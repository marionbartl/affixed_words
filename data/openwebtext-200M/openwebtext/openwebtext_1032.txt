600 protest Pelosi in Houston
Hundreds laid down their money to watch an onstage interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) in Houston , the epicenter of Bush Country , on Friday night .
And hundreds turned up outside the venue to Tea - Party Pelosi .
The speaker did n't make so much news in her remarks to the Progressive Forum , whose members paid between $ 19 and $ 144 to hear what she had to say about health care , the war in Afghanistan , energy -- and her autobiography .
The scene outside the Wortham Center was less sedate , according to the Houston Chronicle -- with about 600 anti-Pelosi protesters jeering attendees as they streamed in and out :
“ Turn back while you still have the chance !
Do n’t support the liar ! ”
Doug Audirsch , of Porter , shouted while hoisting a sign over his head that called for “ Less 1984 — More 1776 . ”
Most of those making their way through the gantlet seemed to take the jeers and catcalls in stride .
Some of the attendees blew kisses , while at least two made obscene gestures to the activists .
“ I think they were probably prepared for this , ” said Paul Kelver of Spring with a laugh .
“ She ’s so far away from mainstream American that it ’s unbelievable . ”
Police estimated the crowd at 600 .
Houston Police Department officials at the scene said there were no reported incidents or arrests .
It 's hard to extrapolate a huge grassroots anti-Pelosi movement from the gathering :
The pro-Pelosi attendees delighted in razzing the protesters -- taking long bows and exhorting them to boo louder as they walked the gauntlet -- like basketball players goading a hostile crowd .
And the protesters themselves seemed pretty hardcore , judging from the video put together by the Houston Tea Party Society -- featuring a free market advocate wearing a Wonder Woman bustier -- and signs like , " I 'm the ProLife gun toting Consitutionalist the D.H.S. warned you about . "

It went to extra time , but the United States were able to one - up Panama and reach the semis of this year ’s CONCACAF Gold Cup .
PHILADELPHIA , Pennsylvania --
It was a testy affair from Lincoln Financial Field , but in the end , after 120 minutes , the U.S. Men ’s National Team was able to outlast Panama 2 - 1.
The Central American team held their own and put up a strong fight against the favored U.S. , even scoring the first goal , but were n’t able to hold off the Americans who put it away in extra time .
The sides came out a bit flat in their quarter - final match - up , with the first few minutes providing nothing more than a few switches of possession .
As you would expect however , the favored U.S. squad began to control the ball as the match started to push on .
It was after eight minutes that things really got started as the U.S. won a free kick to the right of the area , one that Houston Dynamo midfielder Stuart Holden lined up to take .
Firing in an outswinger to a host of white - shirted attackers , Holden found his club teammate Brian Ching who rocketed the header off the crossbar .
Seconds later , Holden sent another cross into the area , with Kansas City Wizards frontman Davy Arnaud the target this time around .
He met the ball well with his head , but pushed it barely over the bar .
Productive moves by the U.S.
Following those two chances , Bob Bradley ’s men took over the match and barely allowed Panama to escape their own half .
Possession was strong and continued , with the ball movement nearly always productive .
Panama ’s first real attempt on net was barely that , as some nice passing by the Marea Roja saw Jorge Luis Garces streaking into the area on the right shoulder of U.S. captain Jimmy Conrad .
The veteran defender was able to get an excellent sliding tackle in on Garces to knock the ball away .
If he had n’t have made the tackle , Garces was alone in on goal .
The play between the two teams following Conrad ’s impressive challenge was choppy at best .
It was n’t until near the stroke of halftime that things really got interesting .
Panama won a corner and sent it in to the area .
The ball bounced around a bit , and took a deflection off of Chad Marshall before Blas Perez was able to rifle the it into the net for a shocking 1 - 0 lead .
The whistle blew seconds later and the sides went into the locker - rooms not how they may have expected .
The late first half goal by Panama seemed to have lit a fire in the U.S. and they came out determined and ready in the second 45 .
A completely different side out of the gate , it took under five minutes for the score to be leveled .
From a corner to the left of goal , the ball bounced its way around the box before rolling eloquently to the edge of the area where Real Salt Lake midfielder Kyle Beckerman met it with a controlled shot that powered its way to the top right corner of the net .
Panama keeper Jaime Penedo had no chance at making the save .
Scoring the goal did n’t settle the U.S. down any as moments later Stuart Holden almost gave his team the lead .
Great exchange play with Davy Arnaud along the right edge of the box resulted in Holden getting a clear chance on net .
He struck the ball low and hard with his right across the face of the net and it barely missed the far post .
The play was dictated by the Americans from the goal onwards as they appeared much more determined to make the game theirs .
Brian Ching had a strong chance in the 63rd minute when advantage was played after Holden was fouled .
Despite being absolutely flattened , Holden was able to play the ball to Ching who had one man to beat .
Cutting it inside of his marker , the Dynamo forward blasted a shot just over the bar .
Kenny Cooper of FC Dallas was brought on with about 15 minutes remaining to add to the striking options and he almost became a super sub in the 80th minute .
Cultured full - back Heath Pearce took the ball down the left and after some nifty ballwork smashed a cross in that deflected off a Panamanian defender and was met by Cooper ’s wide open head .
The former Manchester United man could n’t do much with it though and was only able to nod it over the bar .
He had another chance in the 86th minute from a Holden cross this time , that he directed on net , but right into the hands of Panama keeper Penedo .
90 minutes was n’t enough to separate the two teams so the game went to extra time .
The pace of the match slowed a bit in extra time as the sides appeared content on going to penalty kicks .
The flow was relaxed and legitimate chances on goal were few and far between .
Full - back Heath Pearce had the best chance of the first 15 minutes .
Some quality passing resulted in Pearce taking the ball just at the edge of the area with time and space .
Smashing it low and hard , Pearce looked destined to break the tie .
Unfortunately for U.S. fans , Penedo was able to push the shot aside .
The complexion of the match changed as the first period of extra time drew to a close .
A ball was played into the Panama box , with Cooper set to make something of the possession .
Out of nowhere , Panama defender Roman Torres flew into Cooper with an unwieldy high tackle with studs up .
Referee Armando Archundia had no choice but to call the foul as it was as blatant as they come .
After a quick recovery , Cooper stepped up to the spot and placed the ball off the right post for the goal .
Cooper ’s PK was the difference in the match and it effectively put the USMNT into the semi-final round , which will be played on Thursday in Chicago .

Critical consensus on Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen is overwhelmingly negative .
But the critics are wrong .
Michael Bay used a squillion dollars and a hundred supercomputers ' worth of CG for a brilliant art movie about the illusory nature of plot .
Advertisement
Oh , and I would warn you that there 'll be spoilers in this review — except that , really , since I still have no idea what actually happened in this movie , I 'm not sure how much I can spoil it .
Advertisement
Since the days of Un Chien Andalou and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , filmmakers have reached beyond meaning .
But with this summer 's biggest , loudest movie , Michael Bay takes us all the way inside Caligari 's cabinet .
And once you enter , you can never emerge again .
I saw this movie two days ago , and I 'm still living inside it .
Things are exploding wherever I look , household appliances are trying to kill me , and bizarre racial stereotypes are shouting at me .
Transformers : ROTF has mostly gotten pretty hideous reviews , but that 's because people do n't understand that this is n't a movie , in the conventional sense .
It 's an assault on the senses , a barrage of crazy imagery .
Imagine that you went back in time to the late 1960s and found Terry Gilliam , fresh from doing his weird low - fi collage / animations for Monty Python .
You proceeded to inject Gilliam with so many steroids his penis shrank to the size of a hair follicle , and you smushed a dozen tabs of LSD under his tongue .
And then you gave him the GDP of a few sub-Saharan countries .
Gilliam might have made a movie not unlike this one .
And the true genius of Transformers : ROTF is that Bay has put all of this excess of imagery and random ideas at the service of the most pandering movie genre there is : the summer movie .
ROTF is like twenty summer movies , with unrelated storylines , smushed together into one crazy whole .
You try in vain to understand how the pieces fit , you stare into the cracks between the narrative strands , until the cracks become chasms and the chasms become an abyss into which you stare until it looks deep into your own soul , and then you go insane .
You .
Do. Not. Leave .
The Cabinet .

Michael Bay understands that summer movies are about two things : male anxiety , and pure id .
That 's why he casts Shia LaBoeuf , that supreme avatar of pure male inadequacy , in the lead role .
LaBoeuf projects a pathetic , wall - eyed dorkhood , when he's not babbling like a tumor removed from Woody Allen 's prostate that somehow achieved sentience .
I imagine the DVD of ROTF will include a whole disk of outtakes where they had to stop filming because LaBoeuf was drooling on camera .
As it is , the film includes several extreme closeups of LaBoeuf 's dazed stare .
Advertisement
Where was I ?
Oh yes .
So LaBoeuf , who 's actually a fine actor , is the stand - in for the male viewers ' greatest fears about themselves .
No matter how great a loser they might be , they can't be as losery a loser as Sam Witwicky .
And yet , Sam has awesome giant robots stomping around telling him he 's the most important awesome person ever .
And he has the hottest girlfriend in the universe , Megan Fox , for whom banality is a huge aphrodisiac .
The more pathetic Sam gets , the more Fox 's lips pout and her nipples point , like little Irish setters .
Advertisement
To make matters more awesome for the insecure males in the audience , Sam actually tosses aside his giant robot fanclub and his walking - pinup girlfriend , so he can have a normal life .
Of course , this only leads to other robots and hawt chicks ( who turn out to be robots too ) throwing themselves at him and telling him how important he is .
In the end , everybody learns to appreciate Sam just a bit more than they already did , and a booming voice tells him he 's earned the " matrix of leadership " through his courage and stuff .
Advertisement
And then there 's the " id " part , which is the part where stuff blows up real good , and huge machines smash each other up .
And every single performance is so ridiculous that it looks down on " over the top " as if from a great height .
It 's the part of your brain that thinks it would be awesome to see robots with giant dangling testicles , or hot chicks turning into robot tentacle monsters , or " ghetto " robots that talk in inept hip - hop slang and smash each other playfully , or funny Jewish men who talk about their " schmear " and randomly strip to their G - strings .
Is that going too far ?
Then let 's go 100 times farther than that and see what happens !
Transformers : ROTF is so long , you 'll need to wear adult diapers to it .
But the movie 's pure celebration of the primal urge , and unfiltered living , will make you rejoice in your adult diapers .
You 'll relieve yourself in your seat with a savage joy , your barbaric yawp blending in with the crowd 's screams of excitement .
Advertisement
And yet — and here 's the part where I really think ROTF approaches " art movie " status — the movie 's id overload reaches such crazy levels that the fabric of reality itself starts to break down .
Michael Bay has boasted about how every single shot in the movie has so much stuff going on in it , it would take your PC since the dawn of time to render one frame .
After a few hours of this assault , you feel the chair melt and the floor of the movie theater becomes an angry mirror into your soul .
Nothing is solid , nothing is real , everything Transforms .
Advertisement
The closest thing I can think of to this movie is the Wachowskis ' Speed Racer , which had a similar kind of CG image overload , although it was only five hours long as opposed to ROTF 's nine .
Advertisement
And around hour six of ROTF , something curious happens : the two components — male enhancement and pure id — start to clash , badly .
Usually , in a summer movie , the two aspects go together like tits and ass : Jason Statham plays someone who faces the same insecurities as regular dudes , but he overcomes them , and in the process he blows up everything in the world .
But creating that kind of fusion requires enslaving the id to the male enhancement , and that in turn means only going way over the top instead of crazy , stratospheric over the top .
Michael Bay is not willing to settle for going way over the top , like other directors .
So you have a movie that tries to reassure men that they can actually be masters of their reality — but then turns around and says that actually , reality is not real .
There 's no such thing as the " real world , " and the only thing that 's left for men to dominate is a nebulous domain of blurred shapes , which occasionally blurt nonsensical swear - words and slang from ethnic groups that have never existed .
If you 're drowning in an Olympic swimming pool full of hot chewing gum fondue , do you still care if Megan Fox likes you ?
Advertisement
So yes , ROTF approaches the sublime , and then just keeps rocketing .
Next stop : total anarchy .
In a sense , it 's the first war movie ever to convey a real sense of the fog of war , the confusion that comes with battle .
Somewhere around hour nine , you will understand why friendly fire happens in wartime .
Advertisement
So I 've gotten almost all the way through this review , and I still have n't summarized the movie 's plot .
Here goes .
It 's a couple years after the first movie , and Sam is going off to college , leaving his transforming car and his hot girlfriend , whom he still has n't told he loves her .
And meanwhile , the soldiers from the first movie are running around with a bunch of late - model GM cars and trucks , which turn into robots and fight other robots sometimes .
Sam sees weird symbols which make no sense ( and they still make no sense at the end of the movie ) and they turn out to be the key to the location of a thing that can control another thing , that will enable the bad guys to destroy the sun .
Sam has to embrace the heroic destiny he 's rejected , so he can save us all from solarcide .
Advertisement
But that bare plot summary does n't include the twenty or thirty other storylines that could also claim to be the movie 's plot .
There 's the whole thing where someone from Washington D.C. wonders why the U.S. military is running around the globe with a bunch of late - model GM cars from outer space , and tries to put the kibosh on the military - Autobot complex .
There 's the teenager who 's got a conspiracy website , that competes with another conpsiracy website which turns out to be the work of a secret agent who 's decided that the best way to keep things secret is to put them on a website .
( It works .
I post secret stuff on io9 all the time . )
Various robots die and then come back to life , and there 's a whole strand about whether Decepticons ( the bad ones ) can become Autobots ( the good ones ) .
And there 's the Fallen , who 's sort of the movie 's villain even though he barely shows up .
And people from 17,000 BC who had weird teeth and fought robots .
And the ancient Egyptians did stuff .
And Sam 's parents go to France except that they meet a robot and then they 're in Egypt .
Really , I could go on and on .
This movie starts out with a coherent storyline , for the first half hour or so , and then it just starts to spin faster and faster until the centrifuge of random events slams you into the walls .
It does n't help that there are 500 robots in the movie and they all look kind of the same .
Advertisement
Oh , but that 's the other thing about ROTF .
It 's actually quite funny , a lot of the time .
Some of the jokes fall flat , like the " twin " robots with the ghetto speak , and a lot of the stuff with John Turturro .
But the movie 's relentless silliness is mostly pretty hilarious , in a Saturday morning cartoon kind of way , and almost nothing in the movie seems intended to be taken seriously .
Advertisement
So , to sum up : Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen is one of the greatest achievements in the history of cinema , if not the greatest .
You could easily argue that cinema , as an artform , has all been leading up to this .
It will destabilize your limbic system , probably forever , and make you doubt the solidity of your surroundings .
Generations of auteurs have struggled , in vain , to create a cinematic experience as overwhelming , and as liberating , as ROTF .

Before Wall Street and the media combined to make investors think of calendar quarters as “ short - term ” and single years as “ long - term ” , market cycles were used as true tests of investment strategies over the long haul .
Bor-ing .
There were four types of standard analysis used by most financial institutions , Peak - to - Peak , and Peak - to - Trough being the most common found in annual reports .
There were also basic differences in purpose and perspective in the old days , and a focus on results vs. reasonable expectations for actual portfolios .
Even more boring , and not nearly as profitable for “ the wizards ” as today ’s super Trifecta , instant gratification , speculative , mentality .
Portfolio performance analysis was intended to be a test of management style and overall methodology , not a calendar year horse race with one of the popular averages .
The DJIA was ( I believe ) originally conceived as an economic indicator , not as a market - performance measuring device .
Read
No real - life , personalized , portfolio should ever be a mirror image of any other , or comparable to any particular market index .
Analysis should be of process , content , and operating strategy ; the objective should be fine - tuning of either the philosophy or the discipline .
If the portfolio market value , in a Peak - to - Trough scenario , fell by a greater percent than the benchmark (s ) being used , the overall approach would be looked at for reasons why .
Was there excess speculation ?
Did interim profits go unrealized ?
Was an issue or a sector overweighted ?
Theoretically , portfolios with 30 % or more committed to income securities would fall less in market value than 100 % equity portfolios — they would also be expected to rise less than their more speculative brethren in a Peak - to - Peak analysis .
Formulating valid expectations are important for long - term investment success , and sanity .
November 1999 to Mid-March 2009 would have been the ideal analytical period for a Peak - to - Trough review of WCM ( Working Capital Model ) portfolios , but the November to May time period illustrates the cyclical approach to market value performance evaluation just as well — and the data was easier to obtain .
Here are seven tests you can use to determine how your investment portfolios ( or your clients ’ portfolios ) have fared since the stock market peaked toward the end of 1999 , using a 60 % Equity / 40 % Income , WCM asset allocation as an expectation producing benchmark .
One :
The percent fall in the S & P 500 average was about 33 % .
Your portfolio market value should be up by around the same number .
Two : “ Smart cash ” should have been huge toward the end of 1999 and on the rise again through the middle of 2007 , reflecting much too high IGVSI stock prices .
Then , portfolio smart cash should have been shrinking ( while equity prices tanked ) to nearly zero until the second quarter of 2009 .
Three : Planned disbursements for expenses should have continued unabated throughout the entire ten year period without ever the need to sell any securities , or to reduce payment amounts — except in ( client ) emergency circumstances .
Four : Portfolio market values should have rebounded to a greater extent ( closer to the most recent all time high ) than the gain in the S & P average relative to its latest ATH — after both the dotcom bubble debacle and the latest financial meltdown .
Actually , the dotcom fiasco was pretty much of a non-event for WCM portfolios because of disciplined operating rules boiled down to : “ no IPOs , no NASDAQ , no Mutual Funds , no problem ” .
This time around , the “ problem ” was a stake in the heart of what once were some of the best of the best financial institutions .
Five : Portfolio “ working capital ” should be higher than it was at its peak in 2007 , adjusted for net additions and withdrawals , and possibly about twice the level of May 1999 .
Six : Total portfolio “ base income ” should be slightly higher than it was in mid-2007 , again adjusted for net portfolio additions and withdrawals ( and drastic asset allocation changes ) — but the 2007 base income level would have been significantly above that in 1999 .
Seven :
Finally , there should not have been any major profits left on the table , on any security , of any kind , in any portfolio throughout the ten - year period .
Here ’s to a return to the boring investment portfolio !

Who needs antihistamines if you can eat your sneezes and itchy eyes away ?
Rice that could protect people against allergies such as hay fever has moved a stage closer to clinical trials , following a successful safety assessment in monkeys .
“ I ’d like to try this GM rice in people in the near future , ” lead researcher Fumio Takaiwa of Japan ’s National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences in Tsukuba told New Scientist .
None of the macaques fed the altered rice for six weeks suffered side effects , reports Takaiwa ’s team .
So the stage is now set for clinical trials .
Delayed release
The rice is designed to block symptoms of runny noses and sneezing in people allergic to Japanese cedar pollen , who account for 20 per cent of the Japanese population .
It is genetically modified to contain the seven proteins within cedar pollen that provoke the most serious allergic reactions in people .
Advertisement
Once in the intestine , the proteins damp down allergic responses through so - called “ oral tolerance ” .
This is a process , controlled by lymph nodes , by which the immune system “ learns ” not to overreact to harmless foreign material such as food .
To stop the proteins being digested before they can have their effect , the rice was engineered to produce them in the endoplasmic reticulum , a part of rice plant cells that passes undigested through the stomach .
In 2005 , Takaiwa demonstrated in mice that the strategy works .
He used a different type of rice designed to make a different set of cedar pollen proteins that cause a similar allergy in mice .
The latest version fed to the monkeys is now ready to test in humans , he says .
Because monkeys , too , react to different proteins , the latest assessment was simply to look at safety .
Only when he gives the rice to people will Takaiwa find out if it works or not .
Softening attitudes
Currently , doctors treat the allergy by giving patients repeated injections of tiny amounts of pollen , but this is painful for patients , inconvenient because of the necessary repeat visits to the doctor , and carries a slight risk of a life - threatening reaction .
Patients treated instead with the rice would have to eat it regularly about three to six months before the allergy season , which lasts from February to April .
If it works , Takaiwa says the principle could easily be extended to other allergies .
Already , his team is working a second type of rice to treat allergy to house mites .
“ We got good results in mice , ” he says .
Takaiwa is also hopeful that if it works , it will pave the way for other GM - based vaccines and help soften opposition to genetically modified crops .
“ If our rice works well , I think the atmosphere around GM food will change , ” he says .

PITTSBURGH – A skilled San Francisco - based computer hacker who once sought to unite the cyber underworld under his benign rule pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges here Monday , admitting he stole nearly 2 million credit card numbers from banks , businesses and other hackers , which were used to rack up $ 86 million in fraudulent charges .
Max Ray Butler , 36 , faces up to 60 years in prison for the two felonies under law , but his actual sentence will be influenced by a number of factors , not least a plea agreement with federal prosecutors that was filed under seal Monday .
Wearing an ill - fitting orange jail uniform and round glasses , his hair cut short and neat , the six - foot - plus Butler towered over the burly deputy marshals that brought him into the court room .
Once he settled into his seat , he spoke softly and evenly as he answered questions from the judge , frequently drawing admonishments to speak up for the benefit of the court reporter .
" I actually did the actions that are relevant in the indictment , and I am guilty , " Butler said , at one point .
Butler identified himself in court as " Max Vision , " the name he gave himself in the 1990s when he became a superstar in the computer security community .
At that time Butler was billing himself out as a $ 100 - an - hour computer security consultant , and he earned the respect of his peers for creating and curating an open source library of attack signatures used to detect computer intrusions .
But it turned out Butler was staging recreational hacks on the side , and in 2001 he was sent to federal prison for 18 months for launching a scripted attack that closed security holes on thousands on Pentagon systems , and left backdoors behind for his own use .
While in prison , Butler met more serious criminals , and he was befriended by a professional swindler named Jeffrey Norminton .
After his release , Norminton introduced him to an Orange County , California entrepreneur and former bank robber named Chris Aragon .
Butler admitted Monday that he began hacking banks , merchants and other hackers to steal credit card numbers , which he sold to Aragon and others .
Aragon , who 's pending trial on related state charges in southern California , turned that stolen data into near - perfect counterfeit cards , complete with holograms , and recruited a crew of shoppers who used the cards to snap up designer merchandise for resale on eBay .
Aragon earned at least $ 1 million in the business , police say .
Butler became a priority to federal law enforcement officials in 2006 , when , under the handle " Iceman , " he staged a brazen takeover of the online carder forums where hackers and fraudsters buy and sell stolen data , fake IDs and specialized underground services .
He hacked into the forums , wiped out their databases , and absorbed their content and membership into his own site , called CardersMarket .
On one of the sites he hacked , called DarkMarket , Butler later discovered that an administrator named " Master Splyntr " was logging in from an FBI office in Pittsburgh .
Butler partnered with a Canadian hacker to try and expose Master Splyntr as a fed , but his claim was largely dismissed in the underground as inter - forum rivalry .
DarkMarket went on to become a full - blown undercover FBI operation , and the FBI and Secret Service began an investigation into " Iceman . "
( I wrote about Butler in the January issue of Wired .
I 'm now working on a book about him and the carder forums , due out from Crown in 2010 ) .
Using informants and some genuine electronic gumshoe work , the feds identified Iceman as Butler about a year later , and arrested him in September 2007 at a corporate apartment he used as a hacking safe house .
When the feds seized Butler 's hard drive , they found five terabytes of encrypted data on his harddrive , the government said Monday .
They later cracked Butler 's crypto , and discovered 1.8 million stolen credit card numbers belonging to 1,000 different banks .
The banks tallied the fraudulent charges on the cards at $ 86.4 million .
But Butler 's defense attorney told U.S. District Judge Maurice B. Cohill Jr. Monday that Butler and his associates were n't ' responsible for all of the fraudulent charges .
Butler , noted federal public defender , Michael Novara , frequently cracked the computers of other members of the underground , and stole their stuff .
Some of the credit card numbers found on Butler 's hard drive had been in the hands of cyber thieves before Butler began his hacking spree .
" Max is kind of a hacker 's hacker , " said Novara .
" There was a lot of stuff on his computer that he was not responsible for , and did not intend to use . "
" I do n't think I ever heard the expression , ' a hacker 's hacker ' before , " said Judge Cohill , with a smile .
Sources say Butler 's plea deal will also wrap up a separate federal case in Virginia , in which Butler is charged with staging the first documented " spear phishing " attack against employees of a financial institution , gaining access to the corporate network of Capital One bank .
Butler was calm and attentive at Monday 's proceeding , which opened with federal prosecutor Luke Dembosky crossing to the defense table to shake hands with the hacker , who smiled and nodded .
Through his attorney , Butler released a two - paragraph statement following his plea .
" Max Vision , known in this case as Max Butler , pled guilty today as a first step toward getting this sad chapter of his life behind him .
It is unfortunate that his life circumstances in 2005 led him to participate in this criminal conduct , and he very much regrets doing so , " he wrote .
" Max has always preferred using his extraordinary computer skills – his computer vision – for the good of society and the cyber world , and he hopes that he will be given the opportunity in the future to once again don the white hat . "
Asked afterward what kind of sentence the government expects for Butler , Dembosky was vague with reporters .
" Suffice to say , it wo n't be probation .

Goodbye Scienceblogs NOTE :
This blog has moved .
The Frontal Cortex is now over here .
I 've got some exciting news : Starting today , the Frontal Cortex will be moving over to the Wired website .
Needless to say , the move comes with the usual mixture of emotions , as I 've greatly enjoyed my four years as part of the Scienceblogs community .
It 's been an honor to share this space with such a fine collection of scientists and writers .
I 'm sad to be leaving .
( I should note , by the way , that this move was planned long before Pepsi , etc. )
However , I 'm really thrilled to be joining the blog network of the publication that I …
Twitter Strangers Over at Gizmodo , Joel Johnson makes a convincing argument for adding random strangers to your twitter feed : I realized most of my Twitter friends are like me : white dorks .
So I picked out my new friend and started to pay attention .
She 's a Christian , but is n't afraid of sex .
She seems to have some problems trusting men , but she 's not afraid of them , either .
She 's very proud of her fiscal responsibility .
She looks lovely in her faux modeling shots , although I am surprised how much her style aligns with what I consider mall fashion when she 's a grown woman in her twenties .
Her home is Detroit …
Stress I 've got a new article in the latest Wired on the science of stress , as seen through the prism of Robert Sapolsky .
The article is n't online yet ( read it on the iPad ! ) , but here are the opening paragraphs : Baboons are nasty , brutish and short .
They have a long muzzle and sharp fangs designed to inflict deadly injury .
Their bodies are covered in thick , olive - colored fur , except on their buttocks , which are hairless .
The species is defined by its social habits :
The primates live in troops , or small groupings of several dozen individuals .
These troops have a strict hierarchy , and each animal is …
Smart Babies Over at Sciam's Mind Matters , Melody Dye has a great post on the surprising advantages of thinking like a baby .
At first glance , this might seem like a ridiculous conjecture : A baby , after all , is missing most of the capabilities that define the human mind , such as language and the ability to reason or focus .
Rene Descartes argued that the young child was entirely bound by sensation , hopelessly trapped in the confusing rush of the here and now .
A newborn , in this sense , is just a lump of need , a bundle of reflexes that can only eat and cry .
To think like a baby is to not think at all .
And yet …
Political Dissonance Joe Keohane has a fascinating summary of our political biases in the Boston Globe Ideas section this weekend .
It 's probably not surprising that voters are n't rational agents , but it 's always a little depressing to realize just how irrational we are .
( And it 's worth pointing out that this irrationality applies to both sides of the political spectrum . )
We cling to mistaken beliefs and ignore salient facts .
We cherry - pick our information and vote for people based on an inexplicable stew of superficial hunches , stubborn ideologies and cultural trends .
From the perspective of the human brain , it 's …
Will I ?
We can't help but talk to ourselves .
At any given moment , there 's a running commentary unfolding in our stream of consciousness , an incessant soliloquy of observations , questions and opinions .
But what 's the best way to structure all this introspective chatter ?
What kind of words should we whisper to ourselves ?
And does all this self - talk even matter ?
These are the fascinating questions asked in a new paper led by Ibrahim Senay and Dolores Albarracin , at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and published in Psychological Science .
The experiment was straightforward .

Cages and Cancer
There 's an absolutely fascinating new paper by scientists at Ohio State University in the latest Cell .
In short , the paper demonstrates that mice living in an enriched environments - those spaces filled with toys , running wheels and social interactions - are less likely to get tumors , and better able to fight off the tumors if they appear .
The experiment itself was simple .
A large group of mice were injected with melanoma cells .
After six weeks , the mice living in enriched environments had tumors that were approximately 75 percent smaller than mice raised in standard lab cages .
Furthermore , …
Soda
There 's been lots of chatter about Pepsi lately , so I thought I 'd run with the theme .
I do n't have much to add to the media commentary - I 'm just sad to see some of my favorite bloggers leave this space - but I 've got plenty to say about soft drinks .
And little of it will please Pepsi .
The first thing is that a soda tax is a great idea .
Here 's a compelling chart from a recent report published by US Department of Agriculutre 's Economic Research Service ( via Yglesias ) :
Some of these calories , of course , will be shifted to other categories of food - we 'll drink less Pepsi , but we 'll consume …
LSD
There 's a fascinating article in the latest Vanity Fair ( not online ) about the prevalence of LSD ( aka lysergic acid diethylamide ) among movie stars in 1950s Hollywood : Aldous Huxley was one of the first in Los Angeles to take LSD and was soon joined by others , including the writer Anais Nin .
The screenwriter Charles Brackett discovered " infinitely more pleasure " from music on LSD than he had ever before , and the director Sidney Lumet tried it under the supervision of a former chief of psychiatry for the U.S. Navy .
Lumet says his three sessions were " wonderful , " especially the one where he …
Alcoholism Brendan Koerner has a really fantastic article in the latest Wired on Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA ) .
It 's a fascinating exploration of the organization , from its hallucinogen inspired birth ( Bill Wilson was tripping on belladonna when he found God in a hospital room ) to the difficulty of accurately measuring the effectiveness of AA :
The group 's " cure rate " has been estimated at anywhere from 75 percent to 5 percent , extremes that seem far - fetched .
Even the most widely cited ( and carefully conducted ) studies are often marred by obvious flaws .
A 1999 meta - analysis of 21 existing studies , for …
Body Games
Ever since Pac Man , video games have obeyed a few basic principles : A player sits down in front of a screen and presses a few buttons with his or her thumbs .
Perhaps there 's a joystick involved , or maybe the index finger has to do some work , too .
But the body is essentially still .
The only moving parts are the eyes and the fingers .
The Wii changed everything .
Unlike every other game console , the Wii controller is n't built around a confusing alphabet of buttons .
Instead , Nintendo uses some nifty bluetooth technology to translate our body movements directly onto the screen .

Implicit Learning
The intelligence test is badly named .
The main problem is that we should be talking about intelligence tests in plural , so that the IQ test is merely one of the many measures we use to assess our innate mental skills .
Unfortunately , despite the best efforts of Howard Gardner , Robert Sternberg and others , the IQ test remains the singular test of individual cognitive ability .
The mysterious entity that it measures - g , for general intelligence factor - is still seen as the dominant variable in determining the intellectual performance of our brain .
( G was first coined , in 1904 , by the …
The Advantages of Tourette's I was a stuttering child .
Whenever I got the slightest bit nervous , I had an annoying tendency to run out of air on vowel sounds , so that beginning a phrase with " A " or " eee " or " I " was all but impossible .
I would choke and sputter , my eyes blinking in mad frustration .
This minor affliction led me to become extremely self - aware of my speech .
Before I said anything out loud , I would consider the breathy weight of the words , and mentally rehearse all those linguistic speed bumps and stop signs .
If the phonetics seemed too dangerous , the sentence would be rewritten in my head , edited down to the …
Interacting with Machines I have a complicated relationship with my GPS unit .
On the one hand , it rarely works .
Here 's what happened the last time I turned it on .
First , there was a five minute delay while it searched for the satellite signal .
Then , it could n't find the street I was searching for .
Then , it found the street but lost the satellite signal .
Then , it regained the signal but sent me in the wrong direction .
And then , after I 'd already gotten accurate directions off my phone , the GPS unit finally decided that it knew where I was going .
In other words , the device sucks .
But here 's the funny part : I still use …
Feelings of Knowing Clive Thompson has a wonderful article in the NY Times Magazine on Watson , the supercomputer programmed to excel at Jeopardy .
Thompson delves into the clever heuristics used to generate singular answers to ambiguous questions .
( Watson relies on massive amounts of parallel processing , so that " he " is running thousands of Google searches simultaneously . )
While Watson 's performance is certainly impressive , I thought the most interesting part of the story involved the failings of the machine .
It 's easy to rhapsodize about the ever escalating speed of microchips , but it turns out that Watson is …
Cognitive Surplus Over at the Barnes and Noble Review , I have a short review of Cognitive Surplus , the new book by Clay Shirky : Cognitive Surplus , the new book by internet guru Clay Shirky , begins with a brilliant analogy .
He starts with a description of London in the 1720s , when the city was in the midst of a gin binge .
A flood of new arrivals from the countryside meant the metropolis was crowded , filthy , and violent .
As a result , people sought out the anesthesia of alcohol as they tried to collectively forget the early days of the Industrial Revolution .
For Shirky , the gin craze of 18th - century London is an …
Old Writers Sam Tanenhaus has an interesting essay on the relationship between age and literary genius , which was prompted by the new New Yorker fiction issue , featuring a list of 20 accomplished writers under the age of 40 .
Tanenhaus argues that the purpose of the list - " to offer a focused look at the talent sprouting and blooming around us " - neglected to mention one crucial fact , which is that many of these writers have probably already composed their best work :
The emphasis on futurity misses an essential truth about fiction writers :
They often compose their best and most lasting work when they are …
The Essence of Pleasure The Yale psychologist Paul Bloom has written an excellent new book , How Pleasure Works , that I had the pleasure of blurbing .
The book elegantly refutes the idea that our pleasures are mere sensations , or that our delight can be neatly reduced into some ingredient list of superficial perceptions .
Instead , Bloom emphasizes the importance of essentialism , which is the instinctive belief that everything in the world has an underlying reality , or true nature , or essence .
We are all natural essentialists .
Frank Keil , a psychologist at Yale , has done some interesting work that captures this …
Tradeoffs
I 'd like to tell you a story about a routine of modern life that is really bad for your brain .
Everybody performs this activity - sometimes multiple times a day ! - and yet we rarely realize the consequences .
In 2008 , scientists at the University of Michigan did a very clever study illuminating how this activity led to dramatic decreases in working memory , self - control , visual attention and positive affect .
Other studies have demonstrated that people who are less exposed to this activity show enhanced brain function .
They are better able to focus and even recover more quickly in hospitals .…

On - the - Fly Audacity
Yesterday , the Director of the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) did everyone a favor and spoke some serious truth to power :
The health care bills under consideration in Congress will make our long - term budget outlook worse , not better , Elmendorf said , and that would be very bad for our economic future .
Elmendorf ’s assessment , welcome as it certainly was , should n’t have been a surprise to anyone , especially the Democratic authors of the bills now under consideration .
They more than anyone else should know that the bills moving through their committees would add massive new entitlement spending to the federal budget while making only the most marginal of changes to the prevailing financial incentives which are pushing costs up rapidly every year .
What did they think Elmendorf would say ?
Still , Elmendorf ’s assessment seems to have caught some Democrats by surprise , starting with the president .
Just days earlier he told a gathering of skeptical Blue Dog Democrats that they should get behind the House bill because it would deliver savings beyond the ten - year window .
That was n’t a credible assertion even then ( see this post from Tuesday ) , but , in the wake of Elmendorf ’s testimony , it really has no standing .
So what ’s the administration next move ?
Desperate times apparently call for some serious audacity .
Today , the Obama administration delivered one of the more remarkable presidential power grabs seen in recent memory ( the transmittal letter is here , and a section - by - section description of the proposal is available here ) .
The president has decided — just days before the deadline he himself set for passage of health care bills in both chambers of Congress — that he wants to create a new and very powerful executive branch agency , the Independent Medicare Advisory Council ( IMAC ) , which would be accountable only to him and have the authority to re-write the Medicare program from top to bottom by executive memo .
Now that ’s audacious .
The council would be made up of five members , all selected by the president and confirmed by the Senate .
The president could fire any one of them for cause .
They would have two jobs .
First , each year , the council would make recommendations to the president regarding inflation updates to Medicare ’s payment rates for hospitals , doctors , and other suppliers of services .
Those recommendations , if approved by the president , would automatically go into effect in thirty days unless Congress passed a resolution disapproving them — which the president would also have to sign into law .
Of course , if the president approved the council ’s original package of recommendations , it is unlikely he would sign a congressional disapproval resolution overturning them .
So , as a practical matter , the proposal would force Congress to find a two - thirds supermajority to stop presidentially - approved IMAC recommendations from going into effect .
That would be a remarkable shift of power on its own , but the president ’s proposal does n’t stop there .
Not only would the council make recommendations on payment updates , it would also have the authority to propose other “ Medicare reforms ” which would go into effect unless Congress could muster veto override majorities in opposition .
What are “ Medicare reforms ” ?
From the write - up , it seems they could be just about anything .
Changes in beneficiary cost - sharing .
New rules for establishing qualified hospitals and doctors .
Penalties for physicians who do n’t follow government guidelines .
Pretty much anything except for the payroll tax and premium structure .
The only parameters are that the “ reforms ” must improve the quality of medical care and the efficiency of Medicare operations .
The administration is touting this as a belated cost - control idea .
It ’s not .
By itself , it does n’t change anything , as there are no hard targets that must be hit .
So it does n’t answer the Elmendorf critique that the bills now moving in Congress , even if such a provision were added to them , do n’t bend the cost - curve of governmental health spending .
Still , the fact that the administration is pushing this bill at all speaks volumes .
Here ’s a Democratic president telling a Democratic Congress that it ca n’t be trusted to run Medicare anymore .
That ’s stunning , especially so because Democrats , including the president , are working feverishly to exert additional governmental control over health insurance for working age Americans .
If Congress ca n’t run Medicare well , what possible rationale is there for standing up another government - run insurance plan ?
Nonetheless , the audacity is something to behold .
Certainly unilateral executive branch authority to re-write entitlement programs from scratch would have come in awful handy during the Reagan and Bush years .
But that may dawn on others as well .
Like Medicare beneficiaries , physicians , hospitals , labs , nursing homes , and , of course , House and Senate members too .
Good luck , Mr. President .

Bernie Madoff stole billions from the customers of his phony investment funds , running a racket rather than a financial service .
People who are n't even his victims are furious , and nearly everyone enjoyed a 10 - minute sense of vengeance when the judge threw him behind bars for 150 years .
Let me weigh in with a contrary view .
Free Bernie Madoff , I say .
His life is already ruined .
He is a pauper .
He will never again do business .
From the innovative genius whose information technology in the 1960s became the basis of NASDAQ , he rose to the heights and fell to the depths where he will stay this way until death .
He wo n't be able to be seen in public for the rest of his life without encountering scorn and derision from everyone around him .
Maybe the idea of jail is punishment .
I do n't see how it can be a worse punishment than he would face on the outside .
Maybe the idea is to impose on him a feeling of remorse .
But does he not already feel regret , even deep sorrow ?
This man who was widely considered to be a historic phenom is now disgraced , forever .
We all have one life to live , and his is now a complete wreck , going down in history as the worst financial criminal of all time .
What , then , precisely , is the point of jailing him ?
He is no direct threat to anyone .
Society would not be safer because he is in the slammer .
He is not going to rob people or beat people up .
He might write a book and donate the funds to charity or make some restitution to his victims .
I , for one , would like to read that book .
Instead , taxpayers will be forced to pick up the tab for his living expenses .
Victims get nothing .
That 's not justice .
That 's inhumane for both sides of the transaction : Bernie and us .
Will jail " rehabilitate " him ?
It 's ridiculous .
His rehabilitation , if there can be one , is probably already complete .
Consider the dilemma in which he found himself .
It began small , a simple scheme that anyone can play .
His problem was that it worked better than most .
Once his scam began , he probably hoped the markets would turn around and he would become honest again .
It did n't turn out that way .
Then he could n't dig his way out of it , no matter how much he hated his life .
That it lasted decades instead of days is a testament to his marketing savvy , but that 's not to say that he loved his life .
Spending the rest of his life in the pokey wo n't rehabilitate him any more intensely than life on the outside .
The problem with prisoners is not that you are treated like an animal .
Would that they had it so good !
At the zoo , the animals are fed and groomed and cared for .
They have value because they elicit affection from paying customers .
Even slaves are in a better position , for at least they are valued to some small degree by their masters .
Prisoners , on the other hand , face a kind of metaphysical transformation .
They go from being valued members of society to being treated like blobs of flesh taking up space .
Their wardens see them as objects .
They are abused by fellow inmates and live in a state of incredible degradation everyday .
All prisoners are therefore living amidst a kind of torture .
It is n't modern .
It is n't even medieval .
It is contrary to all principles of civilization .
Perhaps we should allow it for the most violent members of society , pending some other solution .
But that does n't apply to Madoff , and it does n't apply to some ¾ of all the prison population .
But still , we are all supposed to feel some kind of joy at his captivity .
For decades we 've been told by sociologists that the real criminals in society are not muggers and murderers and rapists but rather " white - collars criminals " who are capitalists sneakily stealing money using fancy finance .
They are the ones who should be in jail .
And so now , those educated by the sociologists , forever soft on real crime but oddly tough on financial crime , have their way , as the bourgeoisie cries out for vengeance against a guy whose sole victims were the rich people who were his own customers .
Can there be anyone doubt that Madoff has been set up as a scapegoat , a person on which to blame the downturn so that we will be distracted from the greatest scams of all that enjoy the cover of law ?
So let us ask the unaskable : Just how unusually evil were Madoff 's actions ?
Not that unusual .
In fact , the whole notion of paying off past investors with the funds of present investors is at the very core of the Social Security system .
At least Madoff sought the consent of his investors who let him care for their money based on their own volition .
And at least he did n't attempt to defend himself with the claim that he was conducting wise public policy .
The next version of Ruby is due later this year , and now its first preview version , 1.9.2 Preview 1 , is available .
A detailed list of changes is available , the release notes point out these API changes :
Socket API was more objectified .
Time was reimplemented and enhanced .
Now Time has no max / min value , no year 2038 problem .
New Random class for random number sequence .
Good news for merb users : Method # parameters .
The last item on this list , new method Method # parameters , is necessary for Merb 's action arguments feature , which needs to know the number and names of a method 's formal arguments .
On Ruby 1.8.x , ParseTree was used to implement this functionality , but as ParseTree has been EOL'ed and is not available on Ruby 1.9.x , action arguments were n't available on 1.9.x .
Workarounds were created for JRuby and for 1.9.1 with the methodpara gem .
Now with Method # parameters , getting the formal arguments of a method is easy .
Simply get a handle of the method and call parameters .
For instance , the arguments of this method
def hello ( a , b, x=42 , * args )
will be represented by this :
[ [ :req , :a ] , [ :req , :b ] , [ :opt , :x ] , [ : rest , : args ] ]
A quick look through the Ruby Trunk ChangeLog ( Caution : large file ) , shows a recent improvement by Narihiro Nakamura .
The ' Longlife GC patch ' ( link shows the diffs ) changes the VM and GC to treat long lived objects differently from other objects .
According to the changes , in the current incarnation , long lived objects seem to be method bodies and inline cache entries .
Remembered sets are used to track changes in the long lived space .
There are more plans for features to add to 1.9.2 ; it remains to be seen which make it into the final version .
Writing a compatible Ruby library was certainly easier half a decade ago when there was one mainstream Ruby version .
Now libraries should be compatible with Ruby 1.9.x , as well as the host of alternative Ruby implementations .
David A. Black announced the Ruby versions site , http://ruby-versions.net/:
I 've set up a site where you can ssh in and have access to a bunch of historical and modern Ruby versions and implementations , including Ruby 1.0 through 1.9.2 snapshot , Rubinius , JRuby , and Ruby Enterprise Edition .
Another way to check code across Ruby versions is MultiRuby , which will download Ruby versions and run code on all versions .
This TV preacher uses irrefutable logic to prove that only the Christian 's god is real .
" Have you ever seen somebody working on a fence and takes a hammer and hit their thumb and go " Awww … Buddha ! "
You ever see them do that ?
How many hit a gold ball like I hit a golf ball and they go " Ohhh … Mohammed ! "
Why do they call that name ?
You know what they do ?
They go " Jesus Christ ! " " Jesus Christ ! "
Why do they call that name ?
Because I believe when a person gets hurt or they get angry , they wanna blame who ?
They want to blame God .
I guess that settles it !
Gareth Branwyn ( who sent me the link to this video ) told me this preacher 's line of reasoning reminds him of his grandfather 's argument against hippies .
Gareth 's grandpappy used to say , " If God had wanted men to have long hair , he would have given it to them . "
The preacher also shares many other equally profound insights with his rapt audience : Satan uses LPs to control people , and burn victims are lucky because they 've gotten a taste of hell .
( Thanks , Gareth ! )
The voter uprising against Sacramento on Tuesday showed that “ CA needs wholesale change , ” Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco wrote on Facebook .
“ Ready to Buck the System ? ” asked the Democratic candidate for governor .
“ Donate 5 bucks to change CA , ” he wrote .
“ Goal is 500 people to give 5 bucks to create an army for change . ”
Newsom ’s maneuver to spin campaign money out of California ’s budget calamity was in keeping with the short - on - substance approach to the fiscal crisis that nearly every major contender for governor has taken , lest a voter backlash ensue .
Never in modern history has California faced fiscal peril on this scale .
Yet with the lone exception of Republican Tom Campbell of Orange County , the crowd vying for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s job in 2010 has ducked questions on the tough choices needed to keep the state afloat .
Advertisement
Vaguest of all has been Republican Steve Poizner , the state insurance commissioner .
He has refused to specify any spending that he would cut to make up for $ 12 billion in recent tax hikes that he opposed -- or to close a new budget shortfall that could exceed $ 24 billion .
Poizner , his campaign says , would give agency chiefs two weeks to “ streamline and optimize . ”
He would cut “ bloated bureaucracy . ”
He would dispatch “ SWAT teams ” to overhaul spending on schools , prisons , healthcare and welfare .
In search of useless programs to wipe out , he would “ go through this budget line by line ” ( 1,235 pages plus appendixes ) .
Republican rival Meg Whitman , a former EBay chief executive , opposed the tax hikes as well -- and like Poizner , she has ruled them out for the future .
She has not entirely shunned specifics , calling for layoffs of up to 40,000 workers and a simplified bureaucracy .
But those steps would produce nowhere near enough money to offset the tax hikes and plug the budget hole .
And Whitman ’s promises of higher pay for teachers and new tax cuts for business would throw the state ’s budget further out of balance .
Advertisement
Leading Democratic contenders Newsom , Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown backed the tax hikes , if reluctantly .
But beyond that , none of them has embraced any plan for painful cuts .
“ To fix California ’s budget crisis , Gavin Newsom believes that all options must be on the table , ” his campaign website says .
Contrast that with Campbell , a former Silicon Valley congressman who teaches economics and law at Chapman University .
His nine pages of bullet points to balance the books include one idea that is sure to cause him grief in the Republican primary : a 32 - cents - a- gallon , one - year hike in the gas tax to raise nearly $ 6 billion .
He also details more than $ 15 billion in spending cuts , mainly healthcare for the poor , welfare and the state university systems .
“ I just would not be happy speaking in broad generalities or saying that we can get these savings by eliminating waste , fraud and abuse , ” Campbell said in an interview .
“ That ’s not honest .
It ’s not who I am . ”
Advertisement
With the primaries still a year away , said Republican strategist Jim Nygren , it ’s good politics for candidates to keep dodging specifics for months .
“ There ’s a bunch of bad choices in front of people , ” he said .
“ By the time you get around to it next fall , whatever ’s been done will be done , and we ’ll be on to whatever the next disaster is . ”
Perhaps .
But in an era when voters admire tell - it - like - it - is politicians , the question is whether Californians will lump the would - be governors with the politicians who took a thrashing in the election on Tuesday .
Voters roundly rejected budget measures put before them by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Legislature .
Schwarzenegger , who this year broke his promise not to raise taxes , has voiced frustration with the absence of details from fellow Republicans , so far unnamed .
Advertisement
“ Those who say that we could have balanced the budget through spending cuts alone are guilty of political cynicism at its worst , ” he said in March .
“ Those are not serious people . ”
Adam Mendelsohn , a political advisor to the governor , said candidates who call for such a budget are duty - bound to “ put a plan on the table that shuts down people ’s schools and releases prisoners onto the streets -- but at least it wo n’t raise taxes . ”
Spokesmen for the candidates defended the lack of specifics .
“ What ’s important for candidates is to delineate specifically what their guiding principles and philosophies would be for the time that they ’re in office , ” said Whitman strategist Rob Stutzman .
Advertisement
Or , as Whitman spokesman Mitch Zak put it : “ The current budget mess is not Meg Whitman ’s mess . ”
Equally blunt about the evasiveness is Brown , who was governor from 1975 to 1983 .
With rivals scrounging for attack - ad fodder , any candidate who suggests specific cuts or tax hikes “ will never have a chance to be governor , ” Brown told the CalBuzz political blog in April .
Brown ’s website says not a word about the budget mess .
Nor does his Facebook site , although it does feature a recipe for his mother Bernice ’s banana cake .
( “ Make the cake the day before serving , ” the site recommends . )
For now , Brown and Villaraigosa both have the luxury of not being officially declared candidates , which keeps pressure to lay out ideas to a minimum .
Advertisement
As for Newsom , he touts his management of San Francisco as a template for Sacramento : consolidation of city agencies , workforce reductions and pension and civil service reform .
In a telephone interview , he slammed Schwarzenegger for moving to scrap health coverage for children of the working poor and slash local aid , saying San Francisco would lose $ 175 million .
“ I ’m dealing with this not in the abstract , but in the reality , ” said Newsom , who declined to suggest other state cuts as alternatives .
Villaraigosa , who is still weighing whether to run for governor , is also grappling with a city budget crisis made worse by state cuts .
Ace Smith , his longtime campaign consultant , said all the candidates ultimately must put forward specific budget plans and demonstrate that they get the depth of voter exasperation over systemic troubles in the Capitol .
“ Does the car need a brake job , or does the engine need to be pulled out and rebuilt ? ” he asked .
“ The engine needs to be rebuilt . ”

While wind and solar power may not be the complete solution to a green energy future , these 2 sources of clean , renewable energy definitely have some amazing potential .
From off - grid homes and gadget chargers to bike helmet generators and fully - functional campers , there are already plenty of awesome applications for wind and solar power and just as many other unbelievable ideas to come …
Reminiscent of days gone by but with futuristic flair , the Westfalia Verdier solar camper does n’t appear to have made it to the production lines but is an awesome concept regardless .
Using GPS technology , solar panels power the camper van when you ’re ready to camp – lowering the vehicle onto the wheels to increase stability .
The pop -up design will accommodate a family of 4 , but the proposed $ 69,000 price tag might be the holdup on getting this cool camper on the market .
This has to be the geekiest concept ever for a solar gadget charger – a solar necktie , complete with a built - in pocket and adapters to keep your favorite gadget safe while it charges .
The small solar panels create an intriguing design for the tie but I wonder how comfortable it would be with an iPod stuffed in the underside ?
We ’ve seen a few solar powered cars already , as well as a couple wind powered vehicles , but this intriguing concept by RORMaxx combines both wind and solar power into one amazing car that may actually see production later this year .
The Formula AE is designed to be a wind and solar powered race car , boasting a top speed of 155 mph , with a layer of solar cells and an innovative energy recovery system using intakes and turbines to store additional power .
Similar to the Hymini wind powered gadget charger we ’ve featured before , the K3 offers solar and wind energy to power your portable devices .
This off - grid gadget charger is compatible with most rechargeable handhelds , including phones , cameras , and iPods , and will charge the typical cell phone 5 times when the K3 is fully powered ( and it ’s a bit more appealing than the solar tie above ) .
Creatively artistic and completely renewable , these street lamps produce 380 watts of power with nothing more than sun and wind .
Solar panels and a small wind turbine are masked amid the creative design of the hybrid street lamps by Urban Green Energy .
LED bulbs increase the lights ’ efficiency and the company will customize the posts to suit the area where they will be installed .
The latest addition to China ’s skyscraper skyline is an eco-friendly tower powered by the wind and sun .
The Austrian designed Shenzhen Tower will house businesses , meeting rooms , recreation facilities , and residences within it ’s 49 floors and is created to provide natural ventilation and shade to increase efficiency and reduce China ’s dependency on nonrenewable resources .
Forget electric motorbikes – a wind - powered helmet can create enough juice to operate headlights , turn signals , and tail lights !
Three Cheng Shiu University students came up with the light - powering helmet , using 5 small turbines to generate electricity while the bike is in motion .
Four batteries store the energy and then transmit power to the lights .
Plans to reduce the weight of the helmet are in the works , with hopes of public production in the future .

Completely off - the - grid and totally recyclable , the Homestead House makes the most of solar and wind power .
The futuristic prefab , designed by Michael Jantzen , is still a concept but definitely one worth considering .
The house is made of recycled steel , is low cost , and easy to customize .
A small wind turbine and a series of solar panels provide the off - grid home ‘s energy , while utilizing passive solar technology to control the climate and the unique arched shape to harvest rainwater – a simply awesome use of wind and solar power !
Victor Navorski reaches JFK airport from a politically unstable country .
Due to collapse of his government , his papers are no longer valid in the airport , and hence he is forced to stay in the airport until the war cools down .
He makes the airport his home and develops a friendship with the people who work there until he can leave .

• Israel would accept a Palestinian state but only if it was demilitarised , with no army or military agreements with other states , and only if the Palestinians met the " fundamental condition " of recognising Israel as a Jewish state .
It was the first time Netanyahu has spoken of a Palestinian state , although he used the phrase only once in the 30 - minute speech .
• Palestinian refugees who fled or were forced out of homes during the 1948 war could not be allowed to return to what is today Israel .
• Jerusalem should remain united and under Israeli control .
• Netanyahu said he would meet any Arab leader anywhere to talk peace and called on the Palestinians to restart peace talks immediately without conditions .
• Israel would not expand its settlements but would continue to allow " normal life " inside settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank .
" The settlers are not the enemies of the people or of peace .
They are our brothers and sisters . "
The Jewish people 's link to the land of Israel stretched back 2,000 years .
• Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory had not brought peace , he said , particularly in Gaza .
• The cause of the Middle East conflict was not Israel 's occupation .
" The truth is that the root of this conflict has been , and still is , the refusal to accept the right of the Jewish people to have their own state . "
Burmese in Japan prayed for Ms Suu Kyi on her 64th birthday on Friday A court in Burma has sentenced two supporters of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi to 18 months in prison after they prayed for her release .
The two were convicted of insulting religion after leading prayers at a pagoda for Ms Suu Kyi and other activists to be freed , her party said .
Ms Suu Kyi , 64 , has been in detention for more than 13 of the past 18 years .
She is on trial , accused of breaking the terms of her house arrest , and is being held at Rangoon 's Insein prison .
A spokesman for Ms Suu Kyi's party , the National League of Democracy , said Chit Pe and Aung Saw Wei were sentenced on Tuesday .
They were arrested in April after leading prayers at a pagoda in Twante , about 40 km ( 30 miles ) south of Yangon , said the spokesman , Nyan Win .
Supporters traditionally pray for the release of Ms Suu Kyi and other activists at Buddhist pagodas .
Law revived Prison sentences for insulting religion were rare in Burma until recently , correspondents say .
But the law was resurrected in 2007 to jail monks demonstrating against the military authorities , and has since been largely used to prosecute political cases .
Nyan
Win also said that three other members of the party had been arrested on 12 June after handing out photos of Ms Suu Kyi in Rangoon .
" We do not know the details about their arrest but they were detained on remand under the Explosives Act , " he said .
Observers say the charges against Ms Suu Kyi - which carry a maximum punishment of five years in jail - are designed to keep her imprisoned until after next year 's election .
Her trial is due to resume on Friday .
She was charged after an American man swam uninvited to the house where she was being held , and stayed there overnight .

We all know that eating fast is very harmful for our health .
However , we frequently regard eating as nothing else but just a routine activity and eat really fast .
Is there anyone who is not aware that eating fast leads to various problems with digestive system , overeating and weight gain ?
Look at the French or the Japanese : they seem to be healthier and more fit because their culture of eating has been developing for centuries and these people find eating to be a truly enjoyable experience .
Our fast rhythm of life is a real evil .
Sometimes it does not allow us enjoy simple moments of peace and relaxation .
The reports show that an average meal in the US is only 11 minutes , and sometimes the time for having breakfasts decreases down to 2 minutes .
This problem should be taken as a serious matter of social concern and every modern person should think carefully about own eating habits .
Below , you can find 5 reasons why you should consider eating slowly as one of the most beneficial and advantageous practices :
1.Eating slowly can help you avoid overeating and prevent weight gain .
Many experts agree on the fact that fast eating is strictly linked to overeating .
Usually , it takes 15 - 20 minutes for our brain to receive information that we are full .
Therefore , eating slowly can help to avoid eating extra food and prevent consuming extra calories .
Besides , according to a research of the specialists from the Energy Metabolism Laboratory at the University of Rhode , eating slowly eventually leads to eating less .
2 . Eating slowly can improve your digestion and help you prevent possible problems with the digestive system .
If you have a habit of eating slowly , your stomach will have more time to process and digest the meals consumed .
In addition , eating slower always connected with more chewing and better mixing the food with saliva , that also favors better digestion and lowers the burden on our digestive system .
3 . Eating slowly can make you learn to enjoy what you eat .
Start developing this habit of enjoying your meals from eating your most favorite meals as slowly as you can .
Enjoy every bite , every piece of your favorite pizza , or fries , or lasagna .
You should learn to receive pleasure from what you are eating , but not from the amounts of the meals consumed .
This way you will start paying attention on what you eat and slowly shift to eating tasty , natural and healthy foods .
4 . Eating slowly can help you avoid unnecessary stresses .
Eating can be a pleasurable event , which should bring you more of positive emotions and help you to calm down your worries and anxiety .
Turn your eating ritual into a sort of meditation , enjoy every piece of your meals and forget about everything that possibly brings you trouble .
You will definitely feel happier and calmer after such a relaxation .
5 . Eating slowly can help you understand a real taste of life .
Slow eating can not only help us to learn enjoying the taste of good meals , improve our digestion and learn to relax .
It can also define our life style and help us to be more sociable .
Taking more time for eating in a company of friends or in your family environment is a unique opportunity to talk to the people you love , get closer and share the most special things and moments of your life .

The “ Big Meal ” news story that ran on ABC was , as Dr. Mike Eades explained quite thoroughly , a load of bologna passing for health and nutrition advice .
I ’d like to say that ’s a rare occurrence .
I ’d also like to say I ’m 30 years old , with 10 % body fat , a full head of hair , and enough money in the bank to conduct a hostile takeover of Microsoft … but I ’d be lying .
Bad nutrition advice is everywhere .
I bookmark a lot of health and nutrition articles I find online , figuring I may write about them later .
After the “ Big Meal ” story , I decided to go through them and pick out a few , separating them into the Good , the Bad , and the Ugly .
I like ending on a positive note , so we ’ll save the Good for last .
THE BAD
Surprising Good - For - You Foods !
Well , I ’m pretty sure you can guess what their definition of “ good for you ” is .
Here are some choice quotes :
Cream - Style Corn :
There was cream in your grandma ’s recipe , but the liquid in today ’s cans is actually a component of the corn kernels themselves and other ingredients such as starch .
If you look at calories and fat , canned cream - style and whole - kernel corn are identical .
Ahhh , that explains why the obesity epidemic that ravaged the country in the 1950s is just a bad memory now .
Silly ol ’ Granny cooked with cream .
( Ca n’t you just hear her yelling , “ Jed !
Go milk one of the cows so I can put some cream in yer vittles ! ” )
Nowadays , being so much wiser , we cream up those starchy corn kernels by adding still more starch … kind of like they do at feed lots to provide us with well - marbled cows .
One large egg is a significant source of a number of vitamins and minerals , and contains only 75 calories and 5 grams of fat .
Moreover , most of this fat is the healthy , unsaturated variety .
( Eggs are high in cholesterol , but the chief villain in raising blood - cholesterol levels is not the cholesterol in our diets , but in saturated fats . )
Boy , they had me going for a minute , actually praising eggs .
Then they had to go and point a finger at the chief villain .
And by the way , that last sentence makes no sense .
It ’s not the cholesterol in our diets , but in saturated fats … ?
Huh ?
If the cholesterol is hiding inside saturated fats ( and probably wearing a fake moustache so we do n’t catch on ) , how does it get into our bodies if not through our diets ?
Do we fall asleep and accidentally snort saturated fat particles floating around in the air ?
Saturated fat does n’t raise cholesterol .
It raises HDL , which is n’t actually cholesterol , but a protein that carries old cholesterol from your tissues to your liver .
High HDL is desirable .
So snort that saturated fat out of the air and do n’t feel guilty about it .
Chicken thighs :
They are higher in fat and calories than breasts , but as long as you remove the skin and any excess fat , economical thighs fit into a good - for - you diet .
I sometimes eat chicken without the skin , but only because my daughter steals it when I ’m going to the refrigerator for more butter .
She loves the skin .
Why ?
Because it ’s fatty , and her little brain wants the fat .
So does yours .
The Healthiest Carb You ’re Not Eating .
This writer heard about the wonders of whole grains at a conference .
As she explains , “ I was so blown away by the accumulating evidence of their protective effect against chronic disease that I made a beeline for the grocery store when I got home and purchased a box of the one brand of whole grain pasta I could find . ”
In the studies that blew her all the way to the grocery store , researchers had one group eat white - flour products , while the second group consumed whole - grain products .
The people who ate whole grains ended up with a lower rate of diabetes , among other ailments .
So the researchers came to the obvious conclusion : whole grains prevent those diseases .
Anxious to repeat this rock - solid logic , I had one group of men smoke unfiltered cigarettes for 10 years , while a second group smoked the filtered variety .
Turns out the men smoking the filtered cigarettes had a lower rate of lung cancer .
This proves that filtered cigarettes prevent lung cancer .
We should be passing them out in schools and using them to treat anyone who ’s been exposed to asbestos .
5 Things You Need to Know About Dieting .
Shape magazine promised to “ set the record straight ” about what fills you up .
Here are some quotes :
Know this :
It ’s not the fat in foods that makes you feel full .
That greasy cheeseburger will leave you feeling full all day , so it ’s worth the splurge , right ?
Wrong !
Fat is the slowest food component to clear the stomach , so for years it was assumed that fatty foods slowed digestion and kept you feeling full longer .
Recent research proves the proportion of sugar and fat has little or no differences in satiety ratings .
In fact , protein tends to leave people feeling more satisfied than either carbs or fat .
The problem with fat is that it has more than twice the calories of protein or carbs .
That must be some interesting recent research , because a ton of old research demonstrates pretty clearly that given exactly the same number of calories , the higher the carbohydrate content , the hungrier people will be .
Even the low - carb skeptics admit that people on low - carb diets end up eating less , which is why they call it “ a low - calorie diet in disguise . ”
They just ca n’t seem to explain how the disguise curbs hunger .
Perhaps hunger pangs are afraid of strangers wearing fake moustaches or other disguises , assuming they might be cholesterol preparing to hide themselves inside some saturated fats .
Know this :
Low - carb diets do n’t flush calories from the body .
Proponents of low - carb diets claim you can excrete fat fragments ( called ketones ) in urine on this type of diet , essentially flushing calories out .
But a study at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg found no correlation between urinary ketone levels and weight change in women on low - carb diets .
Okay , they actually have a point .
For all the good he did , I blame Dr. Atkins for the misconception that a positive reading for ketones in the urine automatically means you ’re losing weight .
It does n’t ; it simply mean you ’re primarily burning fat for fuel .
If I eat a big , fatty meal , I will get a positive ketone reading without losing weight , because my body has no need to tap my fat stores .
But here ’s why ketones are good :
Your brain prefers them for fuel , as do many other organs .
And if you ’re burning fat , it means your body is n’t relying on glucose , which in turn means your insulin levels are going to be lower .
Then when you do need to tap your fat stores , they ’re open for business .
Otherwise , you can semi-starve yourself , and your body will respond by slowing your metabolism .
THE UGLY
5 Sauces to Avoid at All Costs .
This author provides helpful suggestions for cutting the flavor out of the sauces you like .
Some examples :
Low - fat Alfredo .
Add two cups of plain soymilk ( the thicker consistency mimics Alfredo ) to a pot over low heat .
Stir regularly to prevent sticking .
Do n’t bring milk to a boil .
Add 1 tablespoon of dry milk powder , 1/ 2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese , salt , and pepper to mixture .
Continue to stir until cheese is melted and milk is thickened .
If mixture is not of the desired consistency , add dry milk powder and stir until dissolved .
You ’ll slash the fat calories by more than half !
Brilliant idea .
While taking in a load of pasta to spike my blood sugar , I like to offset the effects by filling my body with soy and screwing up my thyroid .
( I love alfredo sauce , so when I whip up a batch , I pour it over spaghetti squash or French - style green beans . )
Healthier alternative ( to real salad dressing ) : Canned vegetable stock .
Place in a pot on the stove and bring to a boil .
Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 1 /4 cup of cold water until dissolved .
Add this mixture to the boiling liquid .
This will thicken the stock and create the same consistency as high - fat , oil - based dressings .
Boy , does n’t that sound delicious ?
Vegetable stock , with corn starch to thicken it up .
This will also thicken your blood as your liver takes the starch and converts it to triglycerides .
And by the way , without fat , your body wo n’t be able to absorb the fat - soluble nutrients contained any vegetables you put on your salad .
So let ’s see … none of the flavor , few of the nutrients , and a big load of triglyceride - raising starch .
Pass me the Caesar dressing , now !
THE GOOD
Yes , there is a good , in a lovely article titled Does Fat Make You Fat ?
Here are some samples :
The fat - free craze did n’t begin in the ’90s though .
For decades , scientists were warning of the dangers of fats .
Saturated fat was deemed a killer , clogging the arteries and causing our pants to get tighter .
Never mind that for thousands of years indigenous cultures ate animal fat at nearly every meal and only in recent times had obesity become a problem and heart disease become a # 1 killer .
It did n’t work .
We are fatter and sicker than ever before .
Many of us – myself included !
– ended up with dry skin , constipation and a cold feeling in our bones .
Our bodies ’ need for fat manifested itself in magnificent cravings we satisfied at 3 a.m. with french fries and Ben & Jerry’s .
When I started eating more butter and taking fish oil , my skin really showed a difference .
Lines in my face actually went away !
Bravo !
I ’m 50 years old , and I barely have any lines in my face .
A year ago , I was carded while buying wine in a grocery store in Tennessee .
When I asked the clerk if he was kidding , he said , “ Sorry , we have to card everyone under 40 . ” I would ’ve kissed him , but they frown on that kind of behavior in the south .
Now here ’s the irony of the good , the bad , and the ugly :
The bad and the ugly articles were provided by health magazines …
Prevention , Men ’s Health , Shape , etc .
The good was featured in something called Women and Co. , networking for the career - minded woman .
So we ’ve got actual health nuts out there reading articles telling them to cut the fat and eat corn starch and pasta and soy milk .
They ’ll end up with arthritis , snap a ligament lifting weights at the gym , develop Type II diabetes while recovering in an easy chair and eating soy milk - smothered pasta , then wonder what the heck happened .
Meanwhile , career - minded women who want to network more effectively are learning they should be eating plenty of natural fats .
They ’ll be elbowing the health nuts out of their way as they power along to their next big meeting , looking fabulous in their business suits and their wrinkle - free skin .
I just hope the fat - eating career women network their way into taking over a few media empires .
Then they can kick the health reporters ’ tired , wrinkled butts .

On his radio show today , Glenn Beck defended the extremism of Holocaust Museum shooter James von Brunn .
Beck compared Brunn ’s opposition to the Fed to Thomas Jefferson .
He claimed that Brunn was labeled right wing extremist because he was against the Fed .
He ignored Brunn ’s white supremacist beliefs and his conviction for his armed kidnapping plot at the Fed .
Here is the audio from Media Matters :
Advertisements
Beck said , “ Freedom lovers are hard to find , and it ’s because they have been marginalized as extremists whack jobs .
You notice this guy yesterday was a right wing extremist , the guy who went into the Holocaust Museum was a right wing extremist .
Hmmm , so being for Hitler , literally for Hitler is right wing , only if you play the game .
Right is Hitler .
Left is Stalin , but did you notice the other thing they brought up about him .
He was against the Fed .
The truthers , they ’re against the Fed .
The tea party people , they ’re against the Fed .
I ’m against the Fed .
We must all be alike . ”
Beck then goes on a rant about how he does n’t want private corporations making decisions for us , and yet he claimed to be called an extremist .
He asked , “ How is that an extremist view ?
I guess that is extremist in the way Thomas Jefferson was an extremist . ”
Beck was trying to say that people who are against the Fed are n’t extremists , but it did n’t come out that way .
Although it did certainly sound like he was defending Hitler .
Supporting Hitler does make a person a right wing extremist .
Brunn was n’t labeled a right wing extremist because he opposes the Fed .
He was labeled a right wing extremist because he was convicted storming into the Fed and trying to kidnap members of the board in 1981 .
Opposing the Fed , does n’t make a person a right wing extremist , but armed kidnapping plots do .
Notice how Beck conveniently left out kidnapping part of Brunn ’s story .
Being a white supremacist will lead to being considered a right wing extremist , simply opposing the Fed does not .
By the way , nobody labeled Glenn Beck a right wing extremist , and I do n’t understand why he is so eager to be lumped in with Brunn .
The fact is that Brunn was n’t like most of the people who oppose the Fed .
He was a violent extremist , and the only person who is putting the two in the same category is Glenn Beck .

In effetti in mezzo al frastuono le piccolezze sfuggono .
E quindi è passato quasi inosservato che la settimana scorsa Paolo Liguori , oggi direttore del TgCom , abbia esternato a proposito del caso Noemi - Patrizia - Silvio e dell ’attenzione dedicatagli da Repubblica : “ Io sono convinto che i lettori di Repubblica siano un popolo di imbecilli , perche ’ continuano a leggere un giornale che gli racconta un sacco di panzane “ , ha detto all ’Agr. “ Repubblica sono 15 anni che dice che Berlusconi stupra , violenta , inganna , spaccia droga , ruba soldi – ha detto Liguori – .
Lo dice impunemente , perche ’ nessuno le chiede conto .
Sono convinti che gli italiani siano un popolo di imbecilli , perché seguono Berlusconi “ .
Deliziosamente assurdo come soltanto l’ex direttore di Studio Aperto , poi figurante tifoso romanista durante le trasmissioni sportive di Mediaset , sa essere , Liguori è riuscito nello stesso momento a dare del “ popolo di imbecilli ” sia i lettori di Repubblica che agli elettori di Silvio , e questo la dice lunga sulle sue capacità lessicali .
Ma la cosa più interessante è quel “ nessuno le chiede conto ” rivolto al quotidiano di Ezio Mauro , che è allo stesso tempo minaccioso – visto che sembra sottendere una specie di “ impunità giudiziaria ” nonostante le ripetute calunnie – e ridicolo , tanto ridicolo .
Perché immagina , a non voler seguire la pista “ giuridica ” nell ’ interpretazione delle parole , una specie di “ tribunale del popolo ” dove finalmente i giornalisti di Rep. debbano finalmente rispondere di tutto quello che hanno fatto .
E in bocca a lui , tutto ciò , suona davvero strano .
Liguori è infatti tipico un caso schizofrenia clinica .
Nel ‘ 68 è tra i fondatori ( con il nomignolo di “ Straccio ” ) del gruppo degli “ Uccelli ” , una congrega di allegri bontemponi che durante gli scontri di Valle Giulia attraversavano gli schieramenti di polizia travestiti da pastori e con pecore al seguito .
Poi diventa giornalista e militante di Lotta Continua ( il nickname stavolta è Paolo il Bello ) , occupandosi di politica interna .
E il 16/1/80 racconta i problemi del PSI parlando di un Craxi che non gli sembra molto intelligente : “ Il Craxi - pensiero , come si vede , è molto debole ” .
Il 9/2/80 si occupa dei finanziamenti dell ’ENI alla Stampa e al Corriere della Sera : “ Il petrolio ha molti derivati .
Compresa la carta stampata ? ” .
Ma il suo capolavoro è un reportage scritto con Bruno Ruggiero sulla P2 : “ Cane non mangia cane ” , si intitola .
E all ’interno scrive : “ Perché non si è mai riusciti in Italia ad impedire la cospirazione politica ?
Perché prospera sempre più la politica del ricatto ? ” .
Come perché ?
Ma è chiaro : “ Sin dai tempi del Sifar i capi di tutti i servizi segreti sono ‘ fratelli ’ di Gelli ” , e quindi non c’è niente di meglio da aspettarsi che logge massoniche comandino e ricattino il potere .
“ Un’inchiesta che prometteva bene è quella su Edgardo Sogno , – racconta Paolo – ma Luciano Violante è stato ostacolato dal SID ” quando stava per scoperchiare la pentola del contropotere golpista di stampo italico .
Prima giravolta negli anni ’ 90 .
Diventa direttore del Sabato , settimanale di Comunione e Liberazione , e in un’intervista a Prima Comunicazione dell ’ ottobre ’ 91 dichiara : “ De Benedetti , Romiti e Berlusconi hanno molto più potere di chiunque altro in Italia e controllano gran parte dei mezzi di comunicazione .
Chi parlerà delle loro manovre ?
Io me ne sono fatto un dovere ” .
Ovviamente , il fatto che il giornale si regga in piedi grazie ai fondi assai generosi che rimedia lo Squalo , alias Vittorio Sbardella ( ex pugile , il più “ rustico ” esponente romano – in Sicilia c’era di peggio , anche se non si sapeva – della corrente andreottiana )
Poi , nel 1992 , la svolta : diventa direttore di Studio Aperto ( Italia 1 ) , e la sua linea editoriale accompagna la discesa in campo del padrone .
Studio Aperto diventa in poco tempo il tg più sanzionato dall ’Authority delle TLC per servilismo nei confronti del padrone , peggiore a tratti di quello di Fede .
Il 5/3/94 smista , da conduttore una telefonata di Berlusconi : riesce a farlo parlare per 10 minuti e 20 secondi senza interromperlo mai .
Si scatena contro le “ toghe rosse ” e quel Violante che prima elogiava diventa il nemico pubblico numero uno , l’autore di tutti i complotti della zona Euro ed oltre .
Il suo telegiornale , l ’11/1/96 , si “ dimentica ” di dare la notizia dell ’avviso di garanzia a Dell ’ Utri e della condanna di Paolo Berlusconi .
In un’intervista uscita su Cuore 15/7/95 gli domandano : “ Non hai avuto problemi a passare da Lotta Continua a Forza Italia ? ” .
Risposta : “ Non me ne frega niente degli ideali .
Viviamo in una società dove si teorizza addirittura la fedeltà agli ideali .
Visto che gli ideali cambiano bisogna essere fedeli alle persone ” .
Ma la fedeltà non basta , specialmente nel lungo termine .
Anche perché ci vuole poco a trovare qualcuno più servo di te : nel 2003 gli tolgono la guida di Studio Aperto e diventa ( per poco ) capo della redazione sportiva di Mediaset e direttore di TgCom .
Dove prospera ( si fa per dire ) ancora oggi .
Ecco : di tutto questo , a Paolo Liguori detto Straccio , nessuno ha mai “ chiesto conto “ , come direbbe lui .
Se si cominciasse , brrrrr .

インテル のCoreシリーズCPUが登場して以来、マルチコアCPUは爆発的に普及している。現在では比較的低価格なCPUでも複数のコアを搭載するようになり、現在販売されているPCのほとんどはマルチコアに対応しているといっても過言ではない。しかし、まだマルチコアCPUの性能を生かす、並列処理を行っているアプリケーションは多くない。
並列処理は、一般には実装が難しい、という印象があるようだ。確かにスレッドを駆使して処理を並列化する場合、スレッドの管理やスレッド毎の連携など、考慮しなければならないことが増え面倒ではある。しかし、プログラムを並列化するための言語規格「OpenMP」や、C++用の並列化ライブラリ「 Threading Building Blocks」といった並列化支援技術を利用することで、プログラムの並列化へのハードルは大幅に低くなる。また、インテルの開発製品「 Parallel Studio」に含まれる 「 Parallel Composer」には、独自の並列化支援機能を備えたC/C++コンパイラーが含まれている。このような技術や製品を利用すれば、手軽に並列処理を実装することが可能だ。
本記事では、このような技術を利用した並列処理の実装方法を、簡単な画像処理アプリケーションを例に説明していこう。
スレッドを利用した並列化
今回サンプルに使用するアプリケーションは、画像に対して「メディアンフィルタ」と呼ばれるフィルタ処理を行うものだ（ソースコード全文は記事末にリスト1として掲載）。メディアンフィルタとは、ノイズ除去等を目的に利用される画像処理フィルタで、あるピクセルに対し、そのピクセルの周辺にあるピクセルの値の中央値をそのピクセルの値とするものである（図1）。これにより、図2のように単発的に発生するノイズ（ごましおノイズとも呼ばれる）を軽減する効果がある。

Britain : Police make mass “ preemptive ” arrest of protesters in Nottingham
By Robert Stevens
16 April 2009
In the largest police operation ever mounted against environmental protesters , more than 114 people were arrested in Sneinton , Nottingham , England on April 13 .
Some 200 police officers were involved in the operation from Nottinghamshire , Derbyshire , Leicestershire and Staffordshire .
Officers were also involved from the British Transport Police .
Police mounted the preemptive arrests at a community centre and adjacent school on the unprecedented basis that those detained were preparing a protest at the nearby Ratcliffe - on - Soar power station .
The power station is the third largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the UK and has been the location of previous protests by environmental groups .
Without providing any evidence , police stated that those detained had posed “ a serious threat ” to the power stations operations .
A spokeswoman for the police said , “ From the information gathered , police believe that those arrested were planning a period of prolonged disruption to the safe running of Ratcliffe - On - Soar power station . ”
Those arrested were held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass and criminal damage .
All were released without charge the following day .
In the meantime , police used the arrests to mount searches on various homes , seizing computers and personal paperwork .
According to one local resident quoted on the Indymedia UK web site , the police damaged school property .
He also said the bolt - cutting equipment it was claimed police had uncovered belonged to the school .
He added , “ I live in Sneinton , am a community activist and know a bit about what happened .
Now the point I ’d like to make is that one : anything taken away by the police was not connected to the action planned , and that two : the school may have to close down because of this damage caused by the police . ”
Also searched were premises above the Nottingham ’s Sumac Centre — a meeting place for local campaigning groups , including climate change organisations .
The raids came just days after 12 men were arrested in a simultaneous operation in the northwest of England .
In that instance , police claimed the arrests were necessary to thwart an imminent terrorist attack .
At the time of writing , no evidence has emerged to support police claims , and 11 of the men are still being held without charge .
( See “ The ‘ anti - terror ’ arrests in northwest England : what really lies behind them ? ” )
The Nottingham arrests were carried out as a military - style operation .
Police blocked off roads and junctions leading to the community centre / school and surrounded the buildings .
Local residents reported that they saw up to 20 riot police vans and a number of patrol cars surround the grounds of the buildings at around midnight .
Scores of police with dogs smashed their way into the school , rounding up those inside .
One of the witnesses , Susan Lawson , said , “ The police said to me ‘ get in the house and do n’t come out ’ .
Then I saw them bringing people out of the school gates in handcuffs and putting them into vans .
The vans kept coming back to pick up more of them .
Police had big black and yellow bin bags full of something , which they took away .
I was shocked , I could n’t get back to sleep afterwards .
It was terrible . ”
In an interview with the Guardian , one activist described the operation as a “ preemptive strike ” and recalled how the police “ bashed down the doors of the school . ”
“ It seemed to be a pretty sophisticated attempt by the police to neuter the whole climate movement , ” he said .
“ They must have known about [ the gathering ] a long time before .
They even had colour - coded maps of the school .
It was a huge operation .
They were very pleased with themselves , talking about promotions and how it had been ‘ intelligence - led . ’ ”
He said , “ Everyone was lined up and handcuffed .
There were long queues of people waiting to be processed by the police . ”
He added , “ One arresting officer was quite out of order and asked people if they were proud of being terrorists . ”
Assault on democratic rights
The Nottingham arrests mark an escalation in the assault on the democratic and civil rights of the population by the government .
Those arrested had not committed any offence but were detained on the basis that they may have planned to participate in a protest — a gross infringement on fundamental liberties , such as freedom of assembly and freedom of speech .
During the G20 summit in London earlier this month , police raided two squats on the second day of the summit .
They made a number of arrests and detained scores of people who were photographed and handcuffed , and then made to sit in the street .
This was prior to any demonstrations that were to be held later that day .
Speaking about the Nottingham arrests , Shona Jainjuah , from the Camp for Climate Action , said , “ First the police violently attack the climate camp during the G20 , and now 114 people are arrested before they have actually done anything .
People should be very concerned about how the police are stepping over the line in the way they are targeting activists . ”
The mass arrests have prompted condemnation from civil and human rights groups .
A leading column in the Independent newspaper , entitled “ Mass arrests have no place in a democratic country ” , stated , “ People tend to be uncomfortable with the idea that someone can be arrested before a crime has been committed — and rightly so .
It smacks of totalitarian regimes and the thought police . ”
Clearly , such police measures are not confined to this one incident .
In March , the Guardian published the results of an investigation that revealed that the police have established a database of thousands of political campaigners , covering all manner of issues .
The investigation also found that this information was being stored in the database for at least seven years .
The newspaper report stated , “ Photographs , names and video footage of people attending protests are routinely obtained by surveillance units and stored on an ‘ intelligence system ’ .
The Metropolitan police , which has pioneered surveillance at demonstrations and advises other forces on the tactic , stores details of protesters on Crimint , the general database used daily by all police staff to catalogue criminal intelligence .
It lists campaigners by name , allowing police to search which demonstrations or political meetings individuals have attended . ”
Other names stored in the database include those of journalists .
The investigation noted , “ Police surveillance teams are also targeting journalists who cover demonstrations , and are believed to have monitored members of the press during at least eight protests over the last year . ”
Amongst its findings were that “ Activists ‘ seen on a regular basis ’ as well as those deemed on the “ periphery ” of demonstrations are included on the police databases , regardless of whether they have been convicted or arrested . ”
“ Names , political associations and photographs of protesters from across the political spectrum — from campaigners against the third runway at Heathrow to anti-war activists — are catalogued . ”
The all - encompassing nature of state surveillance of political activists was underscored by the newspaper ’s disclosure that “ Police forces are exchanging information about protesters stored on their intelligence systems , enabling officers from different forces to search which political events an individual has attended . ”

Newt Gingrich was ringing the warning bells of alarm while on Fox News that President Obama is creating a dictatorship by imposing regulations on the financial industry .
Gingrich was in full conspiracy mode , while claiming that Obama is going to socialize everything .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :
Hannity ’s question was about Obama ’s desire to exclude Republicans by using the reconciliation process , but somehow Newt wandered into a jag on liberal fascism .
He then topped it off with this , “ We are seeing the biggest power grab by politicians in American history .
The idea that they would propose that the treasury could intervene and take over non-bank , non-financial system assets gives them the potential to basically create the equivalent of a dictatorship . [ … ]
Look , it absolutely moves it towards a political dictatorship . ”

Gingrich is going back to an old theme among Republicans .
It seems that any popular Democratic president is a dictator .
Here is what was said about Bill Clinton ’s use of Executive Orders in 2000 , “ Here we go again .
President Clinton continues to circumvent Congress , trampling on Constitutional checks and balances .
This is no lame duck president .
He can hear the clock winding down , and sensing his imminent departure , he is spending his last months in office ensuring his legacy through the use and abuse of the Executive Order ( EO ) . ”
Of course let ’s point out that these same people had no issue with George W. Bush ’s use of Executive Orders and signing statements .
Gingrich mentioned Jonah Goldberg ’s book Liberal Fascism F.D.R.’s presidency was a dictatorship .
The idea that Obama is going to take over non-financial assets is stupid .
It is hard to believe that he has a dictatorship in mind , when he has refused to nationalize the banks .
Republicans are too thick to get that right now , people want more regulation in the financial sector .
Heck even Wall Street realizes that the only way this mess will get cleaned up and ponzi schemes and scandals stop is with more government oversight .
Gingrich has intentionally confused the roles of capitalism and democracy .
Although they are in constant conflict , regulating capitalism is not the same as restricting democracy .
This is something that many Republicans do n’t get , which is why the nation goes though cycles of extreme Republican deregulation and then subsequent clean up .
Deregulation is good , but it must be done in moderation .
Deregulation is not the ideological cure all that Republicans make it out to be .
Dr. Fazio ’s Indiana study found that three times as many randomly assigned interracial roommates were no longer living together at the end of the semester , compared with white roommates .
The interracial roommates spent less time together , had fewer joint activities and were less involved with each other ’s friends than the white pairs .
And , the study found , whites ’ pre-existing negative racial attitudes predicted which roommate arrangements would break up .
Several studies have shown that living with a roommate of a different race changes students ’ attitudes .
One , from the University of California at Los Angeles , generally found decreased prejudice among students with different - race roommates  but those who roomed with Asian - Americans , the group that scored the highest on measures of prejudice , became more prejudiced themselves .
Image Sam Boakye , an Ohio State University student , was determined to get good grades to prevent his white roommate from developing negative racial views .

Professionals who watch over roommate relationships say that interracial roommate assignments are an important part of campus diversity .
“ Most of them do fine , and I think it can be more interesting , because they have more to learn from each other , ” said Phil Badaszewski , a hall director at Ohio State .
“ When there are conflicts , it ’s usually different ideas about property sharing , or music , or cleanliness , or coming in late at night  the same things that can be problems for same - race roommates . ”
Sometimes , such disputes mask underlying racial issues .
“ I had one student who chose to move out , who said they just did n’t like the roommate ’s friends , who were too loud , ” Mr. Badaszewski said .
“ I thought there was a racial piece to it , but I did n’t bring it up and name it .
It ’s one of those topics  race , religion and politics  your parents tell you not to talk about at dinner because it can be explosive .
And in this case , I knew it would n’t make things better . ”
Occasionally , there are explicit racial problems .
“ I had a black student who heard racist remarks being made in her quad , ” said Gina Kozlowski , another Ohio State hall director .
“ She said she did n’t want it being made into a spectacle , and she did n’t want to be the person who had to educate her roommates about race . ”
For the winning punters chancing their luck at Hawaiian Gardens ' charity bingo hall in the heart of one of California 's poorest towns , the big prize is $ 500 .
The losers walk away with little more than an assurance that their dollars are destined for a good cause .
But the real winners and losers live many thousands of miles away , where the profits from the nightly ritual of numbers - calling fund what critics describe as a form of ethnic cleansing by extremist organisations .
Each dollar spent on bingo by the mostly Latino residents of Hawaiian Gardens , on the outskirts of Los Angeles , helps fund Jewish settlements on Palestinian land in some of the most sensitive areas of occupied East Jerusalem , particularly the Muslim quarter of the old city , and West Bank towns such as Hebron where the Israeli military has forced Arabs out of their properties in their thousands .
Over the past 20 years , the bingo hall has funnelled tens of millions of dollars in to what its opponents — including rabbis serving the Hawaiian Gardens area — describe as an ideologically - driven strategy to grab land for Israel , as well as contributing to influential American groups and thinktanks backing Israel 's more hawkish governments .
But the bingo operation , owned by an American Jewish doctor and millionaire , Irving Moskowitz , has taken on added significance in recent weeks as President Barack Obama has laid down a marker to Israel in demanding an end to settlement construction , which the White House regards as a major obstacle to peace .
" Moskowitz is taking millions from the poorest town in California and sending it to the settlements , " said Haim Dov Beliak , a rabbi serving Hawaiian Gardens and one of the Jewish religious leaders in California who have campaigned to block the flow of funds to the settlers .
" The money Moskowitz puts in to the settlements has changed the game .
Moskowitz has helped build a hardcore of the settler movement that may number 50 - 70,000 .
" He 's not paying for all of it but he puts the money up front for the vanguards that get things off the ground .
That ties Israel 's hands .
That ties the hands of the Obama administration .
If the administration wants to be serious about stopping the settlers it has to begin in Hawaiian Gardens . "
Moskowitz is an 80 - year - old retired doctor and orthodox Jewish millionaire who built a fortune buying and selling hospitals .
In 1988 he also bought the faltering bingo hall in Hawaiian Gardens which , under California law , can only be run as not - for - profit operation so Moskowitz brought it under the wing of a charitable foundation he had established in his own name .
The foundation , which did not respond to requests for an interview , bills the bingo operation as of great benefit to the local community through donations to a number of groups , such as the Hawaiian Gardens food bank , as well as scholarships .
It has also given money for disaster relief in Central America , Kosovo and parts of the US .
But tax returns show that the bulk of the donations go to what the foundation describes as " charitable support " to an array of organisations in Israel .
" The loss of many of Dr Moskowitz 's relatives during the Holocaust strengthened his conviction that Israel must be maintained as a safe haven for Jewish people from all over the world .
In Israel , the Foundation supports a wide array of religious , educational , cultural and emergency services organisations , " the foundation says on its website .
What it does not say is that the focus of the donations is a number of Jewish organisations intent on claiming Palestinian territory for Israel and ensuring that occupied East Jerusalem remains in the Jewish state 's hands .
Beliak calculates that the foundation has given Jewish settlers well over £ 100 m , beginning with the construction 20 years ago of 133 houses on land confiscated from Palestinians by the Israeli government .
Beliak helped launch the Coalition for Justice in Hawaiian Gardens & Jerusalem to stop the flow of money from the bingo hall to the settlements .
Its investigations of tax records show that the Moskowitz Foundation 's donations include grants to Beit Hadassah , a militant Jewish settlement in the heart of the West Bank city of Hebron .
Thousands of Arabs have been forced from their homes and businesses around Beit Hadassah ostensibly for their own security after an American - born settler Baruch Goldstein murdered 29 Palestinians nearby in 1994 .
Goldstein was himself shot dead and his grave is regarded as a shrine by some settlers .
Moskowitz has made excuses for Goldstein 's actions by blaming Palestinians for pushing him too far .
The foundation has also given more than £ 3.5 m to Ateret Cohanim , a right wing group that houses Jews in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem 's old city .
In other parts of East Jerusalem , Moskowitz has funded Jewish colonies situated to box in or cut off Palestinian neighbourhoods that fits in with a broader government strategy to ensure total Israeli control over the city .
" What Moskowitz pioneered was trying to break up the continuity of the Arab population centres in Jerusalem , " said Beliak .
" The consequences are radically different from just mom and pop buying a little piece of land .
These are political statements and facts on the ground , and every [ US ] administration has allowed him to do this . "
Among the most contentious of the organisations backed by Moskowitz is the City of David Foundation in the heart of an Arab neighbourhood of Jerusalem , where about 1,500 Palestinians are facing expulsion ostensibly in the name of archaeological preservation of a site where the organisation says King David established a city 3,000 years ago .
Four years ago , the City of David Foundation director , Doron Spielman , told the Guardian that " the goal of our organisation is to increase the presence of Jews in the neighbourhood as much as possible …
We cannot trust that if this is an Arab neighbourhood , Jews will be safe here " .
To that end Palestinians have been driven from their homes , sometimes at gunpoint , while others are fighting in the courts to cling on to their properties .
Moskowitz has made no secret of his hostility toward the Palestinians .
He opposed the Oslo peace accords , likening them to the appeasement of the Nazis .
In 1996 he told the Los Angeles Times that peace talks represented a " slide toward concessions , surrender , and Israeli suicide " .
He was also an outspoken opponent of Ariel Sharon 's removal of Jewish settlers from the Gaza strip four years ago and provided the settlers with funds to fight the pullout .
Now Moskowitz is building a much bigger bingo hall in Hawaiian Gardens which will increase the flow of cash .
Beliak is particularly angered that the fundraising takes place without interference from the American authorities .
In contrast , he says , Muslim charities which raise money to help Palestinians have been targeted for investigation , shut down and some of their administrators jailed because providing welfare to Gaza indirectly helps Hamas .
" After 2001 there was a whole discourse about how supposedly Muslims [ in America ] used these charitable donations to support violence .
" There was never ever in the US anything substantially that made that case .
But here they did have a case where somebody was using money to support settlers , money that fosters extremism and violence , and they completely ignored it , " said Beliak .
The Airplane A programmer and an engineer were sitting next to each other on an airplane .
The programmer leans over to the engineer and asks if he wants to play a fun game .
The engineer just wants to sleep so he politely declines , turns away , and tries to sleep .
The programmer persists and explains that it 's a real easy game .
He explains , " I 'll ask a question and if you do n't know the answer you pay me $ 5 .
Then you ask me a question and if I do n't know the answer I 'll pay you $ 5 . "
Again , the engineer politely declines and tries to sleep .
The programmer , now somewhat agitated , says , " OK , if you do n't know the answer , you pay me $ 5 , and if I do n't know the answer , I 'll pay you $ 50 ! "
Now , that got the engineer 's attention , so he agrees to the game .
The programmer asks the first question , " what is the distance from the earth to the moon ? "
The engineer does n't say a word and just hands the programmer $ 5 .
Now , it 's the engineer 's turn .
He asks the programmer , " what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down on four ? "
The programmer looks at him with a puzzled look , takes out his laptop computer , looks through all his references and after about an hour wakes the engineer and hands him $ 50 .
The engineer politely takes the $ 50 , turns away , and tries to return to sleep .
The programmer , a little miffed , asks , " Well ?
What 's the answer to the question ? "
Without a word , the engineer reaches into his wallet , hands $ 5 to the programmer and returns to sleep .
Meet an intelligent designer of the ‘ Transformers ’
TOKYO ( TR ) –
If a robot is to save mankind , then it had better look the part .
Optimus Prime , the lead robot battling evil in the film “ Transformers , ” appeared too weak in its initial design , thought Keiji Yamaguchi , a creature developer at Industrial Light & Magic .
“ So I revised his face so that it looked stronger , more heroic , ” he says .
Perhaps a minor point to the casual filmgoer , but such detail was routine in perfecting the transformation sequences in director Michael Bay ’s $ 150 million blockbuster .
Yamaguchi , who came to ILM from Japan in 2001 , was influenced by such elements as shiko , the squatting done by sumo wrestlers , and karate poses , like those of Bruce Lee , in choreographing the robots ’ complicated motions .
Each robot component , right down to the bolts and washers , is hand designed .
A single robot has as many as 10,000 components , mostly jagged and slick hunks of metal , and when subparts are included , that number can more than double .
In morphing the Transformers piece by piece from cars into robots and back , Yamaguchi , whose prior work included the octopus - like Kraken in “ Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man ’s Chest , ” wanted to suit Bay ’s famously flamboyant tastes .
The violent image of bosozoku groups — the biker gangs that terrorize Japan ’s suburbs by revving their engines to ear - splitting volumes — was a driving force .
“ Instead of executing the transformations after the vehicle had stopped , ” he explains .
“ I designed the process to be ongoing as the car was skidding and spinning along the surface of the road . ”
Yamaguchi also wanted to make sure the animated moves had the same energy as the live - action footage .
“ The camera crews were working for dear life , ” he says of the filming of the car sequences .
“ I wanted to work like the real camera crew did .
We had to respect them and appreciate their spirit . ”
In the end , the point was to make everything look real , Yamaguchi says .
“ When it ’s all finished , ” he adds , “ and I can see the proper rhythm , I am very pleased . ”
Note :
This story originally appeared in the August 3 issue of Variety .
JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected Sunday an American call to hold off on a planned Jewish housing development in East Jerusalem , saying Israel ’s sovereignty over the disputed city could not be challenged .
Mr. Netanyahu issued the statement because State Department officials had raised concerns over the project with Israel ’s new ambassador to Washington , Michael Oren , during discussions last week on a range of issues .
The American officials suggested that going ahead with the development now would cause problems in negotiations toward a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
“ I would like to re-emphasize that united Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people and of the State of Israel , ” Mr. Netanyahu said .
“ Our sovereignty over it cannot be challenged ; this means  inter alia  that residents of Jerusalem may purchase apartments in all parts of the city . ”
Israeli officials , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter , said the Netanyahu government had gone public with the issue to try to pre-empt further American efforts to stop Jewish building in East Jerusalem .
Mr. Netanyahu noted in his statement that there were Arabs living in the predominantly Jewish western part of the city , adding , “ We cannot accept the idea that Jews will not have the right to live and purchase in all parts of Jerusalem . ”
Since then , the nation has only been free of debt once , in 1834 - 1835 .
The national debt has expanded during times of war and usually contracted in times of peace , while staying on a generally upward trajectory .
Over the past several decades , it has climbed sharply — except for a respite from 1998 to 2000 , when there were annual budget surpluses , reflecting in large part what turned out to be an overheated economy .
The debt soared with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and economic stimulus spending under President George W. Bush and now Obama .
The odometer - style " debt clock " near Times Square — put in place in 1989 when the debt was a mere $ 2.7 trillion — ran out of numbers and had to be shut down when the debt surged past $ 10 trillion in 2008 .
The clock has since been refurbished so higher numbers fit .
There are several debt clocks on Web sites maintained by public interest groups that let you watch hundreds , thousands , millions zip by in a matter of seconds .
The debt gap is " something that keeps me awake at night , " Obama says .
He pledged to cut the budget " deficit " roughly in half by the end of his first term .
But " deficit " just means the difference between government receipts and spending in a single budget year .
This year 's deficit is now estimated at about $ 1.85 trillion .
Deficits do n't reflect holdover indebtedness from previous years .
Some spending items — such as emergency appropriations bills and receipts in the Social Security program — are n't included , either , although they are part of the national debt .
The national debt is a broader , and more telling , way to look at the government 's balance sheets than glancing at deficits .
According to the Treasury Department , which updates the number " to the penny " every few days , the national debt was $ 11,518,472,742,288 on Wednesday .
The overall debt is now slightly over 80 percent of the annual output of the entire U.S. economy , as measured by the gross domestic product .
By historical standards , it 's not proportionately as high as during World War II , when it briefly rose to 120 percent of GDP .
But it 's still a huge liability .
Also , the United States is not the only nation struggling under a huge national debt .
Among major countries , Japan , Italy , India , France , Germany and Canada have comparable debts as percentages of their GDPs .
Where does the government borrow all this money from ?
The debt is largely financed by the sale of Treasury bonds and bills .
Even today , amid global economic turmoil , those still are seen as one of the world 's safest investments .
That 's one of the rare upsides of U.S. government borrowing .
Treasury securities are suitable for individual investors and popular with other countries , especially China , Japan and the Persian Gulf oil exporters , the three top foreign holders of U.S. debt .
But as the U.S. spends trillions to stabilize the recession - wracked economy , helping to force down the value of the dollar , the securities become less attractive as investments .
Some major foreign lenders are already paring back on their purchases of U.S. bonds and other securities .
And if major holders of U.S. debt were to flee , it would send shock waves through the global economy — and sharply force up U.S. interest rates .
As time goes by , demographics suggest things will get worse before they get better , even after the recession ends , as more baby boomers retire and begin collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits .
While the president remains personally popular , polls show there is rising public concern over his handling of the economy and the government 's mushrooming debt — and what it might mean for future generations .
If things can't be turned around , including establishing a more efficient health care system , " We are on an utterly unsustainable fiscal course , " said the White House budget director , Peter Orszag .
Some budget - restraint activists claim even the debt understates the nation 's true liabilities .
The Peter G. Peterson Foundation , established by a former commerce secretary and investment banker , argues that the $ 11.4 trillion debt figures does not take into account roughly $ 45 trillion in unlisted liabilities and unfunded retirement and health care commitments .
So , there appears to be a growing fissure between what public opinion considers to be “ science ” and what “ science ” really is .
I could start making some huge proclamations that this might explain modern pseudo - science ( like this , this or this ) or this gaping hole is a new one causing a frenzy of media hype ( like this , this or this ) , but I do n’t think it ’s quite as simple as that .
Although I love statistics , and a recent poll gives me plenty of ammo , I seriously doubt we can start making any conclusions about scientific advancement and the inverse correlation with public intelligence .
No , pseudo - science , fear of science , mad scientists , scientific misinformation , outright lies of science claims and I Just Made This Up™ have always been around , it ’s just that media is propagating faster than ever before ; and as information spreads quickly , misinformation spreads faster .
Public - science is a weak link
If a physics researcher can set up a blog , so can your average crazy doomsday theorist with a brand new theory about the universe being driven by a galactic hamster on a treadmill .
Actually , as physics researchers are very busy , crackpots probably have more time to set up their text - heavy , science - lite websites .
Crazy websites to one side , another factor to consider is that there ’s a stronger public - media relationship than a public - science relationship .
This is why quality , specialist reporters are needed , to communicate science to their readers in a rational , relevant way .
Unfortunately , this is probably the weakest link for science communication in this world of ultra - fast media .
As the “ old media ” behemoths start to suffer , trying to make profit while sinking in a tide of free online content , cutbacks are inevitable .
I ’ve seen this first hand at a recent conference , where the press room was occupied by bloggers , podcasters and vidcasters .
Only one New York Times correspondent was present ; a politics correspondent .
This was an astrophysics conference .
He was only there for a few hours , looking perplexed .
The disconnect widens
So the traditional media has to make cutbacks , so what ?
That ’s business .
Unfortunately , there are few science reporters , so when cutbacks happen , reliable reporting of science is lost , and reporters who probably have n’t studied any science in their lives find themselves being sent to report on the next great Hubble discovery or … the LHC ( we all know how that went ) .
So it is little wonder we start seeing statistics like this surfacing :
On the whole , scientists believe American research leads the world .
But only 17 percent of the public agrees , and the proportion who name scientific advances as among the United States ’ most important achievements has fallen to 27 percent from nearly 50 percent in 1999 , the survey found .
Almost a third of ordinary Americans say human beings have existed in their current form since the beginning of time , a view held by only 2 percent of the scientists .
Only about half of the public agrees that people are behind climate change , and 11 percent does not believe there is any warming at all .
The report said 85 percent of science association members surveyed said public ignorance of science was a major problem .
And by large margins they deride as only “ fair ” or “ poor ” the coverage of science by newspapers and television .
( emphasis added by me )
Playboy science
So why is there a growing disconnect between the public and science ?
I think it ’s a combination of factors ( fast online media , a lack of good quality science journalism etc. ) , but the result is pretty worrying .
When you see celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy spewing her dogma about the link between child autism and vaccines , alarm bells should be ringing .
McCarthy has decided to battle against science ( and the BigPharma overlords , of course ) , and she ’s gathered quite a following ; parents who have decided to turn their back on science and trust an ex-Playboy model instead .
This is just one example of the impact of science distrust .
Using this slack in the public - science communication , there ’s been a huge surge in conspiracy theories and individuals using science as a means to “ prove ” their “ belief . ”
This is an uncomfortable situation where you have large groups of people who are willing to promote their pet theory as science fact ( I ’m not talking Creationism here , there are a fair few odd physics theories knocking around too ) .
And when you have a very polished theory that sounds reasonable on the surface , but fails after a small bit of scientific rigour ( despite the fact they use out of date science to point the finger and say , “ I told you so ! ” ) , it can be hard for the public to understand what is “ science ” and what is bunkum .
Science blogging standard
So , as trusted media sources — such as major newspapers and news channels , traditionally the ‘ ground zero ’ of reporting — desperately try to grasp this new world of free and fast media , science journalism falls by the wayside , watering down the facts .
To “ go viral , ” often stories will be of very low science merit , but headline grabbing .
This could be the key reason why we have this current bout of public misunderstanding of science , allowing cranks some room to manoeuvre their next insane theory into position .
This is where science bloggers are flourishing .
In fact , science blogging is almost like the Internet ’s immune system ( that ’s an analogy , not scientific ‘ proof ’ ) , and because bloggers can knock out articles very quickly , they can often be the first on the scene to fight off the next flawed conspiracy theory or crackpot ramblings .
Of course , you do n’t have to be a scientist to blog , but there is a huge , wonderful infrastructure of skeptical websites that make a very healthy existence debunking false claims and pseudo - science .
Although many skeptical bloggers view debunking nutty theories to be an enjoyable pastime , it turns out they are doing something the mainstream media cannot : they are connected with their audience , they are usually professionals of their field and they will highlight the abuse of science , exposing these theories for what they really are ( crap ) .
So if you ’re ever confused about a website ’s claims , keep in mind Carl Sagan ’s famous ( and very relevant ) quote , “ Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . ”
If a website is telling you that the Sun is actually driven by a magical force , other than gravitational pressure and nuclear fusion , ask ‘ where ’s your proof ? ‘ — you ’ll find there will be no satisfactory answer to that question .

Following the lead of this post by Jon Taplin , you really must read this article in the Times on the battle over including a ‘ public option ’ in the new Obama health care reform bill .
If you ’re not familiar with the lingo of this debate , the ‘ public option ’ refers to allowing the federal government to sell its own insurance plan which would compete with private health insurance providers .
Think of it as a version of Medicare that everyone could buy into .
Here ’s the key graf from the Times piece …
But critics argue that with low administrative costs and no need to produce profits , a public plan will start with an unfair pricing advantage .
They say that if a public plan is allowed to pay doctors and hospitals at levels comparable to Medicare ’s , which are substantially below commercial insurance rates , it could set premiums so low it would quickly consume the market .
As Taplin suggests , these ‘ problems ’ sound remarkably like ‘ the point ’ of the whole exercise .
Most of the argument here is that a big government plan would just provide the insurance ‘ service ’ much more efficiently and cheaply than private carriers .
And that the private carriers would n’t be able to make any money off selling the service any more .
But this is the argument that single payer advocates routinely make — namely , that a lot of the money that goes into private health insurance goes to paperwork , much of which is tied to finding ways to deny people coverage .
That , and the need to earn profits on providing the service .
Presumably if there were other quality advantages to the private plans , the carriers would n’t be so worried that everyone would switch to the public plan .
I think I might be open to some effective scare - mongering on that front .
But the private carriers do n’t seem to have much confidence there ’s much to scare people about .
A new element is set to occupy spot 112 on the periodic table .
(( iStock ) )
Scientists are about to add a new , super - heavy element to the periodic table .
" The new element is approximately 277 times heavier than hydrogen , making it the heaviest element in the periodic table , " the German scientists who produced the element said in a statement on Wednesday .
The new element is massive and unstable — it can only exist for fractions of a second before splitting up in radioactive decay .
It will occupy spot 112 on the periodic table .
Elements are assigned numbers on the table based on how many protons they have .
The team of German researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research produced the element for the first time a decade ago .
The experiment that created it is very hard to duplicate , so it took years for the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) to independently verify its existence .
The same team that produced element 112 is also responsible for adding elements 107 - 111 to the periodic table .
Sigurd Hofmann , who led the team at the Centre for Heavy Ion Research , has been working on adding to the table since 1976 .
Hofmann and his research team made element 112 by firing charged zinc atoms at lead atoms with a particle accelerator .
The nuclei of the two atoms merged and immediately begin to decay .
The researchers then calculated the size of the fused nucleus by measuring the amount of energy emitted by the decaying particle .
The team 's next job is to propose a name for the element .
This has to be done before it can be formally added to the periodic table .
Shortlist of potential names secret
For now , Hofmann is keeping the shortlist of potential names a secret .
In the meantime , it will go by the temporary name ununbium , based on the Latin words for " one one two . "
Creating new elements helps scientists understand nuclear power better , which could lead to advances in nuclear power and radioactive waste management , as well as nuclear weapons .
Research teams in the United States , Russia and Japan are also engaged in an unofficial race to discover new and heavier elements .
Hoffman said he believed elements with as many as 120 protons can be produced .
Creating new elements helps scientists understand nuclear power better , which could lead to advances in nuclear power and radioactive waste management , as well as nuclear weapons .
The heaviest naturally occurring element is uranium , which has 92 protons .
Scientists produced the first artificial element at the University of California , Berkeley in 1940 .
It had 93 protons and was named neptunium .

ISTANBUL ( Reuters ) - Countries that selfishly use shared rivers threaten political stability at a time when water is scarce and demand is growing , a conservation group warned on Wednesday .

Disputes over shared rivers such as the Tigris and the Euphrates could be resolved if nations put borders aside and viewed the entire river basin as a unit instead , they added .
In the past some states have built dams or siphoned water from rivers for irrigation without consulting neighbors downstream -- stirring political tension .
“ The question countries must face is are they interested only in holding all the water themselves and living in a destabilized region , or do they wish to share the water and cooperate ? ” said Mark Smith , head of the water program of the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , a body funded by states , and NGOs .
Rivers shared by more than one country provide about 60 percent of the world ’s fresh water .
There are 260 international river basins in the world , covering half of the Earth ’s surface and home to 40 percent of the world ’s population .
Traditionally the focus in negotiations over shared rivers has been how to apportion water .
Once the water is divided each country tries to optimize water use within its borders , rather than across the shared basin , the IUCN said .
By working jointly countries could reap better economic benefits from rivers and ease political tensions .
Turkey , hosting the triennial World Water Forum in Istanbul , is home to the sources of the Euphrates and Tigris , which form a river basin flowing through Syria and Iraq before draining into the Gulf from Iraq .
Wrangling over the rivers is longstanding .
Upriver dams built by Turkey , Syria and Iran have caused Iraq water shortages , exacerbated by an infrastructure devastated by war .
“ There is a real distinction between the upstream and downstream position .
Those upstream hold a lot of power .
In Turkey that power is accentuated because Syria and Iraq are very dry countries , ” said Smith .
Smith said some countries cooperate well , such as Guinea , Mali , Mauritania and Senegal which share the Senegal River , while the Volta river is shared by six West African states .
“ The Rhine for example used to be a huge source of dispute between France , Germany and the Netherlands , particularly over pollution ... institutions were set up and now the river is co-ordinated and is a clean river again . ”
In states were huge dams have been built to the detriment of other nations downstream , the flows of the dams could be altered to allow rivers to replicate their previous natural patterns , Smith said , which would help restore ecosystems .
Turkey been heavily criticized by some environmental groups during the conference for pursuing large scale dam and hydro- electric power building projects .
Most controversial is the 1.2 billion euro Ilisu project , begun in 2006 , which will construct a dam on the Tigris river , bury part of the ancient town of Hasankeyf and force the relocation of thousands of people .
THERE is a risk police will become too reliant on Tasers , using the stun guns as their weapon of first choice , a review of a year - long trial of Tasers in Queensland has warned .
NSW will begin issuing Tasers to all front - line police officers this month .
Queensland has halted its adoption of the weapon after the death last month of a North Queensland man who was stunned 28 times .
Almost half the officers surveyed by the Queensland Police Service and Crime and Misconduct Commission warned there was potential for over - reliance on the Taser .
A quarter said there was potential for misuse .
The report found better training was required to ensure police officers did not use the stun mode - where the gun is applied directly to the skin or clothes rather than fired from a distance , known as the probe action - needlessly .
The report concluded Tasers " can provide an important , alternative use of force option " , but warned there was a risk officers would use them where not necessary , become over - reliant on them and deploy them repeatedly or for extended periods .
To guard against this the Queensland Police Service will audit Taser data downloads , stations will have detailed Taser registers , officers will have to record their use of the weapon and a " significant event " review panel will assess Taser use .
Training for the statewide implementation of the devices will focus on decision - making about using the stun mode .
During the Queensland Taser trial , which ran from July 1 , 2007 , to June 2 , 2008 , Tasers were used 170 times .
The report found that three - quarters of subjects were unarmed when a Taser was used against them .
Tasers were fired multiple times in a quarter of incidents .
One man , a schizophrenic who had taken amphetamines , was Tasered 10 times .
In 17 per cent of incidents , the subject was already handcuffed when stunned .
The report said the stun mode was more likely to be used multiple times than the probe action .
Last week ,
Ohio state representative John Adams ( R ) introduced a bill that would require women seeking abortions to present written permission from the father of the baby before the procedure could be performed .
Now you can get out of pregnancy in the same way that you used to get out of P.E. class .
One of the brick walls against which pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates often find themselves running up against is the question of who is the most important stakeholder in the abortion debate .
When a woman becomes unexpectedly pregnant , whose needs are most important ?
Hers ?
The baby ’s ?
The father ’s ?
Society’s ?
In this situation , anti-abortion advocates say , a woman has to think about the needs of the new life that has been created .
Her own needs — financial , emotional or otherwise — should take a backseat so that she can give the new life inside her a chance to blossom .
Pro-choicers , on the other hand , often reject the premise that the fetus is a life , and therefore reject the idea that a woman ’s needs should be subjugated to those of the fetus .
Besides , they argue , even if the fetus is a life , the mother is already fully formed human , with a mind and a soul , and with needs and rights of her own .
I do n’t think that abortion is a decision to be taken lightly .
However , there is no doubt in my mind as to whose decision it should be .
And this proposed law is an example of pure , unadulterated sexism .
It ’s one thing to ask a woman to consider the needs of the new life she helped to create , and to compel her to put aside her own needs for the next nine months so that this new life might be allowed to thrive .
It is quite another to use legislation to forcibly wrest the decision from her hands entirely , and to give final say to the biological father of the baby .
Men know best , ladies , so stop worrying your pretty little heads about silly things like your emotional preparedness or your undergraduate education .
Just wait quietly over there while the men will decide what to do .
The Ohio bill is extreme , and its passage seems unlikely .
But , like anyone who ’s been watching abortion politics and abortion legislation over the last few years , I ’m not particularly surprised by it .
After all , when it comes to abortion , male legislators have been making women ask for their permission for years .
Until now , it ’s been in the form of mandatory ultrasounds , 24 - hour waiting periods , bans on partial - birth abortion , and parental notification and parental consent laws .
These are all hoops women have had to jump through , permission slips we ’ve had to get signed .
It was only a matter of time before some bright legislator decided to give individual men the right to do what male legislators have been doing for years .
I ’m of the opinion that if a man and a woman have a relationship that is more than purely sexual and the woman finds herself unexpectedly pregnant , the man ’s wishes should be considered .
After all , in this situation a woman is likely to turn to friends , family and other loved ones for support and guidance , so there ’s a good chance she ’ll at least ask the biological father what his wishes are .
If a man is in a relationship with a woman , he deserves to at least be consulted on the question of abortion .
Whether or not a woman acts on what he tells her is entirely her decision .
But a one - night stand does n’t fall into the category of “ friends , family and other loved ones . ”
As such , in the case of a one - night stand , the father has no business wielding final say over the reproductive future of a near - total stranger , just as the mother has no business demanding child support payments if she decides to keep the baby .
And what about one - night stands , you ask ?
How does Rep .
Adams propose to put this law into action in the case of multiple possible fathers ?
According to Think Progress , “ in the case where the father is n’t known , House Bill 252 would compel the woman to provide a list of names of people who may be the father in an effort to determine paternity . ”
At first glance , this measure seems designed to make sure that as many men as possible are allowed more decision - making power over a pregnant woman ’s body than the woman herself .
Seems harmless enough , right ?
But really , it ’s about shaming women for having multiple sexual partners .
Which Ohio women really do n’t need : they already get that from their state 's abstinence - only sex “ education ” curriculum .
Finally , the Ohio bill is problematic because it trivializes abortion .
In recent months , anti-abortion advocates and pro-choice advocates have been working to find some common ground on which they can work together to reduce the number of abortions that are performed in America .
The reason that both sides want to reduce that number is because both sides understand that the decision to have an abortion is a deeply personal one , a choice to which we cannot do justice with a simple permission slip .
It ’s a decision that must be made at the complex and confusing intersection of a woman ’s values , religion and culture .
It ’s a decision that must take into account her needs and her feelings , her plans and her goals .
And it ’s a decision that needs to be honored and trusted by the men in her life — the ones she sleeps with and the ones she votes for .

Review by Barry Healy
July 28 , 2009 -- In October 2008 the Catholic Synod of Bishops convened in Rome for a four - day theological discussion .
Without warning , on the first day , Pope Benedict XVI suspended discussion and ordered the 200 participants to attend a special commemoration mass for Pius XII , who was the pope between 1939 and 1958 .
The sudden decision was part of an attempt to stampede the Catholic Church into accepting the beatification of Pius XII .
According to the English Catholic newspaper , The Tablet , Pius ’ beatification “ has been bogged down by longstanding criticism , especially from Jewish groups , that the Second World War - era pope did not speak out sufficiently against the Holocaust ” .
That Benedict has to resort to such bizarre tactics is a small measure of how the decisions made during the Holocaust still resonate today .
More than just an example of Søren Kierkegaard ’s famous aphorism , “ Life must be understood backwards ; but ... it must be lived forward ” , it shows how the Holocaust still lives today , effecting individuals , families and whole nations .
The struggle to understand it is part of the battle of ideas to comprehend the modern world .
The Holocaust was a maelstrom ; all those caught in it had to make choices to survive .
Some chose to look after themselves , even acquiring fortunes and lying afterwards , others lived exemplary lives -- and died .
Many just died .
These four books recount some of these individual choices and their consequences .
Slaughter
SS Einsatzgruppen shootings of Eastern European Jewish men started in June 1941 .
In July they began murdering Jewish women and children , and in August and September annihilating whole Jewish districts .
It was here that Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Becher of the SS Death ’s Head Division started to rise through the ranks .
He was to later feature in the mass slaughter of Hungarian Jews , and his alliance with the Zionist Rezso Kasztner is central to Anna Porter ’s Kasztner ’s Train .
By the end of 1941 , a million Jews in the Soviet Union and the Baltics had disappeared .
The figures come from a July 16 , 2009 , article by Timothy Snyder in the New York Review of Books .
By the end of 1942 the Holocaust had claimed two - thirds of its victims .
These were mainly Polish and Soviet Jews shot or gassed by carbon monoxide from engines pumped into chambers at Treblinka , Belzec and Sobibor .
Then the Nazis ’ attention turned to the slaughter of Western European Jews , Roms and others .
Approximately 10 per cent of Holocaust victims were Hungarian .
In 1944 , with the Nazi defeat obvious to all , the killings continued .
Adolf Eichmann dispatched so many Jews to Auschwitz from Hungary that the gas chambers were overwhelmed .
Pits were dug , giant graves .
“ Those that what finished in the gas chambers before they got pushed in these graves , it was the lucky ones ” , Art Spiegelman recounts his Polish father telling him in Maus , A Survivor ’s Tale .
“ The others had to jump in the graves while they were still alive .
Prisoners what worked there poured gasoline over the live ones and the dead ones and the fat from the burning bodies they scooped and poured again so everyone could burn better . ”
The screams of the dying are graphically , hideously depicted in Maus .
Collaboration
After the war US diplomat Robert Daniel Murphy asked German Catholic Cardinal Michael Faulhaber about “ the disturbing reports that during the war some of the Catholic clergy in Bavaria fell under Nazi influence ” .
It was “ unfortunately true ” , Faulhaber admitted .
Luckily only five priests in his archdiocese had aligned themselves with the party .
And the good cardinal had relieved them of their duties and , furthermore , three of them were now dead and the other two had disappeared .
Cardinal Faulhaber was a bare - faced liar .
Kevin Spicer meticulously shows at least 180 Catholic priests actively supported the Nazis up to and including spying on other clergy for the fascists .
Beyond these 180 , there was a vast network of sympathetic priests and Bishops who quietly supported the Reich .
They celebrated the oppression of Jews and blessed Nazi flags .
How these priests could be won to fascism and be tolerated by their superiors was due to a commonality between Nazism and Catholicism : hatred of Jews .
Where they differed was in how to deal with Jews .
The Nazis wanted to kill them , the Catholics wanted to baptise them and “ save their souls ” .
Also , Nazi social totalitarianism conflicted with Catholic social domination through schools and its other structures .
So , while the relationship was not perfectly harmonious , the overlap of ideology allowed for enough of a commonality of interests that the Church did not lead a resistance to the Nazis .
Catholic Church resistance ?
Not all priests were collaborators .
Previously , Spicer has written of priests who opposed the Nazis , at the expense of their lives .
Today , as part of Pope Benedict ’s beatification push for Pius XII , archivists have been delving deep into Vatican records .
The Vatican now claims that a document has been found showing that Pius ordered Catholic clergy to resist the Nazis .
If true , there is no evidence that people were aware of it at the time .
It could be that the Vatican is self - servingly using partial evidence .
Approximately around the same time that Murphy was chatting with Cardinal Faulhaber , Kurt Becher was arrested and charged with war crimes for his part in the mass murder of Hungarian Jews .
Luckily he had Rezso Kasztner , a skilled lawyer , to speak in his defence at the War Crimes Tribunal , effectively acting as his defence attorney .
Kasztner was “ repaying a debt of honour ” , says Anna Porter .
According to Porter , Kasztner owed Becher because while Becher had been working with Eichmann to kill Jews , Kasztner had been working with Becher to save them .
The accusation has hung over Kasztner ever since that he connived with Becher to save some wealthy and influential Jews in exchange for collaboration in the murder of masses of other Hungarian Jews .
Becher got off , returned to Germany , and within a year mysteriously acquired great wealth , became a rich businessman and rose to be a confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
It can be safely assumed that Becher ’s riches came from the treasure trove of bribes he took during the Holocaust .
Emanuel Ringelblum
In early August 1942 a 19 - year - old member of the Jewish underground resistance wrote feverishly , deep inside the burning Warsaw Ghetto about another , different trove of riches : “ What we were unable to shriek to the world we buried in the ground …
May the treasure fall into good hands , may it last into better times , may it alarm and alert the world to what happened …
We may now die in peace …
May history attest to us . ”
Finally , he asked whoever might find the buried items to send them to the Borochov Museum in the “ United Soviets of Palestine ” – a brave testament to his vision of a better , communistic , post - WWII world .
The treasure that David Graber and his revolutionary comrades were toiling to bury was the Oyneg Shabes Archive , a massive collection of essays , historical investigations and contemporary publications that preserved the story of ghetto life .
The leader of the secret group of archivists was the radical historian Emanuel Ringelblum .
Ringelblum was a stalwart member of the Jewish revolutionary group the Left Poalei Zion ( LPZ ) – the radical faction of the Poalei Zion ( Zionist Worker 's ) party inspired by Ukrainian - born thinker Ber Borochov .
Borochov sought to develop Marxist theory to address Jewish oppression .
The LPZ was a major player in the intense politico - social life of pre-WWII Jewish Poland .
It attacked the social - democratic Bund , which sought Jewish assimilation into a social - democratic Polish nationality .
As in the rest of Europe the Zionists were a minority trend .
“ Although the entire spectrum of Jewish political activity in interwar Poland required a high degree of personal dedication and commitment , it is fair to say that the LPZ attracted an exceptionally devoted membership ” , Kassow writes .
One of Ringelblum ’s early employers sniffed that he was “ more Communist than the Communists ” .
The LPZ defended the USSR even though they were aware of its “ mistakes and shortcomings ' ' , Kassow says .
However , the LPZ wanted a socialist , Jewish Palestine and was convinced that only “ a world revolution , directed by the Soviet Union ” could produce it .
Ringelblum ’s political formation , based on faith in the masses , proved essential for the most demanding role of his life within the Warsaw Ghetto as leader of the legal Aleynhilf ( Self - Help Society ) and the clandestine Oyneg Shabes Archive .
Interestingly , Ringelblum was at a conference in Switzerland at the beginning of WWII and could have sat out the war there .
He chose to return to his family and his revolutionary duties in Poland .
In 1940 , in the Warsaw Ghetto , he drew together members of all Jewish factions into the Oyneg Shabes , which collected and buried two huge archives ( one survived unscathed ) .
Of the 60 members of the group only three survived .
Ringelblum was determined that the record be meticulously objective so that future generations could understand the suffering of the Jews .
It was his contribution to a future in which racism and anti-Semitism would be no more .
From this archive we know , for instance , of the many German soldiers who would visit the ghetto and converse in Yiddish - German , sharing their secret thoughts about Hitler and his gang .
Also reported are stories of corrupt Jews eagerly joining Germans and Poles in extorting money from their unfortunate brethren .
And also , astonishing stories of commitment to human values in the face of Nazism .
Such as the teachers Janusz Korczak , Esther Karasiowna , Aaron Koninski and Stefania Wilczynska , who , when the Nazis collected children for deportation , chose to accompany them on their final journey , with full awareness of the consequences , in order to calm their fears .
An essay by Ringelblum himself describes the last meeting of the LPZ in Warsaw , at the opening of a party soup kitchen in the Ghetto in 1942 .
They reiterated their belief that the war would end with the collapse of capitalism and the victory of the Soviet Red Army .
LPZ leader Shakhne Zagan explained his certainty that “ the working class in so - called democratic countries would not repeat the mistakes of 1918 and not let the fruits of victory slip away ” , Ringelblum reported .
Kassow explains that “ mistakes of 1918 ” were the “ the decision of the German Social Democratic Party to set up the Weimar Republic instead of a Soviet state and the failure of workers in other countries to help the Bolsheviks ” .
“ Convinced that dying capitalism had spawned Nazism and , with it , the murder of European Jewry , this belief in world revolution gave Ringelblum a rare glimmer of hope , ” Kassow writes .
The Oyneg Shabes produced documentary evidence of the gas chambers and smuggled it out to the Allies , demanding that action be taken to stop the death trains .
The Allies ’ choice to not bomb the rail lines echoes down the years as an unanswered question from WWII .
Warsaw Ghetto uprising
Eventually , Jewish youth groups , led by Zionist youth , armed themselves and led the heroic Warsaw Ghetto uprising of 1943 .
Ringelblum and the LPZ encouraged the uprising , which lasted for months .
Funds were garnered by armed expropriations from rich Jews in the Ghetto .
After hiding in an underground bunker for an extended period Ringelblum was captured by German soldiers on March 7 , 1944 , with his wife and son .
He was tortured to try to get his contacts in the underground .
Other Jewish prisoners gathered money to save him by bribing the Nazis .
The prisoner who took the proposition to Ringelblum found him sitting , bearing the signs of his beatings , with his beloved son on his lap .
Ringelblum refused the offer , because it would have saved him only .
Some days later , thought to be around March 11 , 1944 , Emanuel Ringelblum , his wife and son , along with others , were shot by the Nazis in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto .
Presumably their bones are under the foundations of modern Warsaw .
Rezso Kasztner
Rezso Kasztner had a completely different relationship with the German occupiers of Hungary and remains a controversial figure because of it .
After WWII he was denounced in a world famous Israeli court case .
It was said that he was a collaborator who connived with Eichmann to facilitate the transport of Hungarian Jews in exchange for money and some Zionists , destined for Palestine .
He was also denounced as having saved the mass murderer Becher at Nuremberg .
Novelist Anna Porter has written what she calls a “ popular history ” in order to exonerate him .
Porter argues that Kasztner was in fact responsible for saving the lives of more than 20,000 , doing the best in impossible circumstances .
Australian writer Thomas Keneally , famous for his novel based on history , Schindler ’s Ark , calls Porter ’s work “ a classic of the times it deals with ” .
He is right in that Porter certainly communicates with novelistic power the terrible Nazi oppression in Hungary .
Unfortunately she has , as she puts in the introduction , allowed herself “ the leeway to reconstruct scenes and dialogue ” .
She has copious footnotes but it is hard to discern exactly what is fact and what is fiction .
Attributing emotions or thoughts to people using novelistic techniques is a great way of swaying the reader rather than reporting facts , and that is her method .
It is quite noticeable that Porter rigorously defends Kasztner 's morality while assassinating the characters of many others .
Even the physical appearance of anyone who disagreed with him gets poison pen treatment .
Kasztner is the only person in this book with pristine motives .
He is brave , robust , good looking and the only person truly concerned to save Jewish lives .
Why ?
Precisely because he was a staunch Zionist .
Porter reports that Eichmann liked dealing with Zionists because he sympathised with their desire to separate from non-Jews and establish a homeland .
As with the Catholic Church , Porter hints at enough of a commonality of ideology to allow for a commonality of interest .
While other Hungarian Jews starved , Krasztner , head of the Hungarian Jewish Agency Rescue Committee , night clubbed with Nazis all night , eating and drinking the very best .
Later , in the 1950s , in an Israeli courtroom , survivors said that Jews boarded Nazi trains to the camps unaware of their doom because Krasztner withheld the information he had about the gas chambers .
When , Kasztner , who Porter says was an extremely intelligent and eloquent lawyer , had the courtroom as his forum in which to demonstrate that he had acted with the best of intentions , he was completely demolished .
Porter offers a series of excuses for this , none of which are persuasive .
She says that Kasztner was responsible for saving the lives of more than 20,000 people .
Yet , these survivors failed to step forward to speak on his behalf while others who did speak denounced him .
In fact , Porter rails against “ Rezso ’s so - called friends who had encouraged him to testify and then , when they were on the stand , had lied that they had no idea about the exterminations , that they would not have gone into the trains had they known . ”
Porter attributes this to a psychological quirk by which people who owe their lives to another person come to resent the fact .
It is an unsupportable claim .
The Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg is warmly remembered to this day for saving Hungarian Jews .
The added drama of the court case was that Kasztner was not even the defendant .
It was a libel action brought by the Israeli government on Kasztner ’s behalf against an obscure pamphleteer who had attacked him .
Porter says that the judge was originally leaning towards Kasztner but as his testimony proceeded , turned against him , finally damning him in his judgement .
After the judgement , Kasztner was assassinated in what appears to have been a political hit carried out by people associated with Israel 's secret police Mossad , possibly because he was an international embarrassment .
After his death , in a divided opinion , Israel 's Supreme Court overturned part of the lower court ’s verdict , thus allowing Porter to say that Kasztner ’s name had been cleared .
But Porter ’s book opens as many questions as it seeks to close .
Porter is not denying that Kasztner got as close as he could to the Nazis , that he had early knowledge of the death camps and chose to not pass that on to others .
Hungarian Jews testified that they believed they were being sent to work , not death , because Kasztner withheld the truth .
Porter even mentions one occasion on which fascist goons acted on Krasztner ’s orders against Jews .
No better path ?
Was his behaviour acceptable because , regrettably , no better path was available , as Porter argues ?
Or was no other path available because of Kasztner 's politics , making him contemptuous of non-Zionists ?
Kasztner said in court that the “ Hungarian Jew was a branch which long ago dried up on the tree ” , meaning that , because Hungarian Jews were assimilated they were morally depleted .
Therefore , they could not be expected to resist and were not worthy to be saved from slaughter .
Astonishingly , the majority of Israel 's Supreme Court agreed with him .
“ From this point of view no rescue achievement could have resulted by disclosing the Auschwitz news to the Jewish leaders ” , the judges said .
The Supreme Court delivered two verdicts : in one they ruled that Kasztner 's accuser had been right that Kasztner had defended the war criminal Becher at Nuremberg , but they split four to one on the accusation that Kasztner had collaborated with the Nazis .
The assassins ’ bullets had already solved the political and legal quandary for the Israeli government of the legal requirement to prosecute Kasztner for having saved Becher .
The complex Supreme Court decision created enough of a loophole for Kasztner ’s defenders to claim vindication .
The government saw to it that the killers were released very early from prison .
This is murky business and Porter puts as good a gloss as possible on all of it .
However , her history with novelistic flourishes actually raises the ghosts of the Hungarian Holocaust rather than settling them .
Fascism , never again !
Art Spiegelman is one who has lived with such Holocaust demons all his life .
The child of two survivors he became an early leader of the Zap comic graphic style in the USA and editor of Raw magazine .
Beginning in the 1980s he started interviewing his father and translating the conversations into graphic form .
The Pulitzer prize - winning work has been rewarded with many reprintings .
Spiegelman 's style is deceptively simple .
Jews are drawn as mice , Germans as cats , Poles as pigs and so on with other nationalities .
By slightly distancing the reader from the human form the utter depravity of Nazism somehow becomes the more shocking , cutting in under conscious defences .
And all the horror of the Holocaust , up to and including Auschwitz is displayed .
What is more , Spiegelman writes himself into the narrative so that the past terror becomes intertwined with revealing the painful difficulties of the father / son relationship in the present .
Spiegelman 's father never really recovered from his experiences .
He was a neurotic , paranoid and demanding individual and the son struggled to fully understand him .
The subtitle “ A Survivor ’s Tale ” ironically raises the question of who is the survivor : the father whose terrors affected his parenting , or the son , coping with the transferred fears he carries in himself .
It is Spiegelman 's unwavering honesty , exposing both himself and his father , which makes this work essential for understanding the Holocaust and its consequences .
It is perfect for presenting to children when they are of an age to deal with the Holocaust .
It stands in such contrast to the manoeuvrings of Pope Benedict and Anna Porter .
It stands in the tradition of Emanuel Ringelblum and the Oyneg Shabes Archive and the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising .
Moreover , it amplifies those howling voices from the burning pit of Auschwitz , which must never be silenced and must always be answered with “ Fascism , never again ! ”
Body may have lain for five years
Isabella Purves , who owned the flat , would have been 90 this year
The body of a pensioner has been found in a tenement flat in Edinburgh where it may have lain for up to five years .
Isabella Purves , who owned the flat , would have been 90 this year .
Police officers , who are appealing for relatives to get in touch , made the discovery as they investigated a water leak on Tuesday .
They had to push past a large volume of mail to enter the flat in Rodney Street in the Cannonmills area .
The death is not being treated as suspicious .
It is understood the pensioner may have been paying her bills by direct debit .
Cleo Gifford , 34 , whose family lived opposite Ms Purves for 18 years , said she was saddened and shocked by the news .
She told the BBC Scotland news website : " In all the 18 years we lived there , Ms Purves never had one visitor , it was a wee shame .
Mail piled up over the years at Ms Purves ' flat " She was always cleaning her brasses and keeping the stair clean and would go out hiking .
She was very fit and only became frail in later years .
" She was an old - fashioned lady , quite a Miss Marple , Morningside - type , but not glam - no pearls or twin sets , but she would wear thick tights and long skirts and was always very well turned out .
" I think it is tragic that someone can be deceased for such a long period of time and not be found , it is really sad . "
Dorothy Crystal , joint owner of David Crystal Optometrist , said Ms Purves was an annual customer until her last visit in 1997 .
She said : " We kept sending her reminders until 2004 but stopped after we thought she must have gone to live in a nursing home .
" She used to walk past the shop but she was frail .

" I am absolutely shocked at this news because it is a close - knit community here and I find it incredible that nobody knew she had died for all this time . "
Ms Purves 's 44 - year - old postman said : " I only met her once in the 10 years I have been delivering her mail .
" She never got much mail , it was only occasional , so that 's why I did n't suspect anything .
" There was no smell from her door .
I am very shocked and saddened that she has been lying there so long . "
Neil Gammack , 57 , whose sister raised the alarm when water started leaking from Ms Purves ' top floor flat into his kitchen , said he had not seen Ms Purves for five years .
" I am shocked and have been thinking about it for days , " he said .
" I never saw her all the years I have been living here . "
Neighbour Lucy Balloch , 28 , added : " I am very sad and shocked by the news .
The pensioner 's body was found at a tenement flat in Edinburgh " People always change flats here as there are a lot of students and very few long - term residents , so nobody knows their neighbours and therefore did n't suspect anything . "
Giovanni Cilia , 59 , has owned the Fioritalia flower shop , which is located below Ms Purves ' flat , for 20 years .
He said she was a solitary person who would occasionally stop to talk .
" I have n't seen her for at least three years , maybe more , " he said .
" She would sometimes weed the communal garden at the front of the tenements and I used to see her with a huge rucksack and big walking boots ... but I never knew where she was going . "

A bipartisan group of six " moderate " US senators , dubbed the " Gang of Six " by news agencies , issued a demand July 17 for a slowdown on Democratic health care reform .
These senators - including three conservative Democrats , one conservative Independent who caucuses with Democrats , and two moderate Republicans - asked for a slowdown on health care reform not because their constituents wished it so : recent polls show that a clear majority of Americans want health care reform now including a public health care option such as that proposed by President Obama and progressives in Congress .
No , these senators asked for a slowdown on health care reform because the for - profit health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries have bid them to do so in the hope that reform can be stopped , and because these same industries have generously provided them with career campaign contributions totalling more than $ 11 million .
These six senators - whom I 'll call the " Gang of Sickos " in honor of Michael Moore 's film on America 's health care crisis similarly titled - are Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska , Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , and Ron Wyden of Oregon ; Independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut ; and Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine ( Paul Krugman calls them " the six deadly hypocrites " ) .
Their career total and average daily contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries are summarized by Paul Blumenthal at the Huffington Post based on figures from the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) .
Sicko # 1 : Democrat Ben Nelson of Nebraska , the ringleader of the group , has raised more than $ 2.2 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of his career according to Blumenthal , averaging more than $ 700 per day since taking office in January 2001 .
Public Campaign Action Fund ( PCAF ) gives a slightly lower career total of just over $ 2.0 million for Nelson , and provides extensive detail on his ties to the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries .
Before entering politics , as PCAF notes , Nelson spent his career as an insurance executive , as an insurance company lawyer and , early in his career , as Nebraska 's state insurance regulator .
As PCAF also notes , a number of Nelson 's former Senate staffers have moved on into lucrative careers as health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industry lobbyists .
Comments may be addressed to Senator Nelson via his Senate contact page ( Nebraska residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : senator@bennelson.senate.gov ( CRP : Ben Nelson ) .
Sicko # 2 : Democrat Mary Landrieu of Louisiana has raised more than $ 1.6 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of her career , averaging more than $ 300 per day since taking office in January 1997 .
PCAF provides extensive detail on Landrieu 's ties to the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries .
Like Nelson 's former staffers , several of Landrieu 's have also gone on to work as health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industry lobbyists .
Landrieu 's opposition to the public option was attacked in a TV ad from MoveOn aired in her home state .
Landrieu is also listed as one of the twenty most corrupt members of Congress by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington .
Comments may be addressed to Senator Landrieu via her Senate contact page ( Louisiana residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : senator@landrieu.senate.gov ( CRP : Mary Landrieu ) .
Sicko # 3 : Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon has raised more than $ 1.4 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of his career , averaging almost $ 300 per day since taking office in February 1996 .
Comments may be addressed to Senator Wyden via his Senate contact page ( Oregon residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : senator@wyden.senate.gov ( CRP : Ron Wyden ) .
Sicko # 4 : Independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut has raised almost $ 3.6 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of his career , averaging more than $ 500 per day since taking office in January 1989 .
This former Democrat has been the bane of progressives since his signing onto the Bush war program and his opposition to Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election .
Comments may be addressed to Senator Lieberman via his Senate contact page ( Connecticut residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : senator@lieberman.senate.gov ( CRP : Joe Lieberman ) .
Sicko # 5 : Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine has raised more than $ 1.1 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of her career , averaging more than $ 200 per day since taking office in January 1995 .
Unlike the " Democrats " listed above , Senator Snowe and her junior Republican colleague from Maine , Susan Collins , can perhaps be partially excused for their actions based on the fact that they are Republicans , and are only doing what all Republicans do :
Deny the needs of the poor , working , and middle classes in favor of the wealthy , while pretending in Bush - Palin fashion to be the champions of " Real Americans . "
Nonetheless , comments may be addressed to Senator Snowe via her Senate contact page ( Maine residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : olympia@snowe.senate.gov ( CRP : Olympia Snowe ) .
Sicko # 6 : Republican Susan Collins of Maine has raised almost $ 1.6 million in campaign contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries over the course of her career , averaging more than $ 300 per day since taking office in January 1997 .
Comments may be addressed to Senator Collins via her Senate contact page ( Maine residents only ) or by direct e-mail at : senator@collins.senate.gov ( CRP : Susan Collins ) .
Based on the average daily contributions given here , Paul Blumenthal estimates that in a 70 - day delay in health care reform such as that proposed by the " Gang of Six , " these six senators stand to gain a further total of more than $ 170,000 in contributions from the health , insurance , and pharmaceutical industries , or an average of more than $ 28,000 ( $ 400 per day ) for each senator .
While they and their families remain fully insured throughout this period , many of their less - fortunate constituents including children will remain uninsured and at risk , some will grow ill and be unable to receive care , and some will die unnecessarily .
But that 's not your problem , is it , Senator Sicko ?
Throughout this period of bipartisan " moderate " foot - dragging on health care reform , Americans should be encourged to watch or to re-watch Michael Moore 's film , Sicko , by which the title of this blogpost was inspired ; and which lays bare the reasons why the United States still ranks far below the rest of the developed world in health care for its citizens .
With all due respect to Mr. Moore and his intellectual property rights , I think that the urgency of the moment merits mentioning that Sicko may at present be viewed in its entirety for free at Google Video , a link to which should be sent to anyone who has not yet seen it or who may need to see it again .

When regular coasters are just too boring , why not ride down one in modified inline skates ?
German sportsman Dirk Auer does just that , racing down a huge 2,821 - foot roller coaster in 60 - seconds .
Video after the break .
Only armed with retrofitted inline skates – especially developed for the stunt – and a helmet , the 36 - year - old man reached a top speed of 56 mph .
This is so so so freaking cool : the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has taken pictures of the Apollo landing sites !
Holy Haleakala !
LM diagram from Wikipedia
That ’s EXACTLY how I pictured it would look .
That picture shows the lower half of the Lunar Module , the part that stayed behind on the Moon when Armstrong and Aldrin blasted back up off the surface .
It was essentially dead weight , so the LM was designed to split in half , with the top half ( the aptly - named Ascent Module — click on the diagram on the right for details ) going back up into orbit to meet with Michael Collins in the Command Module .
From there they returned to Earth .
The Descent Module is about 4 meters or so across , and the image , above taken when the Sun was low on the horizon , clearly shows the DM and its shadow cast across the lunar surface .
The region where they landed was fairly smooth , so the module is the only thing large enough in the image to cast an appreciable shadow .
Wow .
Look at that !
Physical , tangible evidence that human beings walked on the surface of the Moon .
And not just that : we did it again and again .
Behold !
That ’s the Apollo 14 landing site , and you can see where the lunar surface was disturbed by the astronauts bootprints !
Some of that may also be tracks from a wheelbarrow - like device called the Modularized Equipment Transporter which Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell used to help them carry equipment and samples to and from the lander .
Oh man oh man oh man !
And mind you , these pictures are not even the highest resolution LRO can provide ; future observation will have twice this much detail !
I love this .
Not because I needed proof we went , of course .
But there is just something about seeing new pictures after all these years .
Apollo may seem like ancient history , but those artifacts on the Moon are still sitting there , in many ways as fresh as the day they were placed there .
In all of human history , there are many dividing lines we can arbitrarily assign .
Before and after the use of atomic weapons , before and after the invention of the light bulb , before and after this war or that .
But there is one dividing line that can inspire us , fill us with wonder , make us dream of bigger goals , higher aspirations , better ways to live our lives for the future .
And that is the dividing line between the time we were a race shackled to the ground , confined to a single planet … and the time a human being stepped foot on another world .
And there it is , in pictures and in fact .
This is what these pictures mean .
We humans spend a lot of time looking around , looking out , looking down .
But sometimes , for just a brief moment , we look up .
We did it once before , and it ’s time to do it again .
The open source PostgreSQL database is out with a new release today that introduces new administration and database features for users .
In total , PostgreSQL 8.4 includes 293 enhancements from the previous 8.3 release , an update that was primarily centered around performance .
" There is no performance change [ that ] affects all users equally across the board , " PostgreSQL project core team member Josh Berkus told InternetNews.com .
" However , there are several changes with dramatically improve performance for several specific common use cases . "
The new PostgreSQL release comes at a critical time in the open source database market , as rival MySQL is about to be absorbed into Oracle as part of its acquisition of Sun .
While it 's unclear how MySQL may change from its new association with the proprietary database giant , the powers behind PostgreSQL are n't sitting still .
Among the new changes in its new release are improvements to some complex reporting queries , which could improve performance by as much as 400 percent , according to Berkus .
Database restoration is also accelerated in the new release , with a Parallel Restore feature that Berkus said could speed up loading a new database , or migrating an existing one , by as much as eight times -- depending on the number of processors a user has .
From twisted testicles to babies electrocuted in the womb , Tasers are presenting emergency departments with unprecedented injuries , a paper by a New Zealand doctor shows .
Tasers , which are being introduced into New Zealand and Australian police forces as an alternative to firearms , paralyse a person by delivering electrical pulses through metal barbs shot from a gun .
Former Wellington doctor Megan Robb , an emergency medicine registrar at Townsville Hospital in Queensland , led a review of 86 international medical studies on Tasers , dealing with heart and respiratory problems , drugs , alcohol , pregnancy and trauma .
The article , published in the journal of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine , highlights several cases , including :
- A psychiatric patient who removed the barb from his skin and swallowed it .
- A pregnant woman who miscarried after a barb lodged in her abdomen .
- A 16 - year - old boy whose skull was penetrated by the dart .
- A man whose lung was punctured after being shot in the chest .
- Two police officers who suffered compression fractures in their spines from muscle spasms .
- A man who developed a twisted testicle .
Australian police were criticised last week when glue - sniffer Ronald Mitchell , 36 , caught fire and suffered third - degree burns to 10 per cent of his body when he was Tasered .
He had been charging at police with a can of petrol and a cigarette lighter .
A 2006 study by Amnesty International found Tasers were implicated in more than 150 deaths .
However , Dr Robb and her colleagues found that , despite Tasers being used extensively for decades , there was limited research into their implications for those most likely to be shot , such as the mentally ill , those under the influence of drugs and violent offenders .
" The Taser is not likely to be used on normal , healthy resting adults , where much of the research has been performed . "
Emergency departments could expect to see more patients who had been Tasered , and it was important for doctors to be aware of those at higher risk of complications , Dr Robb said .
After a year - long trial , Tasers were introduced fully in Auckland and Wellington in December and are being introduced nationwide .
Since December , Tasers have been presented at people 33 times and fired five times .
This month , the threat of a Taser was enough for a branch - wielding man to give himself up to police on the banks of the Waikato River .
Superintendent John Rivers said more than 60 per cent of cases requiring the use of force involved people believed to be affected by alcohol or drugs and 13 per cent involved people having " some kind of mental health crisis " .
" Our preferred tactical option is always communication , but when you have drugs or alcohol involved , the likelihood is that the effectiveness of communication as a tactical option will be diminished . "
Police Association spokesman Chris Cahill said that , although people under the influence of drugs , alcohol or stress were at higher risk from Tasers , those same people were also most likely to die from being physically restrained or shot .
" Our Australian comrades tell us that , nine times out of 10 , just the threat [ of a Taser ] is enough to calm people down .
Once they see the red light on them , they stop . "
He has been called many things , but Harry Potter has never before been accused of promoting vandalism .
Yet the young wizard looks to be the No 1 suspect in a grafitti spree which took place last week in Wauwatosa , a suburb of Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
According to the Chicago Tribune , residents of the town , population 45,000 , awoke to discover that 80 stop signs had been defaced to read " Stop Voldemort " – Potter 's nemesis , to the uninitiated .
The vandal struck just before last week 's opening of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , the sixth film in the series .
So far local police do not have any clear leads , though Captain Jeff Sutter said the handwriting on each sign , applied in permanent marker , looked very similar .
The dark lord 's name has now been removed from every one , but a number will have to replaced at a cost of $ 80 ( £ 48 ) each .
Police were initially hamstrung in their investigations due to some confusion over who Voldemort actually was , until a policeman 's son helpfully explained matters .
" It took a seven - year - old to tell us , " Sutter said .
" We thought it was just some type of new tagger . "
On Launch Pad 39A at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , workers prepare to remove the seal from the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate , or GUCP , on space shuttle Endeavour 's external fuel tank .
A leak of hydrogen at this location during tanking June 12 for the STS - 127 mission caused the mission to be scrubbed at 12:26 a.m. June 13 .
NASA willtry to launch the space shuttle Endeavour on July 11 , nearlya month late , after plugging a potentially dangerous hydrogen gas leak , topmission managers said Wednesday .
Endeavour successfullypassed a leak check during a fueling test at its seaside Florida launch pad today , settingthe stage for a planned 7:39 p.m. EDT ( 2339 GMT ) liftoff toward the International Space Station on July 11 , said Mike Moses , who leads the shuttle ? smission management team .
NASAinitially tried to launch Endeavour on June 13 , then again on June 17 , but the hydrogengas leak in the shuttle ?s external fuel tank thwartedboth attempts .
Engineers pinpointed the leak in a misaligned ground umbilical carrier plate ( GUCP ) on the tank .
Theplate connects to a vent line that siphons excess hydrogen gas safely away fromthe shuttle during fueling .
? This one Ifeel really good about , that we ?ve got that problem licked and we ?re not goingto see another GUCP leak again on the next launch attempt , ?
Moses toldreporters .
Leak fix a success
Engineers replaceda
Teflon seal and realigned the problematic plate using special washers to plugthe leak , which did not reappear during today ?s fueling test at the Kennedy Space Centerin Cape Canaveral , Fla .
? Looks like the tank performed well , ? said Endeavour ?
scommander Mark Polansky via his Twitter page .
Polansky is leading a seven - astronaut crew tasked withdelivering the last piece of Japan ?s massiveKibo laboratory to the International Space Station during a marathon 16 - daymission .
It is NASA ?s third shuttle flight of the year , but the first to thestation since the outpost doubledits crew size to six people last month .
NASA has strictrules on the amount of hydrogen gas that can be near a space shuttle at launchtime because the extremely flammable gas can pose an explosion risk to the shuttleand its astronaut crew .
Duringfueling , the space shuttle ?s external tank is loaded with about 526,000 gallonsof super - cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen .
Some of that hydrogen boilsinto gas over time and must be safely vented away from the shuttle and beharmlessly burned off elsewhere .
Endeavour ? srepaired tank passed today ?s test with flying colors , mission managers said .
" Therewere absolutely no leak indications whatsoever noted on the two leakdetectors , " said NASA launch director Pete Nickolenko .
" We 'llcontinue to look at the data , and our next step is to move toward launch . "
The Endeavour astronauts are slated to go into quarantine thisweekend and return to their Florida spaceport on Tuesday , Polansky said .
The countdownto Endeavour ?s July 11 launch will begin next Wednesday night , NASA officials said .
Atlantis window work
While oneteam of engineers prepares Endeavour for launch , another is tacklinga window issue on the shuttle Atlantis .
During theshuttle ?s
May flight to the Hubble Space Telescope , a work light knob jammed upagainst a flight deck window pane and dashboard panel .
Initially the knob wasstuck fast , but engineers managed to remove it on Tuesday by pressurizing Atlantis ?
cabin and applying dry ice on the knob .
Moses said techniciansplan to take a mold of the window to see if the knob has caused damage thatwould require replacing the inner window , a potentially lengthy repair that couldsideline Atlantis for up to eight months .
The shuttleis currently slated to launch supplies and parts to the International SpaceStation on Nov. 12 .
? It couldtake a very long time , it sounds very scary , ?
Moses said of any serious repair .?
But then again , I ?ve learned this team is really good at re-sequencing andcoming up with some creative ways to do some work in parallel .?
I enjoy games or better said i enjoyed them .
Now i play from time to time , but there are some classic ones like MariO standard version who are really cool .
Also Hard
Time is a nice one if you have a computer with dedicated video card .
Now many games are on smartphones but is not the same feeling like playing on a keyboard .

We all know it 's hard out here for a pimp .
But apparently it 's not as hard as being an Olympian from New Zealand .

Enlarge AP Photo / Matt Dunham Logan Campbell , in red , desperately wants to win a medal in London in 2012 .
Just ask Logan Campbell , taekwondo athlete , who recently opened a brothel -- perfectly legal where he is from -- to help raise the $ 300,000 he needs to compete in London in 2012 .
According to reports , the 23 - year - old 's father , Max , an auctioneer , had to work two jobs to help pay the $ 150,000 needed to get Campbell to Beijing last year , where he lost to the eventual bronze medalist .
Feeling the need to increase his training in order to compete for a medal , Campbell decided to open the business .
That way , he would n't have to burden his parents any further .
Each one of us faces choices of morality every day of our lives , and those choices are guided by our own individual sense of spirituality , parent / guardian direction and lawfulness .
If Campbell does n't have a problem with running a brothel , and the women do n't have a problem with being prostitutes , and the law of the land says there is no violation , then I do n't understand why John Schofield , the country 's taekwondo funding manager , would say " Selection takes into account not just performance but also the athlete 's ability to serve as an example to the youth of the country . "
Are you kidding me ?
An official from a country with legalized prostitution , sending underfunded athletes to compete in an event ( the Olympics ) that has been tainted by organized crime , steroids and dishonest governments , is suggesting that Campbell is somehow the bad example for kids ?
I loved Campbell 's go - get - 'em attitude so much , I printed out the story and laid it on my 12 - year - old son 's bed with a note saying , " Next time I tell you to water the grass , remember this . "
( Now here 's an example of a son doing what he can to make it easier for his father . )
Of course , my son came to me later holding the sheet of paper , asking , " Dad , what 's a brothel ? "
" Remember those women we saw in Vegas ?
A brothel is where they work . "
" Oh gross , Dad . "
Perhaps .
Listen , I 'm not advocating for prostitution , but I do take every opportunity I can to have healthy conversations about sex with my son , who 's now developing a deeper voice and peach fuzz above his lips .
Avoiding the topic does n't make it go away .
And you would think in a place where prostitution is a legal career option , they would know that .
I actually find it more disturbing that a world - class athlete representing his country is in that position in the first place .
If Campbell does n't make the Olympic team , I hope it 's because he 's been lax in his training , not because a bunch of stuffy Kiwis are trying to save face on the international stage .
After all , talk of sex at the Olympics is far from taboo .
There is an old story from Seoul , back in 1988 , that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the British team 's residential block the night after the swimming competition concluded that the British Olympic Association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex .
Last year as many as 400,000 free condoms were distributed throughout the 100 or so Olympic hotels .
And besides , maybe Campbell 's notoriety is just the PR push New Zealand needs to bolster its tourism industry ?

Intelligence is often used to mean the sort of behaviour that emerges from a collection of individual units , such as birds flocking or ants cooperating , and any book with this phrase in the title would usually be on how to program such behaviour using AI - Artificial Intelligence .
This book is about a different , but perhaps not all together unrelated topic - how you can obtain usual information from the behaviour of Internet users .
It describes the ideas behind such innovations as product recommendations based on previous purchasing or searching patterns that many e-shops offer .
As such its topic is really what might be called by others " data mining " , i.e. discovering patterns that might be useful / valuable in data collected usually for other purposes .
To get into such an area you really need a good grounding in probability theory and statistics , especially so if you plan to innovate .
As such this book can't really hope to get you very far because it tries to introduce some very difficult ideas in a few pages .
Put simply it does n't cover the statistical methods in enough depth for you to really get a working grasp of what is going on and in particular it avoids most of the maths .
Of course , if you really do n't want the maths then this might be a recommendation rather than a criticism .
The book does explain enough of the basic ideas for you to appreciate roughly how they work and to see how they are implemented .
You will find descriptions of simple stats ranging from means and standard deviations to smallest space analysis and regression .
Some AI techniques are also described , including neural networks , clustering and classifiers .
Anyone who knows the volume of literature on these subjects will realise the author can hardly scratch the surface of any of them .
There are even examples of how to implement various techniques using Java code - although I 'm not sure that this level of detail really fits with the book .
If you are trying to cope with the general ideas do you really want to be faced with pages of Java ?
You do if you plan to implement some of the techniques .
Where the book is on target is with its discussion of using the available open tools - Lucene , Nuch , JDM , Weka and so on .
As long as you are the right reader wanting just the right amount of mathematical explanation of the main techniques in use implementing such things as discovering and making use of user likes and dislikes and general user behaviour then this book will be an eye opener .
You will , however , almost certainly need to read around the subject if you want to implement anything groundbreaking .

Square iPhone - based payment system goes into trial
A new paperless payment system that uses an iPhone or iPod touch is currently being trialled in an NYC store .
Codenamed Square , the system involves a small plastic card reader which plugs into the PMP ’s headphones socket ; this is used to read the credit card ’s magnetic stripe , with the price tapped in on - screen and the customer signing with their fingertip .
The customer ’s email address can then be entered , so that their receipt can be sent to them wirelessly .
As the example below shows , the receipt not only records the time , date and value of the purchase , but includes a map with directions back to the store and links to their site .
Square collect a small percentage of the transaction amount plus a fixed fee , as would any card processing company with a traditional card - reader , and the remaining funds are transferred directly into the vendor ’s bank account .
If successful during the trial at Self Edge NYC , it ’s expected to be rolled out to other stores and those requiring straightforward ways to accept mobile payments .

( AP ) -- SPRINGFIELD , Mass . -
Do you use a sock puppet to secretly keep track of your frenemies ?
Plan to spend your staycation watching vlogs and webisodes ?
Or perhaps you plan to signal a flash mob for a quick bite of shawarma .
If you 're not entirely certain what all that means , turn to the latest edition of the Merriam - Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary , which has added about 100 new words that largely reflect changing trends in American society .
John Morse , president and publisher of the Springfield - based dictionary publisher , said many of this year 's new words are tied to changes in technology , increasing environmental awareness and aging baby boomers ' concerns about their health and have become part of the general lexicon .
" These are not new words in the language , by any means , " Morse said .
" ( But ) when words like ' neuroprotective ' and ' cardioprotective ' show up in the Collegiate , it 's because we 've made the judgment that these are not just words used by specialists .
...
These really are words now likely to show up in The New York Times , in The Wall Street Journal . "
There are words such as locavore ( one who eats foods grown locally ) , frenemy ( someone who acts like a friend but is really an enemy ) , waterboarding ( an interrogation technique use to induce the sensation of drowning ) , vlogs ( a blog that contains video material ) and webisode ( a TV show that can be viewed at a Web site ) .
There 's also flash mob ( a group of people summoned electronically to a designated spot at a specified time to perform an indicated action before dispersing ) and green - collar ( involving actions for protecting the natural environment ) .
Some words that just now made the cut have been around for generations .
The term " sock puppet " - a false online identity used for deceptive purposes - was tracked to 1959 but has taken on new popular use with people using fake IDs on social networking sites .
Many words have cross-cultural roots , including shawarma ( a sandwich especially of sliced lamb or chicken , vegetables , and often tahini wrapped in pita bread ) and reggaeton ( music of Puerto Rican origin that combines rap and Caribbean rhythms ) .
Once words like these become so common that they regularly pop up in conversations and published articles , Morse said they pass muster for being included in the dictionary .
Some words , such as " staycation , " have become so popular the dictionary could not ignore them , Morse said .
Staycation refers to staying home for vacation and has gained popularity as the economy worsens .
But Morse said some words face years in limbo as wordsmiths wait to see if they are just fads .
Dave Wilton , author of " Word Myths : Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends , " said it 's difficult to draw conclusions about trends in society with just a handful of new words .
" It 's also an editorial decision and reflects what the ( dictionary ) editors deemed important that year , " Wilton said .
" Most of these words have been around for a while but for some reason they grabbed the attention of editors this time . "
Researchers often keep track of words over many years .
One to watch : prepone .
The word is commonly used in India among English - speaking Indians and refers to the act of arranging for an event to take place earlier than originally planned - the opposite of postpone .
" Prepone did n't make it this time , " Morse said .
" But we know about it . "

Not to take the fun out of it - but maybe they meant Maleficent ?
Nah - your version is so much better .
Over the last four months Joshua Paine and I have been iterating on the design of a layout & view system for the Recess Framework .
The new layout & views are a major part of next week 's 0.2 release .
Recess is an open - source PHP framework .
I know what you 're thinking : how much " design " can you really do in PHP ?
If you can agree that design is the process of taking something raw and making it beautifully functional , then in PHP there 's a lot of opportunity for design .
In the initial release of Recess there was n't much of a story for the front - end , views .
You got plain - old PHP , could plug - in Smarty , or roll - your - own .
Templating / layout / view APIs are hard to design because they 're tremendously important : views and UI dominate the time spent developing most applications .
Rather than taking a swing in the dark I decided to see if anyone in the Recess community would step - up to the plate and knock it out of the park .
To the benefit of Recess users , Joshua Paine did just that .
This is the behind - the - scenes of how Recess ' new templating and layouts came to be , and an interesting look at the evolution of an API .
Design # 1 - " View " Helper : The Swiss Army Knife
The original API work was done by Joshua with a helper class called simply ' view ' ( click above for full example ) .
It invented some abstractions , with inspiration from other libraries , on top of PHP 's output buffering : blocks , slots , & templates .
The original class had 10 static methods around these abstractions in roughly 90 lines of code .
Let 's walk - through some key components of the origina ldesign .
" Blocks " & " Slots "
A concept I fell in love with immediately : blocks and slots .
Blocks fill slots .
Blocks in child templates fill slots in parent layouts .
It was n't too different from other slot - driven layout systems ( Django 's blocks , Rail 's yield , Smyfony 's slots , etc ) but the blocks fill slots idiom was beautiful .
( Aside : Having Blocks in Recess , also a win ! )
Let 's take a look at how they worked :
A Block ' navigation ' in a ' Child ' Template :
Fills a Slot in a ' Parent ' Layout :
The ' navigation ' block in the child template becomes a variable , $ navigation , in the parent layout , and is used to fill a slot .
If no block is provided we can have default contents .
Do you notice an assymetry here ?
Blocks are named with strings , and , with some magic , become variables in the parent layout .
The jump between block ( ' navigation ' ) and slot ( $ navigation ) may feel small , but it was a point we could add symmetry and thus consistency .
So we 've got two leads on improving the design : 1 ) Increase Symmetry , 2 ) Reduce Magic .
A by - product of the magic that turns a block named ' navigation ' to a variable named $ navigation in the parent layout is that in order to know what blocks to pass a parent , you must understand the ' guts ' of the parent ( or parents , with child -> section -> master ) .
This is n't a big deal when you 're writing both concurrently , but when you come back to a project a few months later , or when you 're working on a team , it 's a real pain with complex layouts .
So , we 've got another design improvement lead : 3 ) Do n't expose your guts .
Partial Templates
If you 've used a web framework you 're likely familiar with the notion of ' partial ' templates .
Unlike the Layouts just mentioned that flow from specific to general , Partials flow the opposite direction .
In the following example we 're rendering the ' person / details ' partial template with a $ person :
( Note : The comma should be a => for ' key ' => $ value ) .
The notion of passing a key / value array to a template in PHP is common practice .
In this instance it really hits a nerve .
This is an example of PHP puke .
To pass variables to a partial template you 've now got to know the name and type of the inputs to a partial and match them in a keyed array .
Partial templates , just like functions , take specific inputs .
Why can't I call a partial like a function and pass my parameters in linearly ?
Now , we 've got another lead for a design improvement :
4 ) Partial templates should call - by - contract .
Noise
Finally , there were some methods that did n't really seem necessary : if the pattern of use is that child templates always start and end by extending a parent ( or do n't extend one at all ) then we could remove some noise from the API by making a method like end_template called by the framework instead of the user .
Our final lead for a design improvement :
5 ) Reduce noise & concept - count from user code .
Design # 2 - Layouts : A Simple Pattern
After spending some time with the original system and noting the potential for design improvements I iterated on the original API.
10 methods on 1 class became 8 methods on 2 .
When it comes to an API , if you can accomplish the roughly the same tasks , less is more .
The first , big cosmetic change is in naming : ' view ' is an overloaded term that already has meaning in Recess so the ' view ' helper became the ' Layout ' helper .
Rather than conflating layouts and partial templates , partials got their own helper class : ' Part ' .
Symmetric Slots & Blocks
Let 's attack those weak points in the design .
In the second iteration , the first three leads for design improvement were addressed with a simple change : slots and blocks are both specified using strings .
How did this address each point ?
1 ) Increase symmetry - Now the methods to start slots and blocks both took strings .
No more remembering which one took a string and which took a variable .
2 ) Reduce magic - Variables no longer magically appear in the scope of your parent layout .
The only way to access the shared state from a child template is to ask for it from Layout .
3 ) Do n't expose your guts -
By requiring parent templates use Layout for every slot , it became easy to look at a layout file and know exactly what blocks a child could pass .
You could even use a simple regex to extract the names .
Unfortunately , they 're still scattered throughout the layout so child template developers still have to wade through some guts .
Yes , it 's much easier to do now , but it could be better .
Here 's an example parent layout :
The Assertive Template is Born
How can we make headway on # 4 )
Parts should be call - by - contract ?
An easy way : define parts as functions .
Unfortunately , for view logic this winds up looking pretty ugly in PHP .
It also means you have the mental burden of naming a function .
Sure , you could use a convention based on the file name , but it 's an extra step .
How do functions work ?
They name their inputs in linear order .
How could we name our inputs in linear order ?
We could assert them and their type .
Thus , the assertive template was born .
With a simple regex we can know , for certain , what variables and types a part takes .
Here 's an example :
Here 's how we now render it , compare with view : : template ( ' person / details ' , array ( ' person ' => $ person ) ) ;
This is a big win .
Though we 've increased the cost of implementing a part , we 've simplified the common case of actually using the part .
We 've also hidden some more guts , just like a function , by only needing to know the order and the type of inputs .
We 've also opened the door to higher - order functionality with full - knowledge of a part 's inputs .
I 'll let you dream about the implications ...
Obtuse : Passing Variables with Slots
In the process of improving the design , trade - offs were made .
Trade - offs that had unintended consequences .
The most obvious was in requiring symmetry with blocks and slots the case where you simply wanted to print a slot became excessive :
So there 's room to improve yet , with another lead : # 6 ) Simple should n't be hard .
A more subtle , but more damaging consequence of the second design was that passing variables between child and parent was n't straightforward , passing blocks and slots was .
What I failed to realize at the time , but Joshua did immediately , was in bringing symmetry to the great ' blocks fill slots ' abstraction complicated the plain - old - PHP .
While looking at how I had resolved # 5 ) reduce noise & concept count from user code , by removing the need for template_end in user code ( or , now extendEnd ) he had an epiphany and another lead for a better design : # 7 )
Slay cute abstractions and simplify , simplify , simplify .
Design # 3 : Who Needs Slots ?
Same Scope Minimalism .
From 10 methods to 8 and now to 4 .
No more slots !?
Tomorrow we 'll dive into how Joshua turned the problem on it's head and simplified everything .
Was it too simple ?
We 'll address this in the 4th and the final design of Recess ' view and templates system in 0.20 version launching next week .
Stay tuned ...

When the Family Research Council signed the National Organization For Marriage to sponsor the " New Media Row " at their upcoming Values Voters Summit , we can't imagine that this is the sort of new media result that FRC was hoping to experience :
Values Voters Summit Facebook Page [ Organized by NOM ]
And what 's truly interesting about this Facebook FAIL is that NOM has been promoting this VV Summit event on their own official Facebook page since last Thursday morning .
Yet not one person -- NOT ONE PERSON -- has come over to register their attendance , or voice even an ounce of support for the VV Summit 's agenda .
But in NOM 's defense : Maybe when FRC said " New Media Row , " Maggie Gallagher and Brian Brown thought FRC was imitating a Brit telling them to get into a contentious row with the very concept .
** UPDATE : Now up to 330 non-attendees .
Still a whopping 0 yes or maybes .
Your thoughts
Since coming out in 1969 I have witnessed the extraordinary progress in the march toward our goal of full equality .
And with the pace of that progress accelerating , the final outcome is certain .
So I often find myself wondering how anti-gay groups and their people will reinvent themselves after the battle is over .
Where will one go for employment with a resume that shows the last 15 years of work experience as a Professional Bigot , or a Gay - Bashing Specialist , or the president of a hate - group .
Perhaps NOM will become the driving force behind National Obesity Month , and Maggie Gallagher will be their poster woman .

Richard ... that 's just what FAUX news said about the new Surgeon General ... does n't sound any better from our side .

Oh please .
the Fox News thing about the Surgeon General is just a nasty talking point .
But it does bring up a point .
Let 's focus on the lying arguments of those who oppose us and not their physical attributes .
Truth be known - I 've closed up a few buffet restaurants myself .
Posted by : a. mcewen | Jul 21 , 2009 8:31:09 PM
NOM really is ringing hollow these days .
I 've noted in the last couple public events in RI they could barely muster up a half dozen people to the 300 to 500 we could muster .
And please do n't get my started on Fox News .
My father is a faithful watcher and repeats their talking points ad infinitum .
I of course have to call him on it saying the biggest beneficiaries of the so called socialist movement are his fucking generation .

“ We literally looked at every option we could think of , with several key parameters in mind , ” said Emil Jacobs , vice president for research and development at Exxon ’s research and engineering unit .
“ Scale was the first .
For transportation fuels , if you ca n’t see whether you can scale a technology up , then you have to question whether you need to be involved at all . ”
He added , “ I am not going to sugarcoat this  this is not going to be easy . ”
Any large - scale commercial plants to produce algae - based fuels are at least 5 to 10 years away , Dr. Jacobs said .
Exxon ’s sincerity and commitment will almost certainly be questioned by its most galvanized environmentalist critics , especially when compared with the company ’s extraordinary profits from petroleum in recent years .
“ Research is great , but we need to see new products in the market , ” Kert Davies , the research director at Greenpeace , said .
“ We ’ve always said that major oil companies have to be involved .
But the question is whether companies are simply paying lip service to something or whether they are putting their weight and power behind it . ”
But if it proves a bona fide effort , Exxon ’s move into biofuels , long the preserve of venture capital firms and biotech start - ups , could provide a big push to the Obama administration ’s policy of encouraging more renewable energy .

After several rough years , Canada 's Eugenie Bouchard is enjoying a September surge .
It will mark Bouchard 's first appearance in the third round of a Grand Slam since the world 's 168th - ranked player won two matches at the 2017 Australian Open .
A former world No. 5 after reaching the Wimbledon final in 2014 , Bouchard 's ranking has tumbled in recent years , falling below No. 300 at one point .
I have very few rules in life .
Do n't eat ice cream right before bed , unless you want heartburn .
Do n't watch Jimmy Fallon right before bed , unless you want heartburn .
And never , ever , under any circumstances , get high and drunk on a Monday night and have a threesome with another dude and a chick from Niwot named Serena -- especially if Serena looks like the type of girl a Springer Show producer would stop on the street , and especially if Serena 's six - month - old is sleeping nearby .
It 's a rule I 've managed never to break over the years , unlike that damn Fallon rule .
But , as the Post and every other outlet reported this week , two local men recently showed they just did n't have the restraint .
As you can imagine , it did n't end well .
It all went down early Tuesday morning , after a night of drinking undisclosed amounts of alcohol and doing undisclosed sorts of drugs .
I 'm guessing bucket - loads of whiskey and cocaine , but it could have been troughs full of Miller High Life and meth .
They 're trivial details , really .
What matters is that at some point in the night , Mrs. Brooks decided it would be a good idea to allow two men named Ruffin ( her husband ) and Clint ( not her husband ) to have sex with her .
Now most guys -- and certainly every guy named Clint -- aspires to have a threesome in his life , or at least would n't turn one down .
But this , friends , was what us straight folk call " not the cool kind " -- a threesome of the two - guy - one - girl variety that has very little upside .
And at some point in the rendezvous , something clearly went awry .
Parts touched .
Eyes locked .
Swords crossed .
Something went down , and either Clint or Ruffin -- probably both of them , and probably right around the time the drugs wore off -- decided their manhood had been threatened .
They started fighting , rolling around the floor .
Presumably naked .
More parts - touching .
More eye - locking .
More manhood perceived lost .
Now at this point , you have to figure they were on the verge of waking the baby .
And while Serena Brooks will tolerate two half - cocked men sharing her on a Monday night , she will not -- will not ! -- allow those men to wake her sleeping child !
So she stabbed them .
Because , you know , everyone knows the way to break up a fight between two guys who were just moments earlier rochambeauing for the honor of first insertion is not to sit naked on the bed , softly calling them back to your bosom .
No , that would never work .
Everyone knows you have to stab them each in the back .
So this is what she did .
And it worked !
They stopped fighting .
And this , it seems , led directly to what had be the most awkward car ride in the history of awkward car rides , as Clint Cadigan , 27 , and Ruffin Griffin , 28 , drove together to Boulder Community Hospital .
" Dude , that bitch is crazy ! "
" I know , right ?
One minute you 're getting your flute cleaned , and the next minute you 've got a steak knife in your spine ! "
" Seriously !
Hey , you think I should take the highway or surface streets ? "
Upon arriving at the hospital , their wounds were treated and were not considered life - threatening .
But according to authorities , doctors were not able to revive their dignity .
And so , it is with perhaps the least reservation in the history of Shmuckdom that I pronounce Serena Brooks , Ruffin Griffin , Clint Cadigan -- participants in the Threesome from Hell -- this week 's Shmucks of the Week award .
Here 's hoping at least someone got off before the knives came out .

Fingerprints mark us out as individuals and leave telltale signs of our presence on every object that we touch , but what are fingerprints really for ?
According to Roland Ennos , from the University of Manchester , other primates and tree - climbing koalas have fingerprints and some South American monkeys have ridged pads on their tree - gripping tails , so everyone presumed that fingerprints are there to help us hang onto objects that we grasp .
This theory that fingerprints increase friction between the skin and whatever we grab onto has been around for over 100 years , but no one had directly tested the idea .
Having already figured out why we have fingernails , Ennos was keen to find out whether fingerprints improve our grip , so he recruited Manchester undergraduate Peter Warman to test out fingerprint friction and publishes his results in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Because the friction between two solid materials is usually related to the force of one of the materials pressing against the other , Ennos and Warman had to find a way of pushing a piece of acrylic glass ( Perspex ) against Warman 's finger before pulling the Perspex along the student 's finger to measure the amount of friction between the two .
Ennos designed a system that could produce forces ranging from a gentle touch to a tight grip , and then Warman strapped his index finger into the machine to begin measuring his fingerprint 's friction .
But after days of dragging the Perspex along Warman 's fingers and thumbs , it was clear that something was n't quite right .
Instead of the friction between each finger and the Perspex increasing in proportion to the amount that the Perspex® pushed against Warman 's fingers , it increased by a smaller fraction than Ennos had expected .
Ennos realised that instead of behaving like a normal solid , the skin was behaving like rubber , where the friction is proportional to the contact area between the two surfaces .
To check that skin behaves more like rubber than a normal solid , the duo varied the area of each fingerpad that came into contact with the surface by dragging narrow and wide strips of Perspex along Warman 's fingerpads .
They found that the friction did increase as more of the fingerprint came in contact with the surface , so the skin was behaving just like rubber .
Finally , the friction issue was clinched when Warman measured his fingerprints ' surface area .
The area of skin in contact with the Perspex was always 33 % less than if the fingerpads were smooth resulting in the maximum contact area .
Fingerprints definitely do n't improve a grip 's friction because they reduce our skin 's contact with objects that we hold , and even seem to loosen our grip in some circumstances .
So if fingerprints do n't tighten our grasp on smooth surfaces , what are they for ?
Ennos explains that our fingerprints may function in other ways .
They might have evolved to grip onto rough surfaces , like tree bark ; the ridges may allow our skin to stretch and deform more easily , protecting it from damage ; or they may allow water trapped between our finger pads and the surface to drain away and improve surface contact in wet conditions .
Other researchers have suggested that the ridges could increase our fingerpads ' touch sensitivity .
Whatever our fingerprints are for , it seems that the idea that they provide friction for grip is just another urban myth .

Blistering new evidence on why we have fingerprints
CHICAGO -- Dale Tallon helped restore the Chicago Blackhawks from a struggling hockey franchise to a young and talented team that went all the way to the Western Conference finals in May .
On Tuesday , less than two months after that run in the Stanley Cup playoffs , Tallon lost his job as general manager .
His ouster came a week after a missed deadline for sending qualifying offers to restricted free agents prompted the NHL Players Association to file a grievance against the team .
Tallon was placed by Stan Bowman , the son of NHL coaching legend Scotty Bowman .
" I believe we could have done a better job , " team president John McDonough said Tuesday at a news conference that Tallon did not attend .
McDonough said he took ultimate responsibility for the foul - up .
But asked if Tallon would have been removed at this time if not for the incident , he replied : " Probably not . "
Tallon accepted a two - year contract extension to stay on as an adviser .
" Ultimately when a mistake like that is made that is on me , " McDonough said .
" But it is also on me to make sure that mistake does not happen again or that we have the proper channels in place to make sure it does n't happen again . "
Tallon earlier denied that the problem and grievance had caused the Blackhawks to overpay the players , including Kris Versteeg , the team 's top rookie last season .
" It costs us some money on the front end , but we'd be paying this money eventually , " team owner Rocky Wirtz said Tuesday .
Asked what Bowman , who 's in his ninth year with the Blackhawks , brings to the job that Tallon did n't , Wirtz said :
" He 's 36 , Dale is 58 .
We always want younger people .
What he brings is a system in place to get better , " Wirtz said .
Tallon has been a member of the organization for more 30 years , including five as a player , and 10 in the front office .
He was made general manager in June 2005 and under his guidance , the team drafted young stars Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews , traded for scorers Martin Havlat and Patrick Sharp , and signed free agents Nikolai Khabibulin , Brian Campbell and Cristobal Huet .
Bugler among somnambulists
Of all the law - enabled crimes that the ruling elites of the West have perpetrated on their subject populations in the last 40 years , none has been as grave as the demented stuffing of 55 million imported Muslims into Western Europe , another 5 million into the white Anglosphere countries , plus unknown millions of illegals in both .
This has shattered the common cultural , moral and religious social capital of the Euro peoples , dissolves bonds of community and civil society , and led to strife , violence , terrorism and anti-West genocidal plots by Muslims – all of which , we shall argue , could have been avoided had the West remained the West and the East remained where it properly belongs , in the Crescent Moon East .
The Dutch MP Geert Wilders has spoken often of the dangers Europe faces from Muslim colonizers .
He has described a parallel society out of bounds for indigenous Europeans , governed by deeply alien customs , oppression of women , tribal violence , and sharia justice according to a 7th century moral code .
He has cited thousands of mosques across Europe , European cities that are already one - quarter Muslim , Muslim majorities in the under - 18 bracket , and Muslims as 25 % of Europe ’s population by 2020 .
Wilders evokes the self - imposed falsification of the European culture in order to accommodate Muslim sensibilities : the banishment of pigs from children ’s literature and school menus , the avoidance of bedrock Western authors like Voltaire , Diderot and Darwin , and the burying of inconvenient history like the Holocaust .
He has talked about the self - imposed avoidance of prosecuting Muslims for violent crimes against women , homosexuals , Jews , Muslim apostates , the police , bus drivers , even ambulance workers .
Muslims do not come to integrate in Europe , but to force Europe to integrate in Islam .
And the traitor class that rules Europe is happy to oblige , says this European politician .
“ Muslims demand what they call ' respect ' . [ snip ]
Our élites are willing to give in .
To give up .
Surrender .
[ The Netherlands has ] gone from calls by one cabinet member to turn Muslim holidays into official state holidays , to statements by another cabinet member , that Islam is part of Dutch culture , to an affirmation by the Christian - Democratic attorney general that he is willing to accept sharia in the Netherlands if there is a Muslim majority .
[ snip ]
Politicians shy away from taking a stand against this creeping sharia .
They believe in the equality of all cultures . ”
Wilders has become the West ’s bugler , calling Reveille morning , noon and midnight to Western peoples intent on deep torpor even when it ’s time to rise and confront Islam ’s menace .
He has trained the public spotlight on the Koran ’s incitement to hatred , murder , terrorism and submission of the infidel .
Wilders has pointed out that Muhammad , as a warlord , mass murderer and pedophile [ ibid . ] could have given rise only to a religion that doubles as a totalitarian system intent on world domination , holy war , cruel archaic law , slavery of women , and theocracy .
But perhaps the most important part of Geert Wilders ’s wake - up call is in his reminding that there is no such thing as moderate Islam .
To Muslims , every word in the Quran is Allah ’s word and therefore not open to interpretation or amendment .
It is binding for every Muslim for all times , even though it was written by a 7th century barbarian desert dweller .
Not content just to talk , Wilders has produced the film Fitna , to convey the essence of Islam in images .
For this he has been sued by the Dutch Islamic Federation ( NIF ) , with an Amsterdam appeals court ruling that Wilders should face charges of inciting hatred and discrimination .
The judges characterized Fitna as a " one-sided , generalised phrasing characterized by a radical nature , constant repetition and increasing ferocity " .
The court further ruled that Wilders ’s prosecution would not conflict with the right to freedom of expression .
Geert Wilders has been restrained in directing his censure not at Muslims but mainly at the religion of Islam , therefore evading the capital crime of overt “ racism . ”
He has stated , “ I have a problem with Islamic tradition , culture , ideology .
Not with Muslim people . ”
Nevertheless , the white , cowardly dhimmis at the helm of Holland set out to destroy the bugler in their midst , lest he awaken too many of his compatriots .
The rest of the Body Snatcher cabal , from the UN Secretary General to Great Britain ’s horrid Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , to the usual suspects at Newsweek ( taken apart here ) have reacted as expected per the imbedded programming of their Pod chip .
Wilders does not shy from placing the blame where it belongs , “ the sick and evil surrender ideology of cultural relativism . ”
He states further :
“ Muslim immigration is even a source of pride within ruling liberal parties .
Academia , the arts , the media , trade unions , the churches , the business world , the entire political establishment have all converted to the suicidal theory of multiculturalism .
So - called journalists volunteer to label any and all critics of Islamization as a ‘ right - wing extremists ’ or ‘ racists ’ .
The entire establishment has sided with our enemy .
Leftists , liberals and Christian - Democrats are now all in bed with Islam . ”
Wilders sees hope only in the people , abandoned though they are by their elites and opposed by the entire political , legal and media establishment .
He adduces as proof the public opinion shift in the Netherlands relative to the mass immigration of Muslims , the growth of his own PVV party and of immigration restrictionist parties elsewhere in Europe .
And he sees the establishment of an American - style Freedom of Speech and the abolition of “ Hate Speech ” laws as the way for “ the voices of anti-Islamization [ to ] swell like a mighty chorus across Europe . “
Perhaps .
But criticism of the unhinged behavior of the West ’s Muslims may already be seen in the media , and it ’s muddled , timid and obfuscatory .
Eight years after 9/11 , after Theo Van Gogh and the Muslim doctors ’ plot in Glasgow , and the London Subway plot , and the Muslim pizza commandos in New Jersey , and the Pakistani - American Ph.D. in neuroscience and mother of three who worked for Al Qaeda , and numerous other cases of Muslim immigrant foes imbedded deeply in Western science and security institutions , and a Somali with a Canadian passport found dead in August 2008 with a pound of extremely toxic sodium cyanide in a Denver hotel room , and other American Somalis disappearing and resurfacing on the battlefields of Afghanistan , and British Muslims foaming at the mouth at British soldiers returning from Iraq , a Telegraph article about hostile Western Muslims , ends with the silly whimper , “ If the West wants to prevent further terror attacks , we must first distinguish between those who are on our side , and those who are not . ”
This is pitiful , and it ’s 25 years too late .
What about the 60 + million – soon to be 100 million -- legal 1st and 2nd generation Muslims already in the West ?
What about the possibility that it ’s not Islam but Muslims that are the problem ?
After all , 1400 years of following an unchanged totalitarian dogma and marrying each other ’s cousin , and 500 years of disdaining science and creativity , has at least as much to do with the character of a people as its religion does .
The strange dimensions of Bodysnatcherland ( 1 ) can be seen even in Finland .
According to statistics quoted by a Finnish blog , Somalis , who constitute 0.2 % of Finland ’s population , commit 12 % of reported robberies .
The Somali community in Finland , of course , lives at the taxpayers ’ expense just as is does in every Western country where it ’s present .
To import Somalis to such a singularly unmixed white and monocultural nation as Finland is a symptom of a galloping psychopathology .
Not only that ; the Finnish legal establishment actively prosecutes ethnic Finns who publish politically incorrect statements about Islam or Muslims .
A blogger named Seppo Lehto was sentenced to long imprisonment and a large fine for “ incitement against an ethnic group ” and “ disturbing religious worship . ”
To do this , the Finnish Body Snatchers had to dig up a blasphemy law so old that the first attempt to overturn it was made in 1914 .
And now , a Helsinki councilman and blogger Jussi Halla - aho will be tried for blasphemy , for having written that Muhammad was a pedophile .
Predictably , True Finns is the fastest growing political party in Finland .
But who knows how much of the true is left to be rescued .
The mistaken transposition
The Muslim apostate Dr. Tawfik Hamid wrote in “ The Trouble With Islam ” , “ There is much that is clearly wrong with the Islamic world .
Women are stoned to death and undergo clitorectomies .
Gays hang from the gallows under the approving eyes of the proponents of Shariah , the legal code of Islam .
Sunni and Shia massacre each other daily in Iraq .
Palestinian mothers teach 3 - year - old boys and girls the ideal of martyrdom . ”
Hamid , a former Islamic terrorist , states flatly that Islam teaches and promotes violence and that the Muslim majority refuses to condemn Islam ’s barbaric aspects .
He blames the Western ruling elites for their cultural cowardice and appeasement toward their restive Muslim communities , and admonishes :
“ Progressives need to realize that radical Islam is based on an antiliberal system .
They need to awaken to the inhumane policies and practices of Islamists around the world .
They need to realize that Islamism spells the death of liberal values .
And they must not take for granted the respect for human rights and dignity that we experience in [ snip ] the West . ”
I admire the good doctor for his courage , and wonder whether he is imprudent enough to write under his real name .
Theo van Gogh is already dead , Geert Wilders , Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Wafa Sultan live in hiding under armed protection , Bat Ye'or , Hugh Fitzgerald , Christoph Luxenberg ( 2 ) , Ibn Warraq , Ali Sina , Fjordman and others who speak the truth about Islam hide their names or identity , on penalty of death .
But Dr. Hamid ’s and other such prescriptions stipulating that “ progressives ” need , should , must , have to -- awaken , realize , understand , undertake , change etc. amount to nothing but an exercise in polemics .
Body Snatchers will not wake .
Legume pods , whose original biological programming was erased and replaced by an ideology from outer space , cannot awaken .
They have only one pre-programmed command , forward , toward “ progress . ”
They will continue to progress in the manner of the windup toy that waddles forth until it falls off the edge of the table .
The problem is that they have the rest of Western society in tow .
And the proof of how close this society has been towed to the edge is that ethnoconservative parties like Geert Wilders ’s PVV , the Flemish VB , the Swiss SVP and FPS , and civic associations like Pro-Köln and Cities Against Islamization have been waging a valiant and often - losing fight for every inch of ground for over 20 years now , and still suffer stones and brickbats from the very people they are trying to save .
In addition , Western patriots have spent millions of uncompensated man-hours pro bono to enlighten their peoples about the folly of suicide - by - Muslim - immigration .
They run webzines and conferences and write for blogs like Brussels Journal , Gates of Vienna , Jihad Watch , Atlas Shrugs , View from the Right , or burn midnight oil to write books .
This can even take the form of desperate appeals like this .
All to little effect , so far .
Why is all this necessary ?
How could massive Muslim colonization have happened on the continent where monumental battles –- Toulouse ( 721 ) , Tours ( 732 ) , 750 years of the Iberian Reconquista , Manzikert ( 1071 ) , Kosovo ( 1389 and 1448 ) , Lepanto ( 1571 ) , Chocim ( 1621 and 1673 ) and Vienna ( 1683 ) – had been fought for 1000 years to halt Muslim colonization ?
How can this be when there have been hundreds of additional such battles , and heroes such as Marco Antonio Bragadin whose name once every European schoolboy knew ?
A case of collective amnesia so profound that it would allow for the influx of tens of millions of Muslims and the rise of Islam on this continent , that would lead to planned political unions with Turkey and the Maghreb , is no trifling matter .
Jihad is not the cause .
It ’s a symptom .
Aggressively separatist Muslim communities in the West are not the cause .
They are a symptom .
The symptom , in the West , is as old as the Goths and the Huns .
But the disease is as old as the end of the Roman Empire , and before that , the Babylonian one .
Flowering followed by decadence , followed by a partial population replacement with imported barbarians , followed by chaos , internal war , and wilting .
Addressing the solipsistic degeneracy of the American Empire and the despairing self - asphyxiation of post-national Europe are a precondition for disposing of the symptom .
Fighting the symptom as if it were disembodied cannot bring cure , since the body ’s maimed autoimmune system recognizes Islam and Muslims as its own , and its own – the anti-Islamization dissident – as the invading disease .
It should be none of our business whether Muhammad was a pedophile , nor should we be digging for damning quotes in the Koran or making damning movies about Islam .
That we do so is the normal and spontaneous reaction of the scant remains of Western society ’s nearly atrophied autoimmune system .
It ’s the autoimmune rejection of a foreign and deeply incompatible substance , forcibly injected into the West ’s body as though phenol into a vein by the West ’s insane ruling shamans .
Islam is everything bad its critics say it is .
But one who has visited extensively in Muslim countries – and I have – returns home from some of them wishing he ’d been able to import some of their features .
Consider this :
- Which Muslim country is sick enough to encourage immigration by Christians , let alone welfare - consuming Christians , subsidize Christian churches , cower before Christian dissidents who despise their host society and its religion ?
- Which Muslim head of state or potentate is so gelded as to state that if enough of his state ’s subjects want to institute Christian ( or just Western ) jurisprudence instead of the law of the land , he sees no reason to object ?
- Which Muslim country is lunatic enough to adopt on a wide scale the prima facie madness of denying the most obvious truths about racial , gender and cultural differences – and spending trillions ( in euros , dollars , anything ) to build a sham palace of cards in public education , employment and immigration based on those mad presuppositions ?
- Which Muslim society is stupid enough to fail to understand how profoundly it differs from the West and from the West ’s “ infidel ? ”
Which is ravaged by the Western virus to such an extent it fails to understand that its identity , its soul , depends on a vigilant rejection of the West ’s culture and values , while recognizing that its economic wellbeing depends on playing a game of cooperation ?
- Find a single Muslim head of state who goes out of his way to explain that Christianity is the religion of peace , and that Crusader really means someone who likes to cruise .
- Show me a Muslim country crazy enough to place its foreign relations , security and military matters in the hands of women , or to put women in the combat units of its military .
- Take a walk on the beach in Qatar or Abu Dhabi at 2 AM , and observe how a crowd of families with little children picnics happily and safely under the open skies .
Then go back to Marseille or Rotterdam , Coney Island or Santa Monica , bring your wife and kids and two sets of old parents for a 2 AM picnic on the beach , and see what happens .
This does not imply that Islam is the cure for the West ’s ills .
The West has its own nonpareil system of recognizing and acknowledging reality .
It ’s called empiricism .
The West had its own immune mechanism , its own unequalled culture , its own historical laboratory where the tried turned true .
And all these were better than what Islam offers .
But we have allowed our own ruling elites to destroy these mechanisms here , whereas the Muslims preserved theirs .
Some measure of respect is called for , concomitant with recognizing how indispensable it is that the West shake off its entire Mad Legume top layer .
The bugler in the steeple
Europe has another bugler , on its eastern flank .
And were the soul and brains of the Western peoples less contaminated by their own elites , this is all the discussion about Islam and all the self - defense from Islam that the West would need .
Every hour , on the hour , a bugler climbs to the steeple of the Church of St. Mary in Krakow , and plays the dirge .
The dirge is cut off abruptly mid-note .
This commemorates a mid-13th century bugler who saved Krakow from being overrun by Muslim Tatar hordes from the Asian steppes .
Standing high in the tower of the grand church , the bugler saw a large force of Tatar invaders approaching on horseback toward the royal city , and gave the alert to close the gates .
In the middle , a Tatar arrow pierced his throat .
Once a day , at noon , this dirge , cut off as though by a Mohammedan ’s arrow , is transmitted by Polish radio throughout the country .
The radio transmission has been going on daily since 1927 , but the dirge has been heard in Krakow daily since at least 1399 , with only a half - century pause in the late 18th century .
This is how a European people remembers the meaning of Islam .
G.K. Chesterton , who admired Poland as the staunch eastern bulwark of the Christian West , said that the “ St. Mary ’s dirge ” was for him the call of a besieged civilization .
And so it is .
Poland is nowadays quite relaxed about Islam .
But there are only 25,000 Muslims living among a population of 38.5 million .
Of those , about 5,000 are descendants of some 13th century Tatars who tired of the nomadic Mongol existence and asked for permission to settle .
They were useful as a superb light cavalry , so successive Polish kings granted them citizenship privileges .
The Tatars in turn fought in many wars for the Christian country that had given them shelter .
It ’s all a question of scale and common sense .
If 600,000 + instead of 60 + million Muslims were living in the West , there would have been no renascence of jihad .
In turn , there would have been no Muhammad cartoons or Christian “ blasphemers ” of the Koran either .
There is no harm in accepting a small number of useful foreign exotics , even as different as the Tatars .
The madness begins when a mental virus erases the distinction between a Mongol Muslim nomad and a European Christian pipefitter .
The European West has succumbed to this madness .
The European East has not .
It ’s in the East where one can find proof that Europe used to be sane relative to Islam .
In Kamieniec Podolski , once part of Poland and now Ukraine stands the Polish Cathedral of SS Peter and Paul .
In 1672 , a large Turkish army under Sultan Mehmet IV invaded the area and conquered the Kamieniec Podolski fortress ( 3 ) .
The Turks then converted the Catholic cathedral into a mosque and appended a minaret to it .
But 27 years later , following a defeat of the Turks and their allies in that area at the hands of Jan Sobieski , plus more of the same in 1683 Vienna , in 1699 the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Karlowitz .
As part of the treaty , the land of Podolia , and with it Kamieniec Podolski , returned to Poland .
And the Turkish mosque returned to Christians .
They respected their foes and left the minaret intact .
But they topped it with a 4.5 m gilded statue of St. Mary .
It stands like this to this day , while in Western Europe churches are turned into shelters and community centers for Muslim colonizers .
Separationism
Because of that bugler from Krakow , and the childhood tales of my countrymen ’s 450 years of nearly incessant fighting against the armies of jihad , I do n’t need to read books about the nefariousness of Islam .
I do n’t need to see Fitna .
I knew all I needed to know at the age of seven , as do many boys in Eastern Europe to this day , because they are taught their history .
And what I have known since childhood is that separation and robust deterrence are the only answer .
Not hate , not disrespect , not tilting at delusional windmills that Muslims should , want to , or can be like the West .
Just separation .
The doctrine of separation from Islam has several champions now , who differ in some details but all agree on what that Polish bugler expressed in 1241 : close the city gates .
Lawrence Auster defined Separationism as per these points :
Islam is a mortal threat to our civilization .
We cannot destroy Islam .
We cannot democratize Islam .
We cannot assimilate Islam .
Therefore the only way to make ourselves safe from Islam is to separate ourselves from Islam .
What this separation entails is a subject that Islam experts like Hugh Fitzgerald , and truthful thinkers about the condition of the West like Fjordman , Lawrence Auster and Srdja Trifkovic have written much about .
Other worthy commentators like Steve Sailer and Diana West have also put forth worthy ideas .
What emerges from these is the uniform perception of Islam ’s menace , the epochal mistake of opening the West to Muslim immigration , and the plan to reverse the tide .
In the aggregate , the main points are :
1. Complete stop to all immigration from Muslim countries .
2. Offering financial inducements to legal Muslim residents to return to their ancestral countries .
3. Deportation of all criminal immigrants even if citizens .
4. Deportation of all illegal immigrants .
5. Closing of Wahhabi mosques and Salafi - linked institutions .
6. Ethnic profiling of Muslims and surveillance of mosques and of Muslim employees in sensitive positions .
7 . More severe penalties for terrorist and seditious activities , with ostensibly “ religious ” activities like advocating for sharia , preaching jihad or even the soft jihad of “ conquering the West with the power of the womb ” defined as sedition .
8 . Much tighter border controls .
9. Cessation of all welfare payments to immigrants .
10 . Cessation of involvement in the internal affairs of Muslim countries .
11 . Cessation of foreign aid and all “ help ” to Muslim countries .
12 . Military disengagement from Muslim countries , while erecting forward military posts on the perimeters of the Muslim world .
13 . Punitive military strikes against regimes that harbor and abet terrorists , but without the deluded occupation and " nation building " that followed such strikes against Afghanistan and Iraq .
Needless to say , there is n’t any chance this agenda can be implemented , except after the criminal lunacy of the ruling Pods has led to more terrorist attacks by jihadis , civil wars and perhaps worse .
And so , while all these ideas are wise , proper and warranted , at a certain level Separationism is a theoretical exercise , based again on the premise of “ ought , ” “ should , ” “ have to ” and “ must ” relative to both the rulers and the majority of the Western population that not only have n’t the slightest intention of following such imperatives but regard their issuers as evil .
Geert Wilders , a politician whose job is to win elections , has tried to offer some anti-Islamization measures mild ( and ineffective ) enough to be acceptable to the electorate in his super - liberal country .
Yet , his Klare Wijn platform in 2005 that included these milquetoast measures was deemed “ implausible ” by a margin of 53 % in public polls .
Upon receiving the Kluge Prize in 2003 in the U.S. Library of Congress , the distinguished Polish philosopher , Leszek Kolakowski , gave a speech entitled What the Past Is For in which he said :
“ We must absorb history as our own , with all its horrors and monstrosities , as well as its beauty and splendor , its cruelties and persecutions as well as all the magnificent works of the human mind and hand ; we must do this if we are to know our proper place in the universe , to know who we are and how we should act . [ snip ]
If we forget [ snip ] , we will be condemning our culture , that is to say ourselves , to ultimate and irrevocable ruin . ”
But we have undergone a massive population replacement , not only through an infusion of some 100 million +
Muslim and other Third World aliens , but also through the replacement of at least 300 million of our own people ’s brains with synthetic legume pods manufactured in true global - economy fashion by the firm Gramsci , Adorno & Said ( 4 ) , whose local franchises have been operating for decades in every school and university in every Western country .
How are we to absorb our history if there is no we ?
How are we to know how to act if we do n’t know who we are ?
Hugh Fitzgerald in particular is a great and prolific educator about the totalitarian and West - unfriendly nature of Islam .
And chipping away like this at the public ’s ignorance and apathy is important , and should continue .
But it cannot possibly bring public sanity in time to prevent further calamities of the West ’s self - dhimmization .
For this reason , the road to “ Atlantis ” we ’ll be charting leads there via a wide detour .
It ’s only when Antipods have established a strong base at that detour , that talk of Separationism will be more than an exercise of the imagination .
Nevertheless , there are two points that I ’d like to add on top of the thirteen .
Be nice .
Separation from Islam and from Muslims , unless the latter commit much further transgressions , should not to be carried out in a spirit of anger .
This is normal self preservation , as mundane as keeping the bull and the bear in separate spaces .
We discarded this common sense due to our own foolishness .
Muslim countries have not .
Muslim citizens of the West who behave lawfully , contribute economically and choose to ignore or battle against the incendiary aspects of their faith , cannot be penalized for the idiocy of their host countries in having allowed them to settle there .
However inconvenient , however costly their continuing residence in the West , the West has no moral right to kick them out , though it has the right to cordon them off from jihadi influence .
The same applies to relationship with Muslim countries .
None of the separationist measures implies , ipso facto , hostility .
Good fences make good neighbors .
What does n’t make good neighbors is if one is aggressively tribal and devious by nature , and the other one is a naïve “ progressive ” floating on fumes of Hope and Change .
It ’s in wresting the keys to its house from the Hope and Change boyz that the West ’s security lies , and not in demonizing the swarthy , ululating neighbor .
Beyond that , it is necessary to recognize that the issue is wider than just Islam .
The issue is the incompatibility and unassimilability of well over 100 million Third - Worlders imported into the West by its Body Snatcher regime , and the lack of any justifiable reason for this population replacement .
The issue is the ethnocide of the Euro peoples by the demented legume pods bobbing on top of the social pool like a red tide of algae choking off the supply of oxygen to the creatures below .
In water ecoscience it ’s called eutrophication .
In political science , maybe a new term is in order , europhication .
Consider this :
In Sydney , the Muslim Brotherhood Movement , a gang of 600 Arabs probably all Australia - born , has been terrorizing the city .
Vying for the title of the toughest street fighting force is another Middle Eastern gang , the Asesinoz .
Then there is the BFL gang and the Notorious gang , the latter distinguished in adding a Pacific Islander component to its Middle Eastern one .
Crime reports from Sydney read like this : “ A man wanted for questioning over the murder of alleged crime boss Abdul Darwiche is the younger brother of Ahmad Fahda , a Razzak family associate murdered in 2003 . ”
This is not Islam at work .
Like the “ youths ” ( les jeunes ) in France , these are simply thugs of Middle Eastern Muslim ethnicity .
The issue here is not Islam but why are there Middle Eastern / Maghrebi Muslim Arabs ( or Pacific Islanders ) in Australia .
While Muslim immigration is by far the most dangerous , America , for instance , is undergoing a process of self - asphyxiation - by - immigration similar to Europe ’s , but with Catholic mestizo colonizers as the chief reason .
Leaving aside frothing supremacist wannabe Nazis , in the entire
West there are at most five names of public resonance who speak up for the right and duty of the countries of the white peoples , with their own gene pool and a great and distinct history and culture anchored in Jerusalem–Athens - Rome , to remain as a cradle of that gene pool and culture .
This is “ racist ” territory , far more dangerous to those who tread there than mere “ Islamophobia . ”
And yet , doom is inevitable unless Western political leaders arise who are reasonable , humane , respectful to other races and cultures , but have the courage to state that if the 60 + million Muslim colonizers of the West were Hindus from Karnataka or ( hypothetical ) Ultra -Orthodox Hassidic Jews , or Africans , their admission into the West still would have been a disastrous mistake and a demographic crime .
As the Sci-Fi writer Philip Dick quipped , Reality is that which , when you stop believing in it , does n't go away .
Either we shall learn to deal with Reality , or we will be gone away .
Reality will remain .

(1) The basic analogy reverts to Part 1 , where we cited the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers .
In the film , alien “ Body Snatchers ” produce giant legume Pods that replace living people while appearing to be identical to them .
From the Pods develop the new Body Snatchers who cultivate further Pods etc .
I use these terms interchangeably , usually preferring Pods as a catchall term , and Antipod as the antithesis of Pod .
(2) Known only under the pseudonym Christoph Luxenberg , this is a German scholar of Semitic languages whose research shows that the Koran is a pastiche including contemporaneous Christian Syriac passages that ought to be interpreted according to their Aramaic meaning , not their Arabic one , e.g. raisins , not virgins .

NOAA.govAs bad as George W. Bush ’s environmental record was , W. at least got around to acknowledging that climate change is real and human - caused before leaving office .
Yet his little brother , former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , remains a global warming skeptic .
That ’s what he told Esquire recently in a piece that centers on Bush ’s presidential prospects .
Now that three of the top contenders for the Republican nomination – Sarah Palin , Mark Sanford , and John Ensign – are self - destructing , Jeb Bush is looking like he might be the party ’s last best hope in 2012 .
Here ’s the bit of interest to Grist readers , in which he repeats some familiar skeptic talking points :
Do you believe global warming is primarily man-made ?
I ’m a skeptic .
I ’m not a scientist .
I think the science has been politicized .
I would be very wary of hollowing out our industrial base even further …
It may be only partially man-made .
It may not be warming by the way .
The last six years we ’ve actually had mean temperatures that are cooler .
I think we need to be very cautious before we dramatically alter who we are as a nation because of it .
A Chicago mom lived her worst nightmare earlier this week when she was forced to leave her 10 month old baby on the train after her 3 - year - old bolted .
The woman ’s 3 - year - old bolted out the open doors and she went after him , then turned around to see the doors close and the train take off north towards .
She then immediately called police who called ahead , met the train and recovered the baby , who was unhurt .
Another passenger , who was waiting at the station , said conductors held up the train until police arrived .
“ They went on board and brought the baby off in a stroller .
The baby was awake and alert , just looking around , nice and peaceful , ” he said .
He said he initially feared the baby , which was in a stroller with “ Pampers and other supplies ” had been abandoned and said he was glad everything turned out OK .
The baby was handed over to the mother and she went home .
Everyone in the situation should be commended for their quick thinking .
Even though this mom made the right choice running after her toddler , no one ever wants to be put in the predicament of having to choose .
Disaster was bound to happen either way .

About this time of year I get a few calls from people saying that they have trees growing out of their gutters .
Many times during a gutter cleaning estimate I 'll jokingly ask if I can keep any tomatoes I find up in the gutters .
All joking aside , Cleaning of the gutters is often the most overlooked maintenance issue on a home .
Why ?
Well it 's pretty simple really .
Most of the time when it 's raining people are rushing into the home to keep from getting wet and are not really scoping out the functionality of their gutters .
When it 's not raining , if there is nothing growing out of them , how would one know if they were plugged ?
They Would n't .
Simply put however , if your gutters are full of debris they are not going to work and they could actually cause more harm than good to your home and family .
let 's examine the reasons for cleaning .
First there is the most obvious reason .
If the gutters are full and the drains are plugged they defeat the purpose of having gutters in the first place .
Water will just overflow and cause damage to your landscaping and to the gutter system itself .
The weight of the water in the gutter will cause it to pull away from the home and eventually fall off .
Wood rot :
If the drains are plugged , water could sit in the gutters for weeks .
If you have wooden gutters or fascia , these areas will rot first .
Secondly , wherever your gutters are overflowing , the splash - back effect will cause doorways , garage doors , and low to the ground siding and decks to rot .
Mosquito infestation .
Mosquitoes love stagnant water .
If your gutters are plugged they can be an oasis for mosquito larvae to grow and hatch .
This can be detrimental to the health and well being of your family and pets as mosquitoes are known carriers of many diseases .
Ice -dams : Lastly ,
If your gutters are plugged up when winter sets in , you could be risking thousands of dollars of damage to your home .
Ice will fill up the gutters first and then begin to creep up your roof .
Once it gets past the ice shield beneath your roof ( assuming you have one ) the ice will begin to melt from the rising heat in your home .
Once it begins to melt it will come through your ceilings and walls and it will destroy any finishing you may have on them .
If left un-attended this water could destroy your floors and cause considerable mold within the home .
When should you clean your gutters ?
The average home should be cleaned at least twice a year May / June in the spring after all the little seedlings fall or November / December as winter approaches .
Most people like to wait until every last leaf falls before they clean their gutters and this could spell trouble if you should get a sudden cold snap or snowstorm .
Wait until the leaves are about 80 % down and then clean unless prolonged warmer weather is expected .
If you live in the southern states however you may want to clean your gutters up to four or five times a year .
Pine trees shed year round and can be a particular nuisance when it comes to keeping your gutters clean .
I recommend keeping them away from your home if at all possible .
Should you consider gutter guards ?
I personally do not recommend gutter guards of any kind in the northern states .
Most guards facilitate ice buildup and create nice niches for birds and squirrels .
Most guards do n't work anyways .
Stuff gets in the gutters and then they complicate the cleaning process .
You have to remove the guards to clean what they are supposed to keep out in the first place and then you have to re-install them .
Many times they will be misshapen or damaged when you remove them and will not re-install properly .
This just amounts to more money out of your pocket .
If you live in the southern states however I would recommend Gutter Helmet .
http://www.gutterhelmet.com/
while these guards are pricey , they do work in warmer climates .
Still , regular cleaning will keep you in touch with the rest of your homes exterior as well .
When you are cleaning your gutters you will notice the condition of your roof , paint , siding , chimney , venting and landscaping .
How do you clean your gutters ?
This can be very simple or it could be very , very dangerous .
If you do not have or are not willing to invest in the proper equipment or if you are over 60 years of age I recommend that you hire a professional .
I cannot stress this point enough .
I once received a gutter cleaning contract because a gentleman who could not reach the gutter above his porch roof chose to stack two milk crates on top of one another and stand on top of them .
He fell to his death on the sidewalk below .
When his widow found out that I would have cleaned them for about $ 200 she broke down in tears .
These are the things you will need to clean the gutters on your home . :
If your home is two or three stories high you will need an extension ladder with a stabilizer .
If it is a single story home you will need a heavy duty height appropriate stepladder .
Remember , the heavier duty your ladder , while maybe cumbersome , the safer you will be .
You will also need , a five gallon pail with a painters hook , a 3 " putty knife , some tight fitting work gloves , a gas handheld leafblower ( The lighter the better . ) a cordless screw gun and some trash bags .
From here it 's pretty simple .
You set your ladder up so that it is stable .
If you are using a stepladder never ever stand on the top step or the one below it .
I have fallen about five times doing this and still have n't learned my lesson .
Climb the ladder with your bucket and putty knife , scrape out whatever debris is in the gutter , place it into your bucket and move on to the next spot .
As you fill each bucket empty it into one of your trash bags .
Sometimes gutters will be filled with nothing more than the grit from the asphalt shingles .
If this is the case use the blower and blow out as much as you can .
It is important to remove this sediment as it builds up considerable weight over time .
Once you get to the drains you can be sure they are clean by dropping a stone down the drain and watching to see if it comes out below .
If it does not then there is probably a blockage in the elbows at the top or near the bottom of the drain .
You will have to use your cordless drill to dis-assemble the drain to clean it properly .
Remember the drains are the most important part of your gutter system .
Without them the water has nowhere to go .
Once you have cleaned your gutters entirely it 's good to blow out any residual dust with the blower if the debris is dry .
If the debris in your gutters is wet you may not want to do this as you could blow mud and disgusting debris all over the place .
If you have wooden gutters it is important to treat them with linseed or val oil at least once a year .
You can brush these products on or mix them with paint thinner to run them through a pump sprayer .
Once you are done be sure to check all the bottoms of your drains to be sure they are clear .
If your drains go into an underground drainage system tap on each pipe and listen for a hollow sound .
If it sounds hollow you 're good .
If it sounds full than you will have to abandon the underground system and possibly replace the drain .

Confidential documents showing the flight plans of a CIA " ghost plane " allegedly used to transfer a British resident to secret interrogation sites around the world are to be made public .
The move comes after a Sussex - based company accused of involvement in extraordinary rendition dropped its opposition to a case against it being heard in court .
Lawyers bringing the case against Jeppesen UK on behalf of the former Guantánamo Bay detainee , Binyam Mohamed , claimed last night the climbdown had wide - ranging legal implications that could help expose which countries and governments knew the CIA was using their air bases to spirit terrorist suspects around the world .
Jeppesen UK , a division of the Jeppesen Corporation , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Boeing , is alleged to have provided a range of services that allowed planes owned by shell companies operating on behalf of the CIA to fly suspected terrorists to " black sites " .
Jeppesen is alleged to have provided flight planning services , secured permits for travel , arranged fuel provision and filed flight plans for the clients in the knowledge that the planes were being used for extraordinary rendition .
" Jeppesen 's embarrassing U - turn vindicates our fight to expose corporate collusion in torture , " said Clive Stafford Smith , director of the legal charity Reprieve , which has led the campaign on behalf of Mohamed .
" Binyam Mohamed , and perhaps many others , are one step nearer to making the directors of companies stop and think before they commit criminal acts for profit . "
According to an affidavit signed by a former employee , Jeppesen 's managing director , Bob Overby , told his staff that " we do all the extraordinary rendition flights " .
Sean Belcher , a former technical writer for the company , said Overby claimed that the CIA " spared no expense " when it came to paying for Jeppesen 's services .
Jeppesen contends there is " no basis " to the claims against it .
But after Mohamed 's London lawyers , Leigh Day & Co , presented a large volume of evidence - running to 419 pages - which they claim proves the company 's involvement in the rendition process , the British arm of the firm withdrew its attempt to have the case struck out .
In a letter to Mohamed 's lawyers , Jeppesen 's legal representatives , Allen & Overy , state : " Our client ... has undertaken an extensive review of information in order to address and rebut your client 's evidence .
During the course of this exercise it has become apparent that due to the scope and diffuse nature of the evidence ... there is a real risk that the hearing of our client 's application will descend into a ' mini - trial ' ...
In these circumstances , we consider that the most appropriate and proportionate course is for our client to withdraw its application and for the claim to proceed to trial in the normal way . "
A separate case is being pursued against Jeppesen in the US by the American Civil Liberties Union and Reprieve .
The US government is seeking to have the case against Jeppesen dismissed , saying it would breach national security .
But Jeppesen UK 's decision to drop its opposition to fighting the case in a British court means a wealth of confidential information relating to the alleged rendition process will become public .
" We want to know whether Jeppesen UK participated in Binyam 's rendition which led to his torture , " said his barrister , Daniel Leader .
" It is right they should now disclose all the relevant evidence so we can get to the truth . "
Mohamed , an Ethiopian who lived in Britain , was arrested in 2002 in Pakistan and handed to the US .
He alleges that before his transfer to Guantánamo Bay he was held in prisons in Pakistan , Morocco and Afghanistan , beyond the reach of law .
While in Morocco , he alleges that interrogators tortured him by using blades to cut his penis and chest .
Reprieve 's renditions investigator , Clara Gutteridge , said the CIA could not have acted alone and the case would raise questions over which governments were complicit in extraordinary rendition .
Jeppesen did not return calls .
ED # 111 : Checked Your CD - Rs Lately ?
In the past , hard disk drives were small ( in capacity ) and costly .
In 2001 , the largest capacity available in a desktop hard disk drive was just 100 GB .
More importantly , it would set you back about US $ 450 , which was a LOT of money in those days !
Needless to say , most users had to settle for hard disk drives of 20 - 40 GB in capacity .
To make up for the lack of affordable storage , many turned to CD - Rs .
Even with an initial storage capacity of only about 650 MB , the CD - R was cheap and one could buy hundreds of them to offload files stored in the small hard disk drive .
CD - Rs became an even more popular storage medium when larger capacity 80 mins ( 700 MB ) discs became commonplace , and overburning was introduced .
As it became common to store backups and personal pictures , videos , etc. on CD - Rs , the lifespan of these discs became a concern .
According to manufacturers , CD - Rs should last for decades .
Some even quoted an upper limit of 120 years based on accelerated aging tests !
That sure is a long time , is n't it ?
But will CD - Rs really last that long ?
Update @ July 24 : Added both a new page detailing some tips on improving CD - R longevity , and a new page on reader feedback .
We also increased the results to 208 CD - Rs .
Update @ August 4 : Added 154 additional CD - Rs dating from 1999 till 2003 , and revised the article to reflect the updated results .
Update @ August 25 : Added 70 additional CD - Rs mostly dating from 1999 and 2003 , and revised the article to reflect the updated results .
Time To Go Back To The HDD
Recently , I started porting my archive of over 300 CDs to the hard disk drive .
Not only have hard disk drives really expanded in capacity ( 2 TB per drive and still growing ! ) , they have also dropped a lot in cost per GB of storage , making them one of the cheapest storage options available today .
The biggest advantage , of course , is much easier access to the files as you no longer have to look for the CD / DVD containing the files you want and load it into the CD / DVD drive .
How Many Were Still Working ?
Interestingly , this exercise also led me to examine the reliability of CD - Rs , as I had never actually thought about their lifespan until now , especially since the oldest CD - R dated only to 1999 .
That 's only 10 years old .
I had also taken the trouble to keep them in a cool , dark place .
However , the results of the 362 CD - Rs were really surprising .
Take a look .
Vintage Total
Number Corrupted Difficult
To Read 1999 27 5
( 18.5 % ) 2
( 7.4 % ) 2000 17 1
( 5.9 % ) 1
( 5.9 % ) 2001 149 9
( 6.0 % ) 4
( 2.7 % ) 2002 162 5
( 3.1 % ) 0
2003 77 5
( 6.5 % ) 14
( 18.2 %)
Do note that a CD - R is considered " corrupted " as long as one or more files in the CD - R can not be read .
Discs are labelled as " difficult to read " if it cannot be read by one of the two CD / DVD drives we used for the tests .
Also , this is n't a properly " calibrated " test in that the samples are based on a mixed bunch of CD - Rs - from cheap no - brand CD - Rs all the way to premium Kodak , Ricoh and Imation CD - R media .
Of the corrupted CD - Rs , many of them only had a few files corrupted , but five of the CD - Rs were completely unreadable .
Neither one of the two CD / DVD drives we used could even recognize the CD - Rs , much less read anything off them .
After testing over 430 CD - Rs , a pattern has emerged .
The rate of failure progressively grew worse over time .
The oldest discs , a full decade old , were incredibly bad .
They had an extremely high rate of failure - 18.5 % were unreadable to some extent with another 7.4 % that were difficut to read .
The discs from 2000 were relatively good with a failure rate of just 5.9 % ( with a similar rate for reading difficulty ) .
Of course , those two vintages had the fewest number of samples and the actual results may change radically with a larger sample size .
The failure rate remained steady at 6 % for the discs from 2001 corrupted , followed a drop to just 3 % in 2002 .
However , the failure rate increased in 2003 to 6.5 % with a whopping 18.2 % of the discs difficult to read .
It is rather surprising that CD - Rs that were just 6 - 7 years old were experiencing such failure rates .
The brand of CD - Rs used appears to have some effect on their reliability .
Branded CD - Rs from the likes of Kodak , Ricoh and Imation were generally more reliable than cheap , no - brand CD - Rs .
The latest batch of no - brand CD - Rs from 2003 were the main reason for the marked increase in the number of discs that were unreadable or we had difficulties reading .
However , buying premium CD - Rs was no guarantee of reliability either .
A significant number of premium CD - Rs still failed after just a few years in ideal storage conditions ( cool , dark and dry ) .
So buying CD - Rs based on brand alone is no guarantee they will last even a decade .
What Does This Mean ?
It should be pretty obvious by now - CD - Rs do n't last forever .
Although manufacturers may quote lifespans of decades in length , they are unlikely to last more than a few years .
Our simple test showed that even when stored properly , CD - Rs that were just 6 - 7 years old were failing at a significant rate .
Of course , how significant it is to you would depend on whether you used CD - Rs to store replaceable files ( downloaded media ) or critical files ( family photos and videos ) .
Now , we are not saying that all CD - Rs will fail within a few years .
It is likely that some could potentially still be readable decades from now .
However , you can bet your last dollar that at least a percentage of your CD - Rs will fail after a few years .
So what 's the moral of this article ?
If you have something important to keep , back up OFTEN and use MULTIPLE storage options !

It 's hard to grab attention in our fast - paced world !
" Free gift inside ! "
" Dear Jim , You have been specially selected . "
" Calling all Parents . "
Every day we 're bombarded with headlines like these that are designed to grab our attention .
In a world full of advertising and information – delivered in all sorts of media from print to websites , billboards to radio , and TV to text messages – every message has to work extremely hard to get noticed .
And it 's not just advertising messages that have to work hard ; every report you write , presentation you deliver , or email you send is competing for your audience 's attention .
As the world of advertising becomes more and more competitive , advertising becomes more and more sophisticated .
Yet the basic principles behind advertising copy remain – that it must attract attention and persuade someone to take action .
And this idea remains true simply because human nature does n't really change .
Sure , we become increasingly discerning , but to persuade people to do something , you still need to grab their attention , interest them in how your product or service can help them , and then persuade them to take the action you want them to take , such as buying your product or visiting your website .
The acronym AIDA is a handy tool for ensuring that your copy , or other writing , grabs attention .
The acronym stands for :
Attention ( or Attract ) .
Interest .
Desire .
Action .
These are the four steps you need to take your audience through if you want them to buy your product or visit your website , or indeed to take on board the messages in your report .
A slightly more sophisticated version of this is AIDCA / AIDEA , which includes an additional step of Conviction / Evidence between Desire and Action .
People are so cynical about advertising messages that coherent evidence may be needed if anyone is going to act !
How to Use the Tool
Use the AIDA model when you write a piece of text that has the ultimate objective of getting others to take action .
The elements of the acronym are as follows :
1. Attention / Attract
In our media - filled world , you need to be quick and direct to grab people 's attention .
Use powerful words , or a picture that will catch the reader 's eye and make them stop and read what you have to say next .

With most office workers suffering from email overload , action - seeking emails need subject lines that will encourage recipients to open them and read the contents .
For example , to encourage people to attend a company training session on giving feedback , the email headline , " How effective is YOUR feedback ? " is more likely to grab attention than the purely factual one of , " This week 's seminar on feedback " .
2. Interest
This is one of the most challenging stages in the AIDA model : you 've got the attention of a chunk of your target audience , but can you engage with them enough so that they 'll want to spend their precious time understanding your message in more detail ?
Gaining the reader 's interest is a deeper process than grabbing their attention .
They will give you a little more time to do it , but you must stay focused on their needs .
This means helping him or her to pick out the messages that are relevant to him quickly – use bullets and subheadings , and break up the text to make your points stand out .
For more information on understanding your target audience 's interests and expectations , and the context of your message , read our article on the Rhetorical Triangle .
3. Desire
The Interest and Desire parts of the AIDA model go hand - in - hand : as you 're building the reader 's interest , you also need to help her understand how what you 're offering can help her in a real way .
The main way of doing this is by appealing to her personal needs and wants .
Rather than simply saying , " Our lunchtime seminar will teach you feedback skills , " explain to the audience what 's in it for them : " Get what you need from other people , and save time and frustration , by learning how to give them good feedback . "
Feature and Benefits ( FAB ) A good way of building the reader 's desire for your offering is to link features and benefits .
Hopefully , the significant features of your offering have been designed to give a specific benefit to members of your target market .
When it comes to the marketing copy , it 's important that you do n't forget those benefits at this stage .
When you describe your offering , do n't just give the facts and features , and expect the audience to work out the benefits for themselves : tell them the benefits clearly to create that interest and desire .
Example : " This laptop case is made of aluminum , " describes a feature , and leaves the audience thinking " So what ? "
Persuade the audience by adding the benefits " ... giving a stylish look , that 's kinder to your back and shoulders . "
You may want to take this further by appealing to people 's deeper drives " ... giving effortless portability and a sleek appearance and that will be the envy of your friends and co-workers . "
4. Conviction
As hardened consumers , we tend to be skeptical about marketing claims .
It 's no longer enough simply to say that a book is a bestseller , for example , but readers will take notice if you state ( accurately , of course ! ) , that the book has been in the New York Times Bestseller List for 10 weeks , for example .
So try to use hard data where it 's available .
When you have n't got the hard data , yet the product offering is sufficiently important , consider generating some data , for example , by commissioning a survey .
5. Action
Finally , be very clear about what action you want your readers to take ; for example , " Visit www.mindtools.com now for more information " rather than just leaving people to work out what to do for themselves .
President Obama singled out California on Friday for failing to use education data to distinguish poor teachers from good ones , a situation that his administration said must change for the state to receive competitive federal school dollars .
Obama ’s comments echo recent criticisms by Education Secretary Arne Duncan , who warned that states that bar the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers , as California does , are risking those funds .
In an announcement Friday at the Education Department in Washington , Obama and Duncan said the Race to the Top awards will be allocated to school districts that institute reforms using data - driven analysis , among other things .
“ You can not ignore facts , ” Obama said .
“ That is why any state that makes it unlawful to link student progress to teacher evaluations will have to change its ways . ”
The remarks escalate a disagreement between the Obama administration and California education leaders .
While a 2006 law prohibits the use of student test scores to evaluate teachers on a state level , it does not mention local districts , where state officials say pupil data can be used to judge instructors .
A handful of districts currently are doing that ; L.A. Unified is not .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Friday he would push to amend state law if necessary .
“ We will seek any reforms or changes to the law deemed necessary , including changes to our data system laws , to ensure California is eligible to compete ” for federal funds , Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
California ’s top education officials sent the Obama administration a letter this month saying that no changes were needed to state law and that any attempt to modify it could distract from reform efforts .
The administration has not responded .
Obama ’s speech could mark the beginning of a protracted fight with teachers unions , which have resisted some of the reforms advocated by the administration , including performance pay and data - driven teacher evaluation .
Advertisement
The state ’s teachers unions have already voiced their opposition to such a move .
When the 2006 law was drafted , teachers unions insisted that it include an amendment saying : “ Data in the system may not be used . . . for purposes of pay , promotion , sanction , or personnel evaluation of an individual teacher or group of teachers , or of any other employment - related decisions related to individual teachers . ”
Obama and Duncan made their position clear .
“ This competition will not be based on politics , ideology or the preferences of a particular interest group , ” Obama said .
“ Instead it will be based on the simple principle : whether a state is ready to do what works . ”
Race to the Top applicants must show progress in four key areas to compete for the $ 4.35 billion : adopting rigorous academic standards , recruiting and retaining talented educators , turning around chronically low - performing schools , and building data systems to track student and teacher effectiveness .
But Obama also said teachers should not be judged solely on student test scores .
Seven states have lifted restrictions on public charter schools to better compete for the funds , the Associated Press reported Friday .
Other states , such as Colorado and Massachusetts , are trumpeting their recent progress on issues like merit pay and higher educational standards , which they believe will give them an inside track to secure the federal dollars .
Advertisement
Federal officials have said that California legislators do not necessarily have to revise current law .
Instead , the attorney general could certify that the state law is not a barrier to teacher accountability .
But some California education officials questioned whether it would be possible to comply with the administration ’s demands .
California ranks 41st among states in collecting and using data to evaluate teachers , according to a 2008 survey by the Data Quality Campaign , a nonprofit based in Austin , Texas .
“ There is . . . [ a ] possibility nobody will apply ” for the funds , said California Deputy Supt. for Public Instruction Rick Miller , who stressed that state leaders share the Obama administration ’s goals .
“ They ’re asking for fundamental changes in all sorts of areas , and you have to commit to all of it by October .
. . .
That ’s a heavy lift . ”

The draft guidelines for the federal funding released Friday are open for public comment for 30 days .
States are required to submit applications by October for the first round of grants .
The money is a portion of the roughly $ 100 - billion educational stimulus package approved by Congress .
But much of that money is expected to be used by districts to make up for state budget cuts .

1 July , 2009
The devil lives in the small print , the devil in this case being the BBC in its coverage of the coup d’etat that ousted President Manuel Zelaya of Honduras on 27 June , 2009 .
Take the following para from a BBC piece titled ‘ US treads careful path on Honduras ’ ( 30 June , 2009 )
“ So while Washington ’s reaction has been strong and swift , when it comes to statements , its actions have so far been measured .
Now you may wonder why the BBC chose the word ‘ measured ’ to describe the US ’ response to the military coup d’etat ?
Not only why but how ?
The following para explains ,
“ This is a signal that Washington is not keen to use its clout to help Mr Zelaya return to power , shying away from any action that could be seen as interventionism in a region where the US has a long , complex history . ”
But ‘ measured ’ is not a word that describes the US administration ’s response .
Obama simply stated that the Honduras coup is “ not legal ” .
And note that the US interventions , both direct military and covert over the years , for example , US support for the Contras in Nicaragua , the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile , the attempted overthrow of Chavez in 2002 , are described by the dissembling BBC as “ long [ and ] complex [ sic ] , which is the BBC ’s standard method of covering up the crimes of Empire .
In a related BBC piece with the title of ‘’ Mistimed coup ’ in Honduras ? ’ we read ,
“ Recent events in Tegucigalpa , with hundreds of protesters chanting the president ’s name have proved that he has his fanatical supporters . ”
Why does the BBC choose to use the word “ fanatical ” ?
Here we have a legally elected leader of a country ousted in a coup that it is alleged the US knew about in advance [ see ‘ US Govt.
Confirms It Knew Coup Was Coming in Honduras ’ ] , bundled onto a plane and flown to Costa Rica , describing Zelaya ’s supporters as “ fanatics ” !
What does this tell us about the BBC ’s alleged impartiality and objectivity ?
Clearly , any leader of any country who the BBC describes as “ leftist ” have been tarred with an extremist brush in the eyes of a misinformed public , hence the description of his supporters as “ fanatics ” .
And why call the coup ‘ mistimed ’ ?
Does the BBC know something the rest of us do n’t , like when is the ‘ right time ’ to stage a coup d’etat ?
Inquiring minds want to Auntie Beeb .
The really important aspect of the BBC ’s manipulation of language has to be seen in the larger context of the BBC ’s mandate to control our perceptions of reality .
So for example , its use of the programme ‘ Masterchef ’ to boost the UK ’s illegal invasion of Iraq by promoting ‘ our boys ’ , when the fact is , the great majority of Brits opposed the invasion of Iraq , so they ’re not ‘ our boys ’ but the Empire’s .
In the piece ‘ US treads careful path on Honduras ’ , the BBC lets us know why it uses such potent words ,
“ But Mr Zelaya , who came to power in 2006 as a centre - right leader , turned into a supporter of Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez halfway through his term .
“ He then joined the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas , a leftist alliance led by Venezuela . ”
There we have it , Zelaya did an about turn and joined forces with that other thorn in the side of the Empire , Hugo Chavéz and his “ leftist alliance ” .
So it ’s not Zelaya ’s actual policies that troubles the BBC but the fact that he ’s sided with the “ leftists ” ( with the assistance no doubt of his “ fanatical supporters ” ) .
The term “ leftist ” is loaded with hidden meaning for Western readers , it ’s way beyond ‘ left - wing ’ which may well describe a handful of Labour MPs who consider themselves as such .
Even the title of the piece reveals much about the relationship between the BBC and the USUK state , after all what does ‘ US treads careful path on Honduras ’ really mean ?
Careful not to reveal their role in the coup ?
Careful to make it look like the US supports actual democracy as opposed to fake ones , eg Iraq and Afghanistan ?
Careful not to let the cat out of the bag is closer to the truth , that the US is more than happy to see Zelaya removed but makes all the right noises in public .
Any actual steps to restore Zelaya to his rightful position eg , cutting off the military aid the US ‘ gives ’ to Honduras is noticeable by its absence .
And in an not unrelated piece on the ‘ sovereignty ’ that Iraq is alleged to have gotten with the relocation of US forces outside Iraq ’s cities and towns ( but close enough to be moved whenever their overwhelming firepower is required ) , the BBC quotes the US ambassador to Iraq at length ,
“ Yes , we think Iraq is ready and Iraq thinks Iraq is ready .
We have spent a lot of time working very closely with Iraqi security services … and I think there is an understanding that now it is the time . ”
“ Mr Hill stressed that there would still be “ a lot of US combat capabilities in Iraq for months to come ” .
“ After 30 June , with US combat forces out of cities and villages , localities , we ’ll still be in Iraq ,
“ We will still have a very robust number of US troops in Iraq and , in fact , those troops will not begin to withdraw from Iraq until probably several months from now . ”
‘ US soldiers leave Iraq ’s cities ’ , 30 June , 2009
So how can the BBC say that Iraq has achieved sovereignty when the country is occupied by over 130,000 troops as well as omitting the fact of the vast airpower that the US still lords over the country it bombed back into the Stone Age .
My thesaurus tells me that sovereign means ‘ independent ’ , ‘ autonomous ’ or ‘ self - ruling ’ and clearly Iraq meets none of these definitions .
The other key word is ‘ probably ’ , in other words it ’s just as probable that the US wo n’t withdraw completely by 2011 .
The BBC piece offers us no alternative explanations , the US view is the preferred one , so that ’s what we get for our extorted license fee .

Two teachers on their lunch break scanned a refrigerated shelf inside a Manhattan coffee shop lined with drink bottles : Naked Juice , Perrier , Smartwater , New York City tap water .
“ Tap water ? ” said Alison Szeli , 26 , picking up the clear plastic bottle with orange letters : “ Tap ’d NY .
Purified New York City tap water . ”
She studied the description : “ No glaciers were harmed in making this water . ”
She compared prices : Smartwater cost $ 1.85 .
Tap ’d NY was 35 cents less .
Szeli and her co-worker went for tap , carrying the bottles to the cash register .

“ It ’s cheaper , ” Szeli said .
“ Water is all the same anyway .
I just prefer to buy my own water in bottles . ”
A few feet away , a scruffy - haired 29 - year - old in jeans and a striped shirt delivered a shipment of Tap ’d NY out of a rented Scion .
Craig Zucker , founder of Tap ’d NY , stopped unloading long enough to notice the two customers buying his brand .
He smiled .
In the five months since he started the company , he has proved his hunch : People are willing to pay for New York City tap water , and not just in monthly utility bills .
“ It does n’t require energy or pumping , ” Zucker said , “ and it ’s so pure and clean . ”

It is , after all , one of the nation ’s healthiest water supplies -- so fresh that in 2007 the Environmental Protection Agency said it did not need filtration .
New York pizza and bagel makers have long credited local water as a special baking ingredient .
It goes down soft , without hints of tart - tasting minerals or chlorine like other public water systems .
The water comes from a system of 19 reservoirs and three lakes in upstate New York -- some flowing to the city from as far as 125 miles away .
Most of the supply is protected and filtered by the natural processes of upstate ecosystems .
It dissolves natural minerals while traveling over land or through the ground .
Michael Saucier , a spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection , notes that the city ’s water beat 150 other municipal water systems in New York state in a taste test last summer .
But how was a New Yorker able to enjoy that fresh taste when out of the house ?
As Zucker explained , “ There are n’t necessarily fountains or places to get clean water on every street in New York . ”

The solution was simple .
Especially to a man who discovered his entrepreneurial spirit at age 8 , when he started a lemonade stand in Cleveland .
Since then , he has always kept about 20 business ideas in a drawer .
At 16 , Zucker started a business enticing people to pay $ 1 to take a swing at a golf ball .
The prize for a hole in one from 150 yards : $ 1 million .
He rented space from a driving range and persuaded an insurance company to allow him to pay a premium for a million - dollar policy .
No one made it , but Zucker made some extra cash .
In college , at Miami University in Ohio , Zucker started a discount card company , pitching local businesses to give students bargains .
He collected revenue from advertisers that paid for space on his discount cards , and from college bookstores that bought the cards and gave them as loyalty gifts to customers .
He sold the business at 22 for what he said was a “ great profit , ” and moved to New York , where he launched a toy and gift wholesaling company , selling a million name bracelets .

In 2006 , he bought the Hampton ’s Honey Co. , a farm stand brand that he expanded .
It was his introduction to the growing local food movement , in which consumers support farmer ’s markets and neighborhood breweries , keeping money in the state .
The honey became a top - selling brand in Whole Foods in the New York region .
One night in 2007 , over a restaurant dinner with cold glasses of tap water , Zucker and a friend got to talking about New York water and why it ’s so good .
He noticed many New York restaurants had also started serving tap water .
Meanwhile , in Berkeley , Calif. , a high - end restaurant , Chez Panisse , had banned bottled water , and city governments in Seattle and San Francisco ordered municipal offices to stop buying it .
That ’s when it hit him .
“ Somebody should be bottling New York water , ” he said .

Zucker sold his honey company and used the income , along with investments from friends and family , to launch Tap ’d NY in October 2008 .
To bottle the stuff , Zucker and his business partner , Jon Flax , 26 , who was recruited from Craigslist , pump the water together from a main in a Brooklyn warehouse they rent .
Their water bill costs about $ 2 for every 748 gallons .
They fill up a 5,300 - gallon leased tanker truck , hiring a driver to transport the water 12 miles across the river to New Jersey to be bottled .
Studies , including one by the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco , have found that most bottled water sold in stores is essentially tap water extracted from aquifers , lakes and springs .
Like other bottled water companies , Tap ’d NY treats its water through a filtration process to cut down on unnatural colors or tastes that chlorine and other substances in pipes may have left behind .

He and Flax knew that gas - guzzling trucks and planes were often used to ship bottled water across the country or from other parts of the world .
They knew New York ’s system is almost entirely gravity - driven , delivering water without emitting greenhouse gases .
They figured enough people are suffering from a guilty water - gulping conscience to make Tap ’d NY a hit .
“ We do n’t believe it should travel from Fiji , from France or even the West Coast , ” Zucker said .
But critics say sparing the environment from transportation pollution does n’t go far enough .
If people drink Tap ’d NY , the environment can still take a hit , said Richard McIntyre , director of the water program for Food & Water Watch .
According to recycling reports , water bottles make up much of the 80 % of drinking bottle varieties that end up in landfills or oceans .

McIntyre suggested residents install filters on their home faucets instead .
Saucier , the city spokesman , said that the bottling of New York City tap water was flattering but it raised the question :
Why pay when you can get it straight from the source ?
At Irving Farm Coffee Co. in Manhattan , which sells about 100 bottles of Tap ’d NY a week , manager Muffin Spencer said her store canceled its shipments of Poland Spring after a few weeks of carrying the hometown brand .
“ It ’s a step in the right direction , ” she said .
So far , only one customer has complained that Tap ’d NY does n’t taste as good as the competition , but he begrudgingly buys it anyway out of loyalty .

Zucker and his partner spend their days delivering shipments and going door to door pitching the idea to cafes , delis and hotels .
So far , they have sold 50,000 bottles and 75 New York businesses have signed on .
He expects to expand into bodegas and supermarkets by the summer , and hopes to begin beating out other water brands this year .
Zucker wo n’t ship outside New York , although he has received requests from around the world .
The idea , he said , is to stay local .
During a recent visit to Tap ’d NY ’s small , cluttered office in Manhattan , a table stood littered with promotional stickers that read : “ Not from the top of some mountain far away ” and “ The anti-bottled - water bottled water . ”
Tacked to a wall was a handwritten list of the latest businesses to order shipments , including Urban Outfitters and the Marriott East Side Hotel .
Across the hall , workers from other companies sharing the floor were on break , filling cups at a water cooler filled with Poland Spring .

It will take a while , Zucker said , to get the message across to everyone .

DIEPSLOOT , South Africa 
The two robbery suspects had already been viciously beaten , their swollen faces stained with rivulets of red .
One of them could no longer sit up , and only the need to moan seemed to revive him into consciousness .
The other , Moses Tjiwa , occasionally stared into the taunting crowd and muttered , “ I did n’t do anything . ”
The suspects were awaiting the final cathartic wrath of the mob , the torment of being burned alive , wrapped in the fatal shawl of a gasoline - soaked blanket .
Then suddenly they were saved from that hideous death by the brave intervention of a local politician .
“ Let the police handle this , ” he implored .
As usual , the police arrived late on that recent evening , and many in the mob angrily objected to their being there at all .
Finally , one police inspector shouted : “ Get back or I ’m leaving this place and never helping you people again .
I hate Diepsloot ! ”
Crime in South Africa is commonly portrayed as an onslaught against the wealthy , but it is the poor who are most vulnerable : poor people conveniently accessible to poor criminals .
Diepsloot , an impoverished settlement on the northern edge of Johannesburg , has an estimated population of 150,000 , and the closest police station is 10 miles away .

911 OPERATOR : 9 - 1 - 1 , what is the exact location of your emergency ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Hi , I ’m actually at ( inaudible ) street in Cambridge , the house number is 7 Ware Street .
911 OPERATOR : OK ma’am , your cell phone cut out , what ’s the address again ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Sorry , it ’s 7 Ware Street .
That ’s W - A - R - E Street .
911 OPERATOR : The emergency is at 7 Ware Street , right ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER :
Well no , I ’m sorry .
17 .
Some other woman is talking next to me but it ’s 17 , 1 - 7 Ware Street .
911 OPERATOR : What ’s the phone number you ’re calling me from ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : I ’m calling you from my cell phone number .
911 OPERATOR : All right , tell me exactly what happened ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Um , I do n’t know what ’s happening .
I just had an older woman standing here and she had noticed two gentlemen trying to get in a house at that number , 17 Ware Street .
And they kind of had to barge in and they broke the screen door and they finally got in .
When I had looked , I went further , closer to the house a little bit after the gentlemen were already in the house .
I noticed two suitcases .
So , I ’m not sure if this is two individuals who actually work there , I mean , who live there .
911 OPERATOR : You think they might have been breaking in ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : I do n’t know ’ cause I have no idea .
I just noticed .
911 OPERATOR : So you ’re saying you think the possibility might have been there ?
What do you mean by barged in ?
You mean they kicked the door in ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : No , they were pushing the door in .
Like , umm , the screen part of the front door was kind of like cut .
911 OPERATOR : How did they open the door itself with the lock ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER :
They , I did n’t see a key or anything ’ cause I was a little bit away from the door .
But I did notice that they pushed their ( interrupted ) .
911 OPERATOR : And what do the suitcases have to do with anything ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : I do n’t know , I ’m just saying that ’s what I saw .
911 OPERATOR : Do you know what apartment they broke into ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER :
No , they ’re just they first floor .
I do n’t even think that it ’s an apartment .
It ’s 17 Ware Street .
It ’s a house , it ’s a yellow house .
Number 17 .
I do n’t know if they live there and they just had a hard time with their key but I did notice that they kind of used their shoulder to kind of barge in and they got in .
I do n’t know if they had a key or not because I could n’t see from my angle .
But , you know , when I looked a little closely that ’s what I saw .
911 OPERATOR : ( inaudible ) guy or Hispanic ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Umm .
911 OPERATOR : Are they still in the house ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER :
They ’re still in the house , I believe , yeah .
911 OPERATOR : Were they white , black or Hispanic ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Umm , well there were two larger men , one looked kind of Hispanic but I ’m not really sure .
And the other one entered and I did n’t see what he looked like at all .
I just saw it from a distance and this older woman was worried thinking someone ’s breaking in someone ’s house , they ’ve been barging in .
And she interrupted me and that ’s when I had noticed otherwise I probably would n’t have noticed it at all , to be honest with you .
So , I was just calling ’ cause she was a concerned neighbor , I guess .
911 OPERATOR : OK , are you standing outside ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : I ’m standing outside , yes .
911 OPERATOR : All right , the police are on the way , you can meet them then they get there .
What ’s your name ?
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Yeah , my name is ( deleted ) .
911 OPERATOR : All right , we ’re on the way .
FEMALE WITNESS CALLER : Ok .
All right , I guess I ’ll wait .
Thanks .
The path on the road to learning Scala usually involves using the REPL .
this is a very handy way of trying out functions you write easily and quickly , without having to set up an entire IDE environment .
Scala ’s latests stable release Scala 2.7.5 .
Scala 2.8 will be out in a couple of months , as things stand now .
This new release will contain a number of enhancements and new features , and if you ca n’t wait to try this out , you should check out and use the trunk .
I ’ve previously blogged about starting with Scala , and also hinted at trying this out .
In this blog , I ’ll show some more concrete examples of the and a few neat things that you can do if you ’re willing to take this step .
Get the trunk
To use the trunk , you can either check out the sources and build it yourself , our take the nightly builds .
You ’ve probably set a SCALA_HOME environment variable , so just point it to the newly created build and fire up the REPL .
If all has gone well , you should see something like the following :
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.0.r18341-b20090718103640 ( Java HotSpot ( TM ) 64 - Bit Server VM , Java 1.6.0_14 ) .
Type in expressions to have them evaluated .
Type : help for more information .
scala >
Using the trunk , the first thing you can profit from is using the redesigned and improved Scala collection library .
It has undergone a large redesign effort , largely done by Martin Odersky himself .
It has been checked in and been living in the trunk for a while now , so using the trunk you can have the advantage working with it .
The new API is explained in the Scala Improvement Proposal , an excellent and must read for understanding the design of Scala ’s collections .
Using the revamped REPL
Paul Phillips not only solves one bug after the other in the trunk , he also has the habit of pimping the REPL on a regular basis .
A very nice feature is that there is code completion , very handy if you do n’t have the complete Scala API in your head .
First , define a variable and after typing the variable ( and possibly the start of a function ) hit tab :
scala > val l = List ( 1,2,3 ) l : List [ Int ] = List ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) scala > l AbstractStringBuilder Annotation Appendable Application Array AssertionStatusDirectives BigDecimal BigInt Boolean Byte Cell CharSequence Character CharacterData00 CharacterData01 CharacterData02 CharacterData0E CharacterDataLatin1 CharacterDataPrivateUse CharacterDataUndefined Class ClassLoader ClassfileAnnotation Cloneable Comparable Compiler ConditionalSpecialCasing Console CountedIterator Deprecated Double Either Enum Enumeration Equiv Float Fractional Function GenericRange Immutable InheritableThreadLocal Integer Integral Iterable Left Long Math Mutable None NotNull Number Numeric Object Option Ordered Ordering Override Package PartialFunction PartialOrdering PartiallyOrdered Predef Process ProcessBuilder ProcessEnvironment ProcessImpl Product Proxy Range RangeToString Readable Responder Right Runnable Runtime RuntimePermission ScalaObject SecurityManager SerialVersionUID
Short Shutdown Some StackTraceElement StaticAnnotation StrictMath String StringBuffer StringBuilder StringCoding SuppressWarnings Symbol System SystemClassLoaderAction Terminator Thread ThreadDeath ThreadGroup ThreadLocal Throwable TypeConstraint UNIXProcess
Unhashable UniquenessCache Void actors annotation ch cloneable collection com compat concurrent dbc deprecated inline instrument io java javax jline l management mobile native net noinline org package ref reflect remote runtime scala serializable settings specialized sun sunw swing testing text throws tools transient unchecked unsealed util volatile xml scala > l.zip zip zipAll zipWithIndex
Pretty neat .
But that ’s not all : the trunk REPL now contains a power user mode :
scala > : help
All commands can be abbreviated - for example :h or :he instead of : help .
: help prints this help message .
: jar add a jar to the classpath .
: load followed by a filename loads a Scala file .
: power enable power user mode .
: quit exits the interpreter .
: replay resets execution and replays all previous commands .
: silent disable / enable automatic printing of results .
scala > : power ** Power User mode enabled - BEEP BOOP ** **
New vals !
Try interpreter .
** **
New defs !
Try mkType ( " T " , " String " ) ** **
New cmds ! : help to discover them ** : help prints this help message .
: jar add a jar to the classpath .
: load followed by a filename loads a Scala file .
: power enable power user mode .
: quit exits the interpreter .
: replay resets execution and replays all previous commands .
: silent disable / enable automatic printing of results .
: dump displays a view of the interpreter 's internal state .
: tree displays ASTs for specified identifiers .
Let ’s try some of this .
Using mkType we can define a type alias , just as Haskell :
scala > mkType ( " IntList " , " List [ Int ] " ) defined type alias IntList res3 : scala.tools.nsc.InterpreterResults .
Result = Success scala > val il : IntList = List ( " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " ) : 5 : error : type mismatch ; found : java.lang.String ( " 1 " ) required : Int val il : IntList = List ( " 1 " , " 2 " , " 3 " ) scala > val il : IntList = List ( 1,2,3,4 ) il : IntList = List ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) scala > il.foldLeft(0 ) ( _+_ ) res5 : Int = 10
Works like a charm .
Next , the : tree command displays some AST for classes and functions you ’ve defined , if you ’re interested in this :
scala > def sum(a : Int ) ( b : Int ) ( c : Int ) = a + b + c sum : ( a : Int ) ( b : Int ) ( c : Int ) Int scala > : tree sum def sum( a : Int ) ( b : Int ) ( c : Int ) = a .$ plus( b ) .$ plus( c ) ( DefDef )
Last but not least , we can make use of Scala ’s new cutting edge features .
For instance , Scala has limited support for applying tail call optimizations at compile time .
Determining whether the compiler actually will perform this optimization can be a tricky business however .
If you ’re using this , but are unsure whether a function that you have written will actually be optimized by the compiler , you can use the @tailrec annotation now .
For instance ( the example is taken from the Programming in Scala book ) the boom function shown below is not tail recursive , because of the increment function at the end .
The bang function on the other hand is .
[ scala ]
import scala.annotation.tailrec
class Tails {
@tailrec def boom( x : Int ) : Int = {
if ( x == 0 ) throw new Exception ( " boom ! " )
else boom ( x - 1 ) +
1
}
@tailrec def bang( x : Int ) : Int = {
if ( x == 0 ) throw new Exception ( " bang ! " )
else bang ( x - 1 )
}
}
[ / scala ]
Using the @tailrec annotation on both , the compiler gives the following error :
: 8 : error : could not optimize @tailrec annotated method @tailrec def boom( x : Int ) : Int = { ^ : 13 : error : could not optimize @tailrec annotated method @tailrec def bang ( x : Int ) : Int = {
A bit confusing at first sight , since we get compilation errors for both methods , while we were pretty sure the bang method should be tail recursive .
However , this can be explained by the fact that the bang method is defined in a class as public and not final .
This means it could be overridden in a subclass , thereby preventing tail call optimization .
Subtleties like this really makes this annotation quite useful .
If we change the class into an object ( for which methods ca n’t be overridden ) , and remove the @tailrec annotation from the boom method , all compiles fine .
For more tail call and trampolining explorations in Scala , Rich Dougherty ’s blog is a good place to start .
Also check out the Scala ’s TailRec class , which is available in the trunk , and this thread for discussion of it .
I have n’t touched all of the new features that will be in Scala 2.8.0 , but some a basic overview can be found here .
Take a look and enjoy .

The Department of the Interior ’s move last month to accelerate development of large - scale solar power plants on federal land in six Western states could give an edge to companies that have already staked lease claims in 24 new “ solar energy study areas . ”
The initiative covers 670,000 acres overseen by the department ’s Bureau of Land Management in Arizona , California , Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada and Utah .
During the solar land rush of the last two years , scores of developers large and small have sought the best solar sites , and the bureau is currently reviewing 158 lease applications for solar projects covering 1.8 million acres .
But the B.L.M. has yet to approve any leases and the new program is supposed to speed processing of land claims by identifying large tracts of the desert most suitable for solar development and then giving priority to projects proposed for those areas .
California ’s huge electricity market and renewable energy mandates have made the state a magnet for solar developers , including FPL Group and Chevron as well as solar developers First Solar , Tessera Solar , Solar Millennium , SolarReserve and Solel as well as wind farm builder enXco , a subsidiary of French energy giant EDF .
Across the border in Nevada , Goldman Sachs subsidiary Cogentrix Energy has filed lease claims on 35,996 acres within solar energy study zones , according to B.L.M. records .
“ It ’ll help them compete against other projects not in the zone , ” said Nathaniel Bullard , a North American solar analyst at New Energy Finance , a London - based research and consulting firm .
“ But I do n’t think it will make a project vault past projects on private land . ”
That ’s because the B.L.M. process , fast - tracked or not , can still be an 18 - month affair .
In fact , the Interior Department said it wo n’t complete its evaluation of the solar zones until the end of 2010 .
Still , the solar initiative appears to have sparked something of a mini-land rush .
On Monday , the B.L.M. received two solar project proposals for land in that state ’s study areas , according to Eddie Arreola , the Arizona renewable energy program manager for the B.L.M. , who declined to identify the solar developers until their applications are deemed complete .
For smaller solar developers , lease claims in a solar zone may make them an attractive acquisition target , said Mr. Bullard .
For instance , when First Solar , a Tempe , Ariz . - based solar cell maker and power plant developer , acquired the assets of OptiSolar in March , it cited the company ’s B.L.M. lease claims as a driver of the deal .
And Spain ’s Iberdrola , the world ’s largest wind developer , jumped into the solar business last year by quietly acquiring Pacific Solar Investments , a Henderson , Nev. , start - up and with B.L.M. lease claims in Arizona , California and Nevada .
Also sitting in the catbird seat in California is Bull Frog Green Energy , a Nevada start - up co-founded by Dan Kabel , the chief executive of Spanish solar developer Acciona Energy ’s American operations .
Among Bull
Frog ’s solar lease claims are two tracts in the California solar energy study areas .
I like the Back to the Future trilogy for many reasons .
Along with Jaws II and Die Hard II , Back to the Future II and III are among the very few sequels that are as good as or even better than the original .
And unlike Jurassic Park III or The Core , the Back to the Future storyline is also scientifically credible .
Once you accept the premise that time travel is possible in a converted DeLorean , everything else in the story logically follows .
One lesson I draw from Back to the Future II is the difficulty of predicting the future .
It ’s sobering to realize that we are little more than five years away from 2015 , the time of the futuristic society depicted in Back to the Future II , yet we do n’t have any of the futuristic devices from the movie : flying cars , hoverboard with or without power ( or anything else that can defy gravity ) , fully automated coffee shops or gas stations without human staff , auto - adjusting and auto - drying clothes , self - tying sneakers , instant food hydrators , voice - operated TV , knobless doors with thumbprint readers , etc .
In fact , with the sole exceptions of the internet and cell phones , we are not that technologically more advanced ( or qualitatively different ) than we were in 1985 .
( Remember , we already had Apple Macintosh in 1984 . )
We are not that much more technologically advanced than we were in 1955 !
We in 2009 are much closer technologically to 1955 than we are to the vision of 2015 in Back to the Future II .
Another example of the difficulty of predicting the future is the painting “ Moonport ” by Jim Powers .
This is Powers ’s vision , back in 1956 , of what life in the 21st century might look like .
Notice that we are still so far away from routine commercial passenger travel to the moon ( in shorts , no less ) , yet we ’ve already lost two things that Powers believed would undoubtedly be with us in half a century hence :
Big tail fins on a car and !
But that ’s not why you called .
Back to the Future II is very instructive from an evolutionary psychological perspective , because its creators seem to have grasped the nature and operation of one specific evolved psychological mechanism in our brain .
As any aficionado of the Back to the Future trilogy knows , the actor Crispin Glover , who played Michael J. Fox ’s father in the original movie , did not reprise his role in the sequels .
He was reportedly fired by the producers for asking for too much money to appear in the sequels .
So the role of George McFly in the sequels was played by another actor ( Jeffrey Weissman ) .
As you can imagine , every time different actors play the same role , it presents a headache for the producers .
Anybody who ’s my age or older will recall the fiasco when Dick Sargent replaced Dick York in the role of Darrin Stephens in the TV series Bewitched .
In order to solve this problem , the producers of Back to the Future II came up with a solution that ( whether they consciously knew it or not ) takes advantage of a blind spot in human nature .
Humans have an evolved psychological mechanism called the face recognition module .
Because humans are a social species who lived in a small group which had to compete and fight with other groups , humans developed an ability to tell faces apart very quickly and efficiently .
Telling “ us ” from “ them ” quickly was a matter of life and death .
You know what all of your families and friends look like , and you can spot a stranger immediately .
Human mind is particularly sensitive to facial features , to a much greater extent than it is to other natural features and geometric shapes .
Recognizing and telling human faces apart come very naturally to humans .
This , incidentally , is why the currency of most nations have human faces on it .
Because the human brain is more sensitive to slight changes in human faces than in any other object , this makes it easier to detect counterfeit money .
If there is one extra wrinkle on Benjamin Franklin ’s face , our mind is likely to detect it , by unconsciously noting that something is amiss , whereas similarly minor alteration in any other designs might not catch our .
Yet the face recognition module works only one way – right side up .
Throughout human evolutionary history , there were very very few occasions where our ancestors had to tell faces apart upside down , whether it was the perceiver or the target that was upside down .
In virtually all cases where our ancestors had to tell faces apart , they only looked at them one way – the right side up , with forehead above eyes , not below them , and the mouth below the nose , not above it .
So the face recognition module works only when the face is presented the right away , not if the face is upside down .
If you want to see this for yourself , take the latest issue of People or Us or any other magazine that has lots of pictures of celebrities .
Hold the issue upside down , flip through the pages , and try to identify the celebrities ’ pictures in the issue as quickly as you can while looking at the pictures upside down .
You will notice that it will always take a fraction of a second longer to recognize the faces , even the familiar faces of your favorite celebrities , if they are presented upside down .
What did the producers of Back to the Future II do ?
On the pretense that “ Grandpa ’s back gave out again , ” the actor Jeffrey Weissman was suspended midair from some floating device ( something else that we do n’t yet have ) upside down .
As a result , the audience saw the actor ’s face upside down the entire time he was on screen in Back to the Future II .
If the audience did n’t know the switch in actors already , the upside - down suspension of the replacement actor makes it more difficult for them to notice that there ’s something wrong .
Whether they consciously knew it or not , the producers of Back to the Future II took advantage of a weakness in an evolved psychological mechanism to avoid potential dissatisfaction in the audience when they had to use different actors to play the same role .
Yes , they had the same problem with the role of Jennifer Parker as well , since the role , originally played by Claudia Wells , was reprised in the sequels by Elisabeth Shue .
But I suppose the producers figured that her role was too central to the plot , and Shue too big an actress , to keep her suspended midair upside down for the entire movie .
About Shirts That Go !
Back in 2009 our youngest son was super obsessed with trains !
He would spend hours with his train sets and everywhere he went he would have a train toy in both hands .
After a while he started to ask for t- shirts with more realistic trains and other vehicles .
I looked around quite a bit and was able to find some great shirts online .
That being said I could not find exactly what I had in mind .
I was thinking realistic trains , in motion , oversize prints , and on soft made in USA t- shirts .
That I could not find .
I decided that I would try and create a train theme t- shirt for him and Shirts ThatGo was born !
Realistic Vehicles .
Giant prints .

( CNN ) -- Saudi Arabian officials beheaded and then publicly displayed the body of a convicted killer in Riyadh on Friday , an act that prompted a stiff denunciation by a leading human rights monitor .
The Saudi Interior Ministry said Ahmed Al - Shamlani Al - Anzi was sentenced to death and then " crucifixion " -- having his body displayed in public -- for the kidnapping and killing of an 11 - year - old boy and for the killing of the boy 's father , according to the official Saudi Press Agency .
Amnesty International issued a statement deploring the punishment , with the group 's Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui saying in a statement it is " horrific " that beheadings and crucifixions " still happen . "
Even though the word " crucifixion " is used to describe the public display , the act has no connection to Christianity and the crucifixion of Jesus .
The bodies are not displayed on crosses , Lamri Chirouf , who researches Saudi Arabian issues for Amnesty , explained .
The Saudi Interior Ministry asserted that Al - Anzi 's body was displayed as a warning that those involved in similar crimes would suffer the same fate , the press agency reported .
The ministry said Al - Anzi kidnapped the boy and held him for a " malicious purpose " at a grocery store where he worked .
He tied rope around the boy 's neck and strangled him to death , the ministry said .
When the boy 's father came to the store looking for his son , Al - Anzi axed the father repeatedly until the man died .
When police came to arrest Al - Anzi , Al - Anzi resisted arrest by threatening them with a knife .
Police later discovered that Al - Anzi had been previously convicted of other crimes , including possession of pornographic videos and sodomy , the Interior Ministry said .
Chirouf , the Saudi Arabian researcher for Amnesty International , said his understanding of how the Saudi government carries out crucifixion jibed with Saudi Press Agency 's account .
Government officials do use crucifixions , or public displays of executed bodies , as a tool to deter people from committing such a crime , he said .
This latest case was classified as an offense of rebellion , one that basically rejected all of the rules of religion and society , he said .
Chirouf said those crucified are beheaded first and then their heads are sewn back on their bodies .
Then , the corpse is mounted on a pole or a tree .
The English - language Saudi Gazette newspaper said the body was placed on public display throughout the evening and Chirouf said it was his understanding that the body was to be displayed for a few hours .
In its denunciation of the punishment , Amnesty International deplored the " extensive use of the death penalty " in Saudi Arabia .
" King Abdullah should show true leadership and commute all death sentences if Saudi Arabia is to have any role to play as a global leader or member of the G - 20 , " Sahraoui said .
The group asserts that " trial proceedings " in the country " fall far below international fair - trial standards . "
" They usually take place behind closed doors without adequate legal representation .
Convictions are often made on the basis of " confessions " obtained under duress , including torture or other ill - treatment during incommunicado detention , " Amnesty International said .
" Those who are sentenced to death are often not informed of the progress of legal proceedings against them or of the date of execution until the morning when they are taken out and beheaded . "
Amnesty International said there were 102 executions in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and is aware of 136 people believed to be awaiting execution .
It says there has been " a high number of executions of migrant workers and other foreign nationals , in particular from Asia and Africa . "
Al - Anzi was a Saudi national , said Chirouf -- who added " nobody knows how many people are on death row " in Saudi Arabia .

In his speech to the AMA in Chicago June 15 , 2009 , Obama shared his diagnosis , solutions , and justification for healthcare reform : health costs are spiraling out of control and are a threat to the economy , families , businesses , and the federal government .
The current system is unsustainable .
Costs are increasing faster than they should because we spend money on things that do n't make us healthier .
We equate expensive care with better care .
We overuse and reimburse for treatments that are not needed and we pay for quantity instead of quality .
We can categorize Obama 's major solutions to the healthcare crisis as follows :
Payment reform .
Change how providers are paid by bundling payments so they team up to treat episode of care or illness .
Pay for quality outcomes .
Knowledge reform .
Invest in examining and disseminating knowledge of what treatments are more cost effective and clinically effective to cut costs .
Information - technology reform .
Upgrade medical records from paper to electronic .
This will avoid duplication of tests , track information from doctor to doctor , lower administrative costs , improve doctors ' productivity , and reduce medical errors .
Insurance reform .
Make the purchase of health insurance mandatory for everyone .
Eliminate preexisting - condition waivers and insurance companies ' ability to " cherry - pick " whom to cover .
Introduce an affordable public option for individuals in order to inject competition into the marketplace to keep private insurance companies honest .
Obama assures us that this is not government - run healthcare , that this is not a single - payer system , that the only consequence to these reforms is that healthcare will cost less and that anybody who denies this is misleading or does not understand the facts .
Without his reform , he insists , costs will grow unsustainably , which will threaten reimbursements and the stability of the healthcare system .
Unfortunately , since Obama uses faulty logic to diagnose the problem , his solutions will only make matters worse faster .
The correct framework within which to diagnose the problem is to admit that costs are out of control because they do not reflect prices created by the voluntary exchange between patients and providers , between customers and producers , like every well - functioning industry .
Instead , health costs reflect the distortions that government regulators have introduced through reimbursement mechanisms created by command - and - control bureaucracies at federal and state levels .
Simply put , Medicare , Medicaid , workers compensation , HMOs and even private health - insurance firms that follow Medicare rates , rely on cost reports submitted by providers .
This cost data is then pushed through mathematical models and additional data generated by government , such as inflation and regional - labor - cost modifiers , to unilaterally ( or in agreement with lobbyists and industry groups ) determine what the prices for services should be .
But it is theoretically and practically impossible for a bureaucrat — no matter how accurate the cost data , how well intentioned and how sophisticated his computer program — to come up with the correct and just price .
The just price of a health service can only be determined by the voluntary exchange of a patient with his hospital , physician , and pharmacist .
The relationship between the patient and his private provider has been corrupted by the intrusion of government and its intermediaries ( HMOs , for example ) to such an extent that we can no longer speak of a relationship that can produce meaningful pricing information .
Given the level of technological advance and capital investment in healthcare of the past 40 years , one would expect quality to increase and prices to come down relative to other goods and services .
This is true of other capital - intensive industries like consumer electronics and air travel .
But in healthcare we have the opposite phenomenon : higher prices and , at best , equal or slightly improved quality in some locations or , at worst , lower quality in other locations , particularly government owned institutions .
And too few consider that perhaps government participation is to blame .
Obama suggests that Medicare and Medicaid are responsible for the cost spiral because they pay for quantity rather than quality , because they do not differentiate between services that make people healthier and those that do not , because they pay for services that are not needed , etc .
But he is stating the obvious .
Government bureaucrats , physicians , patients , and hospitals have known that for as long as these federal programs have existed .
In fact , these reimbursement mechanisms have been modified over the years to attempt to resolve these very deficiencies in the same way that Soviet and Cuban planners attempted to cure the weaknesses of their resource - allocation formulas .
Contrary to Obama 's suggestion that knowledge of clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness can be obtained and disseminated , there is no rational way to evaluate cost effectiveness outside of the free market .
Central health planners cannot compare and recommend the best option between two different combinations of drugs , hospitals , and physicians to treat a particular ailment .
It is not just a matter of figuring out which combination offers better outcomes and lower costs .
In fact , the bureaucrat actually needs prices to make that comparison !
This is also why Obama 's ideas on payment reform to change how Medicare pays providers , and knowledge reform to investigate which treatments are most cost effective will never work and will increase costs and reduce quality .
We have explored this argument in detail here .
Obama also proposes to reduce the cost of health care by upgrading medical records from paper to electronic .
While the benefits of health information technology ( HIT ) are undeniable , the industry is nowhere near the level of development required to have a material impact in productivity and quality of care .
It is truly in its infancy .
We have different manufacturers with different systems , and different silos of solutions to particular problems even within the same manufacturer — silos that at best communicate clumsily with each other and at worst make the physician 's access to meaningful timely clinical information a nightmare .
Billions of dollars have already been invested in HIT .
Some systems have worked , while others have not .
Billions more will need to be allocated until the best systems are adopted .
But the idea that somehow a government agency with no shareholders at risk will help us better coordinate the allocation of capital and the experimentation necessary to develop these solutions is laughable , especially when one of its agents , the Department of Veterans Affairs , in all likelihood has the record for the most expensive failed HIT experiment to date , the $ 467 million computer system at its Bay Pines hospital in Florida .
The true drive behind government 's interest in electronic medical records is the desire to acquire as much clinical and cost information as possible to further control care delivery and health resources .
But this is a futile effort as we have seen above .
In addition , the effort runs counter to the logical problem that computer systems at millions of local provider - patient levels are capable of generating more data than can be processed expeditiously and meaningfully by a central control agency and its computer system .
Any information produced by this central planner will be erroneous and old by the time it is used to guide central bureaucratic decision making .
Obama 's plan also includes a reform of our private health - insurance market .
He would like , first , to make health insurance mandatory for all Americans , second , to offer an affordable public option , and third , to eliminate the ability of insurance companies to " cherry - pick " which services to cover and which to deny .
These changes , he believes , will reduce cost shifting — the practice that providers use to subsidize charity , bad debt , and unprofitable government programs by charging more to insurance companies and private payers and patients — and will spread the risks of the insurance company to healthy individuals , thereby reducing the costs to everyone .
These insurance reforms ideas are flawed .
They are based on the assumption that health insurance companies can charge premiums to a pool of policyholders , predict and pay for a large loss triggered by an event outside the control of the policyholder , and make a profit .
But sickness combines risks that are uncontrollable with risks that are indeed controllable by the policyholder ( eating , exercise , preventative habits , and adherence to treatment plans , for example ) and the provider ( selection of diagnostic tests , specialists and hospitals , for example ) .
As a result , insurance companies are left with tools of rationing via higher premiums , deductibles , copayments and utilization controls placed on providers , which have a tendency to create nonrandom groups of policyholders and providers .
Health insurance companies are more instruments of income redistribution than risk managers , and they are left with only one option : to charge healthy individuals enough to subsidize sick individuals .
Eventually , when the impact of the redistribution on individuals is high enough , many either opt out or are priced out of the market , creating the 50 million uninsured individuals . [ 1 ]
Obama explicitly states that he wants to force the redistribution of income from healthy to unhealthy individuals but with the illogical belief that somehow this scheme will reduce the costs to everyone .
But we have seen that even if the size of the risk pool is extended to the whole population of the United States by mandating every American to have health insurance and hence fixing the size and selection of the risk pool to the whole population , this does not address the fundamental flaw of mixing controllable with uncontrollable risks .
Any sensible insurance reform should separate these risks and only cover uncontrollable risks , allow individual underwriting ( the practice of insurance companies assessing each individual 's pricing and eligibility ) move away from community rating ( the practice of offering the same price to large groups of individuals regardless of each individual 's age , sex , health status , and risk level ) so that healthy people pay lower premiums and sick people pay higher premiums , exactly the current model for life insurance .
In other words , we should allow and encourage " cherry - picking , " not ban it .
The logical tendency of Obama 's insurance reforms , despite his explicit denial , will be an inexorable movement towards a single - payer system as his reforms will not control costs or utilization , and the only alternative left will be to enhance the control of the plan via explicit rationing , by a bureaucrat , of the care delivered .
The central authority must then decide which health services are provided and which denied , who should receive them and who should not , when they should be given , all in addition to its current function of attempting to determine prices .
Such a centralized system must logically retrograde into chaos because pricing signals to patients , doctors , and hospitals will be so distorted that they cannot guide resource allocation .
Obama concludes his speech by stating ,
we 're a nation that cares for its citizens .
We look out for one another .
That 's what makes us the United States of America .
We need to get this done .
Besides the obvious demagoguery to justify accelerating further control of healthcare by the federal government , we should ask ourselves how we have devolved from a collection of independent states founded by a war of secession from a central government power into one nation with a powerful central state .
The justification for independence from the rule of King George III that these states gave was based on the doctrine of natural human rights ,
that all men are created equally free & independent , & have certain inherent natural Rights , of which they cannot , by any Compact , deprive or divest their posterity ; among which are the Enjoyment of Life & Liberty , with the Means of acquiring & possessing property , & pursuing & obtaining Happiness & Safety .
These words are from the original draft written by George Mason for the Virginia Declaration of Rights .
Nowhere in this document or in successive drafts by Mason and Thomas Jefferson do we read words that could lead the reader to conclude that the federal government ought to care for its citizens or that we ought to look out for one another or that a central government ought to violate our individual natural rights to freedom , independence , and property to achieve the absurdity of mandatory equal access , equal price , equal quantity , and equal quality of health care for all .
I ’ve just added a note to the Privacy Policy that bears some explanation .
Ate Up With Motor has lots of photos .
Most of them were taken in public places , sometimes by people other than me — at car shows , on the street , and so forth .
Inevitably , some of those photos have people in the background .
Now , generally , under U.S. law , this kind of editorial usage is not a big deal , since people in public places usually do n’t have a “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” ; otherwise , newspapers and news shows could never run crowd shots .
However , under the EU ’s new GDPR directive and associated local law , any recognizable image of a natural person may be considered personally identifying information , which becomes messy .
The plain reality is this : I usually do not have any reasonable way to know the identities of people who may be visible in the backgrounds of photos ( especially in big crowds ) , nor am I usually able to associate their images with any other information I might have about them .
If you ’re a regular visitor to Ate Up With Motor and you popped up in the background of some photo taken at a car show five years ago , I probably do n’t know it !
Also , while some photographers make an effort to obscure the faces of bystanders —
I started doing this with my own photos about seven years ago — that is n’t always possible , or successful .
( I ’ve seen a number of photos where the photographer or editor overlooked the face of someone leaning out a window in the background or something like that . )
If a photo is n’t mine , I may not have the right to modify it in that way , and even if I do , the original online source may still have the unmodified , un -obscured original .
There ’s not usually anything I can do about that .
So , all I can reasonably do is note in the Privacy Policy that this is something that may occasionally happen , and ask that if you see yourself ( or some information about you ) in a photo and feel bothered by it , you contact me to discuss how best I can alleviate your concerns .
Also , please understand that if you request your information under the GDPR , I probably do n’t have any way to associate your comments or other data with the tiny figure in the background of a car show photo !

Gotta thank Amy Bronee , host of the show Real Parenting on C - FAX in Canada for alerting me to this story in the National Post :
Minding your marshmallows Katherine Dedyna , Canwest News Service Published : Friday , July 24 , 2009
There ’s no such thing as being too careful when it comes to kids and camping – even for hyper - vigilant parents .
But peril can take unexpected forms – including the seemingly innocuous marshmallow , if improperly handled .
For maximum health and safety , one B.C. doctor offers his wish - list of marshmallow - roasting techniques for 21st - century campfire kids : 1 . Apply hand sanitizer before selecting marshmallow .
2 . Sterilize the roasting twig by thrusting it in fire .
3 . Remove carbon from the twig with a clean tissue .
4 . Put a clean marshmallow on the clean twig with the clean hands and roast away .
“ And do n’t eat too many because one , they ’re pure sugar , and two , all of us have burned our mouths on marshmallows , ” says Dr. Richard Stanwick , chief medical officer of health for the Vancouver Island Health Authority .
“ If there ’s a flame coming out of it , it ’s probably too hot . ”
And I suppose if you apply the flaming marshmallow directly to your hair , that ’s not a good idea either ?
How about the stick ?
Should one poke it in one ’s eye ?
We do hope to see some more safety tips soon .
The article goes on to discuss a revolutionary device available from MarshmallowChefSticks.com .
It ’s a stick .
It ’s actually more like a paddle until the very end , where it gets pointy , and it ’s long enough to keep your kid over 3 feet away from the fire .
What ’s more , according to the website , this amazing breakthrough , “ makes it easy to roast marshmallows . ”
At last !
‘ Cause I ’d been taking classes for years and just never quite got the hang of it .
And to think the stick is just $ 25 .
Get ’em while they ’re hot !
( And then wait for them to cool down , of course .
Kids :
Please wait till your marshmallow has solidified into a tepid mound before applying tongue . ) — Lenore

( PhysOrg.com ) --
It 's about mosquitoes killing mosquitoes .
The day - biting mosquito Aedes aegypti takes a blood meal and then rests in a dark place before heading for water to deposit her eggs .
Her eggs will develop into larvae , pupae and adults -- adults capable of transmitting the killer disease , dengue .
But maybe not , thanks to a six - member team led by British researcher Gregor Devine , a team that includes epidemiologist and dengue mosquito researcher Amy Morrison of the University of California .
Unbeknownst to the mosquito , a deadly insecticide in her resting place will kill her future generations .
Her resting area contains a cloth impregnated with a powdered larval insecticide , which will stick to her body when she buzzes off to an aquatic habitat to lay her eggs .
There the larvicide will kill not only her offspring but other immature mosquitoes at this and other breeding sites .
Getting mosquitoes to spread insecticides is the gist behind the research , " Using Adult Mosquitoes to Transfer Insecticides to Aedes aegypti Larval Habitats , " published June 29 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
Devine , with Rothamsted Research , Hertfordshire , United Kingdom , and Morrison , with the UC Mosquito Research Laboratory , directed by Thomas Scott of the UC Davis Department of Entomology , have been working together on a variety of field experiments on mosquitoes , including the use of adult mosquitoes to kill their young via a larvicide .
" A major barrier to mosquito control for dengue has been treating all of the infested containers , " said Scott .
" This is a creative way to exploit the ecology of the system by using the mosquitoes themselves to treat all containers , including the ones that are most difficult for humans to find .
This is an exciting new development with important public health implications . "
The field work took place in the Amazon city of Iquitos , Peru , where Morrison has studied dengue since 1999 .
Iquitos , endemic to dengue , is the most populous city in the world that cannot be reached by road .
The researchers placed the insecticide , a juvenile hormone analogue ( JHA ) , at dissemination stations in a cemetery in Iquitos .
Although they placed the JHA in just 3 to 5 percent of a resting area , that placement resulted in a 42 to 98 percent reduction of emergent adult mosquitoes at each breeding site .
The JHA used was pyriproxyfen , which the authors said " does not interfere with the fundamental behaviors ( of mosquitoes ) that we are exploiting because it is neither lethal nor repellent to adults .
" It is the act of oviposition ( egg- laying ) that contaminates the aquatic habitat , so the technique explicitly and precisely targets the mosquitoes ' preferred breeding sites , " the authors wrote .
" This process may help overcome one of the most important constraints on the successful application of larvicidal or pupacidal interventions : the inefficient waste of expense insecticides and human resources on treating inappropriate or cryptic oviposition sites . "
The insecticide kills larvae , but does not harm people - or adult mosquitoes .
Pyriproxyfen is registered for public health use .
The World Health Organization declared it safe for drinking at 300 parts per billion , which is 1000 times the dose needed to control Aedes aegypti .
When humans treat aquatic habitats with insecticides , the process can be difficult , time - consuming and expensive .
When mosquitoes apply insecticides , this targets the exact breeding site ( from a discarded tin can to flower vase saucer to sewage seeps ) and amplifies the effect because every adult mosquito completes several resting and egg - laying cycles during its lifetime , Devine said .
Devine lived in Iquitos in 2006 - 2008 while working with the U.S. Navy and UC Davis on the research project .
Morrison and Jeff Stancil , a U.S. Navy entomologist from the Naval Medical Research Center Detachment in Peru , were co-applicants on the grant .
Some 2.5 to 3 billion people , primarily in tropical and sub- tropical countries , are at risk to dengue , caused by any one of four serotypes or closely related viruses known as DEN - 1 , DEN - 2 , DEN - 3 , or DEN - 4 .
Nicknamed " break bone fever , " classic dengue is characterized by high fever , headaches , muscle and joint pain , nausea , vomiting and a rash .
Some 50 to 100 million cases of debilitating dengue fever occur annually .
The most severe form of the disease , dengue haemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) , strikes a half million people a year , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Some 22,000 die of DHF .

When Dell announced a shift in its Linux strategy last week , accompanied by a new netbook , many wondered why Dell insisted on pre-loading Ubuntu 8.04 , instead of newer versions of the popular Linux distribution such as 8.10 or 9.04 .
BetaNews contacted Dell about it , and Dell replied explaining their rationale behind opting for 8.04 .
According to Dell , it ’s an issue of keeping costs down and building a stable , well - tested platform .
“ We are trying to stay on a 12 - month cadence to keep costs down , and build a stable platform , ” a Dell spokesperson told BetaNews , “ A mainstream user does not care if it ’s [ Ubuntu Linux ] 8.04 or 8.10 or 9.04 ( he / she does not know what those are ) — she just wants it to work right and be stable / safe …
Most of the Linux enthusiasts would not like to be so far behind ( i.e. , 8.04 vs. 9.04 ) , but they are not our primary target audience for the [ operating system ] image . ”
Still ,
Dell wo n’t be sitting still , either .
They plan to add several features to their Ubuntu 8.04 installations over time , like they have already done by bringing the wireless connectivity in their 8.04 image up to par with that of more recent Ubuntu releases .
Dell also plans to continue its strategy of providing its own update repositories , to make sure updates are stable and well - tested .
The Dell spokesperson further added : “ Our goal is to provide choice and while we may not have been able to launch Windows and Ubuntu simultaneously on all of our mini platforms , we have offered [ it ] when it was ready .
It ’s very important for us to make the Linux experience as simple and seamless as possible for mainstream users vs. ‘ Linux enthusiasts . ' ”
At Free Republic , they ’re celebrating the murder of Dr. George Tiller .
From the following two threads :

… a selection of comments , among hundreds ( if not thousands ) of similar comments :
I ’m not weeping for the scumbag himself .
I have n’t the fainest doubt that he is , at this very moment , rotting in the very special place in hell that he so richly earned .
What I ’m saying is that this will hurt the anti-abortion * cause * … and hurt it badly .
If you doubt me …just watch . …
Up to a few years ago , I would have agreed with your statement , Doug .
However , bush2 failed miserably with his “ friendly tone ” and I ’m beginning to think we MUST bring a gun to a gun fight if we have any chance to win this battle against satan and his minions .
…
One less nazi as far as I am concerned . …
What goes around comes around … …
Hope the guy gets away . …
When I first read this , part of me wondered if some liberal is n’t secretly behind this to get just the outcome you have listed .
I used to not be so paranoid , until this surreal reality replaced what used to be .
Interesting the timing of this , as it was recently released that according to polls a majority of Americans are anti-abortion / pro-life .
Good way to discredit the movement and those beliefs - assassinate an abortionist .
…
Obama is going to take advantage of this murder to sieze even more control over our society .
I would not even put it past them to commit this murder themselves , as an excuse to sieze power .
Reichstag Fire , and all that … …
No doubt this ‘ man ’ is responsible for thousands , maybe tens - of - thousands of needless and wanton deaths .
If you think his ‘ passing ’ is a bad thing in the cause of speaking out and ending the practice of abortion , I do n’t know what to tell you .
I can only say that I shall not mourn his demise , nor shall I judge others . …
It ’s too bad the suspect did n’t poke a roto rooter through his skull and then suck him into a vacuum cleaner instead of just shooting the bastard . …
You guys celebrating this may just be celebrating the loss of your own freedoms .
Do n’t be fools .
This is n’t good nor is it right .
My , my , that idea just scares me to death .
I guess I should be a damned hypocrite and say that I ’m sorry someone offed the lousey ration of skunksqueeze .
Not in this life .
… Hmmm .
The shooter no doubt committed murder by our laws .
Whether he will be judged as a murderer by God may be an open question , and none of us know the answer .
In 1942 Reinhard Heydrich was killed in Prague in cold blood .
Czech commandos committed what was by the law of the land murder .
They were from a country that had surrendered and they were not in uniform .
They did this because he was orchestrating the destruction of the Czech people .
Did they kill a tyrant or commit murder or both ?
There is also the case of course of John Brown and slavery .
Yes we must obey our laws , until we can no longer live with the result of not obeying them .
…
Do you think that it would have been murder to assignate Hitler ?
And do n’t say that the question has no relevance — this crud was a leading the killer - of - innocents criminal thugs that has already killed throughout the world far more innocents that Hitler , Stalin and Mao combined .
His killer did a great service when noone else would do it .
… I do not support this , but I do understand this .
Kansas politics has been corrupted to the core by George Tiller , making him like a mobster above the law .
He who lives by the sword , dies by the sword .

Whatever “ church ” Tiller attends must be worshipping satan .
… Reichstag Fire . … jury ( of one ) nullification …
Why is the death of a satanic worshipper tragic ? …
He had the goods on Kathleen Sebelius , and that means she was blackmailable .
I wonder if they will catch the killer on this one ?!

Tiller is screaming as the demons rape him .
The babies he murdered have been given their just regenge .

Although
Im not happy about this news - it might have been more fair if he had been killed like his countless innocent victims were - cut into pieces and sucked down a sink .
… JUSTICE IS SERVED .
TILLER GOT WHAT HE DESERVED . …
I am astonished at the disconnect between this discussion and the facts necessary to resolve any part of it .
It is alleged back and forth whether killing “ Tiller the Killer ” , as he was called by Operation Rescue 20 years ago , is “ Christian ” , yet not one Bible quote to settle the question !
So here is a private message , only for those of you who actually care about God ’s opinion of all this :
Pro 24:10
If thou faint in the day of adversity , thy strength is small .
11
If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death , and those that are ready to be slain ; 12 If thou sayest , Behold , we knew it not ; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it ?
and he that keepeth thy soul , doth not he know it ?
and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
Notice that God is talking about rescuing victims of government - protected murder , since ordinary murderers lack the power to kill by a schedule publicly known .
Luke 1:41 shows we can respond to God even before birth ; Jer 1:5 shows
God assigns missions to us even before conception ; Psalm 139:13 - 16 shows personality existing at conception ; Jer 32:35 shows child murder as so unthinkable that not even God thought of it !
So there you have it : if you still want to call God unjust or bigoted compared with your more highly evolved self , keep shooting off your mouth at Him .
Even though some of your barbs will hit me , since I am standing with God as well as I can , it is safer here than there .

My only two regrets
1 . I did n’t come sooner
2 . The shooter did n’t get away with it .
I assume we are still a Democracy under the “ leadership ” of Barack Obama ……. for how much longer I do n’t know .
I also assume that I wo n’t be arrested myself for this comment …or be dragged out of my bed by Thugs O The State and thrown in jail without defense .
Tiller did n’t get that ….
I hear you libs out there saying in chorus !
Neither did the babies he killed so mercilessly .

It was n’t a murder , it was a legal , safe , late - term abortion .
Some right wing blogs are closing comments on threads about the murder , and judging from the vile , sick stuff you see above , that ’s probably a good idea .
This is very , very bad craziness , at its worst .
Shame on all you people who are gloating and partying over a murder that took place inside a church .

These 5 have been unemployed so long enough they exhausted their unemployment insurance - just like half a million Americans about to face the same fate .
How did it happen , and how do they cope without a weekly check ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Detroit metropolitan area held its position of having the highest unemployment rate among major U.S. cities , with the rate surging more than 2 percentage points to above 17 % , the government reported Wednesday .
The jobless rate in the Detroit - Warren - Livonia metropolitan area rose to 17.1 % last month from 14.9 % in May .
It was the highest of 49 urban centers with more than 1 million inhabitants in the Labor Department report .
The Detroit area also suffered the largest year - over - year increase in unemployment of any major urban center .
The rate is up 8.1 percentage points from 9 % in June 2008 .
" We 've seen continued deterioration in the entire state of Michigan , " said Ken LeVasseur , a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" The entire state did not come out of the 2001 recession . "
Michigan has been battered by the collapse of the auto industry .
General Motors , a major employer in the state , declared bankruptcy at the start of June .
Motor City is the largest metro area to suffer the auto industry 's woes , but it is not the only one .
Kokomo , Ind. , posted a 11.8 - percentage - point jump over last June .
The unemployment rate stands at 19.2 % in Kokomo , where one - fifth of the workforce is employed in the auto sector .
Also in Indiana , the Elkhart - Goshen metro area saw its unemployment rate increase by double digits .
Such large annual increases are " pretty much unheard of , " LeVasseur said .
In California , the Riverside - San Bernardino - Ontario metro area had the second highest unemployment rate among the major metro areas , at 13.1 % .
The Charlotte - Gastonia - Concord metro area in North Carolina , where unemployment rose to 12.4 % last month , had the third highest rate .
The government said jobless rates rose in all 372 of the nation 's metropolitan areas last month .
The highest rate among all metro areas was the 27.5 % in El Centro , Calif. , followed by the 23.1 % in Yuma , Ariz .
Of the 18 areas with a jobless rate of 15 % or more , 8 are in California and 5 are in Michigan .
Bismarck , N.D. , had the lowest jobless rate among metropolitan areas at 3.8 % .
The national unemployment rate rose to 9.5 % in June and many economists expect it to top 10 % later this year .

What are the stations between poverty and destitution ?
Like the Nouveau Poor , the already poor descend through a series of deprivations , though these are less likely to involve forgone vacations than missed meals and medications .
The Times reported earlier this month that one - third of Americans can no longer afford to comply with their prescriptions .

There are other , less life - threatening , ways to try to make ends meet .
The Associated Press has reported that more women from all social classes are resorting to stripping , although “ gentlemen ’s clubs , ” too , have been hard - hit by the recession .
The rural poor are turning increasingly to “ food auctions , ” which offer items that may be past their sell - by dates .
And for those who like their meat fresh , there ’s the option of urban hunting .
In Racine , Wis. , a 51 - year - old laid - off mechanic told me he ’s supplementing his diet by “ shooting squirrels and rabbits and eating them stewed , baked and grilled . ”
In Detroit , where the wildlife population has mounted as the human population ebbs , a retired truck driver is doing a brisk business in raccoon carcasses , which he recommends marinating with vinegar and spices .
The most common coping strategy , though , is simply to increase the number of paying people per square foot of dwelling space  by doubling up or renting to couch - surfers .
It ’s hard to get firm numbers on overcrowding , because no one likes to acknowledge it to census - takers , journalists or anyone else who might be remotely connected to the authorities .
At the legal level , this includes Peg taking in her daughter and two grandchildren in a trailer with barely room for two , or my nephew and his wife preparing to squeeze all four of them into what is essentially a one - bedroom apartment .
But stories of Dickensian living arrangements abound .
In Los Angeles , Prof. Peter Dreier , a housing policy expert at Occidental College , says that “ people who ’ve lost their jobs , or at least their second jobs , cope by doubling or tripling up in overcrowded apartments , or by paying 50 or 60 or even 70 percent of their incomes in rent . ”
Thelmy Perez , an organizer with Strategic Actions for a Just Economy , is trying to help an elderly couple who could no longer afford the $ 600 a month rent on their two - bedroom apartment , so they took in six unrelated subtenants and are now facing eviction .
According to a community organizer in my own city , Alexandria , Va. , the standard apartment in a complex occupied largely by day laborers contains two bedrooms , each housing a family of up to five people , plus an additional person laying claim to the couch .
Overcrowding  rural , suburban and urban  renders the mounting numbers of the poor invisible , especially when the perpetrators have no telltale cars to park on the street .
But if this is sometimes a crime against zoning laws , it ’s not exactly a victimless one .
At best , it leads to interrupted sleep and long waits for the bathroom ; at worst , to explosions of violence .
Catholic Charities is reporting a spike in domestic violence in many parts of the country , which Candy Hill attributes to the combination of unemployment and overcrowding .
And doubling up is seldom a stable solution .
According to Toni Muhammad , about 70 percent of the people seeking emergency shelter in St. Louis report they had been living with relatives “ but the place was too small . ”
When I asked Peg what it was like to share her trailer with her daughter ’s family , she said bleakly , “ I just stay in my bedroom . ”

BOWS and arrows may not be the preserve of modern humans .
It seems that simple stone blades make adequate arrowheads , so they might have been used in lightweight projectile weapons as far back as 100,000 years ago , when the blades first appeared .

The role of gender stereotypes in the ultimate intellectual sport
From European Journal of Social Psychology , Volume 38 , Issue 2 ( March / April 2008 )
Anne Maass , Claudio D'Ettole , Mara Cadinu
Abstract
Women are surprisingly underrepresented in the chess world , representing less that 5 % of registered tournament players worldwide and only 1 % of the world 's grandmasters .
In this paper it is argued that gender stereotypes are mainly responsible for the underperformance of women in chess .
Forty - two male - female pairs , matched for ability , played two chess games via the Internet .
When players were unaware of the sex of opponent ( control condition ) , females played approximately as well as males .
When the gender stereotype was activated ( experimental condition ) , women showed a drastic performance drop , but only when they were aware that they were playing against a male opponent .
When they ( falsely ) believed to be playing against a woman , they performed as well as their male opponents .
In addition , our findings suggest that women show lower chess - specific self - esteem and a weaker promotion focus , which are predictive of poorer chess performance .
Conclusion
A number of novel findings emerge from the present study that complement cognitively - oriented research on chess .
Most importantly , gender stereotypes can have a greatly debilitating effect on female players leading to a 50 % performance decline when playing against males .
Interestingly , this disadvantage is completely removed when players are led to believe that they are playing against a woman .
This may , in part , occur because women choose a more defensive style when playing with men .
A second and more general message of our study is that self - confidence and a win-oriented promotion motivation contribute positively to chess performance .
Since women show lower chess - specific self - esteem and a more cautious regulatory focus than males , possibly as a consequence of widely held gender stereotypes , this may at least in part explain their worldwide underrepresentation and underperformance in chess .
Thus , women seem disadvantaged not because they are lacking cognitive or spatial abilities , but because they approach chess competitions with lesser confidence and with a more cautious attitude than their male opponents .
Hence , a motivational perspective may be better suited to understand ( and prevent ) the underperformance of women in the ‘ ultimate intellectual sport . ’

In March the biggest climate conference of the year took place in Copenhagen : 2500 participants from 80 countries , 1400 scientific presentations .
Last week , the Synthesis Report of the Copenhagen Congress was handed over to the Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen in Brussels .
Denmark will host the decisive round of negotiations on the new climate protection agreement this coming December .
The climate congress was organised by a “ star alliance ” of research universities : Copenhagen , Yale , Berkeley , Oxford , Cambridge , Tokyo , Beijing – to name a few .
The Synthesis Report is the most important update of climate science since the 2007 IPCC report .
So what does it say ?
Our regular readers will hardly be surprised by the key findings from physical climate science , most of which we have already discussed here .
Some aspects of climate change are progressing faster than was expected a few years ago – such as rising sea levels , the increase of heat stored in the ocean and the shrinking Arctic sea ice .
“ The updated estimates of the future global mean sea level rise are about double the IPCC projections from 2007 ” , says the new report .
And it points out that any warming caused will be virtually irreversible for at least a thousand years – because of the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere .
Perhaps more interestingly , the congress also brought together economists and social scientists researching the consequences of climate change and analysing possible solutions .
Here , the report emphasizes once again that a warming beyond 2 º C is a dangerous thing :
Temperature rises above 2 ºC will be difficult for contemporary societies to cope with , and are likely to cause major societal and environmental disruptions through the rest of the century and beyond .
( Incidentally , by now 124 nations have officially declared their support for the goal of limiting warming to 2 º C or less , including the EU – but unfortunately not yet the US . )
Some media representatives got confused over whether this 2 º C - guardrail can still be met .
The report ’s answer is a clear yes – if rapid and decisive action is taken :
The conclusion from both the IPCC and later analyses is simple – immediate and dramatic emission reductions of all greenhouse gases are needed if the 2 º C guardrail is to be respected .
Cause of the confusion was apparently that the report finds that it is inevitable by now that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will overshoot the future stabilization level that would keep us below 2 º C warming .
But this overshooting of greenhouse gas concentrations need not lead temperatures to overshoot the 2 º C mark , provided it is only temporary .
It is like a pot of water on the stove – assume we set it to a small flame which will make the temperature in the pot gradually rise up to 70 ºC and then no further .
Currently , the water is at 40 ºC .
When I turn up the flame for a minute and then back down , this does not mean the water temperature will exceed 70 ºC , due to the inertia in the system .
So it is with climate – the inertia here is in the heat capacity of the oceans .
From a natural science perspective , nothing stops us from limiting warming to 2 ºC .
Even from an economic and technological point of view this is entirely feasible , as the report clearly shows .
The ball is squarely in the field of politics , where in December in Copenhagen the crucial decisions must be taken .
The synthesis report puts it like this : Inaction is inexcusable .

The first openly gay Episcopal bishop told a Studio City gathering today that the church should begin mending divisions over the issue of same - sex marriage by getting out of the civil marriage business altogether .
During a visit to St. Michael & All Angels Church this morning , Bishop V. Eugene Robinson said he favored the system used in France and other parts of Europe in which civil marriage -- performed by government officials -- is completely separate from religious vows .
In the U.S. , the civil and religious ceremonies are often combined with the cleric signing the government marriage license .
" In this country , it has become very confusing about where the civil action begins and ends and where the religious action begins and ends , because we have asked clergy to be agents of the state , " said Robinson , the bishop of New Hampshire .
Robinson , whose election six years ago was decried by some in the Episcopal church and praised by others , supports gay marriage and had his own civil commitment ceremony with his long - time partner blessed in the church last summer .
He said that " untangling " the roles of clergy and government would focus discussion of same - sex marriage on civil rights rather than religion .
" The church is infringing on the secular society and trying to enforce its beliefs onto the entire culture , " he said .
" If we can get these two things separated , we can assure every religious group , no matter how conservative , that they will never have to bless these marriages . "
" I think we could actually gain some support from our detractors if we could make this separation clear , " he said .
Robinson visited the Studio City church while in Los Angeles to receive an award from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation .

Members of the IEEE Task Group n ( TGn ) have finally , after years of bickering , agreed upon a completed specification for the next generation of wireless ( Wi -Fi ) networking - 802.11n ( currently known as ' Draft N ' , ' Draft 2.0 ' or just ' N ' if you 've brought any supporting wireless kit recently ) .
Most Wi -Fi kit these days supports up to 802.11g , which can deliver a typical network speed of just 54 Mbps , though using multiple channels and other technology this can be pushed up past 100 M bps .
By comparison 802.11n has greater range and a typical speed of around 100 to 130 Mbps , which can push up to 600 Mbps .
To date we 've yet to see anything claim more 450 M bps -( note : the real - world performance is often considerably less ) .
It 's understood that formal ratification of the 802.11n standard will be given in September , though we doubt it will have a huge impact given the mass of manufacturers with Draft 2.0 kit on the market .
It will be interesting to see how many developers deliver a firmware update to the final spec .
SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( AP )  U.S. military officials say a Yemeni detainee at Guantanamo Bay has died of an " apparent suicide . "
The Joint Task Force that runs the U.S. prison in Cuba says guards found 31 - year - old Muhammad Ahmad Abdallah Salih unresponsive and not breathing in his cell Monday night .
In a Tuesday statement , the military says the detainee was pronounced dead by a doctor after " extensive lifesaving measures had been exhausted . "
The Yemeni prisoner , known as Al - Hanashi has been held without charge at Guantanamo since February 2002 .
Military records show he was about 31 .
His is the fourth apparent suicide at Guantanamo .
The U.S. military says the remains will be autopsied by a pathologist from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology .

We ’ve seen Mosquito sized robots in Sci - fi movies that can go into Human body to provide inner insights and fix problems or introduce a new one ( like in matrix ) .
Alternatively , they act as a surveillence device .
Well , it ’s not far from reality , thanks to ITU ( Israel ’s Technion University ) , they have unveiled a tiny robot , made using Micro - Electro - Mechanical Systems ( MEMS ) technology .
It ’s capable of crawling through a human ’s veins to provide diagnosis and potentially treat artery blockage and cancer .
This Tiny Robot ( almost 1 mm in diameter ) is very different from the others we have seen so far .
This is powered by a unique source of energy , your body , and external Magnetic fields .
It has neither engine nor onboard controls , instead some very Techie coils that allows it to be propelled forward by a magnetic field wielded on it from outside the patient ’s body .
Controlling the tiny bot externally means that scientist have been able to shrink it to a previously impossibly tiny scale , allowing it to crawl its way through the typical human body ’s veins and arteries using miniscule outstretched arms which grip the vessel walls .
Too good to be believeable .
So What about difficulties in Movement ?
Scientists bet that the mini bot can even withstand massive blood flow and is able to push forward regardless of the magnetic field actuation direction , doing away with any need for exact localisation and direction retrieval .
The inbuilt controller can move the little crawly creature in increments , with its speed of up to nine millimeters a second regulated by varying external magnetic field frequencies .
Outside control also means the robot can be made to work for an unlimited amount of time , rather than suddenly – not to mention inconveniently – keeling over to die of battery failure in the middle of a medical procedure .
The team at ITU quotes :
A small cross sectional area on the tiny robot apparently allows fluids to flow with minimal interference making intra-vascular motion more feasible , and opening up the possibility of minimally invasive medical treatments , as well as diagnosis within the body .
Researchers are also apparently toying with the idea of attaching miniscule cameras to the bot , as well as other “ tools ” it may need to perform internal surgery .
What ’s Next ?
Technion researchers say they ’re also looking at putting the ant - like robot to work in urban water distribution systems , to look for any leaks that need plugging .
This could be like ants will monitor the current location with a reflective light of these swimming ants in water , if they move out of a specified co-ordinates of the path , there is a potential leak .
The researchers have work - in - progress to commercialize them .

OCCUPIED JERUSALEM
( AFP ) - Israel has handed control over much of a key Palestinian area in annexed East Jerusalem to hardline settler groups in a creeping takeover kept away from public scrutiny , a report by an activist group said on Thursday .
Government bodies have transferred both private Palestinian property and national parks in the Silwan neighbourhood outside the walls of the Old City to the settler organisation Elad , said Ir Amim , a non-profit group specialising in Jerusalem issues .
" It was done in the dark , in flagrant violation of the rules of good government and in some cases in violation of the law , without open and official decisions by the government or Knesset and without public discussion , inquiry or scrutiny , " said the report entitled " Shady Dealings in Silwan " .
Elad is dedicated to expanding Jewish ownership in Arab areas of East Jerusalem , which Israel captured from Jordan in 1967 and annexed in a move not recognised by the international community .
In Silwan , Elad has acted as an arm of the government for the past 20 years to gain control over a quarter of the land along its main thoroughfare , Wadi Hilweh or City of David .
" Silwan is a keystone to a sweeping and systematic process whose aim is to gain control of the Palestinian territories that surround the Old City , to cut the Old City off from the urban fabric of East Jerusalem and to connect it to Jewish settlement blocs " in the northeast , it said .
Elad 's impact in Silwan is hard to miss - dominating the city 's poorest neighbourhood is a gleaming new visitors ' centre and the Walls of Jerusalem national park , an archaeological exhibition .
In theory , the park is owned by the government , but the operator is Elad .
" The site is technically run by the Nature and Parks Authority but all the tour guides are actually Elad people , " says Ir Amim activist Orly Noy .
" People arrive here thinking they are at a regular government - run tourist site .
What they are actually hearing is the settlers ' agenda . "
The Parks Authority entrusted the running of the site to Elad in 1997 in what the report said was an opaque transaction instead of an open tender as required by law .
When the National Antiquities Authority discovered that important archaeological remains had been transferred to settlers , it objected and in 1999 the move was overturned in the high court .
But despite this verdict , the Parks Authority in 2002 handed control of the area back to Elad .
Elad wants to turn the Arab neighbourhood , where it says the palace of the biblical King David once stood , a claim disputed by most archaeologists , into a new Jewish heartland .
Such a move could spark violence , as Silwan 's location makes it a potential tinderbox in the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
It lies outside the walls of Al Haram Al Sharif , the Noble Sanctuary known to Jews as the Temple Mount , which is Judaism 's holiest and Islam 's third - holiest site and where a change in the status quo could provoke conflict .
" It 's like giving matches to pyromaniacs , " says Noy .
Elad 's hold on Silwan extends far beyond the walls of the park , with white and blue Israeli flags fluttering over several homes once owned by Palestinians .
Some properties were simply sold to Jewish groups .
But the report said others were often acquired by dubious means , including using forged documents .
Elad was founded and run by David Be'eri , a former deputy commander of an elite special forces unit in the Israeli army .
With Elad , he runs a ring of agents , including local Palestinians and at least one police officer , to scout opportunities to buy Arab houses , probing for weak points such as disputes between neighbours or debts .
Since the late 1980s Be'eri has worked with the Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) - a quasi - governmental body that buys and develops land for Jewish settlement - to evict Palestinians in Silwan , the report said .
Under an unwritten pact , Elad would agree to cover compensation for Silwan families which the JNF would then evict and then allow Elad to lease the homes to settlers at token cost , it said .
Elad has not moved settlers into all the houses it has bought for fear of sparking violence , the report said .
" If they moved in you would see blue and white all across Silwan , " Noy said .
Elad representatives declined to comment on the report .

This weekend , 40 years after man first landed on the Moon , more human beings than ever before are orbiting on a single spacecraft .
In 1969 , three men squeezed into Apollo 11's command module , a craft little bigger than a Mini .
Yesterday , the International Space Station , now as large as a four - storey house , yet speeding at 17,239 mph , took on board the crew of the shuttle Endeavour : 12 men , one woman – seven Americans , two Russians , two Canadians , one Japanese and a Belgian .
During a two - man space - walk , the crew added a four - ton porch – an outdoor shelf for experiments – to the station .
It is yet another small step in space exploration .
But next month , a far bigger one could be taken .
A panel of specialists will advise President Barack Obama on whether the US should embark on an ambitious 21st - century space programme that could see Americans return to the Moon , and eventually venture further to near - Earth asteroids and Mars .
It is an issue that rouses not just space enthusiasts but those who think the world should have other , greener priorities .

The President 's decision could instigate a space race , this time with China , that might be fiercer than anything seen in the Sixties rivalry with Russia .
The Chinese are not participating in the International Space Station , but Beijing is prepared to go it alone , declaring that it intends landing on the Moon by 2020 .
In September , with its manned spacecraft Shenzhou 7 , China became the third power to walk in space .
Russia has also committed to a major upgrade of its space capability , the first of the post - Soviet era .
Russian engineers have spent 105 days isolated in a mock spacecraft to test the stresses travellers may face on the 172 - million - mile journey to Mars .
Buzz Aldrin , the Apollo 11 veteran , and the second man to set foot on the Moon , told Fox News yesterday that America could aid its international partners in exploring the Moon and so free up its own spaceflight resources to develop systems for " even more ambitious goals " .
Once there is an international base on the Moon and in - space refuelling technology , he said , the US should concentrate on sending astronauts into deep space to visit the asteroid Apophis when it passes near Earth in 2021 .
After that , there is the possibility of a temporarily manned base on the Mars moon Phobos .
" By that time , we'd be ready to put people in a gradual permanence on Mars by 2031 , " Mr Aldrin added .
Next year , China 's first Mars probe will go into orbit around the planet after a 10 - month , 236 million mile journey .
There are also the lunar ambitions of India and Japan , plus the rivalry among companies for primitive commercial space flights .
Sir Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace are vying with each other to make the first suborbital flights .
Sir Richard has said that Virgin Galactic spaceships will be completed by December 2009 and are " on track to be carbon neutral " , with paying passengers by 2011 .
Yet tomorrow , on the anniversary of Neil Armstrong 's small but historic step , the question will be asked : are large - scale ventures into space justified when there are problems – possibly terminal ones – with Planet Earth ?
Is an enthusiasm for manned exploration compatible with tackling the environment , poverty , and diseases such as cancer and Aids ?
Or is it only when we reach out beyond our own world that we can maybe make the blue planet a truly green one ?
After all , in 2016 , the US energy firm Solaren plans to send a kilometre - wide panel into orbit to beam back energy .
James Lovelock , inventor of the Gaia theory , said : " I strongly support space travel .
The whole notion of Gaia came out of space travel .
It seems to me any environmentalist who opposes space travel has no imagination whatever .
That gorgeous , inspirational image of the globe that we are now so familiar with came out of space travel .
That image has perhaps been of the greatest value to the environmental movement .
It gave me a great impetus .
" There are the unmanned spacecraft , which are relatively inexpensive , that I certainly think should continue .
The more we know about Mars , for example , the better we can understand our own planet .
The second sort , the more personally adventurous sort of travel , offers great inspiration to humans .
And , were it not for space travel we'd have no mobile phones , no internet , no weather forecasts of the sort we have now and so on .
There 's a lot of puritanical silliness about it . "

Dr Steve Howard , the chief executive of the Climate Group , said : " I do n't think space travel is an ' either / or ' .
Sometimes we feel that we will have to stop other things if we go to the Moon or Mars , but man has always been an explorer .
At a time of global recession we have to budget and plan carefully and it needs to be a collaborative venture . "
Colin Pillinger , professor of planetary sciences at the Open University , said : " Every space mission has spin - offs which are unforeseeable .
The Wellcome Trust funded Beagle 2 on the understanding that the team of highly talented people would look at ways the technology could be used for medicine .
We have developed an instrument that can diagnose TB in a day .
Our instrument , which is going to be tested in Malawi , could save hundreds of thousands , if not millions of lives . "
But John Sauven , the executive director of Greenpeace UK , is sceptical .
He said : " Our argument is that Earth has n't been properly explored and understood yet .
I 'm not against space exploration , but it must n't be a trophy - collecting exercise for countries . "
A waste of money or a good investment ?
The Obama administration puts the cost of Project Constellation – the plan to put people back on the Moon – at $ 187bn ( £ 114bn ) .
That sum could , instead :
* Wipe out North Africa 's foreign debt of £ 70bn – and still have £ 44bn left over .
* Cover the costs of swine flu absenteeism for 10 weeks .
Experts put the toll of this at £ 1.5 bn a day .
* Pay for the Olympic 2012 construction costs of £ 9bn 12 times over .
But Professor Stephen Hawking says : " We need to renew our commitment to human spaceflight .
Robotic missions are cheaper , but if one is considering the future of humanity , we have to visit other worlds ourselves . "

Moving on …
I ’m really not a big fan of store - bought or even most restaurant pesto .
Something about it tastes stale or old … just not fresh .
Maybe they make it too far in advance , dentist maybe they heat it up too long before they use it .
I ’m not really sure – there ’s just something off about it .
I ’m lucky enough to live in a place where I can get fresh , local basil all year long .
But most of you have likely been on a fresh basil hiatus for a few months .
There ’s no better way to welcome it ’s arrival at the farmers market than fresh , homemade pesto .
Instead of the usual pasta , I dressed some garlic - sauteed shrimp in the fresh pesto .
Nestled on creamy Parmesan polenta and topped with crisp pancetta , this is one of my new favorite recipes .
It ’s bright and fresh and summery , but still hearty .
It ’s like a fancy - pants shrimp and grits .
I love it !
Pesto Shrimp w/ Pancetta & Parmesan Polenta
For the pesto :
2 cups fresh basil leaves
1 clove garlic
3 tbsp . toasted pine nuts ( toast them yourself in the oven for a few minutes )
1/2 cup good - quality olive oil
1 tbsp . lemon juice
1 tsp. salt
3 oz . sliced pancetta , diced
1 tbsp. olive oil
1 lb. peeled , de-veined shrimp
1 clove garlic
1.5 cups coarse grind polenta ( corn grits )
4.5 cups water
1 tbsp . salt
1/4 cup freshly ground Parmesan cheese
Make the pesto by pulsing the ingredients in a blender or food proccessor until all large pieces are gone .
If you do n’t have either , mince the garlic and basil as finely as possible and combine with the other ingredients .
Set aside .
Place the water , polenta and salt in a large sauce pan and set over high heat .
Once it comes to a rolling boil , cover and reduce the heat to medium low .
Let cook for 25 – 30 minutes , stirring occasionally .
When the polenta ’s done , stir in the Parmesan cheese and adjust the salt level if necessary .
While your polenta cooks , place a large skillet over medium - high heat and add the pancetta .
Cook the pancetta until it begins to brown and crisp .
Remove to a paper towel - covered plate with a slotted spoon .
Discard the drippings ( mine were too smoky to cook the shrimp in ) and wash your skillet .
Add the olive oil the skillet and return to the heat .
Saute your shrimp until just opaque , then add the garlic and saute for another minute .
Remove from the skillet and toss with 1/4 cup of the pesto .
Spoon the polenta into bowls , top with shrimp and sprinkle with pancetta .
Serve immediately .
Makes 4 servings .
But these conditions are kind of like eating at Taco Bell .
It may sound awesome in theory , but personal experience may leave you with internal bleeding .
Sometimes you hear on the news about weird medical conditions that actually cause more sex than normal .
And when you hear about the poor dude whose condition caused him to have sex with 300 women you think , hell , how do I catch that shit ?

Commonly referred to as nymphomania by Internet perverts and perverts who still eschew technology but like the idea just the same ; hypersexuality is what happens when your libido cranks the dial to 11 and leaves it there .
Frat guys throughout history have fantasized about dating a " total nympho , " thinking they 'll wind up with a special lady friend with a sex drive that rivals a three dicked hummingbird on E .
It 's been the subject of more Penthouse letters than can possibly be counted .
" And this one time , she tried to have sex with me while she was already having sex with me .
It was awesome . "
For menfolk , the condition is known as satyriasis , which is Greek for " having the wang of a goat - legged man " and it means you are now Wilt Chamberlain , minus the distraction of basketball .

Why it Would Suck :
A woman in the UK developed hyerpsexuality after suffering a massive brain hemorrhage , which seems like a really awesome superhero background story .
Not expected to live , she surprised everyone by waking up and trying to ride her husband like a Shetland pony .
Some of you guys are still rooting for the disorder at this point , but that 's because you 're probably assuming the " nympho " only has the hots for you .
Unfortunately , that 's not how compulsions work .
The victim estimates she boned about 50 random , and probably surprised , strangers in the two years since her accident .
Her husband frequently gets called home from work because she 's in the driveway trying to bone some random dude .
Nowadays she can no longer work , and her ability to focus is on par with an eight - year - old armed with a television remote which , in this case , is shaped like a wiener .

Yeah , it turns out pretty much anything can stop being fun once you 're only doing it due to a short - circuit in your brain .
And this is actually worse than say , compulsive over - eating or sleeping , because those do n't carry a stigma that will make you famous around the neighborhood and , well , on websites like this one .
American investigators probing anthrax outbreaks in Florida and New York believe they have all the hallmarks of a terrorist attack - and have named Iraq as prime suspect as the source of the deadly spores .
Their inquiries are adding to what US hawks say is a growing mass of evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved , possibly indirectly , with the 11 September hijackers .
If investigators ' fears are confirmed - and sceptics fear American hawks could be publicising the claim to press their case for strikes against Iraq - the pressure now building among senior Pentagon and White House officials in Washington for an attack may become irresistible .
Plans have been discussed among Pentagon strategists for US air strike support for armed insurrections against Saddam by rebel Kurds in the north and Shia Muslims in the south with a promise of American ground troops to protect the oilfields of Basra .
Contact has already been made with an Iraqi opposition group based in London with a view to installing its members as a future government in Baghdad .
Leading US intelligence sources , involved with both the CIA and the Defence Department , told The Observer that the ' giveaway ' which suggests a state sponsor for the anthrax cases is that the victims in Florida were afflicted with the airborne form of the disease .
' Making anthrax , on its own , is n't so difficult , ' one senior US intelligence source said .
' But it only begins to become effective as a biological weapon if they can be made the right size to breathe in .
If you can't get airborne infectivity , you can't use it as a weapon .
That is extremely difficult .
There is very little leeway .
Most spores are either too big to be suspended in air , or too small to lodge on the lining of the lungs . '
As claims about an Iraqi link grew , senior health officials in Britain revealed they warned all the country 's GPs last week to be vigilant about the disease .
' I think we have to be prepared to think the unthinkable , ' said the Government 's Chief Medical Officer , Dr Liam Donaldson .
The Department of Health confirmed the Government is conducting an urgent review of Britain 's ability to cope with chemical or biological attacks .
It also emerged last night that three people who worked in the Florida buildings at the centre of anthrax scares are now in the UK and undergoing tests for the disease .
And in America a letter sent from Malaysia to a Microsoft office was found to contain traces of anthrax .
In liquid form , anthrax is useless - droplets would fall to the ground , rather than staying suspended in the air to be breathed by victims .
Making powder needs repeated washings in huge centrifuges , followed by intensive drying , which requires sealed environments .
The technology would cost millions .
US intelligence believes Iraq has the technology and supplies of anthrax suitable for terrorist use .
' They are n't making this stuff in caves in Afghanistan , ' the CIA source said .
' This is prima facie evidence of the involvement of a state intelligence agency .
Maybe Iran has the capability .
But it does n't look likely politically .
That leaves Iraq .'
Scientists investigating the attacks say the bacteria used is similar to the ' Ames strain ' of anthrax originally cultivated at Iowa State University in the 1950s and later given to labs throughout the world , including Iraq .
According to sources in the Bush administration , investigators are talking to Egyptian authorities who say members of the al - Qaida network , detained and interrogated in Cairo , had obtained phials of anthrax in the Czech Republic .
Last autumn Mohamed Atta is said by US intelligence officials to have met in Prague an agent from Iraqi intelligence called Ahmed Samir al - Ahani , a former consul later expelled by the Czechs for activities not compatible with his diplomatic mission .
The Czechs are also examining the possibility that Atta met a former director of Saddam 's external secret services , Farouk Hijazi , at a second meeting in the spring .
Hijazi is known to have met Bin Laden .
It was confirmed yesterday that Jim Woolsey , CIA director from 1993 to 1996 , recently visited London on behalf of the hawkish Defence Department to ' firm up ' other evidence of Iraqi involvement in 11 September .
Some observers fear linking Saddam to the terrorist attacks is part of an agenda being driven by US hawks eager to broaden the war to include Iraq , a move being resisted by the British government .
The hawks winning the ear of President Bush is assembled around Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , his deputy Paul Wolfowitz , and a think tank , the Defence Policy Advisory Board , dubbed the ' Wolfowitz cabal ' .
Their strategy to target Iraq was hammered out at a two - day seminar in September , of which the dovish Secretary of State Colin Powell had no knowledge .
The result was a letter to President Bush urging the removal of Saddam as a precondition to the war .
' Failure to undertake such an effort , ' it said , ' will constitute a decisive surrender in the war against terrorism ' .
In a swipe at Powell 's premium on coalition - building , it continues : ' coalition building has run amok .
The point about a coalition is " can it achieve the right purpose ? " not " can you get a lot of members ? " '
Administration officials close to the group told The Observer : ' We see this war as one against the virus of terrorism .
If you have bone marrow cancer , it 's not enough to just cut off the patient 's foot .
You have to do the complete course of chemotherapy .
And if that means embarking on the next Hundred Years '
War , that 's what we 're doing . '
Saddam Hussein says he never used body doubles for public appearances US investigators have released accounts of the questioning of Saddam Hussein , offering a goldmine of historical and personal details on the Iraqi leader .
The documents released under freedom of information rules are from interviews and informal conversations he had in US custody with the FBI in early 2004 .
Saddam Hussein said he refused to allow UN weapons inspectors into Iraq to stop Iran knowing how weak it had become .
And he scoffed at reports that he used body doubles to confuse assassins .
The former Iraqi leader was interviewed by Arabic - speaking FBI agent George Piro after his capture nine months after the US - led invasion of Iraq .
In [ Saddam Hussein's ] opinion , UN inspectors would have directly identified to the Iranians where to inflict maximum damage to Iraq
FBI document
National Security Archive Saddam interviews
He was later tried by an Iraqi special tribunal , found guilty of crimes against humanity and hanged in December 2006 .
Among the fascinating personal detail contained in the accounts , the imprisoned former leader says he only remembered making two phone calls after March 1990 and changed his location every day .
He also revealed that the farm in northern Iraq where he was captured in December 2003 , was the same place where he had found refuge after taking part in a failed coup attempt in 1959 .
He expresses a love of the famous southern Iraqi marshes , which he says he had drained for strategic reasons as well as to save the inhabitants from insanitary conditions during the summer .
Iranian threat Saddam Hussein is identified as High Value Detainee # 1 in the documents .
These recount interviews between February and June 2004 at in his detention cell at Baghdad International Airport , which formerly bore his name .
He laughed and stated , ' This is movie magic not reality '
Saddam Hussein , on body doubles
The former leader appears to view Iran as the biggest threat to Iraq , which was why he says he kept UN inspectors out in the late 1990s , even though he had already got rid of all his weapons of mass destruction .
He preferred to risk American anger , he said , than to let Iran know how weak Iraq had become .
" In his opinion , the UN inspectors would have directly identified to the Iranians where to inflict maximum damage to Iraq , " one document says .
Saddam Hussein said he allowed the inspectors in later , in the hope of heading off the invasion in 2003 , but by then it was too late because the US had already made up its mind to attack .
He admitted it was a mistake not to have allowed the UN to document Iraq 's destruction of its weapons of mass destruction , which he said had been completed by 1998 .
That process , he said , had left Iraq weakened , while Iran was free to develop its armaments .
Denial Saddam Hussein denied US suggestions that he was linked with al - Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden , who he calls a " zealot " .
Interviews were before Saddam first appeared in court on 1 July 2004 Separately he cites North Korea as his most likely ally in a crunch , according to the documents .
He takes personal responsibility for ordering the launching of Scud missiles against Israel during the 1991 Gulf War , blaming Israel and its influence on the US for " all the problems of the Arabs " .
And he lists among his achievements development of Iraq from a very low base and survival through the devastating eight - year war with Iran and 12 years of UN sanctions .
When asked whether he had ever used " doubles " as discussed in books and other publications , " he laughed and stated , ' This is movie magic not reality ' . "
The documents have been made public by the National Security Archive , a non-governmental research institute .
An accompanying NSA commentary says there is no new information about Iraq 's complicated relationship with the US , such as Washington 's covert backing for his regime until the invasion of Kuwait in 1990 .

Two brothers in Rio are living over the edge — literally : sleeping , working and eating on the side of a building 33 feet up in the air .
Brazilian artists Gabriel and Tiago Primo have created a wall with several pieces of home furniture attached to it .
( Pics )
The wall is on the side of a building and features tables , a cabinet , a bed , a sofa and even a hammock .
The classic Brazilian essence is captured in the bright colors that the wall is painted in , which stands out from the rest of the dull building .
The brothers have been hanging out wall - side since the end of May .
They plan to continue the display until Aug. 20 .

Bottom Line
Apache Hive is a specialized execution front end for Hadoop .
Hive lets you write data queries in an SQL - like language -- the Hive Query Language ( HQL ) -- that are converted to map / reduced tasks , which are then executed by the Hadoop framework .
You 're using Hadoop , but it feels like you 're talking SQL to an RDBMS .
Suppose you want to run regular statistical analyses on your Web site 's traffic log data -- several hundred terabytes , updated weekly .
( Do n't laugh .
This is not unheard of for popular Web sites . )
You 're already familiar with Hadoop ( see InfoWorld 's review ) , the open source distributed processing system that would be ideal for this task .
But you do n't have time to code Hadoop map / reduce functions ?
Perhaps you 're not the elite programmer that everyone in the office thinks you are .
What you 'd like to do is dump all that information into a database , and execute a set of SQL queries on it .
But the quantity of data would overwhelm even an enterprise - level RDBMS .
[ Read the InfoWorld Test Center 's hands - on account of working with Amazon Elastic MapReduce and Amazon Web Services .
| Keep abreast of cloud computing news by visiting InfoWorld 's Cloud Computing channel . ]
This is precisely the problem that engineers at Facebook encountered .
They became interested in Hadoop as a means of processing their Web site 's traffic data that was generating terabytes per day , was growing , and was overtaxing their Oracle database .
Though they were happy with Hadoop , they wanted to simplify its use so that engineers could express frequently used analysis operations in SQL .
The resulting Hadoop - based data warehouse application became Hive , and it helps to process more than 10 TB of Facebook data daily .
Now Hive is available as an open source subproject of Apache Hadoop .
Inside the Hive
Written in Java , Hive is a specialized execution front end for Hadoop .
Hive lets you write data queries in an SQL - like language -- the Hive Query Language ( HQL ) -- that are converted to map / reduced tasks , which are then executed by the Hadoop framework .
You 're using Hadoop , but it feels like you 're talking SQL to an RDBMS .
Employing Hadoop 's distributed file system ( HDFS ) as data storage , Hive inherits all of Hadoop 's fault tolerance , scalability , and adeptness with huge data sets .
When you run Hive , you are deposited into a shell , within which you can execute Hive Data Definition Language ( DDL ) and HQL commands .
A future version of Hive will include JDBC and ODBC drivers , at which time you will be able to create fully executable " Hive applications " in much the same way that you can write a Java database application for your favorite RDBMS .
( The current version of Hive -- 0.3.0 -- does have limited support for JDBC , but can only dispatch queries and fetch results . )
To install Hive , you simply install Hadoop and add a couple of download and configuration steps .
( To install Hadoop , the best tutorial I 've found is on Michael Noll 's blog . )
Or if you 'd rather just get straight to testing Hive without all the installation nonsense , you can download a VMware virtual machine image with Hadoop and Hive pre-installed .
The virtual machine image is featured in an excellent Hive tutorial video available at the same Web site .
Now We 're Cooking ... with Pot ! And We Don't Mean Enameled Dutch Ovens
In my years of getting stoned , I 've found that there are generally two types of stoners : the industrious stoners and the lazy stoners .
There are the folks who smoke a joint before alphabetizing their record collection , cleaning the bathroom grout with a toothbrush , or designing dynamic and user - friendly computer programs .
These are people who , despite a full - time job and maintaining a grow - house , still manage to whip up a marijuana - spiked flourless chocolate cake for a weekday dinner party .
These people are successful , productive , and yet somehow , constantly stoned .
Then there are , of course , the people like myself : the lazy stoners .
We enjoy sharing a doober , making nachos , then watching two hours of Family Guy and Two and a Half Men reruns .
The culinary feats we dazzle our friends with include frozen pizzas , spaghetti and meatballs , and occasionally flipping a few flapjacks on a Sunday afternoon .
But thankfully for us , there are lots of easy ways to bring that big bag of marijuana into the kitchen , and none of them require a Moroccan couscoussière .
But whether you 're a magician in a kitchen , or your best dish is a jar of bean dip , we 've got recipes that will keep you from stressing about the holidays — and instead , drifting through them in a giggly stupor .
After all , it 's going to be a long , dark winter .
So let 's pass the time in a productive and enjoyable way — by throwing a party and experimenting with drugs .
But please be a responsible host and let your guests know if the food is loaded .
RECIPES FOR THE GANJA GOURMET
Bud Butter
illustration by Jeremy Eaton
Though preparing marijuana butter can take an entire afternoon , you can store it for future projects .
Even lazy stoners might want to take a stab at whipping up a batch of the THC - laden butter — it lasts a long time and can be used anywhere you 'd use regular old butter .
The possibilities are endless !
What you 'll need :
1 gallon water
1 pound butter
1 ounce or more of marijuana shake
1 large cooking pot
1 large bowl
Put the water , marijuana , and butter into a large pot and bring to a boil .
Reduce heat and let simmer up to five hours .
Turn heat off and run the mixture through a fine metal strainer or cheesecloth into a bowl .
Squeeze cheesecloth to remove whatever butter you can from the marijuana .
Discard the weed when you 're done .
Put the bowl of hot water and butter in the fridge or freezer .
When the butter hardens , dump out the water , microwave the butter a bit , and then transfer to a Tupperware container .
The butter will keep for several weeks .
Marijuana Milk
Like marijuana butter , marijuana milk has countless purposes .
Use it in milkshakes or pancakes , or better yet , homemade hot chocolate spiked with Baileys .
Now that should give you enough assistance to get through even the most mind - numbing family gatherings .
What you 'll need :
One quart milk
One eighth to one quarter marijuana shake
One medium - sized cooking pot
Pour the milk and sweet leaf into your pot .
Bring to a boil .
Reduce heat and simmer for about an hour .
Thrill your guests with herby mashed potatoes that will blow their minds .
Stoner Suds
For the home - brewers who are suddenly everywhere , throwing some weed in your brew is sure to make holiday parties more surreal .
( Look , all your coworkers are totally fucked up ! )
For five gallons of beer , boil about a half - ounce of weed in water , then simmer for about two hours .
Then add the weed and water mix to a high - alcohol brew that is almost done fermenting .
Give it a couple days and you 're ready to bottle and drink .
Pot Truffles
These pot truffles are insanely rich and delicious , and the chocolate flavor goes great with the pot .
What you 'll need :
6 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
An 8 - ounce package of cream cheese
1/8 ounce of weed
3 tablespoons instant coffee
2 teaspoons water
1/4 cup pot butter
double boiler or microwave - safe bowl
Melt four cups of the chocolate chips and the weed in a microwave or double boiler .
Remove from heat and mix in cream cheese , coffee , and water .
Chill in the fridge for about an hour until the mix is firm enough to shape into one - inch balls .
Place on wax paper and place in freezer for another hour until very firm .
In microwave or double boiler , melt final two cups of chocolate chips and butter .
When smooth , drop a few frozen balls at a time into the chocolate mixture and stir quickly .
Remove the balls quickly and put on wax paper lined cookie sheet .
Allow time to cool and harden .
RECIPES FOR THE LAZY STONER
Chocolate Chip Pot Cookies
This is a favorite recipe that tastes great while requiring almost no cooking skill .
What you 'll need :
1 roll pre-made cookie dough
1/4 ounce of weed
spice grinder
baking sheet
Throw your weed into spice grinder and grind until it is fine dust .
Cut slices from your cookie dough log and coat each slice in marijuana dust .
Put cookies slices on greased baking sheet and follow the baking instructions on the package .

But then again , you might have fun on the way down .
What you 'll need :
One fifth of vodka
1/4 ounce marijuana
fine mesh strainer
Pour vodka and weed into a saucepan .
Heat slowly without boiling for 15 minutes .

Our identity , the information that makes us unique , is something that we get called upon to prove each day , when we are opening a bank account , renting a flat , proving our right to work .
It is this unique information that fraudsters and criminals want and this is why we guard it so carefully .
Shredding machines , once only found in offices , are now found in many homes as people protect their personal information by destroying personal bank and billing information .
The introduction of identity cards is a simple means of helping you , and I , protect our unique identity from fraudsters .
Identity fraud costs the UK economy £ 1.2bn on average each year and causes misery for tens of thousands who fall victim .
At a cost of just £ 30 , the identity card is a cheap way of helping fight back .
So , despite the headlines that would have readers think otherwise , I 'm not scrapping identity cards – I 'm committed to delivering them more quickly to the people who will benefit most .
I know that some of you have real concerns about the government 's motives for introducing the card .
When I announced this week that I would make identity cards wholly voluntary it was because I believe that there are real benefits that will make the card an attractive proposition for many people .
I think the case for identity cards has been made , but understand that getting a card will be a big decision for some people .
Easy or hard , I think it should be a voluntary decision , one that people choose to take , because they agree and welcome the benefits an identity card will provide .
In particular , I 'm pleased that the government will be looking at bringing forward proposals for pensioners aged 75 and over to receive an identity card free of charge .
I also want to see young people with identity cards .
They will not only act as a proof of age for the individual but also empower communities tackling underage drinking and crime by enabling local retailers , including pubs and supermarkets , to help ensure they are n't selling restricted goods , such as knives and alcohol , to those who are underage .
And this is why I have taken the decision to speed up the rollout of identity cards by announcing that alongside people in Manchester , residents in the wider north - west will also be able to apply for a card in the new year .
People believe in protecting what they have and what they have worked hard to achieve – a good name and a good credit rating .
Being able to protect your identity from fraudsters who would use and abuse it is something we all want and I think identity cards can achieve this .

I regularly read the Huffington Post , for the good reason that it often sports intelligent articles written from a progressive standpoint , and because I believe in open access and open contribution to the socio-political discourse ( otherwise , I would n’t bother writing this blog ) .
Then again , one of the drawbacks of openness is that you get crap together with the good stuff .
This is n’t altogether bad , since reading crap is a necessary component of developing one ’s own sense of critical thinking , sharpening the baloney detector , so to speak .
But crap needs to be responded to , especially when it comes from influential sources .
Hence this column on good old Deepak Chopra ( he of quantum mysticism fame ) defending Oprah Winfrey from the attacks of a “ struggling news magazine ” ( Newsweek ) which recently dared criticizing Oprah for endorsing and promoting pseudomedicine — most famously by lending ample tv time to Jenny McCarthy , the former Playboy model who maintains against all evidence that vaccines cause autism .
Ok , Deepak , here we go .
Chopra complains that Newsweek adopts “ the same tiresome blend of gotcha journalism and selective fact - reporting that fills tabloid coffers , ” which is a stunning case of the pot calling the kettle black if you go on and read the remainder of Chopra ’s own piece in the Post .
Be that as it may , we then find out that “ [ Oprah ’s ] intention to improve women 's lives on all fronts is so obvious as to be almost above criticism . ”
Really ?
I have no reason to doubt Ms. Winfrey ’s intentions , but surely Deepak has heard that the road to hell is often paved with good intentions , no ?
But you see , “ the fact that she has celebrity guests who have causes and crusades in the area of health , such as Jenny McCarthy or Suzanne Somers , is not the same as Oprah herself endorsing what they say . ”
Well , if you actually watch Oprah ( which I sometimes do while working out at the gym ) she is strongly endorsing McCarthy and Somers , as it is made clear by the continuous nodding and words of encouragement that Winfrey utters every time these quacks are on her show , or by her sometimes vehement dismissal of their critics .
A major argument deployed by Chopra is that “ [ Oprah ] brings up creative solutions to problems that medical science is baffled by , such as the healing response itself and the role of subjectivity in patient response .
...
Do subjective changes affect healing ?
Obviously they do , or we would n't have the placebo effect , which comes into play at least 30 % of the time in illness . ”
He then goes on to show proof of what he is saying by citing a study ( conducted by mainstream medical researchers , incidentally ) , showing that “ on average , acupuncture patients received twice as much benefit as those on standard treatment [ anti- inflammatory drugs or a massage ] .
The kicker is that some of the patients received fake acupuncture — they were pricked superficially with toothpicks — and received the same relief . ”
Now let us stop for a moment and analyze the above .
First off , Chopra does not seem to understand the placebo effect .
As Harriet Hall explained in a recent issue of eSkeptic , the 30 % figure ( which is actually 35 % ) derives from a 1955 study published in the ( decidedly non “ alternative ” ) Journal of the American Medical Association , and authored by Henry Beecher ( a non-alternative MD ) .
But the figure of 35 % refers to the cumulative effect of everything that is not treatment , which includes not just the actual placebo effect , but more importantly a large component deriving from the body ’s natural ( evolved , not mystical ) ability to heal itself .
Indeed , a more recent study by Asbjorn Hrobjartsson and Peter Gotzsche published in 2001 in the New England Journal of Medicine properly compared the improvement achieved with no treatment to the improvement due to the placebo effect , and found little measurable effect of the placebo .
This does n’t mean that the placebo effect does n’t occur , just that it is much more limited than the “ 30 % ” figure mentioned by Chopra , who apparently does n’t bother reading the medical literature before making his spectacularly misinformed pronouncements .
Moreover , a rational person would conclude from the study of “ real ” and “ fake ” acupuncture that there is no such thing as real acupuncture !
If pricking patients with toothpicks has the same effect as inserting needles , would n’t you surmise that the whole thing is in fact the result of placebo and natural healing , no acupuncture required thank you very much ?
Chopra criticizes the “ medical establishment ” for being slow to explore new treatments , and cites the case of American doctors who have finally begun considering lumpectomies in place of the much more drastic mastectomies in cases of breast cancer .
I am no fan of the health industry , and particularly of the pharmaceutical industry , especially as they are run in this country .
But , please notice that the increase in interest in lumpectomies was the result of rigorous studies published by European researchers in peer reviewed journals .
Nothing whatsoever to do with “ alternative ” medicine , whatever that means .
One more example , which perfectly embodies Chopra ’s “ logic , ” such as it is .
The mysticism that he promotes ( and handsomely profits from ) needs “ mystery , ” as in things that official science does n’t understand .
Otherwise he could n’t sell his quackery as an “ alternative . ”
So he cites , predictably , the mind - body connection , as in the following stunning passage : “ So let me offer a typical finding that comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , among other official sources .
It concerns the effect of child abuse and other adverse circumstances on later health .
Is it ‘ soul talk ’ to believe that a child raised around parents who abuse substances , who suffer from mental illness , or who outright abuse the child will suffer health risks later in life ?
According to the CDC study , covering 15,000 HMO members in San Diego between 1995 - 97 , the risk of contracting an autoimmune disease as an adult is increased from 70 % to 100 % if you happened to be abused as a child or grow up with adverse home conditions .
...
This study suggests a human connection rather than a biological one . ”
A human rather than biological connection ?
What does Chopra think human beings are , if not biological organisms ?
And notice , again , that the source of the study is a perfectly mainstream organization , the federally funded CDC .
And no , no scientist in his right mind would dismiss this as crazy ‘ soul talk , ’ because the idea of a connection between stress and health has been accepted and explored experimentally by biologists in both humans and other animals for decades .
Indeed , if you are a dualist ( as in “ mind - body ” ) like Chopra you actually have a hard time explaining exactly how is it possible that the mind and the body are thus connected ( a much bigger mind , Rene Descartes , tried and miserably failed ) .
But if you are an old - fashioned materialist scientist you actually expect a connection between “ mind ” and “ body ” because they are both the results of biological functions .
I ’m sorry , Mr. Chopra , but that little “ struggling news magazine ” actually did something that takes gall these days : they questioned the nonsense sputtered by a celebrity with no medical training whatsoever in the name of protecting the public ’s health and welfare .
It may be tiresome journalism , but it is the only kind of journalism worth reading .
( Newser ) – Roger Penske , the racecar driver turned business tycoon , will buy the Saturn brand and dealer network from GM .
The deal will save 350 - plus dealerships and some 13,000 jobs if it goes through , the bankrupt parent company said in confirming the tentative agreement .
The price is between $ 100 million and $ 200 million , a source told Bloomberg .
Under the deal , which could close as soon as the third quarter of this year , GM will continue to supply vehicles to Saturn for 2 years , after which the Penske - owned company will import its stock , the Detroit News reports .
The supplier is n't set yet , but the agreement wo n't be a long - term one , Penske vowed : " Our ultimate goal is to have those vehicles built in the US , " he said .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A contrite head of the Federal Protective Service took the blame Wednesday for security lapses that allowed covert investigators to sneak bomb components into 10 federal government buildings .
A GAO report cites lax security in federal buildings after investigators got bomb components past guards .
The Government Accountability Office , which conducted the tests , testified that they showed the service to be " an agency in crisis . "
Plainclothes investigators testing the effectiveness of private contract guards at federal office buildings were able to smuggle in bomb components in all 10 attempts .
Only one investigator was stopped and questioned , but he was allowed to pass with the components of a liquid bomb .
Once inside the facilities , the testers assembled the bombs in restrooms , put them in briefcases and " walked freely " into government offices , according to the Government Accountability Office .

Asked point - blank at a Senate hearing Wednesday why the security guards had failed , Protective Service Director Gary Schenkel said , " It 's purely a lack of oversight on our part . "
He added , " I take full responsibility .
I am the director of the organization . "
Schenkel , who assumed his post in early 2007 , said the police force was hampered earlier this decade by major budget cuts , which forced the agency to reorganize how it protects 9,000 federal facilities nationwide .
Although police officers formerly protected federal buildings , the agency now uses a core cadre of 1,200 sworn federal officers or " inspectors " to oversee a small army of about 13,000 private security guards who man the X - ray machines and magnetometers at building entrances .
Department of Homeland Security put out an official statement Wednesday focusing on steps the Federal Protective Service is taking to improve the situation , but Schenkel was at times more negative , outlining some of the problems the agency faces .
The service , he said , used a " stubby pencil " system to keep track of guards , and it would take a " full year , I believe " for changes being made now to have an effect .
" When I came here , I made an analogy that we were a ship , and it takes 38 miles at sea to turn a ship , an aircraft carrier .
I think we are probably on mile six , but we 've certainly initiated the turn , " he said .
Mark Goldstein of the Government Accountability Office testified about the investigators ' operations .
" We brought in all the components that we needed to make a real bomb , " he said , though the concentration of explosives was " below the trigger point " for safety reasons .
Investigators obtained the components at local stores and over the Internet for less than $ 150 , the report says .
" In a number of the locations -- three or four of them -- the guards were not even looking at the screens that would show materials passing through , " Goldstein said .
" If a guard had been looking , they would have seen materials that are ordinarily not brought into a federal building , and should have stopped our investigators and asked , ' Why are you bringing these kinds of things into a fed building , and what is your purpose ? '
But in really no case did that occur .
" In only one instance did a guard ask about something that an investigator was carrying , [ and ] after a brief explanation , that guard let it go through , " Goldstein said .
The covert agents then assembled bombs in the bathrooms , he said .
" In some cases , bathrooms were locked , but federal employees let us in , " he said .
Having assembled the bomb , typically in less than four minutes , the agents placed it an a briefcase " and walked around a variety of federal offices -- both legislative branch offices and executive branch offices in the four cities we went to , " Goldstein said .
He blamed the lapses on an " antiquated approach " to security , saying federal building security is directed in part by the buildings ' tenants , who form a committee to determine the appropriate level of security .
So decisions are made " by people who , frankly , ought not be making them , " he said .
He also said security is " budget - driven ; it 's not risk - driven . "
But he shied away from recommending that the contract security jobs be federalized , a move the government took for airport security screeners following the September 11 terrorist attacks .
That would be a policy decision , he said .
But he said the Protective Service was lax in assuring that security standards it set were followed by the private contract guards .
Of 663 randomly selected guards , 411 , or 62 percent , were missing some form of required certification , such as an up - to - date firearm qualification , background investigation or CPR or first aid training .
Included in the Government Accountability Office report is a photograph of a guard asleep at his post .
The report also detailed an instance in which a woman placed an infant in a carrier on an X - ray machine while retrieving identification .
Because the guard was not paying attention and the machine 's safety features had been disabled , the infant was sent through the X - ray machine , according to the report .
The Protective Service dismissed the guard , who sued the agency for failing to provide X - ray training .
The agency lost the suit because it could not prove that the guard had been trained , the report says .
In one region , the service " has not provided the required eight hours of [ X - ray ] or magnetometer training to its 1,500 guards since 2004 , " the report says .
It report also says the service does not have a national guidance on how often its inspectors should check on the contract guards .
In several instances , when inspectors have checked on guards , they found " instances of guards not complying with post orders . "
In one case , the report says , a guard was caught using government computers to manage a for - profit adult Web site .
All of the buildings involved in the bomb smuggling test were " Level IV " buildings , meaning they house more than 450 federal employees and have a high volume of public contact .
The Government Accountability Office has declined to identify the specific buildings " because of the sensitivity of some of the information , " the report says .
After the report was obtained by CNN late Tuesday , ahead of its release Wednesday , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , I - Connecticut , chairman of the Homeland Security Committee , called the test results " simply unacceptable . "
Added Sen. Susan Collins , R - Maine , " In this post - 9/11 world that we 're now living in , I can not imagine how security lapses of this magnitude were allowed to occur . "
Both Lieberman and Collins said they were putting the Federal Protective Service on a list of " high - risk " agencies and asked Schenkel to provide them with details of how he would fix the security lapses .
Although the investigators ensured that bombs assembled in the buildings would not explode , they later videotaped the detonation of several of the devices at a remote site to demonstrate the their destructive power .

A Dutch - Japanese phrase book , compiled in 1770 for a trade legation from Holland -- the only Westerners permitted to reside on Japanese soil by the xenophobic shoguns -- had a mere 80 phrases .
Its brevity suggests a paring down to the absolute essentials of speech needed to get by with the locals .
Yet eight of the phrases -- an eye - catching 10 % of the total -- pertained to hiring the services of female companions .
These included a scripted exchange that would not be out of place in one of the more free - wheeling modern guidebooks for Western travelers to Thailand , say , or the Philippines : " Do you like that girl ? / Yes , ...

Like most contributors , he prefers to remain anonymous .
The media punishment that Joe the Plumber received has much to do with this nearly universal reticence .
A week before that , I heard from another excellent contributor , Mr. Midwest .
Their collective contribution should dispel the doubts of all but the willfully blind that Ayers played a substantial role , likely the primary role , in the writing of Dreams .
As a reminder , there is no reliable computer science for determining authorship .
In assessing the value of the existing science , think polygraph , not DNA .
Polygraph - level scholarship may suffice for harmless speculation about the authorship of Midsummer 's Night Dream , but not for Dreams From My Father .
Too much is at stake for the latter .
The experts in the field have told me to stick with old - fashioned literary detective work , and I have done just that .
Mr , Midwest has helped .
His most recent contribution is a good example of keen - eyed detection .
Going forward , I will be referring to five books .
These include Ayers ' 1993 To Teach , his 1997 A Kind and Just Parent ( shorthand : Parent ) , his 2001 memoir Fugitive Days , and Obama 's 1995 Dreams From My Father ( Dreams ) .
Casual critics of this research have repeated the canard that I attributed both Obama books , Dreams and the 2006 Audacity of Hope ( Audacity ) , to Ayers .
I never have .
From the beginning , I have asserted that the two books appear to have two different authors , and so I will leave Audacity out of the equation until the end .
What Mr. Midwest noticed recently is that both Ayers in Parent and Obama in Dreams make reference to the poet Carl Sandburg .
In itself , this is not a grand revelation .
Let us call it a C - level match .
Obama and Ayers seem to have shared the same library in any case .
Both talk of reading the books of Malcolm X , James Baldwin , Langston Hughes , W.E.B. Dubois and Frantz Fanon among others .
In fact , each misspells " Frantz " as " Franz . "
Ayers and Obama , however , go beyond citing Sandburg .
Each quotes the opening line of his poem " Chicago . "
From Dreams :
He poured himself more hot water .
" What do you know about Chicago anyway ? "
I thought a moment .
" Hog butcher to the world , " I said finally .
From Parent :
" At the turn of the century , Chicago had a population of a million people and was a young and muscular city - hub of commerce and industry , the first skyscraper city , home of the famous world exposition , " hog butcher to the world " - bursting with energy . "
This I would call a B - level match .
What raises it up a notch to an A - level match is the fact that both misquote " Chicago , " and they do so in exactly the same way .
The poem actually opens , " Hog butcher for the world . "
Last week , the first email I received from Mr. West had in the message box " 759 striking similarities between Dreams and Ayers ' works . "
This claim seemed so outsized I did not take it seriously .
When I was unable to open the documents , I emailed Mr. West back , asked him to reformat , and then forgot about the email .
He resent his documents a few days later .
This time I was able to open them and was promptly blown away .
Mr. West 's analysis was systematic , comprehensive , and utterly , totally , damning .
Of the 759 matches , none were frivolous .
All were C - level or above , and I had no doubt of their authenticity .
I had been gathering many of them in my own reserve waiting for a book - length opportunity to make my case .
Mr. West had done the heavy lifting .
He even indexed his matches .
This represented months of works .
As I learned , he had been patiently gathering material since November when he first began building on my own research .
I read through all 759 matches and culled out those that I would consider B - Level or above .
There were 180 of these .
As a control , I tested them against my own 2006 book Sucker Punch , like Dreams and Fugitive Days a memoir that deals extensively with race .
In that I am closer to Ayers in age , race , education , family and cultural background than Obama is , our styles should have had more chance of matching .
They do n't .
Of the 180 examples , I matched , strictly speaking , on six .
Even by the most generous standard , we matched on only sixteen .
Let me just cite a few matches between Ayers ' work and Dreams that I found intriguing .
Rather astonishingly , as Mr. West points out , at least six of the characters in Dreams have the same names as characters in Ayers ' books : Malik , Freddy , Tim , Coretta , Marcus , and " the old man . "
Many of the stories involving these characters in Dreams seem as contrived as their names .
In one instance , Obama reflects on his own first days as a ten year - old at his Hawaiian prep school , a transition complicated by the presence of " Coretta , " the only other black student in the class .
When the other students accuse Obama of having a girlfriend , Obama shoves Coretta and insists that she leave him alone .
Although " his act of betrayal " buys him a reprieve from the other students , Obama understands that he " had been tested and found wanting . "
Ayers relates a parallel story in Parent .
He tells of a useful reading assignment from the 1992 book , The Kind of Light That Shines on Texas , by black author Reginald McKnight .
The passage in question deals with the travails of Clint , the first black student in a newly integrated school , who repudiates Marvin , the only other black boy in the school .
Upon reflection , Clint thinks , " I was ashamed .
Ashamed for not defending Marvin and ashamed that Marvin even existed . "
As Mr. Midwest pointed out in a recent missive , Ayers ' interest in education bleeds into Dreams .
The tip - off once again is the contrived name , in this case " Asante Moran , " likely an homage to the Afro-centric educator , Molefi Kete Asante .
Moran lectures Obama and his pal " Johnny " on the nature of public education .
" The first thing you have to realize , " he said , looking at Johnnie and me in turn , " is that the public school system is not about educating black children .
Never has been .
Inner -city schools are about social control .
Period . "
" Social control " is an Ayers ' bugaboo .
" The message to Black people was that at any moment and for any reason whatsoever your life or the lives of your loved ones could be randomly snuffed out , " he writes in Fugitive Days .
" The intention was social control through random intimidation and unpredictable violence . "
In Dreams , " Moran " elaborates on the fate of the black student , " From day one , what 's he learning about ?
Someone else 's history .
Someone else 's culture .
Not only that , this culture he 's supposed to learn is the same culture that 's systematically rejected him , denied his humanity . "
If this character were real , and Obama had actually met him , there would be no reason to phony up his name .
In fact , however , Moran is spouting exactly the same educational philosophy that Ayers does in To Teach .
" Underneath it all , " Ayers says of standard school textbooks , " the social studies and literature texts reflected and promoted white supremacy .
There were no pictures or photographs of African Americans . . . there was throughout an assumed superiority and smug celebration of the status quo . "
Both authors , by the way , use the phrase " beneath the surface " repeatedly .
And what they find beneath the surface , of course , is the disturbing truth about power disparities in the real America , which each refers to as an " imperial culture . "
Speaking of which , both insist that " knowledge " is " power " and seem consumed by the uses or misuses of power .
Ayers , in fact , evokes the word " power " and its derivatives 75 times in Fugitive Days , Obama 83 times in Dreams .
More exotically , both authors evoke images of a " boy " riding on the backs of a " water buffalo " and prodding the beast not just with sticks , but with " bamboo sticks . "
Ayers places his boy in Vietnam .
Obama puts his in Indonesia .
Both authors link Indonesia with Vietnam .
In each case , clueless officials - plural -- with the " State Department " try to explain how the march of communism through " Indochina " will specifically imperil " Indonesia . "
The Ayers account , however , at least sounds vaguely real .
The Obama account sounds like an Ayers ' memory imposed on Obama 's mother .
She allegedly discussed these geo-political strategy sessions in Indonesia with her pre-teen son .
Ayers and his radical friends were obsessed with Vietnam .
It defined them and still does .
To reflect their superior insight into that country , they have shown a tendency to use " Mekong Delta " as synecdoche , the part that indicates the whole .
In Fugitive Days , for instance , Ayers envisions " a patrol in the Mekong Delta " when he conjures up an image of Vietnam .
Ayers ' wife , Bernadine Dohrn , pontificated about " a hamlet called My Lai " in a 1998 interview , but to flash her radical chops , she located it " in the middle of the Mekong Delta , " which is in reality several hundred miles from My Lai .
Given Obama 's age , " Mekong Delta " was not likely a part of his vocabulary , but that does not stop him from writing about " the angry young men in Soweto or Detroit or the Mekong Delta . "
Ayers , of course , would also have had a much deeper connection than Obama to " Detroit , " whose historic riot took place shortly before Obama 's sixth birthday .
Ayers worked in Detroit the year after those same riots .
Returning to the exotic , in his Indonesian backyard Obama discovered two " birds of paradise " running wild as well as chickens , ducks , and a " yellow dog with a baleful howl . "
In Fugitive Days , there is even more " howling " than there is in Dreams .
Ayers places his " birds of paradise " in Guatemala .
He places his ducks and dogs together in a Vietnamese village being swept by merciless Americans .
In Parent , he talks specifically about a " yellow dog . "
And he uses the word " baleful " to describe an " eye " in Fugitive Days .
For the record , " baleful " means " threatening harm . "
I had to look it up .
Ayers is fixated with faces , especially eyes .
He writes of " sparkling " eyes , " shining " eyes , " laughing " eyes , " twinkling " eyes , eyes " like ice , " and people who are " wide - eyed " and " dark - eyed . "
As it happens , Obama is also fixated with faces , especially eyes .
He also writes of " sparkling " eyes , " shining " eyes , " laughing " eyes , " twinkling " eyes , and uses the phrases " wide - eyed " and " dark - eyed . "
Obama adds " smoldering eyes , " " smoldering " being a word that he and Ayers inject repeatedly .
Obama also uses the highly distinctive phrase " like ice , " in his case to describe the glinting of the stars .
If Ayers is fixated on eyes , about eyebrows he is positively fetishistic .
There are six references to " eyebrows " in Fugitive Days -- bushy ones , flaring ones , arched ones , black ones and , stunningly , seven references in Dreams -- heavy ones , bushy ones , wispy ones .
It is the rare memoirist who talks about eyebrows at all .
On three occasions in Dreams , Obama speaks of people with " round " faces .
On four occasions in Fugitive Days , Ayers does the same .
Both speak of " grim - faced " people , people with " soft " faces , and , most unusually , people with " tight " faces .
Both Ayers and Obama describe acquaintances who smile like a " Cheshire cat . "
Some of their characters have a countenance -- grin , squint , or scowl -- that is " perpetual . "
Others are " suppressing " their smiles or their grins .
To this point , I have just skimmed the 759 items in the bill of particulars in my case against Obama 's literary genius .
Not familiar with the term " bill of particulars ? "
Uncertain myself , I looked that one up too .
It means a list of written statements made by a party to a court proceeding .
Ayers and Obama each refer knowingly to a " bill of particulars . "
Does n't everyone ?
The answer , of course , is no .
In Audacity of Hope , Obama does not use this phrase or most of the distinctive words or combinations of words in Dreams .
In Audacity , for instance , there are virtually no descriptions of faces or eyes , and the few that the author does use are flat and clichéd -- like " brave face " or " sharp - eyed . "
In Dreams , seven different people " frown , " twelve " grin , " and six " squint . "
In Audacity , no more than one person makes any of these gestures .
Mr. West independently came to the same conclusion that I did , namely that Ayers was not meaningfully involved in Audacity .
These two Obama books almost assuredly had different primary authors .
What should be transparent to any literary critic is that the author of Audacity lacked the style and skill of the author of Dreams .
There are a few pockets in Audacity that evoke the spirit of Dreams but without the same grace .
A likely suspect for these imitative passages , perhaps the whole of Audacity , is Obama 's young speechwriter , Jon Favreau .
Favreau joined the Obama team in 2005 , time enough to play that role .
The London Guardian reports that Favreau carries Dreams wherever he goes and can " conjure up his master 's voice as if an accomplished impersonator . "
If so , in Audacity he played the classic role of the ghostwriter -- one who absorbs his client 's thoughts and relates them in a refined version of his client 's voice .

If a lack of third - party plug - in support ( i.e. Flash ) kept you from trying out Chrome on your Linux system , then avoid no longer .
The " early developer version " now supports many plug-ins , and they seem to work pretty well .
You 'll need to add -- enable - plugins to your Chrome shortcut 's command line operation to get the " buggy " plug - in support , but it seems worth the hassle , as YouTube and Hulu videos are playing relatively stable and smooth .
Google 's updated their alpha - level Chrome builds to include the newest start page tweaks as well , and it 's generally a browser worth checking out , even if a few standard settings and convenience items are still missing .

A very , very long time ago I personally advocated the inclusion of a certain feature into GNOME .
We set up a poll at OSNews , which resulted in a very , very resounding “ yes ! ” from the OSNews community – many of which are GNOME users .
The feature in question was the global application menubar , which allowed the GNOME desktop to have a menu bar atop the screen similar to that of Mac OS X .
The poll is long gone , the debate thread in the Bugzilla has died out , and no decision has yet been made .
I wanted to know where this feature stands , and how much the developers have improved it , and I was in for a surprise .
Back in the day when the patch was first released , it required a hacked Gtk+ , which made the patch a little daunting for many people .
It was also rather buggy at times , and you could n’t really rely on it too much .
Well , I am happy to inform you all that that has really , really changed .
The patch has become more than a patch – it ’s a simple panel applet now .
And it no longer requires a hacked Gtk+ .
They also have a fancy website now .
The panel applet , once installed , can be added to any GNOME panel as you would any other applet .
Once it ’s in there , right click on it , open its preferences window , and activate it .
That ’s it .
THey even have a nice repository at Launchpad , so installation is a breeze .
Add the PPA to your sources .
list , install the relevant package , et voila .
The current package has an error in it , so some users may need to run the linked commands to make it work properly .
The next packaged build should solve this .
Once installed , it works beautifully .
They ’ve added several convenient options to configure the applet , so you can tweak it to your needs .
For the rest , it works exactly as you would expect : the menubars in your windows disappear , and are placed in your GNOME panel of choice in Mac OS X fashion .
The only downside is that it does n’t work for non-Gtk+ applications such as Firefox or OpenOffice.org .
Qt+ applications are also not supported , but there have been talks in the KDE community to standardise their upcoming global menubar implementation on the Gtk + one , making it all cross-platform .
I ’m totally addicted again .
I prefer a global menubar , and I know a lot of you agree with me that it ’s a better solution .
It is strictly a matter of taste though , so the fact that it ’s implemented as a panel applet is just perfect .
It can be included in GNOME , as an optional applet , and those who prefer it can use it .
I would like to , once again , urge the GNOME team to finally accept this applet into the default GNOME distribution ( by lack of a better word ) .
This is a feature requested by quite a number of people , and its inclusion as an optional , turned - off - by - default panel applet poses no threat whatsoever to GNOME ’s policies and goals regarding interface design .
We can have swimming fish and moving eyes in our GNOME panel by default , but a much more interesting and useful feature gets the boot .
If GNOME fails to address this issue ( it ’s their project after all ) , then maybe Ubuntu can step in and include this option .
It would make it so much easier if it finally received what it deserves : blessing from the GNOME and / or Ubuntu community .
Now that KDE is also looking at this specific implementation to serve as the cornerstone for a cross -DE implementation of the global menu bar , there is simply no excuse to hinder this process .
Clunkermania officially began Friday .
The federal government finally released the rules that dealers and their customers have to follow to participate in the much - discussed “ cash for clunkers ” program , which can provide consumers with up to $ 4,500 when they trade in an older vehicle and buy a newer , more fuel - efficient model from a participating dealer .
The law creating the $ 1 - billion program went into effect July 1 , but many dealers were reluctant to participate until they got a look at the rules .
The arrival of the 100 - plus - page document Friday morning sparked a registration rush that overwhelmed the government ’s computers , resulting in waits of two hours or more , the National Automobile Dealers Assn. reported .
The program is also exciting a fair amount of interest among consumers .
Online auto information provider Edmunds .com said its traffic has been at record levels in recent weeks .
Part of that comes from what may be the beginnings of a rebound in car sales , but the clunkers program is helping .

“ We ’ve clearly had traffic coming in that ’s being driven by ‘ cash for clunkers , ’ ” said Marc Cannon , spokesman for AutoNation Inc. , which owns 77 dealerships in California , including Power Chevrolet lots in Valencia , Hawthorne and Irvine .
“ We started doing deals early this morning . ”
Automakers are also jumping on the bandwagon .
General Motors and Chrysler ran full - page ads in Friday ’s Times touting the program , and several manufacturers are offering special incentives .
The government estimates that the program will generate sales of 250,000 new cars , although Edmunds.com Chief Executive Jeremy Anwyl figures that about 200,000 of those sales would have happened anyway as part of the natural retirement rate of old vehicles .
Anwyl also notes that the rules are fiendishly complicated .
Much of that is a result of the government ’s effort to prevent fraud .
For instance , the program requires trade - ins to be junked , and the rules include elaborate procedures that dealers must follow to permanently disable the engines of clunker trade - ins so they ca n’t be resold .
( Part of the idea behind the law was to get older , less - fuel - efficient vehicles off the road . )

Shoppers may also be in for some frustration , above and beyond the tight restrictions they need to meet to qualify ( read on for details on how the program works ) .
For example , buyers must show proof of one year ’s insurance -- which would be recorded on their policy but may not be reflected on the insurance card they carry in their wallet .
Consumers should also be wary of official - looking clunkers websites that have sprung up , many of them asking for personal information .
The official government website for the programs is www.cars.gov.
The government has also set up a hotline at ( 866 ) 227-7891 .
Kelley Blue Book ( www .kbb.com ) and Edmunds.com offer online calculators to help buyers decide whether a particular deal makes sense under the clunkers program .
Here are some questions and answers about the program .

--
How do I know if my trade - in vehicle is eligible for the program ?
It must have been manufactured in 1984 or later and have a combined city - highway fuel economy rated at 18 miles per gallon or less .
The program is advantageous only if the trade - in value is less than the minimum $ 3,500 offered by the government .

Can the credit be applied to any new vehicle ?
All imports and domestics with a list price under $ 45,000 are eligible , as long as they meet fuel economy standards of at least 22 mpg for cars ; 18 mpg for SUVs , small pickups and minivans ; and 15 mpg for large vans and trucks .
The new vehicle ’s fuel economy must exceed the trade - in ’s by at least 4 mpg for cars , 2 mpg for SUVs and 1 mpg for large trucks to qualify for the $ 3,500 rebate .
The full $ 4,500 rebate kicks in at an increase of 10 mpg , 5 mpg and 2 mpg , respectively .
Remember , the mileage numbers are based on combined city - highway driving mileage as measured by the federal government -- not the mileage you actually get .
The fuel economy numbers can be found at www.fueleconomy .gov .

What happens to the clunkers after the trade - in ?
Can they be resold ?
The Car Allowance Rebate System requires that the trade - in be crushed or shredded so that it will not be resold .
The wrecking yard is allowed to salvage some parts for resale , excluding the engine and drivetrain .
--
Can I game the system by going to a junkyard and buying a wreck to use as a trade - in ?
Advertisement
No , the program requires the vehicle be in drivable condition , continuously insured and registered to the same owner for at least a year before the trade - in .
--
I have several clunkers in my garage .
Can I trade them all in ?
There is a limit of one trade - in per owner under the program , with the credit applying to the lease or purchase of a single new vehicle .

--
How long does the program last ?
Until Nov. 1 or until the $ 1 billion is spent , whichever comes first .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A former Army captain who was dismissed under a federal law dealing with gays and lesbians in the military lost his appeal Monday at the U.S. Supreme Court .
The U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene in the challenge to the " do n't ask / do n't tell " law .
James Pietrangelo and 11 other veterans had sued the government over the " do n't ask / do n't tell " law passed in 1993 .
Pietrangelo was the only one who appealed to the high court , but the justices without comment refused to intervene .
The provision forbids those in the military from openly acknowledging or revealing their homosexuality , and prevents the government from asking individual soldiers and sailors about their sexual orientation .
The Obama administration had asked the high court not to take the case , and White House officials had said they would not object to homosexuals being kicked out of the armed services .
During the presidential campaign last year , President Obama said he supported throwing out the federal law but has taken no specific action on the controversy .
The Justice Department said in a high court filing the law was " rationally related to the government 's legitimate interest in military discipline and cohesion . "
A federal appeals court in Boston , Massachusetts , had ruled against Pietrangelo , essentially ending his legal efforts .
But a San Francisco , California - based federal appeals court ruled partially in favor of Maj .
Margaret Witt , allowing her lawsuit against the Pentagon to move ahead .
Those judges said the Air Force must prove the dismissal of the flight nurse would ensure troop readiness and cohesion .
Justices say state judge should have recused himself
In a separate ruling , the high court on Monday found a state judge acted improperly when he refused to remove himself from a 2006 civil appeal despite having received financial support during his campaign from the CEO of the key defendant .
Chief Justice Brent Benjamin of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals cast the deciding vote in favor of that company .
In a 5 - 4 ruling , the justices found that a perceived conflict of interest should have led to the judge 's recusal .
" On these extreme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconstitutional level , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote .
The issue has become a touchstone of a growing political debate over whether judicial election races -- which have become more expensive and contentious in recent years -- erode public confidence in the legal system .
The West Virginia case has attracted nationwide attention and was the basis for author John Grisham 's 2008 best - seller , " The Appeal . "
The case now goes back to the state courts , where Benjamin likely will have to pull out of a rehearing .
The U.S. Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling on the specific facts of the West Virginia dispute , but the implications are likely to be felt nationwide .
Thirty - nine states elect some or all of their judges .
The facts of the case read like a legal thriller .
Businessman Don Blankenship , chairman of A.T. Massey Coal Co. , spent $ 3 million supporting Benjamin's 2004 run for the judicial seat -- accounting for 60 percent of the money spent in support of his campaign .
Massey was involved in a decade - old business dispute with Hugh Caperton , owner of rival Harman Mining .
Caperton accused Massey of unlawfully interfering with his business relations .
A jury agreed , and in 2002 awarded Harman Mining $ 50 million in compensatory and punitive damages .
Massey waited four years to appeal .
It was during those four years that Benjamin won his state high court seat .
In April 2006 , Benjamin declined to recuse himself from Massey 's appeal , which had reached his five - member court .
West Virginia , like most state and federal courts , leaves to an individual judge 's discretion the decision to stay out of a case because of a potential conflict of interest .

Many economists have stated that consumer spending can’t rebound until house prices stop falling .
But Charles W. Calomiris of Columbia University , Stanley D. Longhofer of the Barton School of Business and William Miles of Wichita State University argue that the wealth effect of housing has been overstated .
Much commentary in the financial press over the last several months has been concerned with the impact of falling house prices on consumer spending .
While some see evidence of “ green shoots ” and hope for economic growth over the horizon , many still fear that lower home values will depress consumer spending .
This “ wealth effect , ” a drop in home values that causes consumers to cut back on purchases , is thought to dampen economic growth and hamper any recovery .
At first glance , it seems reasonable to expect such a wealth effect .
If consumers are less wealthy because of declines in the value of the assets they own , whether they be stocks or their homes — it seems logical that they would cut back on their spending .
Indeed , many prominent economists have conducted research purporting to find large housing wealth effects , and often argue that the wealth effect from homes exceeds that from equities .
Moreover , the Federal Reserve employs a model , which presumably guides its policies , that assumes the housing wealth effect is large .
A more careful look at the data , guided by economic theory , however , suggests that much of this evidence has been misinterpreted and that the reaction of consumption to housing wealth changes is probably very small .
First , several recent studies have shown that the logic of the housing wealth effect is faulty .
Houses , unlike stocks , are not just assets but are also consumption goods themselves .
Theoretical papers by Willem Buiter , as well as by Todd Sinai and Nicholas Souleles , cast doubt on the notion of a large spending effect from housing .
Putting aside for the moment the question of how housing wealth may affect spending indirectly ( via its effect on consumers ’ access to credit ) , when considering the direct effect of housing wealth on consumption it is clear that any decrease in house prices hurts only those who are net “ long ” in housing , that is , those who own more housing than they plan to consume .
This might include , for instance , “ empty - nesters ” who are planning on selling their current houses and downsizing .
On the other hand , the decline in home values helps those who are not yet homeowners but plan to buy .
Most homeowners , however , are neither net long nor net short to any significant degree ; they own roughly what they intend to consume in housing services .
For these households , there should be no net wealth effect from house price change .
And when one thinks about the economy as a whole ( which is a combination of all three types of households ) the aggregate change in net housing wealth in response to house price change should be nearly zero ; changes in house prices should affect the distribution of net housing wealth , but have little effect on aggregate net housing wealth .
Thus any effect from net housing wealth change on aggregate consumption spending should be similarly small .
Put differently , an increase in house prices raises the value of the typical homeowner ’s asset , but such a price increase is also an equivalent increase in the cost of providing oneself housing consumption .
In the aggregate , changes in house prices will have offsetting effects on value gain and costs of housing services , and leave nothing left over to spend on non-housing consumption .
Up to this point , we have neglected the question of whether housing wealth change affects consumption through another , indirect channel — a financing channel — by affecting consumers ’ access to credit .
For example , if houses serve as better collateral than other wealth , then it is possible that “ constrained consumers ” ( those who wish to borrow today and repay loans from anticipated increases in income in the future ) may face better lending terms as the result of an increase in the value of their homes , which in turn may increase their non-housing consumption .
Some observers point to the latest housing boom , and the increased use of HELOCS and other mortgages during the boom , as evidence that housing prices spurred consumption through this financing channel .
While this indirect financing channel is a theoretical possibility , it is an empirical question whether it is significant in its effect , and even if the indirect financial effect is present it should not produce a “ first - order ” effect of housing wealth on consumption ; housing wealth should still matter much less for consumption than other forms of wealth .

The Hubble Space Telescope was undergoing a thorough checkout of all its systems following the recent servicing mission , but scientists decided to drop everything and interrupt the observatory ’s checkout and calibration to take an image of what every other telescope has by trying to view : the impact site on Jupiter .
But Hubble does it better than anyone .
This image , taken just yesterday ( July 23 ) shows the black spot on the giant planet — created a small comet or asteroid — is expanding .
“ Because we believe this magnitude of impact is rare , we are very fortunate to see it with Hubble , ” said Amy Simon - Miller of NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. “ Details seen in the Hubble view shows a lumpiness to the debris plume caused by turbulence in Jupiter ’s atmosphere . ”
The new Hubble images also confirm that the May servicing visit by space shuttle astronauts was a big success .
The Jupiter impact has been a sensation ever since Australian amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley imaged a black spot on the planet on July 19 . ,
The only other time such a feature has been seen on Jupiter was 15 years ago after the collision of fragments from comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 .
For the past several days , Earth - based telescopes have been trained on Jupiter .
To capture the unfolding drama 360 million miles away , Matt Mountain , director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , gave observation time to a team of astronomers led by Heidi Hammel of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colo .
“ Hubble ’s truly exquisite imaging capability has revealed an astonishing wealth of detail in the impact site , ” Hammel said .
“ By combining these images with our ground - based data at other wavelengths , our Hubble data will allow a comprehensive understanding of exactly what is happening to the impact debris . ”
Simon - Miller estimated the diameter of the impacting object was the size of several football fields .
The force of the explosion on Jupiter was thousands of times more powerful than the suspected comet or asteroid that exploded over the Siberian Tunguska River Valley in June 1908 .
The image was taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 .
The new camera , installed by the astronauts aboard space shuttle Atlantis in May , is not yet fully calibrated .
While it is possible to obtain celestial images , the camera ’s full power has yet to be seen .
“ This is just one example of what Hubble ’s new , state - of - the - art camera can do , thanks to the STS - 125 astronauts and the entire Hubble team , ” said Ed Weiler , associate administrator of NASA ’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
“ However , the best is yet to come . ”

LIVE : Brown fights for his future Tories and Lib Dems in poll wins
In full : Brown 's new cabinet Speaking at a Downing Street media conference , Mr Brown said the current political crisis , fuelled by the Westminster expenses scandal " is a test of everyone 's nerve - mine , the government 's , the country 's " .
He added : " If I did n't think I was the right person to lead these challenges I would not be standing here .
" I have faith in doing my duty ... I believe in never walking away in difficult times . "
Mr Brown defended Chancellor Alistair Darling as a " very good personal friend " and said the idea that the pair were split over the economy was " ridiculous " .
Three new ministerial councils - the Democratic Renewal Council , the Domestic Policy Council and an enhanced National Economic Council - would report weekly to the cabinet , said Mr Brown .
Mandelson 's role
But speculation about his future continued as Labour MP Ian Gibson said he was standing down to force a by - election in Norwich North - and said he thinks Mr Brown 's days " are close to being numbered " .
BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said if ministers had followed James Purnell in calling for Mr Brown to quit " we would today have had a new prime minister " .
Several of the women attending Cabinet - myself included - have been treated by you as little more than female window dressing
Caroline Flint , former Europe minister
Flint 's ' window dressing ' attack
But the PM had still been forced to carry out an " emergency reshuffle based on his own personal survival " , which had left him " not that much stronger " .
In other moves , Alan Johnson becomes home secretary and Andy Burnham succeeds him at health .
Caroline Flint has quit as Europe minister , with Glenys Kinnock , wife of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock , who recently stood down as an MEP as her successor - she will be appointed to the House of Lords to be able to take the job .
Ms Flint is understood to have quit after Mr Brown failed to promote her to a full cabinet job .
In her resignation letter she launches a stinging attack on Mr Brown for allegedly treating women ministers " like female window dressing " and running a " two tier cabinet " .
She said Mr Brown had " strained every sinew " of her loyalty to the government .
There has been speculation all week that Ms Flint was about to quit , yet she had taken to the airwaves to defend Mr Brown and declare her loyalty to him .
Labour 's deputy leader , and minister for women and equality , Harriet Harman : " I can understand the frustration of any woman in politics , but I do n't accept that Gordon does n't take women in politics seriously - not at all . "

Lord Mandelson 's role has been expanded , giving him responsibility for higher education and training .
In what Nick Robinson said amounted to a deputy prime minister 's role , he has also been given the titles of First Secretary of State and Lord President of the Council .
Mr Hoon has agreed to be the prime minister 's European policy adviser ahead of the climate change talks in Copenhagen at the end of the year .
Bob Ainsworth becomes defence secretary and Peter Hain returns to the cabinet in his old job of Welsh Secretary .
Ben Bradshaw joins the cabinet for the first time as culture secretary and Lord Adonis takes over at transport .
Universities Secretary John Denham succeeds Hazel Blears as communities secretary and Yvette Cooper replaces Mr Purnell as work and pensions secretary , with Liam Byrne replacing her as Chief Secretary to the Treasury .
Margaret Beckett and Tony McNulty are amongst those leaving the cabinet , the latter quitting his job as employment minister in an effort to clear his name over allegations about his expenses claims which are being investigated by the standards watchdog .
Election losses John Hutton earlier quit as defence secretary and James Purnell quit on Thursday as work and pensions secretary - but no ministers have so far backed Mr Purnell 's call for Mr Brown to " stand aside " .
Many Labour backbenchers who were ready to call for a change of leader will now be asking themselves :
' If they 're not willing to act to end this , why should I ? '
Nick Robinson 's blog Mr Hutton backed the prime minister and said he thought fellow Blairite Mr Purnell had made " the wrong decision " in calling for him to quit .
Alan Johnson , touted by some backbenchers as a possible leadership challenger , said he backed Mr Brown " to the hilt " to continue as prime minister .
He said he would " never say never " to becoming Labour leader at some point but could see no circumstances at present where he would mount a bid for the job .
He added that he was " really pleased " to be going to the Home Office , describing the job - regarded as something of a poisoned chalice - as an " invigorating challenge " .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The ineptness of New Labour over the past 11 years has finally caught up with them Jonathan , Slough But although no cabinet ministers have backed Mr Purnell , several backbench Labour MPs have continued to call for him to stand down .
Dr Gibson - stripped of the right to stand for Labour at the next election because of his expenses - said he would stand down now to trigger what is likely to be a potentially difficult by - election for Labour .
With the majority of results now in , the scale of Labour 's defeat at the English local elections is also clear after it lost control of its four remaining English county councils .
According to the BBC 's projected share of the national vote at a general election , based on the English local election results in so far , the Conservatives would poll 38 % , the Lib Dems 28 % and Labour would be third on 23 % .

Conservative leader David Cameron said it showed his party was on course to win the next general election , adding that Labour had " lost the right to govern " .
" We have clearly won this election and turned in some remarkably good results , " he told BBC News .
Mr Clegg said Mr Brown 's future as PM was " irrelevant " because the Labour government was " finished " .
Labour is braced for another poor performance when the results of European elections are announced on Sunday .
And , in sign of the continuing febrile atmosphere , Nick Robinson said Gordon Brown had been forced to defend his expenses again over suggestions in the Daily Telegraph he claimed for electricity bills and service charges on two properties between 2005 and 2007 .
A 10 spokesman insisted Mr Brown had complied with the rules at all times , a fact backed up by the Commons authorities , but he had agreed to repay about £ 180 " for the avoidance of doubt " .

Bernie Borges , Founder and CEO of Find and Convert , an Inbound Marketing Agency , released his new book today , Marketing 2.0 ; Bridging the Gap between Seller and Buyer through Social Media Marketing .
Mike Volpe , V.P. Inbound Marketing at HubSpot , wrote the foreword .
Borges wrote the book for business executives who seek to understand how to develop and implement social media marketing strategies .
In his book , Borges sets the stage for the significance of the social web by describing the dramatic evolution of paradigm shifts in history such as the way music was once sold on records and CDs and now is sold mostly online as a download .
Similarly , Borges presents the case that marketers must adapt to an entire new way of marketing as a mindset .
He refers to " marketing 1.0 " as disruptive and interruptive .
That mindset is alive but the results are on a rapid decline .
" Buyers are in control now , " says Bernie Borges .
" They can easily ignore or filter out seller 's marketing .
More so , buyers turn to two sources when setting out to find a product or service they need to purchase : 1 ) the Internet and 2 ) other people 's opinions . "
The social web allows buyers to seek out information about products and services with little influence by seller 's advertising .
Sellers must learn to engage buyers on their terms on the social web .
Sellers must learn to build relationships with buyers early in the search process to win their trust .
And , sellers must learn to be collaborators with their buyers .
Borges offers his reader a roadmap for creating a social media marketing strategy including the risks , benefits and staffing implications .
He presents two primary pillars comprising a social media marketing strategy ; content marketing and relationship building .
Each of the major social media platforms is discussed in overview fashion including social networking , blogging , Twitter , video , photos and podcasting to help the reader understand the role each plays in content marketing and relationship building on the web .
Borges presents numerous case studies to help the reader digest examples of social media marketing in action .
" I appreciated the fact these case studies were comprised of small and midsize companies , " said Jason Atkins , CEO of 360 incentives.com and one of the first to review Marketing 2.0 .
" Bernie did a fantastic job putting this book together .
It 's similar to a playbook that is full of strategies and tactics to bring your organization into the social web . "
Marketing 2.0 is published by Wheatmark Publishing , of Tuscon , AZ .
It is available at most online booksellers including Amazon and directly from Wheatmark 's online store .
Borges will provide several forms of contact and content sharing with his readers through his Internet marketing blog where he regularly writes articles on best practices , success stories and occasionally controversial viewpoints , which stimulate conversation with his community .
Additionally , Borges has begun to summarize his book on his podcast show and will also interview people who have been profiled in the case studies section .
Borges also invites interaction on his Twitter account and his Facebook account where he interacts with his community on a daily basis .

Today , I found out my psycho ex also reads FML .
She called me at work , pissed that I 'd " publicly humiliated " her on here .
I have n't posted about her at all .
I 'm sure the brick I found thrown through my window a few hours later has nothing to do with her , though .

In the spirit of Tim Burton ’s new Alice in Wonderland movie ( which hits movie theatres tomorrow – watch for our review ! ) , the china brand Wedgwood has some suggestions to help you throw the perfect Mad Hatter Tea Party , daaaarlink .
And as everyone knows , tea parties are English , so bring your manners !
Think Fun , Not Fussy .
Create a chic , relaxed atmosphere with comfortable chairs , a central table , brightly colored fresh flowers and an invitation that sets the tone .
Traditional tea time is 4 p.m. , but schedule your party for whatever works best for you and your guests anytime between 3 - 6 p.m .
Make Your Table Talk - Worthy .
Choose tight , floral arrangements in low vases to make conversation across the table easy .
You might even consider a teapot as a floral vase .
Bring the theme to life with colorful linens and accents .
What does Mad Hatter and whimsical mean to you ?
Gather the basics – teapot , teacups and saucers , luncheon size plates ( your salad plates are perfect ) , a small milk jug , a sugar bowl ( preferably with sugar cubes ) , and a plate for lemon slices .
Your flatware should be set with forks on the left , knives and spoons on the right with knife blade pointed toward the plate .
Mix and Match Like Mad .
Your place settings need not match .
Our personal favorite is the Wedgwood ’s Harlequin Polka Dot Collection , a fanciful pattern in a fun mixture of pink and blue hues that look like Easter but would be perfect for a Hatter tea party !
Let Loose with the Tea .
Good selections of loose teas ( preferable to teabags ) are essential .
If you are not steeping your tea in the teapot , provide individual infusers ( hollow , silver balls with holes on a thin chain ) to pack loose tea into .
Begin the brewing process with cold , filtered or bottled ( not tap ) water .
Did you know that teabags were created more than 100 years ago as a way to send customers tea samples ?
Loose tea has been around for more than 5,000 years !
Assemble Savory & Sweet .
Savories are tiny sandwiches that can take on a multitude of ingredients – fill interesting breads with smoked salmon , egg salad or cucumbers and cream cheese .
On the sweet side , scones and biscuits with plenty of jams and clotted cream and shortbread or simple cakes add a nice touch .
Fanciful cupcakes with Alice in Wonderland designs can be a great signature take - home gift .
Display sweets on a beautiful footed cake plate , an elegant tiered plate or any beautiful small tray .
Pinkies Up !
Lastly , although your pinkie does not have to be literally up , consider the following ideas when it comes to proper decorum : always serve from the right , take small sips of your tea and avoid slurping , and never overfill your plate .
This is tea , not a meal , little piglets !

But it appears that Mr. Espada may have been driven to make a deal to return as majority leader out of fear of being marginalized , because a separate Democratic faction was moving to establish a power - sharing deal with the Republicans .
Indeed , the Democrats have become increasingly polarized , often along racial lines .
Mr. Espada and other Hispanic senators have pushed for more influence from Mr. Smith and Mr. Sampson , who are black .
Separately , the faction of seven white Democrats , led by Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx , that had sought the power - sharing deal with the Republicans is especially uneasy with Mr. Espada , who faces investigations related to nonprofit health clinics he runs , his campaign finance practices and whether his primary residence is in the Bronx .
Any arrangement they reached with Republicans would probably have pushed Mr. Espada aside .
Faced with that possibility , Mr. Espada returned to the Democrats in exchange for a job whose power beyond its title is difficult to discern .
The titles of Senate president and majority leader have traditionally been combined ; the president is vested with special powers in the state ’s Constitution , and the majority leader is not .
As majority leader , Mr. Espada will receive a bonus on top of his regular legislator ’s salary .
Senator Hiram Monserrate , a Queens Democrat who initially sided with the Republicans along with Mr. Espada , played a key role in persuading his colleagues to allow Mr. Espada to return .
Dean G. Skelos , the leader of the Senate Republicans , speculated that the Democratic caucus would break apart again .
“ This is my prediction , ” Mr. Skelos said at his own news conference , his caucus surrounding him .
“ Within a few months , maybe six months , there is going to be so much discord within that conference that we ’re going to be running the Senate , all right ? ”

However , at the moment when all Chinese fans were cheering the upcoming opportunity to get a closer look at the masterpiece by Blizzard , there came a sad news , saying , Starcraft 2 was banned by authorities from being exhibited on this year ’s ChinaJoy .
Again , Blizzard failed when facing Chinese goverment .
The detailed cause of ban remains unkown .
Up till now ,
Two accounts were given unofficially by online media .
The former said that The State Bureau Of Culture called a halt to Starcraft 2 on ChinaJoy , for “ Starcraft 2 is much too bloody , which will severely effect the mental as well as physical health of adolescents ” .
The latter is in a more institutional tone , saying , according to the lastest regulation released on July 1st,2009 , “ Any activity related to foreign games , including their showing , demostrating , trading and marketing promotion , shall also abide by the censorship laws aming at imported online games ” , meaning any foreign game , if it wanna put in an appearence in any public event inside China , “ shall be subject to censorship and approval by the State Admimistartion Of News And Press . ” , or it will no doubt be banned , and “ all promoters , sponsors , and companies related shall held their respective legal responsibilities . ”
PLU , the official partner of OGN in China had planned to broadcast the exhibition matches live via online TV , with its best narrators =XD=love , Sanpao , etc. commentating .
But they cancelled the plan yesterday , issuing an terse official statement , saying they had to change their plan for some nontechnical reason .
BTW , both Blizzard and its Chinese partner NetEase have never officially announced anything about Starcraft2 on ChinaJoy , nonetheless , several news are leaked by some insiders , including the photos below , showing Blizzard and NetEase ’s booths on this year 's ChinaJoy , with large Starcraft 2 posters hanging .

The scheduled exhibition matches of Starcraft 2 for ChinaJoy 2009 on July 23rd would have become the first starcraft 2 open event around the world , predating the ones to be held in South Korea on July 24th , featuring the much - anticipated face - off between Moon and Nada .

Fantasy
Jupiter took a bullet for us last weekend .
An object , probably a comet that nobody saw coming , plowed into the giant planet ’s colorful cloud tops sometime Sunday , splashing up debris and leaving a black eye the size of the Pacific Ocean .
This was the second time in 15 years that this had happened .
The whole world was watching when Comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 fell apart and its pieces crashed into Jupiter in 1994 , leaving Earth - size marks that persisted up to a year .
That ’s Jupiter doing its cosmic job , astronomers like to say .
Better it than us .
Part of what makes the Earth such a nice place to live , the story goes , is that Jupiter ’s overbearing gravity acts as a gravitational shield deflecting incoming space junk , mainly comets , away from the inner solar system where it could do for us what an asteroid apparently did for the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .
Indeed , astronomers look for similar configurations  a giant outer planet with room for smaller planets in closer to the home stars  in other planetary systems as an indication of their hospitableness to life .
Anthony Wesley , the Australian amateur astronomer who first noticed the mark on Jupiter and sounded the alarm on Sunday , paid homage to that notion when he told The Sydney Morning Herald , “ If anything like that had hit the Earth it would have been curtains for us , so we can feel very happy that Jupiter is doing its vacuum - cleaner job and hoovering up all these large pieces before they come for us . ”
But is this warm and fuzzy image of the King of Planets as father - protector really true ?
“ I really question this idea , ” said Brian G. Marsden of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , referring to Jupiter as our guardian planet .
As the former director of the International Astronomical Union ’s Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams , he has spent his career keeping track of wayward objects , particularly comets , in the solar system .
Thought - police is here
By Rona Kuperboim
The Foreign Ministry unveiled a new plan this week : Paying talkbackers to post pro-Israel responses on websites worldwide .
A total of NIS 600,000 ( roughly $ 150,000 ) will be earmarked to the establishment of an “ Internet warfare ” squad .
The Foreign Ministry intends to hire young people who speak at least one language and who study communication , political science , or law – or alternately , Israelis with military experience gained at units dealing with information analysis .
Beyond the fact that these job requirements reveal a basic lack of understanding in respect to the dynamics of the online discourse – the project ’s manager argued that “ adults do n’t know how to blog ” – they are not too relevant either .
An effective talkbacker does not need a law degree or military experience .
He merely needs to care about the subject he writes about .
The sad truth is that had Israeli citizens believed that their State is doing the right thing , they would have made sure to explain it out of their own accord .
Without being paid .
Foreign Ministry officials are fighting what they see as a terrible and scary monster : the Palestinian public relations monster .
Yet nothing can be done to defeat it , regardless of how many foolish inventions will be introduced and how many bright communication students will be hired .
The reason is that good PR cannot make the reality in the occupied territories prettier .
Children are being killed , homes are being bombed , and families are starved .
Yet nonetheless , the Foreign Ministry wants to try to change the situation .
And they have willing partners .
“ Where do I submit a CV ? ” wrote one respondent .
“ I ’m fluent in several languages and I ’m able to spew forth bullshit for hours on end . ”
Anti-democratic initiative
Any attempt to plant talkbacks online must fail .
Especially if the State is behind it .
Not only because it ’s easy to identify responses made on behalf of someone , but also because it ’s anti-democratic .
When the Israel Electric Company or other companies do it , it ’s annoying .
Yet when the State does it , it ’s dangerous .
Imposters on behalf of the government are threatening free discourse even if they only wander through the virtual space .
The Internet was meant to serve as an open platform for dialogue between people , rather than as a propaganda means .
Something worrisome is happening here lately .
We see the accumulation of silencing attempts .
The Nakba Law , the bill calling for a ban on protests outside the homes of politicians , Lieberman ’s Loyalty Law , and the biometric information database .
The free speech hunting season is on .
Thankfully we have the Internet , and it enables us to identify processes , discuss them , warn about them , and join forces against them .
We can assume that soon we ’ll see the establishment of a website opposed to this new initiative , unless such site already exists .
Perhaps even a group on Facebook .
I wonder whether all its members will be Foreign Ministry agents , or whether it will also include some real people .
This is not a police state :
This is a thought - police state .
The story begins with a regular Joe who tries desperately to seek employment , but embarks on a violent rampage when he teams up with cult leader Uncle Dave .
Their first act is to heist an amusement park , only to learn that the Taliban are planning the same heist as well .
Chaos ensues , and now the Postal Dude must not only take on terrorists but political figures as well .

TNT Village , Italy 's most prominent torrent site has been compromised by hackers .
Intimate details of the site 's operations including 50,000 usernames , passwords and email addresses have been leaked out onto the Internet .
The site has taken precautionary measures but concerned users should change their passwords immediately .
One of the problems with running a website or any Internet presence is the constant threat of malicious attacks .
Almost everyone will recall the terrible mauling experienced by MediaDefender after their confidential emails leaked onto the Internet , and since then many anti-piracy groups and related companies have felt the wrath of hackers .
But of course , being hacked is n’t the sole preserve of these organizations , it can happen to file - sharing sites too .
In November 2008 a hacker tried to gain control of Torrentz.com and at the beginning of June NowTorrents had its own problems .
Today we bring news of another sizable hack , this time affecting Italy ’s most prominent BitTorrent site , TNT Village .
A hacker targeted the 50,000 member site and made off with the site ’s database .
The admin of TNT Village explains : “ A son of a bitch was able to discover my password .
With it in recent days he has removed the TNT database .
I then proceeded to change my password but in the meantime he / they had taken some sensitive data to users , and yesterday they were made public . ”
Indeed , a torrent of the stolen data has appeared on various BitTorrent indexes .
The data contained within is largely in Italian but a source with an interest in security breaches told TorrentFreak that the archive contains very sensitive information .
The site ’s database schema , the actual database with around 50,000 usernames , passwords and emails , a list of site donors and private messages have all been leaked .
The site has taken steps to limit the damage but concerned users should change their passwords immediately , at the very least .
Like a mad scientist ’s creation run amok , the beast that Dick Armey and his corporate sponsors will unleash wo n’t accomplish their end — a return to political power — but will instead hasten their political irrelevance .
Faux Noise seems determined to lead this new crusade .
Roger Ailes recruited Glenn Beck to anchor a strategy to transform the cable channel into a mainstream organ of right - wing counterculture .
Beck has been reading straight from militia manuals in a code that speaks to his tinfoil - hatted target audience .
What Ailes and Beck do n’t understand is that you cannot tame this monster .
All attempts to rein it in will only result in their being eaten by the beast they ’ve released .
The Teabagger Fail will give way to the Teabag Terror .
Governor backs off plan to suspend Prop. 98 CALIFORNIA'S FISCAL CRISIS

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Friday he is willing to reconsider his most recent proposal to help close the state 's $ 26.3 billion budget shortfall by suspending state constitutional rules that control education spending in order to make deep cuts in school funding .
That concession may help him avoid a political battle with the influential California Teachers Association .
Although the powerful union has been largely quiet during budget talks , it could sway lawmakers who are desperately needed to pass a budget .
A source told The Chronicle on Friday that the union is preparing a statewide television advertising campaign to fight any attempt to ignore the education spending rules that voters passed in 1988 as Proposition 98 .
On Wednesday , Schwarzenegger had proposed suspending Prop. 98 , which among other things requires that school funding be based in part on what was spent the previous fiscal year .
The requirement can make it difficult , if not nearly impossible , to make large cuts in education - an expense that makes up about half of the state 's discretionary spending .
Such cuts became even more inevitable when the state 's gaping deficit grew overnight by $ 2 billion because the Legislature failed to approve a budget fix by midnight Tuesday , the end of the 2008 - 09 fiscal year .
Still , the governor , who has proposed cutting this year 's education spending by $ 3 billion , said he was willing to consider other solutions .
" We are not stuck ... about the suspension " of Prop. 98 , he said in a meeting Friday with The Chronicle 's editorial board .
" We 've got to analyze all this .
... We have to figure out how to deal with it . "
Democratic lawmakers said they are encouraged by Schwarzenegger 's willingness to reconsider the Prop. 98 issue .
Yet Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg quickly pointed out that the issue would have never surfaced had the governor on Tuesday supported three budget bills that would have saved $ 3 billion .
" This problem was completely avoidable .
The administration is stuck because of its own ... strategy , " said Steinberg , D - Sacramento .
The governor has refused to support partial budget fixes .
But the budget impasse has caused a cash crunch that on Thursday forced the state controller to begin issuing IOUs to some taxpayers , businesses and creditors .
That impasse would become even more complicated by an enraged California Teachers Association and other education groups .
" They had not declared war on this governor who had made billions of dollars in cuts to education in his budget proposals ... and to have additional rounds of cuts proposed by him on top of the huge reductions they 've already made have gotten them very , very upset , " said Kevin Gordon , an education lobbyist .
Gordon noted that the California Teachers Association , which led the effort to torpedo Schwarzenegger 's ballot measures to reform government in 2005 , had supported the governor 's budget - related ballot measures that failed in the May 19 special election .
That could spell trouble for the governor , who is one of the biggest proponents of next year 's ballot measure that would create an open primary system .
Telephone calls to CTA representatives were not returned Friday .
Nevertheless , despite this new wrinkle in the budget negotiations , Schwarzenegger said talks with Democratic legislative leaders have been progressing and he 's hopeful that a resolution is near .
The governor said there has been a greater sense of urgency since Tuesday .
Since then , the bulk of the budget negotiations have centered on how much to cut spending in health and human services .
" There 's more willingness to look at our proposals more seriously - to look at reforms more seriously ... and to look at cuts more seriously , " said Schwarzenegger , who has backed away from outright elimination of popular state programs such as health care for poor children , a welfare - to - work program for single mothers , and in - home support services for the elderly and the disabled .
The governor said " there 's movement " in budget negotiations .
" I think if we continue this way we can get this done in the next few days . "

We are releasing one more maintenance version of Scala 2.7 , in order to correct a couple of issues found in the actors library .
If you do not use actors in your code , there is no need to upgrade .
The new stable release of the Scala distribution , Scala 2.7.5 final , is available as usual from our Download Page .
The Scala 2.7.5 distribution
What is new ?
Here is the changelog for the actor fixes in 2.7.5 :
Fixed # 1999 ( Starvation problem when lots of tasks are created from FJTaskRunner thread ) .
This could result in the JVM running out of memory when a lot of actors were created at a very high frequency .
Fixed # 2000 ( Linked actors do not always terminate properly ) .
This could result in memory leaking in applications that create many linked actors .
Disabled reference - counting actors using WeakReferences , since this could lead to memory leaks .
Termination of actors is still tracked , although using a simpler scheme that does not rely on WeakReferences .
In some cases , users must now call ` Scheduler.shutdown ( ) ` explicitly to terminate an actor - based application .
Fixed a `NullPointerException` bug in `Scheduler.restart` .
Mr Kroenke also owns a number of US sports clubs
Arsenal director Stan Kroenke , the largest shareholder at the north London club , has again increased his stake .
Mr Kroenke has bought a further 160 shares at £ 8,500 per share , taking his holding in Arsenal to 28.58 % .
It takes Mr Kroenke closer to the 30 % threshold that would force him to make an offer for the remaining shares .
In May , the American tycoon had increased his stake to 28.3 % .
giving him a bigger holding than Uzbekistani metals magnate Alisher Usmanov .
Mr Kroenke also owns the NBA 's Denver Nuggets , the NHL's Colorado Avalanche , and the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer .
Share plan rejected
Mr Usmanov , a billionaire , owns more than 25 % of the club through investment vehicle Red and White Holdings .
The Arsenal board recently rejected the Uzbek - born Russian billionaire 's plan to provide fresh funds for transfers , as well as cutting the club 's debt by issuing new shares .
Chief executive Ivan Gazidis turned down the request in favour of the current arrangement which would see the Emirates Stadium club remain self - financing .
Following the rejection , Mr Usmanov cast doubt on the club 's ability to provide enough money for the team to challenge for honours .
“ There are paragraphs that sound like Ayn Rand , next to paragraphs that sound like ‘ The Grapes of Wrath . ’
That ’s quite intentional , ” Vincent J. Miller , a theologian at the University of Dayton , a Catholic institution in Ohio , said by telephone .

“ He ’ll wax poetically about the virtuous capitalist , but then he ’ll give you this very clear analysis of the ways in which global capital and the shareholder system cause managers to focus on short - term good at the expense of the community , of workers , of the environment . ”
Indeed , sometimes Benedict sounds like an old - school European socialist , lamenting the decline of the social welfare state and praising the “ importance ” of labor unions to protect workers .
Without stable work , he noted , people lose hope and tend not to get married and have children .
But he also wrote , “ The so - called outsourcing of production can weaken the company ’s sense of responsibility towards the stakeholders  namely the workers , the suppliers , the consumers , the natural environment and broader society  in favor of the shareholders . ”
And he argued that it was “ erroneous to hold that the market economy has an inbuilt need for a quota of poverty and underdevelopment in order to function at its best . ”
Benedict also called for a reform of the United Nations so there could be a unified “ global political body ” that allowed the less powerful of the earth to have a voice , and he called on rich nations to help less fortunate ones .
“ In the search for solutions to the current economic crisis , development aid for poor countries must be considered a valid means of creating wealth for all , ” he wrote .
John Sniegocki , a professor of Christian ethics at Xavier University in Cincinnati , said one of the most controversial elements of the encyclical , at least for some Americans , would be the call for international institutions to play a role in regulating the economy .
In most cases , according to the U.S. Attorney 's Office in New Jersey , the rabbis used charitable organizations to launder money that they believed came from bank fraud and selling counterfeit goods .
The witness allegedly told targets he was in bankruptcy and trying to hide his cash .
In some instances , he said , the money came from the sale of fake Gucci bags .
PARIS ( Reuters ) - U.S. defense companies , some rocked harder than others by Defense Secretary Robert Gates ’ sweeping program cuts , are looking to international sales and acquisitions to fill the void .
Many are also vying for contracts to maintain and sustain aircraft for U.S. military services and foreign countries , an increasingly attractive market given that budget woes are keeping many aircraft in service longer than expected .
Industry executives , meeting with reporters on the eve of the Paris Air Show , said they expected U.S. defense spending to flatten after years of strong growth , but said their companies were largely well - positioned to report growth in other areas .
Executives are not expecting to clinch big - ticket orders at the show , but most have dozens of meetings scheduled with possible foreign buyers and U.S. officials .
Most
Jim Albaugh , head of Boeing Co ’s defense business , acknowledged that some big Boeing programs such as the Future Combat Systems Army modernization program , the Air Force ’s Transformational Satellite program , and the C - 17 transport plane took a hit in the Gates cuts , but said the fiscal 2010 budget plans also pointed toward some future opportunities .
He said Boeing was bidding in many foreign competitions and expected global sales to expand to 20 percent of Boeing ’s defense sales from 16 percent now , and five percent in 2004 .
He said Boeing , the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor , was taking part in fighter jet competitions in India , Denmark , Brazil and Greece .
South Korea could also buy 40 more fighters and Australia remained interested in the F / A - 18 Super Hornet .
He also cited foreign interest in Boeing ’s C - 17 , Chinook CH - 47 helicopter , and Apache attack helicopters .
“ There ’s a lot of international potential there , ” Albaugh told reporters .
Boeing is creating a separate business unit for the company ’s work on unmanned vehicles , and will announce on Monday a fourth targeted acquisition in the intelligence area , Albaugh said .
He gave no further details .
Robert Stevens , chief executive of Lockheed Martin Corp , said the Pentagon ’s No. 1 contractor was also keeping an eye out for value - adding acquisitions at the right price , but said he was generally pleased with the broad , diversified portfolio the company had developed over the past years .
He told reporters at a media dinner that the very definition of global security was expanding to include things such as access to clean drinking water , secure transportation , and alternative energy sources , among other things , all areas in which Lockheed was already active and growing .
At the same time , Stevens said he had strong expectations for the new radar - evading F - 35 fighter jet being developed by nine countries to replace up to 13 different current fighters .
Helicopter are also in great demand , Jeff Pino , president of Sikorsky AirCraft , a United Technologies Corp unit , told Reuters .
“ We ’re really focused internationally . ”
Pino said he planned to meet with Navy Vice Admiral Jeffrey Wieringa , head of the Pentagon ’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency , and other foreign and U.S. officials to talk about future sales during the air show .
Pino said his company had an order backlog valued at $ 12 billion and was in talks on some $ 1.4 billion of foreign sales over the next three to five years to Albania , Georgia , Mexico , the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and Bahrain .
In addition , he said Taiwan was interested in buying 60 Black Hawk helicopters , a deal that could be worth around $ 1 billion , and should be finalized later this year .
Turkey was also nearing a decision on up to 300 new helicopters in a competition that pitted Sikorsky against AgustaWestland , a unit of Italy ’s Finmeccanica .
That deal was worth around $ 2.5 billion , Pino said .
Pino said Sikorsky was also looking for ways to keep its helicopter platforms relevant as the Pentagon increases its focus on irregular warfare , including development of an aircraft that could be remotely piloted , or manned , depending on what was needed .
A first flight was expected in 2010 .
Gates ’ decision to cancel Lockheed ’s work on the VH - 71 presidential helicopter , a deal Sikorsky lost , and redo a competition for combat search and rescue helicopters , could also spell a chance to bid for the work again , Pino said .
Aircraft engine maker Pratt & Whitney , another unit of United Technologies , is also eyeing acquisitions in its core engine business and energy sector , Pratt & Whitney President Dave Hess said in an interview ahead of the Paris Air Show .
Hess said Pratt was hit by Gates ’ decision to end production of Lockheed ’s F - 22 fighter at 187 , since it builds the engine for the fast , stealthy fighter .
He said he would welcome a repeal of a congressional export ban on the F - 22 to keep the production line running until production of the F - 35 fighter begins to ramp up in 2014 , but that was up to Congress .
He said he was more optimistic that U.S. lawmakers would act to add funding for additional C - 17 aircraft , which also runs on Pratt & Whitney engines , which would stave off the closing of that production line , at least for now .
automateaching -- part 2 : proof of concept
1 direct reply — Read more / Contribute by Discipulus
on Sep 30 , 2020 at 04:45 Only Perl can teach Perl
Discipulus Introduction
This is the follow up of Perl Automateaching -- part 1 : brainstorming so read it first to have an idea of my intentions even if the pseudocode presented there is not what I currently plan .
I have choosen the name for this project and it will be Perl : : Teacher as it is clear and explicative .
This post is a mere proof of concept about Perl teaching and , yes !
it can be done !
I 'd like to be billionaire to hire super skilled perl geeks to develop my idea ... but let 's say they are all busy at the moment :) so the pupil ( discipulus in Latin ) will squeeze his brain and will dress teacher dresses .
Contributors are welcome !
In the final form Perl : : Teacher will be document oriented , ie : it will analyze perl programs wrote by the pupil in physical files .
But in the current proof of concepts various student 's attempts are hardcoded into the below program contained in scalars from $ work_01 to $ work_n and with a $ solution_code
Also the final form of Perl : : Teacher will be a bit interactive presenting and reviewing assignements and telling small lessons , but for the moment nothing of this is done .
So running the below program you will see a serie of attempts to satisfy the assignemnt and results of tests applied to provided code fragments .
Modify the $ debug variable to 1 or 2 to see much more messages .
Proof of concept
Here my efforts up now ( Ignore the warning you 'll receive : Having more than one /x regexp modifier is deprecated at .../ perl5.24-64b/perl/site/lib/Perl/Critic/Policy/ValuesAndExpressions/RequireInterpolationOfMetachars.pm line 110 . beacuse it is a problem of Perl : : Critic itself : see resolved issue on github ) Read more ... ( 22 kB ) Implementation ( current )
As you can see there is a lot PPI stuff but not exclusively .
Tests are execuded in order from 001 to 00n and if a test fails the current mini program is rejected .
Each test can contain different steps , the first one being the optional run that simply sends the current code to a sub : this preliminary , optional test passes if the sub returns 1 and fails otherwise .
Here it is used only to check if the program compiles ( see below for future ideas ) .
The second step of a test is select_child_of and it expects a PPI class name and a serie of subtests .
Each PPI element of the specified PPI class , for example PPI :: Statement : : Variable ( a variable declaration ) will be processed to see if they contains PPI elemnts which satisfy all subtests .
The first PPI element passing all subtests is returned by select_child_of and becomes a candidate for further inspections .
Infact if evaluate_to is also specified , the current PPI element is , take a deep breath , keep calm , string evaluated to see if it holds the wanted value .
And hic sunt leones or here are dragons because eval only returns the last statement value .
Search the code above for the string dirty trick to see my workaround .
For me it is a genial solution , but wait , I 'm the guy who string eval 'ed entire CPAN .. :) so improvements are warmly welcome .
This form of testing is a proof of concepts : is not the final form of the testing framework needed by Perl : : Teacher When a miniprogram passes all tests it is evaluated by Perl : : Critic to give more hints to the student .
Eventual policy violations will not make the program to be marked as wrong , but are just presented as suggestions .
A note about flexibilty : looking carefully at the assignement you will notice that @letters and $ result are constraints .
Not the same for the intermediate scalars containing the first element and the last one .
Implementation ( future ) module design
The main Perl : : Teacher module will provide only a framework to produce courses .
The $ teacher will load or create a configuration will have methods to deal with the student 's input and to emit messages , but the main activity will be to load and follow courses plugins of the class Perl : : Teacher : : Course
In my idea the course creator will publish Perl : : Teacher : : Course : : EN : : BasicVariables or Perl : : Teacher : : Course ::IT :: RegexIntroduzione all being child of the main Perl : : Teacher : : Course class .
These courses have to be pluggable to the $ teacher object ( Module : : Pluggable probably but I have to investigate it further )
Each course will contain a serie of lessons published a sub modules , as in Perl : : Teacher : : Course : : EN : : BasicVariables ::01_strings , ..::02 _lists etc .
Yes I know : very long names .. but this will ensure a clarity of intent and of usage , in my opinion .
lessons
Each lesson will contain an ordered serie of optional elements : zero one or more assignement , multiple test elements possibly interleaved by one or more discourse and direct question .
So a possible flow can be : Read more ... ( 688 Bytes ) Suggestions on module design are warmly welcome , but i want to keep it as simple as possible , not spawning objects for everything .
tests
Tests presented in the above code are too semplicistics to cover each teaching activity .
I need beside positive tests also negative ones for example to prevent the use of modules , or all modules but one , to prevent external program execution and so on .
Theese tests will be quite on success and will emit messages only on failure : " dont do this ! " .
I can use Test :: Script to add tests about correct overall syntax check , behaviour of STDOUT and STDERR given different arguments and so on .
Then Perl : : Teacher will provide its own tests like ones presented above : evaluate_to ( evaluate_at is probably a better name as it eval the code at a certain line ) , is dirty but it seems to me a viable option not so risky given the super small and controlled environment .
I also plan a method named evaluate_subs which will grab al subs to test them .
I have to mix all this features in a clean and easy to use interface .
Suggetions are welcome .
student interaction During a lesson the student must have the possibility to review the current assignement , to receive hints and be pointed to relevant documentation .
Part of this is roughly done in the presented code using hints and docs embedded in tests .
Can be and must be improved .
I like to add a TIMTOWTDI discourse at the end of each lesson showing more ways to accomplish , even if not in the very same way , the assignement .
Every output , comprensive of examined code , errors and hints , emitted during 03 _array_manipulation must be saved into a 03_array_manipulation .history file so that the student can review the whole lesson including errors commited and pitfalls and the solution alongside different approaches to the same problem .
Passing the time this becomes a good source of knoweledge .
further ideas
Testing standalone scripts is an idea haunting me since years .
Modulino is an approach .
I can be mad enough to take the original PDOM of a given program , then save all subs and use PPI method prune to delete them from the PDOM , then wrap the rest into a new main_original_program sub , add it to a new PDOM along with all previously saved subs .
Then I could do the obtained file and test it nicely .
A lot of cut 'n paste and probably error prone , but can be a path to explore .
I 'd like also my Perl : : Teacher to be as much possible input / output agnostic : implement a way to interact with the console leaving open the possibility to be used by a web interface too : how to do this ?
I 'd like to ear your opinions about this project , sugesstions on module design and implementation of its parts , comments to the above proof concepts and everything you want to share .

There are no rules , there are no thumbs ..
Reinvent the wheel , then learn The Wheel ; may be one day you reinvent one of THE WHEELS .
The latest batch of touch - enabled devices is a marked improvement over what was available less than a year ago .
Sometimes a few months makes all the difference .
Last year around this time , handset vendors were just beginning to flood the market with iPhone - wannabe devices .
Most had touch screens .
But the screens were often stubborn and unresponsive , or the handsets themselves were saddled with poorly laid out icons .
Fortunately , that 's all changed for the better .
Now you can choose from dozens of touch screen handsets , none of which require a stylus or careful aim to use .
Plus , many of today 's touch screen handsets have higher screen resolutions , which allows for sharp user interface graphics and clearly designed icons and buttons .
That said , not all touch screens are created equal .
There are two basic kinds : resistive and capacitive .
Capacitive screens sense the proximity of your finger using an electrical field .
They 're more accurate with finger touches , although you can't use a stylus ( which is usually not a problem ) .
The iPhone , Palm Pre , and T - Mobile myTouch 3G all have capacitive LCDs .
Resistive screens are an older design ; they 're composed of multiple metallic layers that conduct electricity when pressed together .
They work fine , but you need to be a little slower and more deliberate with them in practice .
Both resistive and capacitive screens can support multi-touch .
Multi - touch expands the UI ; for example , you can zoom in and out of Web pages and photos with two fingers , or cycle through photos by swiping with your index finger .
Only a few handsets ( like the iPhone and Palm Pre ) actually employ multi-touch , though their number is increasing .
Here 's a roundup of the latest batch of handsets with full touch screens .
All of the following devices are new designs , having been released sometime over the past several months .
AT&T
$ 199.99 , 16GB ( with two - year contract )
$ 299.99 , 32 GB ( with two - year contract )
Of course there 's going to be an iPhone on this list ; at this point it would be akin to treason to leave it out .
The iPhone 3GS kicks it up a notch this year with a significantly faster processor , a better camera , a stellar VGA video recorder , and a fingerprint - resistant coating .
It 's the best smartphone in the U.S .
Apple iPhone 3G ( AT&T )
$ 99.99 ( with two - year contract )
It may be last year 's model .
But at a new price point of just $ 99 with a two - year contract , why not snag an iPhone on the cheap ?
You still get 3G and GPS radios , and you can still run all 60,000 applications in the App Store with the second - generation iPhone 3G .
( It 'll be a long while before we see many 3GS - only apps . )
Cricket Wireless
$ 299.99
Cricket 's only touch - screen phone has an attractive oval shape and a widget - based interface , which shows YouTube and MySpace details on its home screen .
It also syncs contacts with Google , a very neat trick .
But Cricket charges extra for Web browsing on this phone , and the browser is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
MetroPCS
$ 349.99
The Samsung Finesse is the only MetroPCS handset with a touch screen .
As such , it offers a powerful camera and plenty of music and video options , although its e-mail program is a total disaster ( stick with Web mail and you 'll be OK ) .
Plus , you can get unlimited calls and data with the Finesse for just $ 50 per month .
That 's a real steal , once you get past the high upfront price .
Sprint
$ 199.99 ( with two - year contract )
After a successful launch in early June , the stellar Palm Pre has fallen out of the headlines mostly because Palm took so long to release the to third - party developers .
While we wait for the upcoming flood of webOS apps , the Palm Pre is still a killer device out of the box due to its capacitive touch screen and thoroughly modern , multitasking operating system .
The Pre is little soft on phone reception , though .
Samsung Instinct S30 ( Sprint )
$ 99.99 ( with two - year contract )
The Instinct S30 looks like a slender iPhone copy , and unfortunately is n't nearly as powerful .
That said , the S30 comes packed with streamed video services , GPS navigation , and the ability to buy music tracks over the air from Sprint 's Music Store .
I 'd still give the nod to the Palm Pre , which is a real smartphone with a higher - resolution screen and a much more capable operating system .
But the Instinct S30 offers better battery life and a simpler design at a lower price .
T- Mobile
$ 149.99 ( with two - year contract )
The Samsung Highlight makes an excellent entry - level handset for anyone enamored with touch screens .
The Highlight offers a surprising number of features for the price , including decent music and instant messaging apps and a basic but functional Web browser .
T- Mobile myTouch 3G ( T - Mobile )
$ 199.99 ( with two - year contract )
The nation 's second Google Android smartphone , the myTouch 3G is slimmer and more contemporary than the original , even if it lacks a hardware keyboard .
The myTouch 3G offers a responsive touch screen .
It also runs the latest Android 1.5 OS , which added plenty of features at its introduction a few months ago .
The myTouch 's 3.2 - inch , 320 - by - 480 - pixel screen matches the 3.1 - inch Palm Pre and 3.5 - inch iPhone 3GS panels in resolution , and sits just between them in size .
Verizon Wireless
$ 99.99 ( with two - year contract )
Ca n't decide if you want a big keyboard or a touch screen ?
Get both with the enV Touch .
In fact , this unusual clamshell phone offers two 3 - inch screens .
The outer one is touch - enabled ; it 's a little dull in color , but it 's easy to use .
The inner one is considerably more vibrant , and comes in handy for watching videos or for making use of the roomy QWERTY keyboard inside .
RIM BlackBerry Storm 9530 ( Verizon Wireless )
$ 149.99 ( with two - year contract )
The Storm is a pretty polarizing device , with its clickable touch screen and unconventional interface .
But most of its bugs are now gone with the latest .148 update .
It 's also an e-mail powerhouse , and offers a high - resolution screen along with solid GPS and media players .
There 's a brewing on the horizon , but the Storm 9530 is still the only touch screen BlackBerry in existence .
LITTLE EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP --
When word got out that Mr. McBeth , a popular substitute teacher at two southern New Jersey school districts was about to come back to class as Miss McBeth , it caused an uproar .
The former William McBeth had undergone sex reassignment surgery and was now Lily McBeth .
The schools ' 2006 decisions to keep her on as a substitute were hailed around the nation as a model of tolerance and acceptance of transgender Americans .
But the storybook ending never happened :
She got only a handful of assignments since then and is resigning in frustration .
" When I got the news from the school board that I would be retained , I was thrilled , " she said .
" I thought , ' They consider me a person of worth , and that I could still be a valuable asset . '
" But it did n't happen , " she said .
Before her transition from male to female in 2005 , McBeth said she averaged between 15 to 18 assignments a year as a substitute teacher for elementary students in the Eagleswood school district , and an additional 16 to 20 a year in the Pinelands Regional School District , teaching high school students .
Afterward , she said , she only got two assignments per year at both districts .
" All they did was put me in a closet again , " she said .
" They boxed me in and kept me there . "
McBeth , 75 , sent a letter today to the Eagleswood Board of Education saying she would not return as a substitute this fall , and plans to give similar notice soon to the Pinelands district .
Jennifer Boylan , an English professor at Colby College in Maine and author of the best - selling autobiographical novel , " She 's Not There : A Life In Two Genders , " said transgender people continue to suffer discrimination .
" It seems like a good teacher is being judged for something other than her talent , and we should all be able to agree that 's not fair , " said Boylan , who transitioned in 2000 .
" My heart goes out to Lily and all people who have to fight prejudice as a result of who they are . "
Deborah Snyder , the Eagleswood schools superintendent , said the district wanted McBeth to return this fall .
She denied bias was involved , adding the district has hired a permanent substitute to report to work each day and fill in as needed .
For other classroom vacancies , the district turns to its list of certified teachers .
Only after that is exhausted does it call subs from the local hiring list that included McBeth .
" We wanted to see her back on our sub list , " Snyder said .
" If she makes the decision not to return to our district , we wish her all the best in the future . "
Detlef Kern , the Pinelands superintendent , declined to comment .
McBeth said she misses interacting with students in the classroom .
" I tried to be an example of something you might want to be when you grow up : a kind , caring person , " she said .
While some parents objected at public meetings to McBeth continuing to teach after becoming a woman , many students were supportive .
" I can see where some people might have concerns , but people just need to get over it , " one Pinelands high school student said in 2006 .
Jillian Todd Weiss , an assistant professor of law and society at Ramapo College in New Jersey transitioned in 1998 , about five years before she began teaching .
She said she 's not surprised at how things worked out for McBeth .
" There 's a difference between talking the talk and walking the walk , " said Weiss , who holds seminars for businesses on how to deal with transgender employees in the workplace .
" This often does happen in employment situations where there 's an outward display of tolerance and acceptance . "
Mara Keisling , executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality , said McBeth 's experience is a common one for transgender employees .
A survey her group helped to conduct this year of 6,500 transgender Americans found 91 percent had faced bias at work because of their transgender status .
These included supervisors illegally disseminating personal information to co-workers or deliberately using the wrong pronoun when addressing them ; being passed over for promotion or barred from dealing with clients .
Seven percent reported being physically assaulted at work , and 6 percent said they were sexually assaulted .
McBeth , a retired marketing executive with three children , plans to stay busy with hobbies , which include work to help re-establish clam colonies in Barnegat Bay .
She also acts in local theater productions and sings in a church choir .
" I could sue them over the violation of my medical privacy rights , but what would that accomplish ? " she said .
" I 'm not in this for the money , and I have to be able to sleep peacefully at night .
I 'm just going to enjoy the rest of my life . "
RIP Walter Cronkite !
In the summer 1992 , I was told by an assistant that I had a phone call , and that “ unless the person on the phone was kidding , that it was someone claiming to be Walter Cronkite . ”
I took the call and it was in fact Mr. Cronkite , who wanted to talk about his concerns regarding America ’s so - called ‘ war on drugs ’ .
We talked for about half an hour and he asked me to fax him some data and / or reports to support some of the information I ’d related to him regarding arrest rates , racial disparity and I think the efficacy of medical cannabis .
As he related his fax number to me I recognized the exchange as coming from Dukes County , MA ( which is principally Martha ’s Vineyard and Nantucket Islands ) .
I told Mr. Cronkite that I had grown up in close proximity to his locale , across Nantucket Sound in the Cape Cod town of Chatham .
That sparked an additional half hour conversation about striped bass , giant Atlantic bluefin tuna and the importance of knowing where you derive pleasure .
All in all , a most pleasant conversation with a journalist I ’d grown up watching and had always generally respected .
I was heartened some years later when Walter Cronkite started speaking out strongly against the war on some drugs , including doing fundraising letters and videos for the Drug Policy Alliance .
Drug war is a war on families
By Walter Cronkite
Article Published : Sunday , August 08 , 2004
In the midst of the soaring rhetoric of the recent Democratic National Convention , more than one speaker quoted Abraham Lincoln ’s first inaugural address , invoking “ the better angels of our nature . ”
Well , there is an especially appropriate task awaiting those heavenly creatures – a long - overdue reform of our disastrous war on drugs .
We should begin by recognizing its costly and inhumane dimensions .
Much of the nation , in one way or another , is victimized by this failure – including , most notably , the innocents , whose exposure to drugs is greater than ever .
This despite the fact that there are , housed in federal and state prisons and local jails on drug offenses , more than 500,000 persons – half a million people !
Clearly , no punishment could be too severe for that portion of them who were kingpins of the drug trade and who ruined so many lives .
But by far , the majority of these prisoners are guilty of only minor offenses , such as possessing small amounts of marijuana .
That includes people who used it only for medicinal purposes .
The cost to maintain this great horde of prisoners is more than $ 10 billion annually .
And that ’s just part of the cost of this war on drugs :
The federal , state and local drug - control budgets last year added up to almost $ 40 billion .
These figures were amassed by the Drug Policy Alliance , one of the foremost national organizations seeking to bring reason to the war on drugs and reduce substantially those caught in the terrible web of addiction .
There are awful tales of tragedy and shocking injustice hidden in those figures – the product of an almost mindlessly draconian system called “ mandatory sentencing , ” in which even small offenses can draw years in prison .
Thousands of women , many of them mothers of young children , are included among those minor offenders .
Those children left without motherly care are the most innocent victims of the drug war and the reason some call it a “ war on families . ”
Women are the fastest - growing segment of the prison population , with almost 80 percent of them incarcerated for drug offenses .
The deep perversity of the system lies in the fact that women with the least culpability often get the harshest sentences .
Unlike the guilty drug dealer , they often have no information to trade for a better deal from prosecutors , and might end up with a harsher sentence than the dealer gets .
Then there are women like Kimba Smith , in California , who probably knew a few things but was so terrified of her abusive boyfriend that she refused to testify against him .
( Those who agree to testify , by the way , frequently are murdered before they have a chance to do so . )
Smith paid for her terrified silence with a 24 - year sentence .
Nonviolent first offenders , male and female , caught with only small amounts of a controlled substance frequently are given prison sentences of five to 10 years or more .
As a result , the number of nonviolent offenders in the nation ’s prisons is filling them to overflowing , literally .
The resulting overcrowding is forcing violent felons onto the streets with early releases .
The Drug Policy Alliance also points out other important areas of injustice in the present enforcement system .
For instance , people of color – African - Americans and Latinos – are far more likely to be jailed for drug offenses than others .
And college students caught in possession of very small amounts of illegal substances are denied student loans and even food stamps .
The Alliance and other organizations are working to reform and reframe the war on drugs .
And they are finding many judges on their side , who are rebelling against this cruel system .
We can expect no federal action during the congressional hiatus in activity ahead of the November elections , but it would be of considerable help if , across the country , campaigning politicians put this high on their promises of legislative action , much sooner than later .

Karl Denninger : Bad Math , Bad Statistics : Trying to get a blogger to admit a mistake
2009-07-15
Sometimes someone on the internet is just so wrong that I become engulfed with rage and have to write about it .
In this case , an article was linked to on reddit about " Economic Fundamentals . "
The point of the article was that we are spending way too much on debt and credit .
Which may be a perfectly valid fact , but it could n't have been argued more poorly .
His first argument that we are spending way too much on debt is the following :
In 1981 , US GDP was $ 3.1 trillion dollars .
In 1992 it was $ 6.3 trillion , a double .
In 2005 it was $ 12.4 trillion dollars , another double .
Doubling in roughly 12 - 13 years .
Not bad , right ?
Let 's look at it a different way , this time in " current " ( not inflation - adjusted , since GDP is n't ) dollars .
In 1981 the per-capita income in the US was $ 8,476 .
In 1992 it was $ 14,847 , a 75 % gain .
In 2005 it was $ 25,036 , a 69 % gain .
Notice anything ?
Its not really that subtle , is it ?
GDP slightly more than doubled in each of those above periods , but per-capita income lagged , and the lag rate is increasing .
So what 's wrong with this picture ?
If you guessed , " he 's comparing a gross value with per capita value " you win a cookie .
US population is increasing all the time , and therefore , even if per capita incomes have dropped , that does n't mean total income has n't .
So if you multiply those figures by the population and then compare them , you get this ( source ) :
1981 : 229465714 * 8476.0 = 1.944 trillion
1992 : 255029699 * 14847.0 = 3.786 trillion ( 94 % gain )
2005 : 292892127 * 25036.0 = 7.332 trillion ( 93.6 % gain )
Er , does n't look like a lag to me .
In fact , it looks like it 's doubling every 12 - 13 years just as much as GDP is .
I also looked up total income statistics for the US , and found the following figures ( source ) .
( Note these figures are different .
More on that later . )
1981 : $ 2,580,600,000 ( 2.58 / 3.1 = 83 % of GDP )
1992 : $ 5,349,384,000 ( more than double ! ) ( 5.34 / 6.2 = 86 % of GDP )
2005 : $ 10,252,973,000 ( another double ! ) ( 10.25 / 12.4 = 82 % of GDP )
GO BACK AND READ IT AGAIN .
The issue is n't GDP - per-capita - IT IS PERSONAL EXPENSES IN EXCESS OF PERSONAL INCOME , BOTH PER CAPITA .
Both of those series are from the BLS - SAME DATA SOURCE .
We went from spending $ 400 more than we make ( less than 5 % ) to 16 % more than we make ( $ 4,000 ) , both per-capita per year .
How ?
DEBT .
As I said : GO BACK AND READ IT AGAIN .
Er , looks like the same thing .
So if his thesis is correct , it certainly does n't rest on this .
I emailed him twice about this fact .
You think he'd be happy to correct this unfortunate error of math .
But no , instead he told me to " READ IT AGAIN " :
First problem here is that the listed sources on his blog were n't the BLS : it was the Census Bureau .
Anyway , that seemed besides the point .
So I went back and read the rest of the article .
In it , his next claim is the following :
In 1981 we spent $ 1.941 trillion , or $ 8,600 per capita , about $ 200 more than we made .
That is , we barely spent more than we made - this was the start of the " gluttony of credit . "
But in 2005 we spent $ 8.694 trillion , or $ 29,000 per capita , or about $ 4,000 per person more than we made , or a spending deficit of some sixteen percent !
Looks damning .
But I checked his source for the spending amounts , and he uses the BEA .
Here 's where those different results for personal income come into play : I realized that statistics groups have different ways of measuring personal income .
So I checked the BEA 's personal income figures so they would be consistent with the personal expenditure figures .
Here 's the result ( source ) :( Percentages are spending divided by income ) 1981 : 11,266 ( spent " about $ 8,600 " , actual spending $ 8,439 , 74%) 1992 : 20,870 ( you did n't calculate this one , actual spending $ 16,485 , 78%) 2005 : 34,691 ( spent " $ 29,000 per capita " , actual spending $ 29,368 , 84 % )
So in every case , the expenditures are less than the income .
The percentage is increasing , which is definitely cause for concern .
But it 's nowhere near the debt spending the article claims .
So I emailed him about this , and he responded that the BEA make some kind of adjustment to their income numbers :
Because the BEA has ADJUSTMENTS they make to income .
Care to try to back 'em out ?
I do n't know if you CAN - this , by the way , is a big part of where the problem with their " savings rate " comes from - its false , because it counts paying down debt as " savings " .
Source , please .
I looked at the BEA 's methodologies and see nothing about " adjustments " made to income .
I do n't see it in the table .
And the numbers I got were n't even adjusted for inflation .
Perhaps
I 'm ignorant of some government trickery to falsify the income numbers , but getting two different numbers from two different sources who may very well use VASTLY DIFFERENT methodologies is just bad science , bad math , and even bad statistics .
Now you 've gone from a discussion to ad - hominen attacks .
I have twice asked you to re-read the original article .
You keep coming back with canards ; the entire issue is the efficiency of the economy - that is , what is the " spread " between spending and income , and what is the " spread " between GDP and income .
I 've presented my case and have no more time for someone who wishes to argue that the RATIOS are n't the important issue when that 's exactly how the original argument was framed .
My response : He responds : Now , I did say that his math was bad .
I did say that his article was flawed .
But people really need to learn what " " actually means instead of just throwing it out there every time they feel threatened .
Also , I 'm pretty sure I never sent him any canards and my complaints were legitimate .
This is the part that gets me frustrated enough to type this blog out .
In any case , what 's this " spread " he 's referring to ?
Well , he wrote a follow - up article in which he talked about the GDP to Personal Income " spread " :
In numbers , in 1981 per-capita GDP was $ 13,600 while per-capita income was $ 8,476 , a " spread " of 60 % .
In 2005 per-capita GDP was $ 42,200 while per-capita income was $ 25,036 , a " spread " of 68 % .
Lower " spreads " denote a greater return of GDP into the hands of people - that is , a more efficient economy .
The wider the spread the more " parasitic drains " there are on GDP - that is , the greater the amount of GDP that winds up somewhere other than in the people 's hands .
But here 's the problem : he is .
The Census web site itself says : " Income data obtained in household interviews are subject to various types of reporting errors which tend to produce an understatement of income . "
So here 's the numbers with the BEA 's figures :
1981 : PCI $ 11,266 / GDP $ 13,601 = 82.8 %
2005 : PCI $ 34,691 / GDP $ 41,961 = 82.6 %
So the " spread " really only dropped by 0.2 % .
But let 's look at 2007 :
PCI $ 38,654 / GDP $ 45,670 = 84.6 %
It 's clear that this " spread " value is meaningless .
Confronted with this fact , Karl replies :
You have n't proved anything Stephen .
You have steadfastly refused to go to the point of the article , and this has consumed over an hour of my time today .
You know , I was at least hoping he'd make some kind of correction or at the very leastthat his article has data in it that , at the very least , conflict with other sources .
But this is the internet , where you never have to say you 're wrong .
Karl eventually wrote back , saying :
No . [ BEA includes ] " records of disbursements to individuals by governmental agencies "
If you do n't understand why that can't be included for the series I was presenting then there is nothing more to discuss .
If you DO understand why that can't be included then go ahead and tell me how you back it out - because you have to .
You did the basic research ONLY AFTER I BASICALLY FORCED YOU TO but you did n't understand what you were looking at .
Now cogitate on the " why " for a while and the light should come on as to WHY the BEA numbers can't be used for that particular piece of information .
( See , progress , even if I had to drag you kicking and screaming to it ! )
Of course , I responded that 1 ) the eventual " answer " had nothing to do with what he was talking about and 2 ) if if you 're an Ayn Rander that things fiat currency is fake money , if you get a disbursement from the government and spend it , you 're not spending outside your means , and therefore is perfectly acceptable to be included in a per capita income statistic , especially in an article like he wrote ..
Am I wrong ?
I repeatedly asked him why he refused to accept the BEA figures , or what kind of " adjustments " they made , and he kept on saying that " If you read the report like I do every month , you 'd know that you 'd have to go through every year and adjust ! ! "
He never articulated exactly what kind of thing might be unacceptable in the income figures .
He said that they " made ADJUSTMENTS " but after I explicitly asked him , out of ignorance , not spite , what kind of adjustments they were since I could n't find any mention of them on the BEA 's site .
If someone out there reads this and knows the answer , I would really like to know .
Karl , on the other hand , refused to answer , saying he does n't want to do my work for me .
Anyway , the point of the whole story is that I was silly and expected a blogger on the internet to recant their mistakes when I pointed them out .
The best bloggers do , but I find that crazy bloggers and unwillingness to admit wrongdoing are strongly correlated .
I strongly suspect that Karl wo n't write me back .
Sometimes you can't win .
EDIT : He did write me back ; updates you 've probably already read .
I also think that this is a symptom of our poor national discourse , especially in the world of blogging and the internet .
Blogging is just throwing your opinions out there .
As pro-science as the internet demographic is , it seems none of them really enjoy partaking in reasoned debate about politics .
I suspect that maybe it's the case that some people just are n't good at reading or expressing their thoughts clearly enough to efficiently communicate with people on the internet without shouting in the most vague terms or repeating talking points ad infinitum .
I am also worried about yet another Latin phrase being misused -- ad hominem does n't mean someone insulted you .

Archaeologists in south Moravia have begun excavating the site of a Roman hospital which is described as the largest preserved site of its kind north of the Danube .
Indeed , it was part of a fortified complex that was the northernmost outpost of the Roman Empire in the region in the second century .
Photo : CTK
Archaeologists have been aware for some years of the ruins of a Roman field hospital at Pasohlávky , around 30 kilometres south of Brno .
But only now have they begun excavating the site , which the archaeologist in charge of the dig told the Czech News Agency was the biggest facility of its kind persevered north of the River Danube .
Photo : CTK
The hospital , 60 m by 45 m in size , was part of an extensive fortified complex the 10th Roman legion built on Hradisko hill in the latter half of the second century .
At that time , during the reign of Marcus Aurelius , it was the northernmost outpost of the Roman Empire in central Europe .
The Germans had been making raids across the Danube and the Romans established the stronghold in order to keep them at bay .
Though the site is regarded as important , all it features today are remains of the foundations of the second century hospital .
That is all that is left after construction work on the nearby Nové Mlýny dam system in the mid 1970s .
The reason the current dig is taking place is that there are plans to build a new thermal spa at Pasohlávky .
One of the archaeologists said that the original layout of the Roman hospital could be marked in the new facility by paths or bushes .

Bob Crow called for concerted action to tackle the BNP
The left - wing No2EU party led by the leader of RMT rail union Bob Crow has gained 1 % of the UK vote in the European Parliament elections .
The No2EU - Yes to Democracy alliance polled 153,236 votes .
The party 's leader , Bob Crow , blamed the BNP 's electoral success on the collapse of the main political parties .
He called for urgent talks between socialist organisations and trade unions to build a concerted political and industrial response to the results .
Mr Crow said : " There is no question that the BNP has benefited from the collapse of the establishment political parties and from media coverage that has pumped them up . "
He said sections of the press were also to blame for the BNP 's success by giving it " blanket coverage " .
He added : " But it 's the collapse of public support for the three main parties - each of which is pro-business , pro-EU and supportive of the anti-union laws - which has created the conditions for the scapegoat - politics of the BNP to thrive .
" The fascists ' support in former mining communities like Barnsley is shocking and throws down a massive challenge to the Labour and trade union movement . "
The party , had said if it were elected , its MEPs would refuse to take their seats in the the European Parliament in protest at the institution 's " undemocratic " nature .
In Today ’s Programming Praxis problem we have to solve a logic puzzle .
The provided solution uses a 182 - line logic programming library and then takes 36 lines to solve the problem .
I did n’t feel like porting 182 lines from Scheme to Haskell , so I rolled my own solution .
It ’s going to be a slightly longer one than usual though , so let ’s dive right in .
Our imports :
import Data .
List import qualified Data .
Map as M
We ’re going to handle the constraints by applying them to a two - dimensional grid .
One axis holds the position of the house ( first , second , etc. ) and the other the various properties ( nationality , color , etc. ) .
Each cell holds the remaining options for that combination of house and property .
By applying constraints we ’re going to remove options until each cell has only one option left .
It ’s a bit like sudoku puzzles if you think about it .
type Grid = M . Map String ( M . Map Int [ String ] )
In the problem we have four types of constraints , which we encode in an ADT :
data Constraint = Link ( String , String ) ( String , String ) | PosLink ( String , String ) Int | NextTo ( String , String ) ( String , String ) | RightOf ( String , String ) ( String , String ) deriving Eq
A convenience type to keep the type signatures a bit easier to read :
type Solver = ([ Constraint ] , Grid )
Adding a constraint to a solver is trivial :
addConstraint :: Constraint -> Solver ->
Solver addConstraint c ( cs , g ) = ( c : cs , g )
This function abstracts out some common logic .
It removes options from the grid if the conditions to do so have been met .
removeIf :: ( String , String ) -> ( String , String ) -> [ String -> String -> Int -> Grid -> Bool ] -> Grid ->
Grid removeIf ( f1 , v1 ) ( f2 , v2 ) cs g = M . adjust ( M . mapWithKey ( \k -> if and [ c f1 v1 k g | c <- cs ] then delete v2 else id ) ) f2 g
Like removeIf , not At abstract out some common code .
It checks if a given value is still an option for the given property in another house .
notAt :: ( Int -> Int ) ->
String -> String -> Int -> Grid ->
Bool not
At f f1 v1 i g = M .
notMember ( f i ) ( g M .! f1 ) || notElem v1 ( g M .! f1 M .! ( f i ) )
With that out of the way , the function to apply a constraint looks like this .
Since most constraints work in two directions , we have to apply them in both directions .
runConstraint :: Constraint -> Grid ->
Grid runConstraint ( Link a b ) = removeIf a b conds .
removeIf b a conds where conds = [ ( \f1 v1 k -> notElem v1 . ( M .! k ) . ( M .! f1 ) ) ] runConstraint ( PosLink ( f1 , v1 ) i ) = M . adjust ( M . update ( const $ Just [ v 1 ] ) i ) f1 runConstraint ( NextTo a b ) = removeIf a b [ not At pred , not At succ ] runConstraint ( RightOf a b ) = removeIf a b [ not At pred ] .
removeIf b a [ not At succ ]
adjustOthers applies a function to all elements of a map except the given one , which we need for the next function .
adjustOthers :: Eq k => ( v -> v ) -> k -> M . Map k v -> M .
Map k v adjustOthers f k = M . mapWithKey ( \k ' v -> if k ' == k then v else f v )
If a house has only one option left for a property than we can remove that option from all the other houses .
Similarly , if a house is the only one that still has a certain option , we can remove the other options for that property .
simplify :: Grid ->
Grid simplify g = foldr ( $ ) ( M . mapWithKey ( \_ v -> M . mapWithKey ( \i x -> let d = x \\ concat ( M . elems $ M . delete i v ) in if length d == 1 then d else x ) v ) g ) [ M . adjust ( adjustOthers ( \\ take 1 x ) i ) f | ( f , v ) <- M . assocs g , ( i , x ) <- M . assocs v , length x == 1 ]
run simply runs all the constraints once .
run :: Solver ->
Solver run ( cs , g ) = ( cs , simplify $ foldr runConstraint g cs )
Once all the constraints have been run , we might have fewer options available than we did at the beginning , which might open up new possibilities for more removal .
apply keeps applying all the constraints until no further progress is made .
apply :: Solver ->
Solver apply = head .
head .
dropWhile ( null . tail ) . group .
iterate run
If we had enough constraints to solve the problem with just constraint propagation we could stop here .
Unfortunately , this does n’t work on the problem we have to solve .
While it significantly reduces the available options , it ca n’t give a complete solution .
So we ’re going to have to do what any self - respecting logician would do in such a scenario : guess .
If a property still has multiple options we choose one of them and see if we can solve it then .
If not , we try the next option , or we do the same thing for the next property if none of the guesses helps solve the problem .
If any property still has more than one option the problem is not solved .
solved :: M . Map k ( M . Map k ' [ v ] ) ->
Bool solved g = and [ False | ( _ , v ) <- M . assocs g , ( _ , xs ) <- M . assocs v , length xs /= 1 ]
solve takes care of the guesswork , and also reformats the output to be more readable .
solve :: Solver -> [ String ] solve s = map ( unwords . map head ) .
transpose . map ( M . elems ) .
M . elems $ head [ r | let ( cs , g ) = apply s , ( f , v ) <- M . assocs $ g , ( i , xs ) <- M . assocs v , x <- xs , let ( _ , r ) = apply ( cs , M . adjust ( M . adjust ( const [ x ] ) i ) f g ) , solved r ]
And there we have our constraint solver .
Now for the problem .
First we create the grid with all the options :
grid :: Grid grid = M . fromList . zip ( words " owner brand drink pet color " ) $ map ( M . fromList . zip [ 1 ..] .
replicate 5 ) [ words " Englishman Ukranian Norwegian Japanese Spaniard " , words " Old_Gold Kools Chesterfields Lucky_Strike Parliaments " , words " Coffee Tea Milk Orange_Juice Water " , words " Dog Snails Horse Fox Zebra " , words " Red Green Ivory Yellow Blue " ]
Next we add all our constraints .
problem :: Solver problem = foldr addConstraint ( [ ] , grid ) [ Link ( " owner " , " Englishman " ) ( " color " , " Red " ) , Link ( " owner " , " Spaniard " ) ( " pet " , " Dog " ) , Link ( " drink " , " Coffee " ) ( " color " , " Green " ) , Link ( " owner " , " Ukranian " ) ( " drink " , " Tea " ) , RightOf ( " color " , " Ivory " ) ( " color " , " Green " ) , Link ( " brand " , " Old_Gold " ) ( " pet " , " Snails " ) , Link ( " brand " , " Kools " ) ( " color " , " Yellow " ) , PosLink ( " drink " , " Milk " ) 3 , PosLink ( " owner " , " Norwegian " ) 1 , NextTo ( " brand " , " Chesterfields " ) ( " pet " , " Fox " ) , NextTo ( " brand " , " Kools " ) ( " pet " , " Horse " ) , Link ( " brand " , " Lucky_Strike " ) ( " drink " , " Orange_Juice " ) , Link ( " owner " , " Japanese " ) ( " brand " , " Parliaments " ) , NextTo ( " owner " , " Norwegian " ) ( " color " , " Blue " ) ]
And finally we print the solution .
main :: IO ( ) main = mapM_ putStrLn $ solve problem
That brings the total to 36 lines for the solver and 23 for the problem , and it runs in about 60 ms .
I ’d say that will do nicely .

Real - world disease - prevention often means checking in the word " should " at the door .
Take abstinence programmes : whether or not you think kids should be having sex , you can't miss the fact that they are having sex .
If you want kids to stay disease - free and healthy , you have to provide them with the tools and skills to have sex while doing so .
The facts speak for themselves ; countries where abstinence is the primary mitigation strategy have higher rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections than countries where sexual education and free birth control and condoms are the rule .
Of course , it 's worth asking why kids are having sex and whether you can do something about that fact , too .
The researcher danah boyd has identified at - risk kids haunting sexually explicit chatrooms – and it's there that predators go to find prey , not random messageboards or chatrooms ( boyd likens the idea that predators will find victims on random MySpace pages to the idea that they would pick phone numbers at random and dial them ) .
If you want to make kids really safe , it 's worth looking into the factors that send kids out looking for trouble .
There 's a lesson in here for IT security in here .
Every time a state secret disappears from an internet - connected PC , every time a hospital computer reboots itself in the middle of a surgical procedure because it has just downloaded the latest patch , every time an MRI machine gets infected with an internet worm , I hear security experts declaiming , " Those computers should never be connected to the internet ! " and shaking their heads at the foolish users and the foolish IT department that gave rise to a situation where sensitive functions were being executed on a computer connected to the seething , malware - haunted public internet .
But no amount of head - shaking is going to change the fact that computers , by and large , get connected .
It 's what they 're designed to do .
You might connect to the internet without even meaning to ( for example , if your computer knows that it 's allowed to connect to a BT Wi-Fi access point , it will connect and disconnect from hundreds of them if you carry it with you through the streets of London ) .
Operating systems are getting more promiscuous about net connections , not less : expect operating systems to start seeking out Bluetooth - enabled 3G phones and using them to reach out to the net when nothing else is available .
All evidence suggests that keeping computers off the internet is a losing battle .
And even if you think you can discipline your workers into staying offline , would n't it be lovely if you had a security solution that worked even if someone broke the rules ?
" You should n't be having net at your age , but if you do , you should at least practice safe hex . "
A good security system – especially for sensitive machines – should contemplate the possibility that a computer is going to be connected to the net even if that 's not supposed to happen : needless services turned off , appropriate firewall rules ( including rules that distrust the LAN as well as the WAN ) , good auto - update policies that require human intervention .
But IT departments need to go beyond defense in depth .
To effectively secure a network , you need to become an epidemiologist of your users ' unsafe activity .
Did the radiologist plug the ethernet into the MRI machine because she needed to update the controller software with a new version in order to get her job done ?
Are the operating theatre 's machines on the LAN because surgeons have followed the entire rest of the world in outsourcing their remembrance of petty facts to search engines ?
Does that defence contractor carry his sensitive materials on his laptop because he is collaborating with hundreds of other contractors in a huge , complex endeavour only possible with networked communications ?
Users will always prioritise getting their job done over honouring your network policy , and who can blame them ?
If network policy breaches are n't followed up with safe solutions to users ' demonstrated needs , they 'll keep on happening , no matter how much security you put between your users and their duties .
In the era of cheap and easy virtualisation and sandboxing , there 's no reason users should n't be able to partition their computers into " dirty " public - facing sides and " clean " private sides .
Of course , a user might subvert this separation deliberately , but the only way to comprehensively prevent that from occurring is to make it possible for a user to get the job done without needing to do so .
Just like the parents who are running around shagging their brains out while preaching abstinence , IT departments are generally happy to step outside the boundaries they set out for their users in order to get their jobs done .
Teenagers are n't the only people who ignore abstinence programs – users and kids can sniff out hypocrisy a mile away .
The goal of this blog is to share my of knowledge of beer and the micro brew culture .
I do not have many people to talk to about everything that is going on in the micro brew culture here in MInnesota .
Everyone has their beer they drink , and its usually one of the “ Big Three ” ( Coors , Miller , or Budweiser ) .
Which to me is like eating the same meal for the rest of your life .
No thank you , thats not for me .
I will be posting more as soon as I get more time .
Thanks for Visiting !
There ’s a lot more to come .
P.S. Check out some of my links .
I visit them almost everyday .
You could rely on a health maintenance organization to make the hard choices and do the cost management , and to some extent we do .
But HMOs have been highly limited in their ability to achieve cost - effectiveness because people do n’t trust them — they ’re profit - making institutions , and your treatment is their cost .
[ Emphasis in the original . ]
In a post on healthcare , Paul Krugman makes this observation : Paul 's comment got me thinking .
Perhaps a lot of the disagreement over healthcare reform , and maybe other policy issues as well , stems from the fundamental question of what kind of institutions a person trusts .
Some people are naturally skeptical of profit - seeking firms ; others are naturally skeptical of government .
( There is , of course , the issue that an HMO can be run as a nonprofit organization .
The one I use through Harvard is an example .
But let 's put that issue aside for another day . ) I tend to distrust power unchecked by competition .
This makes me particularly suspicious of federal policies that take a strong role in directing private decisions .
I am much more willing to have state and local governments exercise power in a variety of ways than for the federal government to undertake similar actions .
I can more easily move to another state or town than to another nation .
( I am not good with languages . )
Most private organizations have some competitors , and this fact makes me more comfortable interacting with them .
If Harvard is a bad employer , I can move to Princeton or Yale , and this knowledge keeps Harvard in line .
To be sure , we need a government - run court system to enforce contracts , prevent fraud , and preserve honest competition .
But it is fundamentally competition among private organizations that I trust .
This philosophical inclination most likely influences my views of the healthcare debate .
The more power a centralized government authority asserts , the more worried I am that the power will be misused either purposefully or , more likely , because of some well - intentioned but mistaken social theory .
I prefer reforms that set up rules of the game but end up with power over key decisions as decentralized as possible .
What puzzles me is that Paul seems so ready to trust solutions that give a large role to the federal government .
( In the past , for instance , he has advocated a single payer for healthcare . )
I understand that trust of centralized authority is common among liberals .
But here is the part that puzzles me :
Over the past eight years , Paul has tried to convince his readers that Republicans are stupid and venal .
History suggests that Republicans will run the government about half the time .
Does he really want to turn control of healthcare half the time over to a group that he considers stupid and venal ?
These thoughts , I appreciate , are broad generalizations .
They do n't immediately lead to a specific set of reform proposals .
But I wanted to give Paul credit for a key insight : A central question in this and perhaps other debates is , Whom do you trust ?
Why Men Prefer Direct Pick - Up Lines
· Both sexes know men prefer a direct approach from woman , but is it just because men ca n’t read the signs ?
Men and women ’s attitudes to relationships have become remarkably similar — when dating women are now much more likely to make the first move .
It will come as no surprise that research finds men prefer this first move to be direct .
But do men and women agree on what a direct approach is and why such directness is necessary in the first place ?
These questions are addressed in a new study published recently in the journal Personality and Individual Differences ( Wade et al. , 2009 ) .
Forty women aged between 19 and 22 were asked to list the types of opening lines they might use to signal their interest in dating a man .
Researchers sorted these into 10 categories , then 40 men and women rated them in order of perceived directness .
Here are the 10 categories ( with examples ) from most to least direct :
Directly ask out on a date :
Want to go get dinner ?
Ask if single :
Do you have a girlfriend ?
Give out phone number , or ask for a call :
You should call me .
Give a compliment : I like your hair .
Ask about shared interests :
Do you watch The Wire ?
Indirectly hint at a date :
What are you doing later this weekend ?
Say something funny / sexual humour : Wanna make out ?
Suggest familiarity : Have we met before ?
Personal interest questions :
How was your weekend ?
Subtle hello :
Hey , what ’s your name ?
Then men were asked which lines they thought would be most effective for women to use on them .
They pretty much put the chat - up lines in order of directness , with the most direct also perceived as the most effective .
When women were asked to do the same they produced a similar list with one exception .
Women did n’t rate as highly giving out phone numbers or asking for a call .
Overall , though , women clearly understand that men prefer the direct approach .
The only surprise is the low ranking of funny or sexual humour .
Men do n’t seem to appreciate the lewd come - ons suggested by gender stereotypes .
This relatively low rating for a jokey approach is another thing shared by both sexes .
Previous work by Bale et al. ( 2006 ) found that women were n’t particularly impressed with men trying to be funny , despite what we are often told .
It seems opening lines are a serious business for both sexes .
Ambiguous signals
The interesting question , although it may seem easy to answer , is why do men prefer a direct approach ?
Two obvious answers are men ’s purported inability to read body language or an assumed distaste for reading situational subtleties ( in other words : too stupid or ca n’t be bothered ) .
But researchers in Germany provide us with evidence for an alternative explanation .
Grammer et al. ( 2000 ) videotaped opposite sex pairs meeting for the first time to catch the nuances of body language in the first 10 minutes of an interaction .
Afterwards women were asked how much interest they had in the man they ’d been talking to .
The researchers revealed two counter - intuitive results :
In the first minute women behaved no differently to men they fancied than those they did n’t .
They sent many positive nonverbal signals to all the men and hardly any negative signals .
It is only between the 4th and 10th minute that any correlation was seen between an increased sending of positive nonverbal behaviours and wanting to date the man .
But even then the difference was only between some positive signals and slightly more positive signals .
Again negative signals were very rare .
The reason men prefer a direct approach becomes clearer .
Women may think they are sending out all the right nonverbal signals and may blame men for failing to pick up on them .
But from a man ’s perspective there may often be little to pick up on because women , being polite , are always sending positive nonverbal signals .
While it ’s not good practice to generalise too much from one relatively small study of 45 participants whose age ranged from 18 to 23 , the results accord with what men say anecdotally : they often ca n’t tell if women are interested or not because the signals are too ambiguous .
So subtlety is out and it ’s back to the age - old problem for both men and women : who has the guts to risk rejection with the direct approach ?
· Related : the psychology of relationships , particularly : the hidden purpose of chat - up lines .
In his weekly sermon Saturday evening , Shas ' spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef slammed US President Barack Obama and other western leaders for pressuring Israel to freeze construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem .
" ' You ca n't build here , you can't build there ' – it's as if we were their slaves , " the rabbi protested .
" We are being ruled by slaves , " he said , " adding that , " Our messiah will come and throw them out . "
Rabbi Ovadia also bemoaned the current reality in the Temple Mount , saying : " Where is our temple ?
There are Arabs there ! "
He then promised that the messiah " will throw all these evil ones out of here . "
Rabbi Ovadia 's sermon was mostly dedicated to the customs of the Fast of Tisha B'Av , which will be marked on Thursday .
He stressed that reading the newspaper was forbidden on that day , because it was a distraction from the day 's mourning .
The rabbi stated that taking a walk on Tisha B'Av is prohibited as well .
Instead of studying Torah , which is also forbidden , Rabbi Ovadia recommended to study mourning rituals or books on ethics .
However , he noted that in general , only by studying the Torah can the arrival of the Messiah be brought closer .

Good point .
I think what I was going for with the sword was a pixelly thing held at and angle , so the sides can be crisp diagonals due to foregrounding , but the pointy tip does n't make any sense !
I 'll fix that , do n't know if it'll make the shield any more obvious , but I 'm trying to be fairly authentic with representing everything I can from the original game the same way , but in 3D .

Looking really slick .
Fighting is a bit harder in this than in the regular LoZ , I agree that lengthening the sword 's reach would probably be a good idea .
In fact , I 'd say you 're going to have to change quite a bit in the game in order to make a 3D version playable ...
I can't imagine how hard it would be to kill Darknuts this way .
I mean , it 's already hard enough top - down .
Perhaps it would be best to go with the spirit of Zelda rather than the rule of Zelda .

The changes from 0.98.9 to 0.99.3 were pretty major , and it's not likely that they 're going to change back .
Depending on what 's breaking , your game as it is just might not be compatible with any future versions ( hooray for beta ) .
You 'll likely have to bite the bullet and figure out which part of your engine needs to be rewritten , or which object settings need to be updated .
Which would be totally worth it , because this project is cool as hell Nice .

» If I have to I will , but as far as I can tell the only problem with 993 is that adjusting pitch / yaw of 3 D boxes is unsupported .
The only other relevant change was the default height , but that was easily fixed .
I have a feeling that being able to mouse aim with projectile weapons will make the sword a lot less important .
There 's actually a slightly newer version that has a few items partly implemented and more of the dungeon , but I think I accidentally saved it in 993 .
Oops .

As you may have guessed , I have a serious soft spot for everyday cakes . *
I call them Dinner Party Cakes .
Or Potluck Cakes .
Or I Heard You Were Coming and So I Baked You a Cake , cakes .
Or If You Bake a Cake , The People Will Come cakes , as a fresh - from - the - oven cake has a way of drawing friends around your coffee table on an otherwise blah Monday night .
Home baked goods are magical like that .
This one was no exception .
( Well , except for the part where the preggo in the audience may have fallen asleep before actually telling people when to ring the doorbell .
But let ’s not talk about that . )
I saw it in Gourmet last week and it sounded so deliciously summery , I was “ fixin ' ” ( as my friend Molly says ) to bake it immediately .
Alas , I ’m still convinced my new kitchen conspires against me , as this time the oven which had been working a whole 36 hours before had mysteriously stopped ( Said “ mystery ” turned out to be a pilot light that needed re-lighting .
What ?
I ’m new here , okay ? ) and I had to wait a whole four days to actually get to this .
It was totally worth the wait .
The cake is ridiculously simple , takes no time at all to assemble or bake ( especially if you discover that your newly - lit oven runs ridiculously hot and spits out an almost - toasted cake in just over half the suggested time , not that I recommend this ) and is therefore just perfect for your upcoming long weekend ( or Tuesday night ) as it will not keep you from it .
I already told you , it ’s magic .

One day , soon hopefully , I will put all of the “ everyday cakes ” on this site on one topic page .

Raspberry Buttermilk Cake
Adapted from Gourmet , June 2009
You can just ignore the word “ raspberry ” up there and swap it up with any which berry you please , like blackberries or blueberries or bits of strawberries or all of the above .
This is a good , basic go - to buttermilk cake ( not unlike a lemon yogurt cake before it ) — moist and ever - so - light — a great jumping off point for whatever you can dream up .
By the way , I was having a “ moment ” when I made this and for once , remembered to weigh my ingredients as I measured them , for all of you people out there that know weighing is way easier than dirtying a zillion cups and spoons .
Now let ’s just hope my scale is accurate .
Makes one thin 9 - inch cake , which might serve eight people , if you can pry it from first two people ’s grasp
1 cup ( 130 grams ) all - purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon ( 2 grams ) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon ( 2 grams ) baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoons ( 2 ounces or 55 grams ) unsalted butter , softened
2/3 cup ( 146 grams ) plus 1 1/2 tablespoons ( 22 grams ) sugar , divided
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1/2 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest ( optional )
1 large ( 57 grams ) egg
1/2 cup ( 118 ml ) well - shaken buttermilk
1 cup ( 5 ounces or 140 grams ) fresh raspberries
Preheat oven to 400 °F with rack in middle .
Butter and flour a 9 - inch round cake pan .
Whisk together flour , baking powder , baking soda , and salt and set aside .
In a larger bowl , beat butter and 2/3 cup ( 146 grams ) sugar with an electric mixer at medium - high speed until pale and fluffy , then beat in vanilla and zest , if using .
Add egg and beat well .
At low speed , mix in flour mixture in three batches , alternating with buttermilk , beginning and ending with flour , and mixing until just combined .
Spoon batter into cake pan , smoothing top .
Scatter ( see Note ) raspberries evenly over top and sprinkle with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons ( 22 grams ) sugar .
Bake until cake is golden and a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean , 20 to 25 minutes .
Cool in pan 10 minutes , then turn out onto a rack and cool to warm , 10 to 15 minutes more .
Invert onto a plate .
[ Baking time updated , shortened , after so many of you concurred that this cake bakes crazy quickly . ]
Note : Directions like “ scatter ” always scare me .
Where ’s the science ?
Here ’s what my neuroses taught us : the ones that were downward were almost all swallowed by the batter .
The " o " ones stayed empty , like cups .
Both were delicious .
Make your own almost - buttermilk :
No need to buy buttermilk especially for this or any recipe .
Add one teaspoon tablespoon [ updated , as an astute reader pointed out that the larger amount is more common ] of vinegar or lemon juice to one cup of milk and let it sit until it clabbers , about 10 minutes .
Voila , buttermilk !

Mimicking plant transpiration to scavenge electricity ( Image : Image Source / Rex Features )
Artificial photosynthesis has yet to be cracked , but electrical engineers in the US think that synthetic leaves could be used to generate electricity in a different way – by sweating .
Natural leaves constantly lose water through evaporation in a process called transpiration , which draws water from the roots to the very top of even the tallest trees .
The new synthetic leaves also lose water through evaporation to create that mechanical water pump effect , and use it to generate power .

Flowing bubbles
Michel Maharbiz at the University of California , Berkeley , working with Ruba Borno at the University of Michigan and Joe Steinmeyer at MIT , built their leaves from glass wafers shot through with a branching network of tiny water - filled channels arranged like the veins of a leaf .
The smaller channels extend to the edge of the plate and have open ends that allow water to evaporate , drawing fluid along the leaf ’s central stem at a rate of 1.5 centimetres per second .
The researchers added metal plates to the walls of the central stem and connected them to a circuit .
The charged plates and the water within the stem create a sandwich of two conducting layers separated by an insulating layer – in effect , a capacitor .
The leaf is transformed into a source of power by periodically interrupting the water flowing into the leaf with air bubbles .
Thanks to the different electrical properties of air and water , every time a bubble passes between the plates the capacitance of the device changes and a small electric current is generated , which passes to an external circuit where it ’s used to pump up the voltage on a storage capacitor .
“ We use the mechanical energy in the liquid flow to change the capacitance and add energy to the capacitor , ” says Maharbiz .
Energy scavenger
Each bubble results in an increase in output voltage of some 2 to 5 microvolts , and the device has a power density of some 2 microwatts per cubic centimetre .
“ I think we could easily reach hundreds of microwatts per cubic centimetre [ with modifications ] , ” he says .
That is still a fraction of the power density of power systems such as fuel cells or batteries , but it ’s a respectable figure for an energy scavenging system , Maharbiz says .
The device could be scaled up to produce artificial trees that generate power entirely through evaporation wherever there ’s a cyclical change in humidity .
Although the modest power output is not enough to rival solar technology , Maharbiz thinks it could act as a complementary technology – the sunlight that generates solar power could also drive transpiration to boost the electricity generated .
Breaking the tension
Abraham Stroock at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , thinks this is the first attempt to generate electricity from evaporation - driven flow .
Although he points out that one US firm Voltree has succeeded in generating tiny quantities of power from the pH difference between soil and the roots of real trees .
“ One challenge with the new study is that a bubble is used to generate the current in the capacitor , ” Stroock says .
Bubbles prevent transpiration taking place over long distances because they break the tension that allows the water column to be pulled along like a piece of string .
Maharbiz says he can get round this issue by using solid insulators instead of bubbles , that spin in place as the water is pulled passed like a water wheel to create the permittivity differences needed to generate power .

Murtha Gets Angry With Reporter Asking About Ties To Corrupt Company
In response to a question from a reporter , Rep. John Murtha ( D - Penn . ) adamantly denied any connection to Kuchera Defense Systems , Inc. , which is currently being investigated for alleged fraud .
FOX News : Embattled Democratic Congressman Temporarily Gives Up Key Duty
“ Fracking ” is the slang term used for hydraulic fracturing , a process by which the gas industry injects a slurry of unknown composition into a gas well in order to break up the rock and release the natural gas contained within .
At present , the EPA exempts fracking from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act ( SDWA ) , but Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado has introduced legislation into the House ( H.R.2766 ) to force the EPA to regulate fracking .
In response , the gas industry has pushed back with studies that purport to show that regulation is both unnecessary and costly .
A new article by ProPublica , an “ independent , non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest , ” shows that the exact same studies being used by industry to oppose fracking actually counter the industry ’s own arguments .
The gas industry claims that there is already sufficient regulation and oversight of fracking at the state level .
The ProPublica article contests this claim , pointing out the following :
In fact , the report calls for some of same measures found in the congressional bill the industry is so hotly contesting .
Regarding fracturing in areas close to the surface or near shallow aquifers , the report reads : “ States should consider requiring companies to submit a list of additives used in formation fracturing and their concentration . ”
It also says that shallow fracturing very close to certain drinking water aquifers “ should either be stopped , or restricted to the use of materials that do not pose a risk of endangering ground water and do not have the potential to cause human health effects . ”
The additives issue is specifically addressed in HR2766 , just as the ProPublica article says :
In subparagraph ( C ) of paragraph ( 1 ) insert before the semicolon ` , including a requirement that any person using hydraulic fracturing disclose to the State ( or the Administrator if the Administrator has primary enforcement responsibility in the State ) the chemical constituents ( but not the proprietary chemical formulas ) used in the fracturing process ’.
( Section 2 ( b ) ( 1 ) )
The bigger problem is that , according to the article , “ 21 of the 31 states listed do not have any specific regulation addressing hydraulic fracturing ; 17 states do not require companies to list the chemicals they put in the ground ; and no state requires companies to track how much drilling fluid they pump into or remove from the earth — crucial data for determining what portion of chemicals has been discarded underground . ”
So much for “ the states do a great job regulating fracking already . ”
As to the cost question , the study that supposedly claims that the cost of complying with the SDWA is about $ 100,000 per gas well has a number of major flaws .
For example , the study uses data that ’s 10 years old , it estimates costs for tests that are n’t required by the SDWA , and the vice president of the group who did the study ( and was interviewed for the ProPublica article ) believes “ that many of the processes listed in the report are already being practiced to a greater degree than they were in 1999 , meaning that even if they were required they may not be additional burdens at all . ”
An estimate produced by Deutsche Bank analysts found something radically different from the industry ’s preferred studies :
If all the testing that Godec includes is factored out , the regulations would cost the industry just $ 4,500 per well , according to his report , or just six hundredths of a percent of the cost of establishing a typical new well .
The jury ’s still out on whether fracking is a threat to water supplies ( anecdotes are not data ) , but one thing is abundantly clear : the industry did n’t do itself any favors by misrepresenting and / or cherry - picking study data and findings in order to oppose federal fracking legislation .

Can concentrating photovoltaic compete with solar thermal and standard photovoltaic ?
Photovoltaic ( PV ) electricity is notoriously inefficient .
The theoretical maximum for a simple PV cell irradiated by a single sun ( equivalent irradiance ) is 31 % , which is less than half of the efficiency of the best coal generation .
More complex PV cells rely on the absorption of multiple light frequencies or the concentration of solar energy to achieve greater efficiencies .
While there have been some interesting recent developments in solar power such as so - called combined - cycle solar , these developments are n’t intended for utility - scale electricity generation .
A new technology reported by Greenwire has the potential to provide gigawatts of electricity – concentrating photovoltaic ( CPV ) .
The point of CPV is to make solar electricity cheaper .
Compared to solar thermal ( the concentrating of sunlight on a tower that boils water to turn an electrical turbine ) , CPV uses much less water and has a more distributed footprint .
Given that the same areas that are good for solar power are also short on water resources , cutting water consumption by over 99 % is a huge deal .
In addition , environmentalists are already getting concerned about large swaths of desert being converted into solar thermal and standard solar PV farms , with the accompanying environmental degradation and loss of wild space .
CPV , on the other hand , is more like wind turbines – they can be spread out and the area between and underneath CPV structures can still be used for other purposes .
As far as the energy economics of the technology , one company mentioned in the article did a “ cradle - to - grave ” energy analysis and found that it takes only six months for their CPV technology to start producing more energy than it took to create the CPV structure in the first place .
But as good as CPV appears to be , the Greenwire article points out that CPV suffers from the same problem that all solar does right now – it needs government support in order to survive long enough to become cost - competitive with other supplies like natural gas and coal ( although it ’s on track to reach parity with other solar technologies in the next year or two ) .
CPV sounds like a great technology to me because it appears to be far more environmentally friendly than solar thermal is .
But in the energy sector , as with commercial commodity products , the best technology does n’t always win in the end .
Instead , marketing , financing , and political influence are greater indicators of success than low water consumption , a small carbon footprint , and a smaller physical footprint .

Wind turbines may affect weather
If you ’ve ever laid down on the ground during a windstorm , you probably noticed that wind at ground level is much slower than wind at head height or a couple of hundred feet in the air .
This is the main reason that wind turbines are raised up on massive towers – the wind blows stronger and more consistently high above the ground , making the turbine more efficient as a result .
Similarly , wind does n’t blow through the forest itself as fast as it blows does through open clearings .
And faster or slower wind speeds has an effect on the weather downwind .
But what happens when you cover large swaths of land with extra - tall steel trees with spinning branches ( aka wind turbines ) ?
The Bright Green Blog at the Christian Science Monitor has a article devoted to answering this very question .
According to the article , wind farms on the scale of North American storm systems has an appreciable affect , in this case defined as “ larger than typical weather - forecast uncertainties , ” with the effects felt not just in North America but also across the North Atlantic and on into Europe .
Of course , the size of a storm system is very often tens of miles in diameter and can be hundreds of miles across , but if you covered the Midwest with turbines , well , that ’s certainly going to be large enough to qualify .
What does this mean ?
Well , the scientists interviewed for the article said that the impacts on wind speed , cloudiness , and temperature , but that the impacts were small compared to the benefits of removing carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) from the atmosphere .
Beyond that , though , the scientists were n’t comfortable speculating .

Geoengineering does n’t help acidification
According to a new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letter and reported by Standford University News , some forms of geoengineering may cool the planet but do nothing to reverse the effects of ocean acidification .
In the immortal words of Obviousman : No Duh !
Ocean acidification is a result of the burning of fossil fuels .
In essence , the CO 2 is emitted in to the air and then absorbed by the ocean , resulting in the creation of carbonic acid and a corresponding reduction in ocean pH .
Geoengineering schemes like covering up the sun with a sunshield in space or emitting large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere or seeding more clouds with a fleet of automated seawater spraying ships all work on the same basic principle – reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth ’s surface .
However , none of them pull the extra CO 2 out of the atmosphere that would be required to stop additional ocean acidification .
Perhaps I ’m being a little too harsh on the study authors .
They did run the geoengineering method through climate models in order to better understand how ocean acidification will be affected , and that ’s valuable information to have .
But the overall conclusion – changing solar insolation via geoengineering does nothing to stop ocean acidification – well , duh .

New study on the PETM raises questions , but no answers
55 million years ago , the Palaeocene - Eocene Thermal Maximum ( PETM ) produced between five and nine degrees Celsius of warming globally , and that warming lasted for tens of thousands of years .
A new study published in Nature Geoscience investigated the PETM using a single climate model and claims to have found that CO 2 alone was insufficient to have caused the PETM .
However , once you read the actual paper , it ’s not quite that clear - cut .
First off , the PETM happened during a geological era when the Pacific was much larger than it is today and the Atlantic was much smaller and the Earth was much warmer before the PETM than today .
And the authors of the study acknowledge all these points :
Undoubtedly , the climatic boundary conditions before the PETM were different from today ’s – including different continental configuration , absence of continental ice and a different base climate , which limits the PETM ’s suitability as the perfect future analogue . ” ( emphasis mine )
Second , the study investigates a single climate model , rather than the many different climate models that are available .
Even so , though , the study does raise a couple of important questions that really should be answered .
The first question is whether , as the authors claim , this study represents “ a fundamental gap in our understanding ” of climate that “ needs to be filled to confidently predict future climate change . ”
It certainly suggests that we do n’t understand enough , but is the problem our understanding of the PETM , our understanding of recent climate change , or both ?
At this point , there ’s not enough information to know the answer to that question .
After all , some scientists have suggested that climate models are insufficient to predict the long - term changes to the Earth ’s climate resulting from anthropogenic CO 2 , and that over the next thousand years , CO 2 will actually drive far more heating than it does over the next century .
The second question is whether this study supports the contention that climate models are underestimating the effects of anthropogenic climate disruption .
The authors found that their climate model only accounted for approximately 3.5 degrees of the five to nine degrees of warming that actually occurred during the PETM .
If this is accurate , then this study could mean that the models to date have underestimated the effect of CO 2 emissions by 43 % to 157 % , and that climate disruption during the next century or two could be much , much worse than it is already expected to be .
Which question you focus on probably depends more on whether you ’re a climate disruption “ skeptic ” or denier , or whether you ’re a proponent of anthropogenic climate disruption .

New climate idea might break US - China emissions stalemate
The U.S. wo n’t cut emissions until China and India are on - board , but China and India wo n’t cut emissions unless the U.S. and Europe cut even more .
This Catch - 22 of blame justifying a refusal to act has dominated post - Kyoto Protocol climate politics for years now , and recent news suggests that it ’s not going to get better any time soon .
Into this stalemate steps some of the same Princeton researchers who developed the climate wedge visualization aid with a possible new approach that is agnostic to the source of the CO 2 .
The idea is to force the top billion or so people who are the highest CO 2 emitters to cut their emissions , no matter where those emitters are located on the globe .
The U.S. would still have a huge number of people who needed to cut their emissions ( people like me , for example ) somehow , but so would a large number of Chinese , most of the EU , Russia , and even a few countries in Africa and the Middle East .
But this scheme would automatically exempt , at least to start with , the poorest countries and even permit them to increase their emissions .
This scheme would also rope in developing nations as they started to reach the per-capita emissions cap , so a country like India that is presently mostly under the cap would find itself having to start paying automatically as their economy improves over the next several decades .
It ’s an interesting idea , and given that it might enable real action on climate disruption and CO 2 emissions , it ’s certainly worth considering .
I look forward to hearing more about it in the coming months , especially if it starts to get traction among climate policy wonks .

An Afghan law which legalised rape has been sent back to parliament with a clause letting husbands starve their wives if they refuse to have sex .
President Hamid Karzai ordered a review of the legislation after The Independent revealed that it negated the need for consent within marriage .
President Barack Obama described it as " abhorrent " , Gordon Brown said Britain would " not tolerate " it , and other Nato countries threatened to withdraw their troops unless the legislation was drastically re-written .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The amendments were passed to the cabinet this week and signed by Mr Karzai on Wednesday , Human Rights Watch said last night .
The women 's rights activist Wazhma Frough , who was involved in the review , said that conservative religious leaders had pressured the Justice Ministry to keep many of the most controversial clauses .
" There have been a few little changes , but they are not enough , " she said .
" For example , if the wife does n't accept her husband 's sexual requirements then he can deny her food . "
According to civil society groups , the law , which regulates the personal affairs of Afghanistan 's minority Shia community , still includes clauses which allow rapists to marry their victims as a way of absolving their crime and it tacitly approves child marriage .
The law sparked riots in Kabul .
Hundreds of Shia women took to the streets in protest .
They were attacked by mobs of angry men who launched counter demonstrations outside the capital 's largest Shia madrassa .
It is due to be ratified by parliament , which first passed the legislation in March with hardly any debate .
" Violence against women is already endemic , " said Razia Jan , who is building a women 's community centre in Afghanistan 's Shia heartland , Bamiyan .
" Men pay thousands of dollars for young girls and they are treated like slaves .
Women here are already so vulnerable . "
Critics claim that Mr Karzai signed the law to appease Shia leaders , ahead of the presidential polls on 20 August .

The hallmark of a person By Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski
In an era when when ' spirituality '  as opposed to religion  is on the rise , how can one tell what 's authentic and not ?
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
The Talmud gives the characteristics of the disciples of Abraham : a benevolent eye , a humble spirit and a meek soul .
The traits of disciples of Balaam , who is discussed in this week 's Torah reading , are : an evil eye , an arrogant spirit and a greedy soul .
The Talmud then says , '' How are the disciples of Abraham different than the disciples of Balaam ? ''
( Ethics of the Fathers 5:22 ) .
Why does the Talmud focus on '' the disciples ' ' of Abraham and Balaam ?
Why not cite the differences between Abraham and Balaam themselves ?
The answer is that anyone looking at Abraham and Balaam might not be able to distinguish between the two .
After all , did not Balaam subjugate himself totally to G-d ?
'' If Balak will give me his houseful of silver and gold , I cannot transgress the word of G - d '' ( Numbers 22:18 ) .
'' Balaam spoke up and said , ' Whatever G -d puts in my mouth , that I must take heed to speak '' ( ibid. 23:12 ) .
'' I cannot transgress the word of G - d to do good or bad on my own .
Whatever G -d speaks , that I will speak '' ( ibid. 24:13 ) .
Are these not the words of a tzaddik , a truly saintly person ?
Anyone hearing Balaam might conclude that he is a very G - d - fearing person .
Appearances can be deceptive .
There were people who were Torah scholars and who were even fulfilled their religious duties , yet all their disciples deviated from Torah and mitzvos .
On the other hand , if one looks at the disciples of the Baal Shem Tov , who founded the Chassidic movement , or the great ethicist Rabbi Yisroel of Salant , one can understand the greatness of their masters .
If you wish to know the true mettle of a person , look at his disciples .
The true nature of a person is revealed in those whom he taught .
Their character , their behavior and their belief reflect that of the teacher .
Of course , the finest parents have had an errant child , and the finest teachers have had an errant student .
However , if one looks at the body of students , one can get a fair idea of what the teacher was like .
This is an important concept in moral and ethical education .
The character of the mathematician does not necessarily impact the subject he teaches .
It is different when the subject is human behavior .
In the secular world , one may find books on guidelines in life written by people whose ethical and moral principles may leave much to be desired .
In the Torah world this is untenable .
The sixth chapter of Ethics of the Fathers begins with '' Blessed is He Who chose them ( the sages ) and their teaching . ''
Them is a prerequisite for teaching .
Only those whose character is such that they deserve to be chosen are acceptable as teachers .
Before accepting anyone as authoritative on how one should live , check into how he has lived his life .

Take - Two has announced that BioShock 2 has been delayed until fiscal 2010 .
The game , which was originally scheduled for an early November release , is being delayed to “ provide additional development time for the title . ”
Take - Two has clarified it previous statement and said at it ’s press conference that BioShock 2 is now planned for release in the “ first half ” of 2010 .
Perhaps the late addition of yet another developer to the heavily anticipated BioShock 2 should have acted as an early indicator of the delay .
Take - Two ’s Chairman Strauss Zelnick publicly apologized about the setback in a press release : “ We recognize that our revised outlook for the balance of fiscal year 2009 , due to both internal and external factors , is a disappointment .
That said , we concluded that moving the release of BioShock 2 into fiscal year 2010 was the right decision for the product . ”
Take - Two ’s investors are likely to respond to this news unpositively , considering the company ’s has practically no presences this holiday season .
With most Take - Two ’s biggest anticipated titles such as Mafia II , Max Payne 3 and now BioShock 2 , all appearing in fiscal 2010 , the company will have little to rely on to bolster its current year results .
Zelnick reiterated that “ we remain confident in the long term potential for Take - Two ’s business , and our ability to capitalize on that potential through our exceptional creative talent and solid balance sheet . ”

There is no rational reason to expect property to always be a good investment and , as with shares , what matters most is the starting point .
The reason shares have been a disappointment over the past decade is that they started out very expensive .
It has taken 10 years for a combination of earnings growth and price falls to make them now rather cheap .
I expect a similar process to unfold with residential property , especially as the end of the buy - to - let game sees a steady drip - feed of unwanted property investments into the market .
I will continue to take talk of turning tides and missed boats with a large pinch of salt .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
House Democrats unveiled their revised version of health care reform Tuesday , offering a proposal that includes a government - funded health insurance option , requires both individuals and employers to participate , and taxes the wealthy to help cover costs .
President Obama has urged Congress to work quickly on creating a health care reform bill .
Democratic
House leaders said the measure , titled " America 's Affordable Health Choices Act , " met the requirements set by President Obama for health care reform by lowering costs to consumers and businesses , letting people keep their current plan if desired , and preventing denial of coverage due to pre-existing medical conditions .
" The House proposal will begin the process of fixing what 's broken about our health care system , reducing costs for all , building on what works , and covering an estimated 97 percent of all Americans , " Obama said in a written statement .
" And by emphasizing prevention and wellness , it will also help improve the quality of health care for every American . "
Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , said the bill is intended to repair a " dysfunctional " health care system that is draining the U.S. economy while leaving 46 million Americans without health insurance .
" We are going to accomplish what many people felt would n't happen in our lifetime , " he said .
But House Republicans slammed the Democrats ' bill and pledged to try to amend it as three House committees begin considering the legislation later this week .
Rep. Roy Blunt , R - Missouri , said the bill " without any question will kill jobs , will limit access to health care , will raise taxes and will lead to a government takeover of health care . "
Blunt said he will offer an amendment requiring all elected federal officials , including Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , to enroll in the new public insurance option .
Republicans and some fiscally conservative Democrats also question the cost of health care reform .
An earlier draft of the House Democrats ' bill carried a price tag of $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
The Congressional Budget Office said the revised house bill also would cost $ 1 trillion .
However , a senior Democratic House committee staffer said the CBO analysis only covered costs without factoring in cost - saving measures worth $ 500 billion over 10 years or the revenue from tax surcharges on wealthy Americans , estimated to raise more than $ 500 billion over a decade .
According to the CBO , the bill would cover 97 percent of Americans by 2015 .
The bill includes tax surcharges on Americans in the top 1.2 percent of income .
It proposes a 5.4 percent surtax on couples earning more than $ 1 million , a 1.5 percent surtax on couples with income between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million , and a 1 percent surtax on joint incomes over $ 350,000 or individual income over $ 280,000 .
Anticipating Republican complaints that the tax surcharges would harm small business owners who report their income as personal , Democratic sponsors said the measure would affect less than 5 percent of all small business owners .
Specific provisions of the bill include :
-- A Health Insurance Exchange providing individuals and small business with choices for coverage , including a government - funded public option .
--
No more coverage exclusion for pre-existing conditions .
-- Affordability credits for low - and moderate - income individuals and families , available to those with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level , or $ 43,000 for individuals and $ 88,000 for a family of four .
-- Limits on annual out - of - pocket spending .
-- Expanded Medicaid coverage to individuals and families with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level .
-- Required participation by individuals , with a penalty of 2.5 percent of adjusted gross income for non-compliance .
-- Requirement that businesses with payrolls exceeding $ 250,000 provide their employees with health coverage or contribute up to 8 percent of their payroll on their behalf .
-- A series of measures intended to reduce costs of Medicaid , Medicare and other existing systems .
A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups opposed some of the bill 's proposals , calling for market forces and employer autonomy instead of mandated participation by businesses .
" Exempting some micro- businesses will not prevent this provision from killing many jobs , " the statement said .
The House bill now goes to three committees for debate and revision before consideration by the full chamber .
The Senate also is considering health reform measures that contain some of the House bill provisions .
Obama has said he wants both chambers to pass their respective proposals before Congress goes on its August recess as part of a timetable to get a final bill to his desk by the end of the year .
House Republican Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia argued that the current economic conditions mean Congress should take its time on a major overhaul of the health care system .
" There 's no need for us to be rushing into passing legislation before the end of this month at the potential cost of , really , millions of jobs , " Cantor said Tuesday .
A CNN - Opinion Research Corp. survey released July 1 found that a slim majority -- 51 percent -- support Obama 's health care plans , but most worry that their costs would go up , and only one in five think their families would be better off .

A major political struggle surrounds current efforts to enact legislation addressing the harmful effects of climate change .
Opponents of legislation limiting carbon dioxide emissions express doubt about the scientific evidence for global warming .
Since the issuance of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Science Report in 2007 ( the Physical Science Report , hereafter referred to as the “ IPCC - 2007 Science Report ” ) , many legislators have concluded correctly that the relevant science is settled .
A vocal minority , however , continues to insist otherwise .
Lawmakers opposed to legislation needed to slow global climate change have hailed the recently published United States Senate Minority Report on Global Warming as proof of division within the scientific community .
In that report , almost 700 individuals with implied scientific credentials are offered as evidence that measures to address climate change are premature , and that further research on the cause of global warming is needed .
The Center for Inquiry ’s Office of Public Policy has examined the Senate Minority Report carefully .
Our office deemed it well worthwhile to assess its claims .
Clearly , if the report is scientifically credible and its case is strong , this would have significant implications for efforts to control the emissions the IPCC - 2007 Science Report identifies as the “ highly likely ” cause of global warming .
We dubbed our effort to assess the Senate Minority Report “ The Credibility Project . ”
Highlights in contemporary climate science
The existing scientific evidence on the cause and extent of climate change casts serious doubt on the Senate minority position on global warming .
The term “ global warming ” as used by the scientific community refers to the alarmingly rapid warming that has occurred over the past three decades .
This warming has been established beyond all doubt by observations carefully analyzed by a large and competent climate science community .
Climate scientists have already investigated a number of possible causes for global warming .
Their exacting investigations have identified anthropogenic greenhouse gases , led by carbon dioxide , as the only plausible major contributor to global warming .
Although the evidence for this conclusion is too detailed and voluminous to present here , it is outlined in both the IPCC - 2007 Science Report and in a succinct but well - documented reference by one of the authors of this post ( see the two articles and two subsequent responses by S. Jordan in the four issues of Skeptical Inquirer , Vol. 31 , Nos. 3 - 6 , 2007 ) .
Deniers of global warming often cite the occurrence of a temporary cool period since 2005 ( cool only in relation to the extremely hot years before ) as reason to doubt the science of global warming .
Far from defying scientists ’ expectations , this cool period was predicted by the best climate models before it occurred .
This shows that climate models have passed a critical test of physical theories — namely , that they have demonstrable predictive power .
Worryingly , these same models predict that another very sharp temperature rise will occur in a few more years .
Claims that the sun is responsible for global warming have all failed observational tests to date .
Proposed solar interplanetary magnetic fields and variations in solar ultraviolet radiation , both solar - cycle dependent , fail for many reasons .
When one includes the effects of volcanic aerosols and even allows for possible phase shifts in the Earth ’s response , there is no correlation between global warming and the solar cycle .
Careful observations of the solar irradiance at the outer reaches of Earth ’s atmosphere rule out changes in this parameter that might account for global warming .
To date , no observationally grounded argument has demonstrated that some “ driver ” other than anthropogenic greenhouse gases is a major contributor to global warming .
In contrast , the harmful effect of anthropogenic greenhouse gas is confirmed by an enormous database and by all major climate models worldwide .
Finally , since the publication of the IPCC - 2007 Science Report , many scientists have argued that the Earth ’s climate could change even more rapidly than previously expected .
NASA scientist R. Bindschadler , a recognized authority on the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic icecaps , has analyzed observational data obtained over the last decade .
His analysis shows that the rate of melting may be much larger than the earlier value reported in the IPCC - 2007 Science Report .
Should this faster melting rate persist , the average sea - level rise over the 21st century would be on the order of one meter , not one foot as predicted in the IPCC Science Report .
While it is too early to conclude that this high melting rate will persist , this danger cannot be ignored .
If the higher melting rate should continue , the subsequent sea - level rise would constitute a major global environmental disaster , with ominous social and political consequences .
For the reasons stated above , many scientists are skeptical when politicians claim that a large body of scientists doubts that human activity causes global warming .
That claim runs contrary to the evidence , and the work of a large climate - science community .
Results of the Credibility Project
The Senate Minority Report lists 687 individuals with purported climate science credentials as skeptics of the scientific consensus on global warming .
We assessed the credibility of the Senate Minority Report primarily by determining what fraction of these individuals could reasonably be considered to be active climate scientists , or scientists working in related fields .
The best measure for this , almost universally agreed to in the scientific community , is to determine if these individuals publish articles on subjects somewhat related to climate science in refereed journals .
Additional criteria were invoked , including attempts to determine the professional fields of the individuals on the list , as well as education degrees received .
The data set we relied upon is accessible on the Credibility Project ’s provisional website .
Such a process is liable to small errors of interpretation .
Nevertheless , after double - checking our assessment and following this procedure using the best available data , several striking results emerged .
The results of our assessment are summarized as follows :
Based on publications in the refereed literature , only approximately 10 % of the 687 individuals could be indentified definitively as climate scientists .
Only approximately 15 % could be identified as publishing in fields related to climate science .
Examples include solar physicists studying solar irradiance variation .
Examples include solar physicists studying solar irradiance variation .
For approximately 80 % of these individuals , no evidence could be found that they had published research remotely related to climate science .
Examples include purported meteorologists — the largest professional field found — who have no refereed scientific publications and whose job is merely to report the weather forecast .
Examples include purported meteorologists — the largest professional field found — who have no refereed scientific publications and whose job is merely to report the weather forecast .
Almost 4 % have made statements suggesting they largely accept the scientific community ’s consensus view that global warming is occurring and that greenhouse gases appear to be a significant cause .
( This is a tentative approximation , because these same individuals may have made other statements elsewhere .
This nonetheless raises the question whether they should have been included on the Senate Minority Report ’s list in the first place . )
In light of these results , it is difficult to think this is a list composed primarily of publishing climate scientists .
These results cast serious doubt on the Senate Minority Report ’s credibility .
Conclusions
We conclude with some general thoughts .
The first concerns the nature of science .
The second concerns the question of numbers ( of scientists ) and how they are counted .
Unfortunately , many Americans fail to understand that science does not give us absolutely certain answers to questions about nature .
Instead it gives us probabilities .
This does not mean , however , that policymakers should feel free to ignore scientific findings .
In many cases these probabilities approach certainty .
Thus , when scientists say it is “ highly likely ” that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of the recent global warming , they are asserting that the observational evidence and scientific theory together make a highly compelling case for this conclusion , such that it can not be dismissed .
Although it is always possible that some as - yet - undiscovered mechanism might also play a role , no one has shown convincing evidence for one .
As such , unproven claims that other mechanisms explain global warming should be viewed skeptically .
When we consider the amount of research that has been accomplished since the seriousness of climate change became apparent two decades ago , the case for the scientific community ’s consensus view on global warming becomes even stronger .
This leads us to the question of counting numbers of scientists .
One sometimes hears that only about 100 “ technocrats ” are responsible for the conclusions of the IPCC - 2007 Science Report .
That statement is patently false .
If one reads that report , the number is closer to 2,000 scientists who published on climate science in the refereed literature .
Their work was summarized by approximately 100 “ technocrats , ” with the approval of the relevant science study leaders .
Thus , in comparing the IPCC - 2007 Science Report and the Senate Minority Report , the proper comparison is between the approximately 137 scientists in the Senate Minority Report who might have published in the referred literature on topics directly related to climate science ( i.e. , 20 % of 687 ) and the approximately 2,000 scientists whose work is summarized in the IPCC - 2007 Science Report .
This contrasts dramatically with the ratio of 687 implied climate scientists against approximately 100 “ technocrats . ”
The conclusions we draw from our examination of the Senate Minority Report are preliminary .
We have lacked the resources under current time constraints to check every detail in the report , or to contact all of the people who appear on its list .
We intend to continue gathering data and will update our analysis accordingly .
Nevertheless , based on the procedure described above , we have double - checked our results and are prepared to offer the following three conclusions :
We think it is highly unlikely that a growing fraction of top climate scientists are becoming increasingly skeptical of human causation of global warming .
We think that the title “ Senate Minority Report ” is technically appropriate , but understated .
That report ’s list does contain the names of some outstanding scientists , including at least one distinguished meteorologist .
However , when weighted against the much larger number of equally outstanding climate scientists , there is no doubt where the great majority of experts in this field stand .
Absent hard evidence that another likely candidate drives global warming , it is highly unlikely that man-made greenhouse gases do not play a significant and probably a major role in causing global warming .
The authors of this Credibility Project assessment are not qualified to assess the engineering and economic questions associated with proposed legislation addressing climate change .
However , we are disturbed by any document that may misrepresent the state of the global scientific effort to address this problem .

Enlarge By Robert Deberry , The Mat - Su Valley Frontiersman Sarah Palin announces Friday that she is stepping down from her position as Alaska governor .
A new poll finds the move did not diminish her support among Republicans .
WASHINGTON  Sarah Palin 's bombshell that she is resigning as Alaska governor actually has boosted her a bit among Republicans , a nationwide USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds , though it also has dented her standing among Democrats and independents .
Two - thirds of Republicans want Palin , the party 's vice presidential nominee in 2008 , to be " a major national political figure " in the future .
Three - fourths of Democrats hope she wo n't be .
TOP REPUBLICANS : Puzzled by Palin 's abrupt resignation PALIN ON TV : ' All options are on the table '
PALIN : Gov. hints at national ambitions , political future Independents by 55 % - 34 % would prefer she leave the national stage .
The findings underscore how polarized opinions of Palin were even before Friday 's surprise announcement .
Seven in 10 polled say their views were n't affected by her decision .
Among those whose opinions shifted , Democrats by a 4 - 1 ratio and independents by 2 - to - 1 view her less favorably .
Republicans are somewhat inclined to see her more favorably .
" For independents and Democrats , she 's already not their candidate , and with Republicans her support is not based on her record as governor of Alaska , " says GOP consultant Alex Castellanos .
The poll Monday of 1,000 adults — including 321 Democrats , 323 independents and 316 Republicans — has a margin of error of +/–3 percentage points for the full sample and 6 points for the partisan subsamples .
Palin 's complaints about unfair treatment by the news media resonate with many respondents .
Three - fourths of Republicans , more than half of independents and a third of Democrats say coverage of Palin has been unfairly negative .
When it comes to a potential presidential run , the USA TODAY Poll displays Palin 's strength in the Republican base and weakness among swing voters , who traditionally decide national elections .
Republicans by 71 % - 27 % say they'd be likely to vote for her if she ran for president in 2012 , while independents by 51 % - 44 % would not .
" Do n't know what the future holds , " Palin said Tuesday on ABC .
" I 'm not gonna shut any door .
That — who knows what doors open ? "

Colombian troops are pressing their offensive against the rebels Sweden has asked Venezuela to explain how Swedish - made weapons ended up in the hands of Colombia 's Farc rebels .
Swedish officials said the anti-tank rocket launchers had been sold to Venezuela in the 1980s .
Colombian troops recovered the weapons in a raid on a Farc camp .
Colombia has long claimed that Venezuela has backed the left - wing rebels .
The Caracas government denies this , and dismissed the latest reports as an attempt to harm Venezuela .
Jens Eriksson , a senior official at the Swedish Trade Ministry , said his government was working with Colombia " to find out how this happened " .
" We have asked the officials of the government of Venezuela to give us information on how they believe this material was found in Colombia , " he said .
Jan -Erik Lovgren , of the Swedish Inspectorate for Strategic Products , told Radio Sweden that the weapons had been sold to Venezuela in the 1980s .
He said the incident was a clear violation of end - user licenses and could affect future decisions on whether to allow weapons sales to Venezuela .
Mr Lovgren said that no Swedish company had ever been granted a permit to sell weapons to Colombia .
' Media show '
On Monday , Colombian Vice - President Francisco Santos said the anti-tank rocket launchers seized from the Farc had been purchased by Venezuela in Europe .
" In several operations in which we have recovered weapons we have found powerful ammunition ( and ) powerful equipment , including anti-tank weapons which a European country sold to Venezuela and which turned up in the hands of the Farc , " he told Colombia 's Caracol radio .
Venezuela 's Nicolas Maduro said Colombia wanted to justify US bases
In response , Venezuelan Interior Minister Tareck El Aissami said the allegations were a " media show " .
" It 's part of a campaign against our people , our government and our institutions , " he added .
Venezuela 's Foreign Minister , Nicolas Maduro , said it was a campaign " to justify the presence of US bases " in Colombia .
Correspondents say he was referring to reports that Washington and Bogota are close to an agreement that would increase US military operations in Colombia .
Colombia has fallen out with its neighbours in the past over suspected links to the Farc movement .
Colombia and Ecuador broke off diplomatic ties last year after Colombian troops raided a Farc base just over the Ecuadorean border .

Japan has executed three death row inmates convicted of murder - the country 's first hangings in six months .
One killed two women ; another used the internet to find victims considering suicide ; the third was from China and killed three Chinese people .
Before this , the last executions were carried out in January .
The latest convicts to be executed were Japanese nationals Hiroshi Maeue , 40 , and Yukio Yamaji , 25 , and 41 - year - old Chinese national Chen Detong .
Maeue , executed in Osaka , killed three people in 2005 after he met them through an internet website for people planning to commit suicide .
Yamaji , also executed in Osaka , raped and then stabbed to death two sisters in 2005 .
Chen was executed in Tokyo for killing three of his compatriots and injuring three more in Kawasaki , southwest of Tokyo , in 1999 .
The death penalty receives widespread support in Japan , but the executions are regularly criticised by the European Union and anti-death penalty campaign groups .
Correction 6 August 2009 : An earlier version of this story incorrectly implied that the convicted men's trials were held under a new " lay jury " system that combined citizens and professionals to decide on serious criminal cases .
In fact the sentences were passed before the new system had been implemented .
RELIGIOUS GROUNDS : Victims may be able to request their cases investigated by Muslim police
Police in London already give victims the right to ask for a Sikh officer to be involved in an investigation but the scheme could be introduced for other religions elsewhere .
Chief Supt Joanna Young , from the Met ’s Criminal Justice Policy Unit , said : “ If it ’s a success , I would encourage the other ( police ) associations to do likewise . ”
The project is intended to help investigate “ honour ” killings and forced marriages but Metropolitan Police Federation chairman Peter Smyth said : “ We ’re stretched thin enough already .
Are Sikh officers going to have their rotas changed so there ’s always one on duty ?
“ It ’s political correctness gone mad .
We talking about the creation of a separate force within a force . ”
But Palbinder Singh , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Sikh Association , said : “ I do n’t believe a white officer is ever going to be fully conversant with a Sikh . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Michigan became the first state in 25 years to suffer an unemployment rate exceeding 15 % , according to a report released Friday by the Labor Department .
The state 's unemployment rate rose to 15.2 % in June .
It was the highest of any state since March 1984 , when West Virginia 's unemployment rate exceeded 15 % .
Michigan , which has been battered by the collapse of the auto industry and the housing crisis , has had the highest unemployment rate in the nation for 12 months in a row .
Rhode Island had the second highest unemployment rate at 12.4 % , followed by Oregon at 12.2 % .
A total of 15 states and the District of Columbia had unemployment rates of at least 10 % .
Friday 's report from the U.S. Labor Department also showed that six states recorded record - high unemployment rates in June .
Over the month , jobless rates increased in 38 states and the District of Columbia .
Michigan 's 1.1 percentage point increase from May to June was the highest in the nation , followed by Wyoming 's 0.9 point increase .
On an annual basis , jobless rates where higher in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .
Michigan also recorded the highest yearly increase at 7.1 percentage points .
Oregon came in second with a year - over - year increase of 6.3 percentage points in its unemployment rate .
The national unemployment rate rose for the ninth straight month in June , climbing to 9.5 % from 9.4 % , and hitting another 26 - year high .
Nearly 3.4 million jobs have been lost during the first half of 2009 , more than the 3.1 million lost in all of 2008 .
Unemployment rates decreased in five states , and seven states had no rate change .
North Dakota 's 4.2 % jobless rate was the lowest in the nation , followed by Nebraska at 5 % .
The Midwest and West both had jobless rates of 10.2 % .
The jobless rate in the Northeast rose to 8.6 % from 8.3 % but was the lowest of any U.S. region .
In the South , unemployment rose to 9.2 % .
Non -farm payroll employment fell in 39 states and the District of Columbia in June .
California had the largest month - over - month decrease in jobs .
Payrolls increased in 10 states and were unchanged in one state .
The largest over - the - month increase occurred in North Carolina .
San Francisco - " Terms of Service " policies on websites define how Internet businesses interact with you and use your personal information .
But most web users do n't read these policies -- or understand that the terms are constantly changing .
To track these ever - evolving documents , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) is launching " TOSBack " : a " terms of service " tracker for Facebook , Google , eBay , and other major websites .
" Terms of service form the foundation of your relationship with social networking sites , online businesses , and other Internet communities , but most people become aware of these terms only when there 's a problem , " said EFF Activism and Technology Manager Tim Jones .
" We created TOSBack to help consumers monitor terms of service for the websites they use everyday , and show how the terms change over time . "
At www.TOSBack.org, you can see a real - time feed of changes and updates to more than three dozen polices from the Internet 's most popular online services .
Clicking on an update brings you to a side - by - side before - and - after comparison , highlighting what has been removed from the policy and what has been added .
The issue of terms - of - service changes -- and how and why they are made -- was highlighted earlier this year when Facebook modified its terms of use .
Facebook users worried that the change gave the company the right to use members ' content indefinitely .
After a user revolt , Facebook announced that it would restore the former terms while it worked through the concerns users had raised .
" Some changes to terms of service are good for consumers , and some are bad , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Fred von Lohmann .
" But Internet users are increasingly trusting websites with everything from their photos to their ' friends lists ' to their calendar -- and sometimes even their medical information .
TOSBack will help consumers flag changes in the websites they use every day and trust with their personal information . "

Berlin says games like paintball encourage violence
The German government says it plans to ban combat games such as paintball , in response to a recent school shooting .
The new measures being proposed to parliament also include tighter gun control rules and give officials the right to conduct checks on gun owners .
Anyone defying the proposed new rule could face a 5,000 - euro ( £ 4,474 ) fine .
Sixteen people , including the gunman , were killed in the school shooting in March .
Relatives of the victims say the new measures do not go far enough .
' Biometric controls '
Under the proposed rules , the authorities would be given more right to ensure weapons are safely locked up .
The massacre at Albertville School shocked Germany
It is also thought that " biometric controls " for gun storage might be introduced , the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Berlin reports .
That would mean that anyone owning and storing guns at home would need to use their own fingerprint to open the safe or cupboard , our correspondent says .
Berlin also plans to ban games like paintball and laser - tag that simulate killing on the grounds that they trivialise and encourage violence .
But relatives of those killed in the March attack in the town of Winnenden , near Stuttgart , are calling for an outright ban on pistols and high - calibre weapons .
" There can not be a second Winnenden , " Hardy Schober , whose daughter was killed in the attack , told a news conference in Berlin .
<< BOTH SYSTEMS >>
The databases are operating normally .
I am one of those conservatives who has been inclined to cut President Barack Obama some slack on foreign policy and national security issues .
I believe that he inherited a " worst possible " international situation with the United States universally hated , two wars being lost and a third one waiting in the wings , an " ally " in Israel with an elected government that was both racist and heedless of the national interest of its great benefactor , and anti-American populism on the march everywhere in Latin America .
To be sure , Obama has moved quickly to change the " tone " of the conversation , restoring civility with many of America ’s neighbors and friends .
He has demonstrated that he is serious about a Palestinian state and has established the principle that it is better to negotiate with adversaries than to start preventive wars .
All of that granted however , President Obama has failed to carry out the change that he promised when he was running for office .
If one assumes that he won the presidency due to the votes of people who wanted an end to wars in the Middle East and Central Asia and who wanted a rollback of legislation that has enabled the government to spy on its own citizens and lock them up without appeal , then he has been a complete disappointment .
Every feature of the Bush Administration security and surveillance state remains in place , including secret prisons , military tribunals , arbitrary arrest , and monitoring of citizens .
Iraq continues to simmer with no end in sight and AfPak , as the other expanding war is now called , is exploding even though a growing body of opinion appreciates that it is a conflict that can not be won .
Under Obama , missile strikes from predator drones have actually increased , killing more insurgents but also many more civilians and shaking an already unstable Pakistan .
And then there is Iran .
In a major foreign policy speech , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said last Wednesday that Iran has only a short time to come to a negotiated agreement with Washington .
She added the United States would not hesitate to use its military against Tehran " to defend itself and its allies " and this week elaborated , explaining that she would support arming allies and creating " defense umbrella " against Iran if it were ever to acquire a nuclear weapon .
Hillary ’s use of the word " defend " is curious .
Does she seriously think that Iran is about to attack or does she really mean that " all options are on the table , " an expression that she used frequently when she was running for president ?
Joe Biden , meanwhile , has advised Israel ’s leadership that if they want to attack Iran it is their right to do so because they are a sovereign state , ignoring the fact that the United States has vital interests at stake and would immediately be sucked into such a conflict .
Secretary of State Clinton is also reviving the coalition of the willing , so it seems .
On Saturday during a visit to India she asserted that the entire world must join together with the United States to do more against terrorism .
Sounds a bit like the Bushies ’ " global war on terror , " does n’t it , an expression that President Obama had consigned to the dust bin ?
Israel , meanwhile , has flatly rejected US objections to a settlement expansion in east Jerusalem and is clearly orchestrating a campaign to make the entire issue of the settlements go away .
Obama and his chief negotiator George Mitchell have been unable to do anything about the delaying tactics that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been successfully employing to avoid taking any action on a Palestinian state .
Since Washington is unable to exert any real pressure on Israel , the situation has returned to the all - too - familiar stalemate in which everyone loses .
President Obama ’s biggest problem is undeniably AfPak because of the escalation underway there driven by the continuing presence of al - Qaeda and Osama bin Laden in the border region .
Whatever Obama might privately believe , he would appear to be guarding his back from Congress and the media , knowing that the survival of bin Laden makes it politically risky to withdraw American soldiers before the terrorist group is actually eliminated .
There are numerous signs that the administration is nervous about what is occurring in AfPak .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said that the situation must turn around within a year , making victory achievable .
One should not take Gates too seriously as he will undoubtedly find generals to say whatever he wants in a year ’s time , but there is concern that the British might soon pull the plug on their own commitment , and as they , the Canadians , and Dutch are the only components actually doing any fighting alongside US troops , the loss would be serious .
Two weeks ago , President Obama let slip that he has a low threshold for success in the escalating war , wanting only to deny the region as a haven for a terrorist group that might be ready , willing , and able to attack the United States .
If that is indeed the objective , then Obama should perhaps cold - bloodedly rethink precisely what he is doing and why .
For starters , he should ask himself if there is any actual evidence that al - Qaeda is now capable of carrying out major attacks internationally .
There are many signs that al - Qaeda in AfPak has very little international reach and that it has become little more than a franchise .
The attack on the hotels in Jakarta last week has been attributed to a terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah ( JI ) that once had links to al - Qaeda , but those ties are now more hypothetical than demonstrated .
Though the once greatly feared JI is still capable of the occasional spectacular suicide attack , it has been largely dismantled by the Indonesian and Malaysian governments and its surviving leadership is on the run .
If al - Qaeda is in reality little more than an ongoing nuisance then a strategy other than the deployment of 65,000 troops at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars might be considered , something that relies on working with the allies in the region using intelligence and police resources .
What is needed is a reexamination of issues that goes back to zero , examining each argument on its merits .
Listening to generals about what to do in a war situation that they have created and find career enhancing is no better than listening to the arguments of CIA officers who have tortured explaining why it was necessary to do so .
If it is up to the Petraeuses and Odiernos of this world , the United States will still be at war thirty years from now and Osama bin Laden ’s grandson will undoubtedly be giving orders from out of a cave somewhere in Pakistan .
The recent retrospectives on Robert McNamara should remind everyone that even the brightest bureaucrat armed with the best information possible will often be wrong and will seamlessly lie if it is politically expedient to do so .
Why should we expect any less when we promote generals based on their ability to say the right things to their political overseers ?
In short , the free lunch is over .
It is time to start criticizing President Obama the way most of us criticized George W. Bush .
There is hardly any difference between the two on foreign and security policy except that the thoughtful and articulate Obama ’s high - minded but empty rhetoric appears to be more reasonable and moderate than the bellicosity of his tongue - tied predecessor .
It probably was a mistake to think that he would behave any differently than George Bush after obtaining office as the difference between liberal interventionism and the conservative variety is really just a matter of approach .
Do not expect the antiwar democrats to surface any time soon .
They have been seduced by the trappings of power .
Do n’t wait around for any marches for peace .
It might well be the task of the libertarian and paleo - right to take the lead once again and revive the discussion about the critical issues relating to war , peace , and national security .

Puno , Peru -- May 27 - 28 , 2009 --
We , indigenous women gathered in the sacred lands of Lake Titicaca , after two days of discussions and deliberation raise our voices in these times when Abya Yala ’s [ 1 ] womb is once more with childbirth pains , to give birth to the new Pachakutik [ 2 ] for a better life on our planet .
We , indigenous women , have had a direct input into the historical process of transformation of our peoples through our proposals and actions in the various struggles taking place and engendered from the indigenous movements .
We are the carriers , conduits of our cultural and genetic make - up ; we gestate and brood life ; together with men , we are the axis of the family unit and society .
We join our wombs to our mother earth ’s womb to give birth to new times in this Latin American continent where in many countries millions of people , impoverished by the neoliberal system , raise their voices to say ENOUGH to oppression , exploitation and the looting of our wealth .
We therefore join in the liberation struggles taking place throughout our continent .
We gather here at this summit , with our hearts , minds , hands and wombs , for the purpose of seeking alternatives to eliminate injustice , discrimination , machismo and violence against women , and to return to our ways of mutual respect and a life of harmony with the planet .
Whereas women are part of nature and the macrocosm , we are called to defend and take care of our mother earth , because from her comes our ancient history and culture , that make us what we are : indigenous peoples under the protection and spiritual guidance of our parents and grandparents who gave life to all the human beings that now inhabit this wonderful planet , even though a few oligarchs and imperialists seek to plague it with death in their quest for their god called greed .
Therefore , before the memory of our martyrs , heroes , leaders , we present to our extended families ( Ayllus ) , communities , peoples and nations of the world the conclusions of our rebellious hearts .
Resolutions and agreements :
Build a continental agenda that reflects the defence of collective rights and the human rights of indigenous women and which follows up the mandates of the First Continental Summit of Indigenous Women .
Abya Yala Indigenous
Women to defend our mother earth ; strengthen our organisations ; promote policy and training proposals ; and create spaces for sharing experiences in various fields : economic , political , social , and cultural amongst others .
Furthermore , this will be the representative and referential body for Abya Yala women before national and international entities .
Form the Continental Coordinator of Indigenous Women to defend our mother earth ; strengthen our organisations ; promote policy and training proposals ; and create spaces for sharing experiences in various fields : economic , political , social , and cultural amongst others .
Furthermore , this will be the representative and referential body forwomen before national and international entities .
We urge on international entities the reform of international instruments , related to indigenous peoples , so as to incorporate the rights of women and submit alternative reports on progress and compliance .
We are in solidarity with and support the struggles of peoples of Amazonian Peru and demand the government of Peru immediately repeal all laws and decrees which violate the territorial rights of indigenous peoples in the Amazon .
At the same time , we demand the government of Peru repeal the state of emergency in the departments where it has been decreed .
We express full solidarity and support for the government of President Evo Morales .
We support the Minga [ 4 ] resistance undertaken by the indigenous peoples of Colombia and condemn acts of genocide and extermination against the indigenous movement in Colombia and other countries .
We strongly reject the persecution of social protest and government repression of demonstrations and actions in defence of land rights and the life of indigenous peoples .
We demand from national governments a real and wholistic agrarian reform that safeguards land to preserve food sovereignty .
We demand that governments create institutions and policies for the care and protection of migrants , taking into account their cultural diversity .
We demand that the state declares our lands and territories inviolable , inalienable and unable to be expropriated , requiring respective titles .
We support the founding of the Climate Justice Court Pachamama [ 5 ] .
so as to demand developed countries and transnationals repair and not damage the biodiversity of the [5 ] .
We reject biofuels because they impoverish the land and place at risk food sovereignty and the life of natural ecosystems .
We demand decriminalisation of the cultivation of the sacred coca leaf .
We demand an end to genocide and ethnocide , which especially affects our indigenous peoples , carried out by the army , paramilitaries and others , which injure , intimidate and violate the rights of people in every country .
We , the women of the First Continental Summit of Indigenous Women , do not want to see more widows , more orphans .
We struggle for peace , for life and for world dignity .
We struggle to end violence committed by : the army , multinationals , trans- nationals and some NGOs ; that engender division in our communities , particularly among women .
This brings about all kinds of violence : physical , psychological , sexual , political , financial , institutional , and symbolic among others .
We struggle for the freedom of men and women who are imprisoned in army and public jails for their fight in defence of Mother Earth and territories , and in defence of the collective rights of indigenous peoples – as it is the case of Leonard Peltier who has been condemned to life in prison in the US .
We demand the immediate withdrawal of the foreign multinational companies in our territories which are exploiting our mother earth and damaging the environment .
We , the women of Abya Yala , demand that the government of Alan Garcia stops granting political asylum to individuals who have violated human rights , as in the case of the ex-ministers of Bolivia ’s Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada .
The First Continental Summit of Indigenous Women has decided that the Second Continental Summit will take place in Bolivia together with the Fifth Continental Summit of Indigenous Peoples and Nations .
To follow up the implementation of the UN declaration of the rights of the indigenous peoples , in various countries , in particular on themes related to indigenous women .
To promote a continental mobilisation in defence of Mother Earth , to be held on October 12 .

Vietnam War genius Robert McNamara dies at 93
Former US Secretary of Defense Robert Strange McNamara , who was significantly more well - known for his work in the Vietnam War as the “ Architect of Vietnam “ , died early Monday morning of yet undisclosed causes .
He was 93 .
McNamara had also been the president of Ford Motor Company , and also of the World Bank on different occasions , aside from being designated as the Secretary of Defense under the presidential terms of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Baines Johnson .
He also served under the positions of directors and consultants for various private and public organizations , and was also the go - to - guy for knowledge regarding nuclear arms .
McNamara was decorated by the multitude of his achievements in government and the academe , but his reputation is substantially marred by an almost exclusive impression of the Vietnam War on his persona .
He was a significant key note figure , having been responsible for a large part of the war where the US failed to subdue an arguably weaker foe , essentially leading to the takeover of key allies in the process .
He had been critical in shaping some of the world ’s nuclear arsenals and technology through the shaping of the United States ’ , during his keep in the Pentagon .
McNamara served as Secretary of Defense longer than anyone else in US history .
Your memories of high school biology class may be a bit hazy nowadays , but there are probably a few things you have n’t forgotten .
Like the fact that you are a composite of your parents — your mother and father each provided you with half your genes , and each parent ’s contribution was equal .
Gregor Mendel , often called the father of modern genetics , came up with this concept in the late 19th century , and it has been the basis for our understanding of genetics ever since .
Obama administration officials said Monday they would not meet self - imposed deadlines for deciding what to do with scores of detainees too dangerous to release from the prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
The delays , involving those who cannot be tried , raise questions about whether the White House can close the prison by January , as President Obama pledged when he took office .
Although officials said the deadline still would be met , a task force studying the issue was expected to deliver its recommendations by Jan. 22 -- exactly one year after Obama issued his executive order to close the prison within a year .
The officials said they had made substantial progress in reviewing the cases of the approximately 240 prisoners at the facility , and had decided that dozens of detainees were eligible for transfer to other countries or were suitable for trial .

But the officials acknowledged that two reports that were supposed to be delivered to the president by Wednesday -- one on how to overhaul the nation ’s detention policy and another on interrogation policy -- would not be ready .
Officials emphasized the complexity of the issues and their desire to find solutions that would be acceptable to Congress but could withstand a court challenge .
“ We want to get this right and not have another multiple years of uncertainty , ” one senior administration official said in a background briefing with reporters at the White House .
The official spoke on condition of anonymity , citing the sensitivity of the deliberations .
Civil liberties groups expressed concern Monday that the White House was planning to preserve the ability to hold some prisoners indefinitely .

“ The Obama administration must not slip into the same legal swamp that engulfed the Bush administration with its failed Guantanamo policies , ” said Anthony D. Romero , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ A promise deferred could soon become a promise broken . ”
Administration officials said they had not retreated from their January deadline to close the facility .
“ To meet the requirement of the executive order -- that is our goal , ” one official said .
But the administration has given a six - month extension to the task force examining detention policy .
The delay means the recommendations for devising a system for the indefinite detention of those considered too dangerous to release but impossible to try may not be delivered until Jan. 22 .
Officials declined to say how many Guantanamo prisoners might fall into the indefinite detention category , but said no decisions on those cases had been reached .

In contrast , a second administration official said that a review team had resolved “ substantially more than 50 cases ” of detainees who could be transferred overseas , as well as a “ significant number ” of others who would face trial in U.S. federal courts or before a revamped system of military commissions .
The White House has granted a two - month extension to a separate task force that Obama created to recommend changes to the nation ’s interrogation policy .
Officials have said that the panel will probably suggest creating teams of expert interrogators -- drawing on personnel from the CIA , FBI and other agencies -- to question senior Al Qaeda members and other high - value suspects .
During the George W. Bush years , Guantanamo became an international symbol for America ’s harsh handling of Muslim prisoners .
But the Obama administration , like its predecessor , has been unable to devise a single set of legal rules for detaining and prosecuting the men held there .

Under military law , the government could hold foreign fighters and suspected terrorists under the rules of war .
But the Obama administration ’s lawyers have been reluctant to follow the lead of Bush by relying on the power of the commander in chief to hold military prisoners indefinitely without charges .
The Supreme Court also may have foreclosed that possibility last year when it ruled that Guantanamo prisoners had a right to challenge their detention in federal courts .
Criminal law sharply limits who can be held and under what circumstances .
For example , prosecutors would be required to release a suspect if they had no witnesses against him and no other evidence of his guilt that would be admissible in court .
But the Guantanamo prisoners include accused terrorists allegedly involved in attacks on Americans , including the bombing of the warship Cole .
In some cases , the only witnesses were either subjected to harsh interrogations or are in prison abroad .
None could testify at a trial .

Users are increasingly storing their data on cloud servers without realizing the implications of losing control and privacy of their personal data .
The current trend belies the logic and natural order of things .
On one side , computers are getting powerful and personal storage devices are getting cheaper .
But still we are turning the custody of our data to profit seeking entities whose market valuation is dependent on “ how much customer data they have in their server ” and “ how much value they can get off from customer ’s data “ .
They call it as a “ Life time value of a Customer ” or ” Lifetime value of your data “ .
Also , if you look at the Internet landscape you can realize that few companies monopolize information .
I am not being paranoid here .
Information monopolies have serious consequences on how we discourse , share ideas and information and how our thought process can be influenced by selective information filtering .

Some Answers to Questions Customers have asked us about Cremation Urns
What size cremation urn do I need ?
There is a rule of thumb used in the memorial industry , that a 200 pound person will be about 200 cubic inches of cremated ashes , meaning you will need an urn which holds 200 cubic inches .
This means that 1 pound of body weight = 1 cubic inch of ashes .
Our principle is to add a bit on top to be on the safe side , saying that you would need for the person weighing 200 pounds an urn with the size of 205 – 210 cubic inches ( the bone density could be a bit more and it would be saver to go a bit larger ) .
How do you transfer the cremation ashes to the urn ?
There are 2 ways to do it , either at home or you let the funeral home transfer the ashes for you .
In case you decide to do it at home here is the easiest way :
First you have a choice of ; when given the ashes from the funeral home they usually are in a plastic bag .
You need to decide if to transfer the ashes with the bag or without the bag .
With the bag you just put them in the urn without opening the bag and closing the lid .
Many urns the bag will not fit and you will need to cut the bag open and pour the ashes slowly into the urn .
Next you need to close the lid , you could use a little bit of caulking to seal the urn , we recommend you using a sealer which is not permanent so you can maybe open the urn again at a later point if you decide to get a piece of cremation jewelry for which you will need to be able to open the urn again .
One of our tips is if you do not feel comfortable to do it yourself at home you can ask a good friend to help you ( usually they feel honored to be asked and gladly give a helping hand ) .
What do you do with ashes after cremation ?
You have a few choices on what to do with the ashes after the cremation .
Last week , we continued trying to figure out why Sarah Palin quit her job .
We could think of a couple reasons !
And today , the New York Times seems to throw its weight behind one of those reasons .
We phrased it as , " She Just Hates Governing . "
Today 's
Times story on the days leading to Sarah Palin 's resignation suggests that " she just hates her life , and Alaska , and is not very good at governing " might more accurate .
So what happened is Sarah continued to be obsessed by every single petty attack against her , real or perceived , by any enemy , from any corner .
When she talks about how she was unable to focus on helping Alaska because the governor 's office was bogged down in frivolous ethics complaints , what she means is that she was personally consumed with everything bad said about her .
Like , here is one of those all - consuming ethics complaints that were hurting Alaska :
By all accounts , Ms. Palin became consumed with the complaints , no matter how small - bore - which many were - or where they came from .
When a local Democratic blogger accused her of becoming a " walking billboard " by wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logo of Arctic Cat , her husband 's team sponsor at the Iron Dog snowmobile race , she issued a news release titled " Governor Comments on Latest Bogus Ethics Complaint . "
" Yes , I wore Arctic Cat snow gear at an outdoor event , because it was cold outside , " her statement read .
A follow - up release was triumphantly titled " Ethics Complaint on Governor 's Apparel Dismissed . "
So , yes , Palin was fixated on attacking local bloggers , on responding to everything Levi Johnston said and did , and on taking on a late - night comedian for making a dumb joke .
The Republican Governors Association tried to send an aide up to help her out , and party bigwigs tried to help her set up a PAC and a legal defense fund , and meanwhile the Alaska legislature just wanted her to govern , and Palin could not really handle all of those things , at once , and so she quit .
But not before she randomly fired someone who annoyed her , again , because that is her style .
Dr. Butler said he resigned his post in June in part because the administration asked one of his highly regarded division heads , the state public health director , Beverly Wooley , to resign .
" I felt that it was not a good time to be downsizing , " said Dr. Butler , who is now working on a swine flu vaccination at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Dr. Butler said the governor 's office apparently deemed Ms. Wooley insufficiently supportive of the parental consent bill backed by Ms. Palin .
Ms. Leighow would only say , inexplicably , that Ms. Wooley had been terminated by the health department , not the governor .
At least we can be confident that , while Sarah Palin has quit politics , she will never quit being a petty , thin - skinned liar , surrounded by sycophantic enablers .
And she will certainly not disappear from the public eye as long as Levi Johnston remains free , and on television !

They have been reviled as the bad hats of Wall Street , nefarious traders who cashed in on the market collapse and , some insist , helped precipitate it .
Now short - sellers , the market skeptics who correctly called last year ’s downturn , are coming under even more unwanted scrutiny , this time from federal regulators .
The Securities and Exchange Commission appears poised to reverse itself and reinstate rules that would make shorting stocks  that is , betting their prices will decline  somewhat more difficult .
Whether the S.E.C. will go far enough to satisfy the many critics of short - sellers is far from certain .
The controversial role of these investors has divided not only the financial industry , but also federal regulators .
As the S.E.C. considers its options , the debate is heating up .
Hedge funds and big pension funds argue that short - selling is vital to modern markets .
Such trading not only enables investors to hedge their risks but also to ferret out weak companies or , as in the case of Enron , outright frauds .
Jon and Wendy Savage are two siblings who have spent their adult years trying to recover from the abuse of their abusive father , Lenny Savage .
Suddenly , a call comes in that his girlfriend has died , he cannot care for himself with his dementia and her family is dumping him on his children .
Despite the fact Jon and Wendy have not spoken to Lenny for twenty years and he is even more loathsome than ever , the Savage siblings feel obliged to take care of him .
Now together , brother and sister must come to terms with the new and painful responsibilities with their father now affecting their lives even as they struggle with their own personal demons Lenny helped create .

Throughout the years the especially sharp - eyed have noticed the presence of cryptic name - and - number notations on burger wrappings and disposable cups used at In - N - Out Burger , a popular chain of hamburger eateries in California , Nevada , Arizona , Texas , Oregon , and Utah .
These tiny notations are placed in out - of - the - way spots ( the undersides of cups and near the seams of the paper pouches burgers are placed in ) .
No overt explanation is given for the presence of the odd phrases or their meaning : they just quietly sit there , awaiting decipherment by those moved to do so .
These mysterious markings are pointers to Biblical passages .
Those easily disturbed by the presence of Bible verses need not fear for their souls , however :
The text of the passages themselves are not spelled out on the cups and wrappings ; only their notations appear there .
In - N - Out Burger was founded by Harry and Esther Snyder in Baldwin Park , California , in 1948 .
Although this chain of west coast hamburger restaurants has since grown to more than 200 outlets , control still rests in the hands of the Snyder family .
According to the company ’s web site : “ In - N - Out remains privately owned and the Snyder family has no plans to take the company public or franchise any units . ”
The Snyders are a religious family , and their continuing to control their own company means they can put what they want on their product packaging .
They ’ve chosen to include pointers to particular Bible verses that we presume hold special meaning for them .
The soda cup bears the notation John 3:16 : “ For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life . ”
The milkshake cup lists Proverbs 3:5 : “ Trust in the Lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . ”
The water cup ( no longer available to customers but we ’re told is still used by employees ) bears John 14:6 : “ Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me . ”
The hamburger and cheeseburger wrappers point to Revelation 3:20 : “ Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me . ”
The wrap used for the “ Double - Double ” ( two burger patties and two slices of cheese ) lists Nahum 1:7 : “ The Lord is good , a strong hold in the day of trouble ; and he knoweth them that trust in him . ”
The French fry holder lists Proverbs 24:16 : “ For though a righteous man falls seven times , he rises again , but the wicked are brought down by calamity . ”
We examined the packaging of other menu offerings from In - N - Out ( coffee cups , milk containers ) but failed to uncover any further pointers to Bible verses .
The ones we ’ve found expound upon a shared theme : belief in the Lord .
As proselytizing goes , this is about as low - key as it gets .
Not even the texts of the verses themselves are printed out ; those looking to absorb the messages ( and who do n’t have this article handy ) have to do so with the assistance of their own Bibles .
Yet even so , the presence of those simple notations has been interpreted by some as indicative of a lurking menace : we ’ve had folks tell us they ’ve heard In - N - Out Burger was “ owned by the religious right ” or “ the Christian Coalition , ” or a “ sect , ” or that bible - study classes were secretly held at each location .
Likewise , the search for a good backstory to enliven whatever appears even slightly mysterious has given birth to a rumor that the presence of the Bible verses is in some way connected to the 1993 death of son Richard Snyder ( 41 ) in a plane crash .
Though even In - N - Out Burger can’t provide a precise date of when the Bible citations were first placed on its packaging , company records indicate they ’ve been there at least since 1987 , which rules out the “ deceased son ” theory .
Immigration authorities had bad news this week for American Apparel , the T - shirt maker based in downtown Los Angeles : About 1,800 of its employees appeared to be illegal immigrants not authorized to work in the United States .
But in contrast to the high - profile raids that marked the enforcement approach of the Bush administration , no federal agents with criminal warrants stormed the company ’s factories and rounded up employees .
Instead , the federal immigration agency sent American Apparel a written notice that it faced civil fines and would have to fire any workers confirmed to be unauthorized .
The treatment of American Apparel , which has more than 5,600 factory employees in Los Angeles alone , is the most prominent demonstration of a new strategy by the Obama administration to curb the employment of illegal immigrants by focusing on employers who hire them  and doing so in a less confrontational manner than in years past .
Unlike the approach of the Bush administration , which brought criminal charges in its final two years against many illegal immigrant workers , the new effort makes broader use of fines and other civil sanctions , federal officials said Thursday .

I am really happy to announce a major update to the Rails OAuth Plugin it has been coming over the last week or two with help from Nobukazu Matake .
The plugin is now a gem .
Just install it with :
sudo gem install oauth - plugin
For a quick tutorial in how to use it see How to turn your rails site into an OAuth Provider .
New OAuth Consumer generator
The biggest news is the OAuth Consumer generator which should remove any excuses you ever had to not use OAuth when talking to Twitter etc .
I will cover this in more the next blog post .
For now checkout the README for more .
OAuth 1.0a support
The biggest change on the Provider side is support for OAuth 1.0a .
There is also optional backwards compatible support for the insecure OAuth 1.0 .
Please read Seth ’s Idiot ’s Guide to OAuth 1.0a for detailed information on what changed and why .
Nothing has changed on the OAuth 1.0a for existing AccessTokens , but if you need to support clients that only support 1.0 add the following at the bottom of your environment.rb file :
OAUTH_10 _SUPPORT
= true
HAML support
Both consumer and provider will now create haml view templates .
Just use the — haml flag .
Cleanup and easier updates
The original plugin was a really quick proof of concept , with lots of things that really needed cleaning up .
I am trying to do that little by little now .
The first step of this is to have the main functionality of the OauthController in a module within the plugin .
This allows you to update it easily .
We will do the same for the various Token classes as well over the next few releases .
How to upgrade ?
As long as you ’re using git / svn or whatever the easiest way to upgrade is to run the generator and let it overwrite your existing files .
Then use a diff tool to bring any changes you had done into the new code .
If you do n’t like the idea of doing that check the README for what should be done .
Worst comes to worst create a dummy rails project run the generator and compare files .
Do you need advise or help with implementing OAuth in your Rails application ?
I am available as a consultant and would be glad to help your company out .
Whether you need help in developing an OAuth strategy or in practical hands on implementation help .
Send me an email at [ email protected ] to let me know what you need help with and I can give you an estimate and my rate .
Using cameras so sensitive that they can detect single photons , researchers at Kyoto University discovered that humans emit visible light .

We know , these images look like standard infrared heat maps , but they 're not .
They actually depict visible light emanating from skin , the results of scientists tracking five 20 year old males standing in front of a dark room camera for frequent sessions throughout a day .
Apparently linked to metabolism , light emittance seemed to rise and fall during the day with the lowpoint tracked to around 10 am and the high point around 4 pm .
Also notable was that the face seemed to constitently emit the most light , a supposed byproduct of more melanin in the skin ( the stuff that makes you tanner ) because melanin has fluorescent components that might be enhancing the results .

XABI ALONSO’S proposed transfer to Real Madrid moved a step closer today – after the Spaniard put in a formal written transfer request .
The 27 - year - old ’s future has been the subject of intense speculation this summer with Real officials repeatedly stating their desire to sign the midfielder .
Alonso has consistently refused to publicly reveal his intentions and boss Rafa Benitez has always insisted he did n’t want to sell the Spanish international .
Benitez held talks with Alonso during the club ’s Far East tour in a desperate bid to convince him to stay .
However , Alonso refused to make any guarantees and has now finally admitted he sees his future away from Anfield .
Read James Pearce 's verdict on the transfer request on Liverpool Banter here .
Alonso ’s request is likely to be granted with Benitez reluctantly agreeing to sell a player who has three years remaining on his current contract .
The two clubs will now attempt to agree a fee with Real set to increase their initial offer of £ 24 million closer to Liverpool ’s valuation of £ 30 million .
Real president Florentino Perez yesterday admitted that signing Alonso is crucial to their hopes of success this season .
He said : “ It is fundamental that we sign Xabi Alonso .
He is a key player to our project . ”
Perez had previously slammed Benitez ’s valuation of Alonso as unrealistic – despite the £ 80 m they paid Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo – and threatened to walk away from the deal .
Liverpool will make a reluctant but hefty profit on Alonso , who cost £ 10.7 m from Real Sociedad in 2004 .
If Alonso now gets his move he will be reunited with Alvaro Arbeloa , who has completed his £ 3.5 m move to Real Madrid .
The 26 - year - old right - back passed a medical and signed a five - year deal .
Meanwhile , Andrea Dossena ’s move to Napoli is being held up by the left - back ’s wage demands .
Liverpool have agreed a fee of around £ 4 million for the 27 - year - old Italian international but personal terms are proving to be a stumbling block .
Napoli sporting director Pierpaolo Marino is planning further talks with Dossena in a bid to break the deadlock .
He said : “ We have taken a break in order to reflect on this .
The move is on hold .
There are no immediate prospects .
“ The president has spoken to Rafael Benitez and there is some distance between us and the player .
But I would n’t worry too much . ”

The internet was in an uproar Sunday when AT&T DSL subscribers around the country found they could n't reach the /b/ board on 4 chan , that petri dish of mischief that 's led to many an internet meme and more than one federal criminal indictment against Anonymous members .
Did those NSA - loving suits at AT&T block the site in a craven bout of puritanism ?
How would Anonymous retaliate ?
The pieces seemed set for the greatest battle between control and chaos since Control versus Kaos .
" If you 've been affected , I would advise you call or write customer support and corporate immediately , " 4 chan founder Moot wrote on the site 's status page Sunday .
AT&T responded Monday morning with a press release confirming it had temporarily blackholed img.4chan.org .
But it said the ban ( which has since been lifted ) was a defensive response to denial - of - service traffic hitting an AT&T subscriber , and originating from 4 chan 's own network .
Reached by Threat Level , AT&T declined to elaborate .
Now 4 chan ’s founder , Moot , has admitted that his network was sending spurious traffic , but he still faults AT&T for going too far with its response .
" They essentially dropped a nuke instead of using the fly swatter , " Moot said in an e-mail to Threat Level .
" I was told by someone within the company that an engineer essentially overreacted and made a mistake in choosing how to deal with a rather trivial issue .
That 's how we got to where we 're at now . "
The trouble was triggered by 4 chan 's response to a denial - of - service attack that 's been targeting the site 's image board for three weeks .
" We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that was more or less transparent to the end user , " Moot wrote in an afternoon update .
" Unfortunately , as an unintended consequence of the method used , some internet users received errant traffic from one of our network switches .
A handful happened to be AT&T customers . "
Filtering is normally a passive process not prone to spewing traffic onto the net .
But Moot says his filtering appliance was sending response packets to the incoming DDoS traffic .
Because the DDoS traffic used spoofed internet IP addresses , the replies went to innocent computers .
" A handful of AT&T customers ... complained to AT&T , and AT&T 's response was to blackhole our IPs across their entire network , as opposed to blocking traffic for just the customers who were being affected , " Moot says .
" I highly doubt the traffic was higher than a few megabits total – it would have not degraded their network at all . "
We wo n't question the most influential person on Earth .
We 're just glad that the war was called off before it escalated beyond a single fake news report claiming AT&T's CEO died .
In these times of heightened tension , it might be a good idea to set up a Cold War - style red phone linking Moot and the presidents of various internet providers .
Just to avoid future misunderstandings .

The Chinese heavy machinery maker that agreed to buy General Motors ' Hummer brand may find the biggest stumbling blocks to the deal in its home country .
- shares
Following last week 's surprise announcement that Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery and GM had reached an agreement , analysts and Chinese media were buzzing with talk that the two companies might have jumped the gun .
Reuters newsagency says the pitfalls range from regulatory to financing issues .
GM said a day after its bankruptcy filing that it did not expect any regulatory scrutiny from the US government on the deal , part of its attempt to restore profits by focusing on four core brands : Buick , GMC , Cadillac and Chevrolet .
According to Reuters many China watchers say that resistance could actually come from China itself , as Beijing pushes for development of more energy - efficient technologies that go contrary to Hummer 's lineup of big SUVs .
As the world 's second - largest energy user , China is trying to encourage its citizens and industry to be more fuel efficient to lower its energy bill and improve its environment .
The Hummer deal may also not get government approval as Beijing is not encouraging its carmakers to make foreign acquisitions , the official Shanghai Securities News reported , citing people with knowledge of the matter .
" Some people may have views and speculation but the Chinese government has a process that we respect , " the Tengzhong official said .
" We have only just signed an MoU ( Memorandum of Understanding ) , but as we develop our proposals with GM and Hummer we will continue to work with the appropriate authorities . "
Some analysts said Chinese leaders may also be reluctant to let a company with no experience running an overseas operation take on such a high profile and risky acquisition .
" Obviously , Tengzhong is not a well - established company , and its business does n't fit well with Hummer , so the deal looks tricky , " said Jeffery Wang , Shanghai - based managing director of investment bank Business Development Asia .
" Apart from that , buying Hummer should be a poor business decision in the long run , as ... I do n't think Tengzhong has the ability or resources to turn the business around .
... I do n't think any banks would be willing to fund the acquisition by a company without a solid background . "
Tengzhong was in advanced talks with banks , a spokeswoman from Tengzhong told Reuters .
" However , as you would appreciate , the funding can't be finalized prior to a definitive agreement being signed , " she said .
Little is know about Tengzhong , which is based in the Chinese province of Sichuan , other than it makes special - use vehicles , highway and bridge structural components , construction machinery and energy equipment .
Tengzhong was formed in 2005 through a series of mergers and , according to its Web site , has 4800 employees .
A veteran New Jersey political consultant who was among dozens arrested in a huge corruption sweep last week was found dead in his Jersey City apartment on Tuesday , the same day that one of three mayors charged in the case resigned .
The circumstances surrounding the death of the consultant , Jack M. Shaw , are “ suspicious , ” said Edward J. DeFazio , the Hudson County prosecutor .
He said it did not appear to be a homicide .
“ It could be natural , it could be accidental , it could be suicide , ” he said , refusing to elaborate .
An autopsy is set for Wednesday .
His death , reported by a companion to the authorities at 5:17 p.m. , came hours after Dennis Elwell , the mayor of Secaucus , stepped down , becoming the first elected official to quit after being charged in the sprawling political corruption case .
Mr. Shaw , 61 , once an adviser to some of New Jersey ’s most influential Democrats , more recently worked mainly for developers doing business in Hudson County .
A top client was Metrovest Equities , developer of the Beacon , a 10 - building apartment complex on the site of the former Jersey City Medical Center .
It is very easy to be tricked by light and shadows , as an artist one learns to manipulate a flat , 2D reality into a 3D illusion .
As an artist and sculptor I like to see and feel in 3D .
I felt that if I could recreate the Monolith in 3D and apply the same angle and lighting conditions , that I could bring out the intrinsic form and shape in question .
I created my ' diorama ' on a shallow box covered with sand and small angular rocks which I then spray painted with a flat gray primer paint .
I created the ' monolith ' with a block of wood and set it at an angle that would approximate the Phobos monolith .
I set the light ( sun ) at an approx .
angle close to the sun angle in the MOC image .
( See images at right ) .
Compare the diorama to the MOC image .
It 's close , enough to speculate that this is an artifact sticking up out of the surface .
Several years ago , orphaned baby Chhouk was found wandering alone in the forest without a foot .
The endangered Asian baby elephant apparently lost his left front foot due to injuries sustained from a poacher ’s snare .
Rescued in a remote area of northeastern Cambodia , the injured elephant was transported by truck to the Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center in what turned out to be a very difficult and treacherous 26 - hour journey .
Besides being severely malnourished , his stump was badly infected and nearly 5 inches of infected tissue was removed .
Balance issues and severe strain made walking on three feet nearly impossible .
Asian Elephants
According to the ICUN Red List , Asian elephants , Elephas maximus , are endangered .
Due to habitat loss and poaching , it is estimated only a few hundred of the Asian elephants exist in the wild in Cambodia .
Asian elephants can live up to 60 or 70 years .
Chhouk ’s Long Journey
This video was taken in 2008 , prior to Chhouk ’s new foot :

After being cared for by specialists since his rescue , the young elephant has now been fitted with a prosthesis .
The Cambodian School of Prosthetics and Orthotics ( CSPO ) headed the project to fit the baby with a brand new foot .
Although the foot needed some tweaking and repairs along the way , Chhouk can now walk and run with the new design .

While many caring people were involved in the elephant ’s rescue and recovery effort , Nick Marx , director of the Wildlife Alliance ’s Cambodia Rescue Center , wrote , “ However we must not forget the character and determination of the patient also .
A lesser spirit might not have survived the ordeal . ”
Due to his injuries , he can never be released back into the wild .
Chhouk and an older female elephant at the facility , Lucky , are now the best of pals .
In good health and as happy as a horse , Chhouk and Lucky spend their days frolicking in the pool and enjoying life .

Hello Bob ,
I ’m sorry to read of this near conclusion of your run-in with cannabis prohibition laws in SD .
Like you , I ’d hope to see a suspended sentence , or a lower sentence all together .
With 98 % of all criminal cases being plea bargained , I ’m sure this Hobson ’s Choice was a difficult one to make .
Being banned from public advocacy regarding something you–and clearly tens of millions of other Americans agree should be discussed publicly –maybe the cruelest cut of all .
One that I suspect is ironically going to draw more attention / media awareness to your ‘ run - of - the - mill ’ cannabis bust than any cannabis possession case in your state ’s history ( if it has not already ) .
You may have to remain mum about marijuana advocacy ( for a year ) , but groups like NORML never will , and where your voice has been temporarily silenced by a system ( i.e. , the mechanisms of cannabis prohibition ) no longer worthy of public respect in America ( and South Dakota ) , know full well that hundreds of thousands of your like - minded friends and fellow cannabis consumers will be LOUDLY protesting the continuation of cannabis prohibition from the halls of Congress , to Statehouses across the country , to the streets and parks in protest of both a failed public policy — and against any government or court mandates that seek criminal sanctions against citizens who disagree with prohibition laws , and will not allow them to share their views with the general public .
When a simple cannabis arrest turns into government restrictions on protected First Amendment speech and right of assembly , cannabis consumers and concerned citizens need to re-double their efforts to end our country ’s expensive and destructive cannabis prohibition laws .
Godspeed Bob !
Please remain in touch with NORML !!

Hello everyone ;
This will be the last email I send under the banner ‘ South Dakotans for Safe Access ‘ at least for a year .
By now , most of you know I plead to a felony count of possession of marijuana in May .
Today I was sentenced .
In an hour - long sentencing hearing , Judge Delaney waxed reminiscent as he described his admiration for Muhammad Ali ’s stance against an illegal war , which cost him millions of dollars and his peak performing years , during which time he did not complain , nor did he leave the country that so abused him for his beliefs .
Then , citing the fact that he ( Judge Delaney ) had to account for his actions to the hundreds of kids he sees in juvenile court , he sentenced me to a year in the Penn .
Co. jail , with all suspended but 45 days .
During the suspended part of the sentence I will wear a bracelet that senses alcohol use and I will be subject to arbitrary piss tests by a probation officer to detect illegal “ drug ” use .
In addition I may have no “ public role ” in cannabis law reform advocacy during that year .
Work release is an option , but I have few marketable skills , especially in a time when everyone else is getting laid off .
I ’ll follow any leads any of you might have .
It was somewhat harsher than I expected , and probably less than I deserved .
At least it did not cost me a career worth millions , and my peak performing years wo n’t begin until July 6 , 2010 .
And that ’s about all I feel comfortable saying about it .
For a year .
I ’ll turn 61 in prison , doin ’ six weeks for smokin’ a joint .
Mama cried .
*****
I will do my time beginning sometime in August .
If I have a job of the conventional sort ( you know , with a time to get there and a time to leave ) I can get work release .
So , if you have any ideas for me along those lines ?…
Thanks again to all who sent letters to the judge , and to those who have sent messages of support to me .
For 40 years I have watched as dozens of people I know–and thousands I know of –go through this same , ummm ? , procedure .
Now it ’s happening to me , and I feel the same frustration over the purposelessness of it all as I have felt for all those other people , many , many , many of whom were treated far more viciously than I .
Someday this war will be over .
So long for now ,
Bob

To start with , if he really was going that fast , he 's an idiot for pulling over .
He could have been off that toll road and off the freeway safe and sound before the CHP officer could have called for backup .
Also , I have never once seen a CHP officer on any of the toll roads around here .
The only way this makes sense is if he did n't have an electronic toll pass , decided to blow through that lane anyway to skip the toll and traffic , and was unfortunate enough to get his license plate snapped by the cameras there , and get the ticket mailed to him later .
In any case , something tells me that this is a fake .

Why Intelligent Design Does n't Cut It : A Primer By Michael S. Luciano Posted June 30 , 2009
There exist many organizations whose stated mission it is to promote the teaching of Intelligent Design in the science courses of our public schools .
They have names like the Discovery Institute , and the Intelligent Design Network which seeks " Objectivity in Origins Science . "
Needless to say , such organizations seek neither discovery nor objectivity , but are corrupted from the outset by a preexisting desire to push a faith - based agenda which has no scientific merit whatsoever .
Rather than define Intelligent Design and open myself up to allegations of straw - man tactics , I will let the Discovery Institute , perhaps the most visible and vocal mouthpiece for the ID cause , explain precisely what ID is : Intelligent design refers to a scientific research program as well as a community of scientists , philosophers and other scholars who seek evidence of design in nature .
The theory of intelligent design holds that certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection .
Through the study and analysis of a system 's components , a design theorist is able to determine whether various natural structures are the product of chance , natural law , intelligent design , or some combination thereof .
Such research is conducted by observing the types of information produced when intelligent agents act .
Scientists then seek to find objects which have those same types of informational properties which we commonly know come from intelligence .
Intelligent design has applied these scientific methods to detect design in irreducibly complex biological structures , the complex and specified information content in DNA , the life - sustaining physical architecture of the universe , and the geologically rapid origin of biological diversity in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion approximately 530 million years ago .
[ 1 ]
Because every single sentence contains major flaws , it would not be unwise to scrutinize every single one of them .
And so off we go .
Right away we are told that ID is a program conducted by " scientists , philosophers , and other scholars who seek evidence of design in nature . "
Basically this is an admission that their program is not about gathering data and allowing the evidence to lead them wherever it may , but rather a mission to find evidence which supports a predetermined conclusion -- that being that an intelligent agent created everything .
In this way , the ID " researcher " confines himself to analysis of only those findings which he may have use for as a buttress for the conclusion he has already arrived at .
It goes without saying that this is not science .
To presuppose automatically the existence of a ( perhaps supernatural ) designer is to preclude real , thoughtful , scientific research in accordance with the scientific method , since science deals only with observable , measurable , phenomena .
Second , I must take issue with the characterization of natural selection as an " undirected " process .
While selection is certainly not guided by a designer , it is guided by a fundamental logic inherent in the way the populations of species develop through time .
Specifically , organisms with the highest likelihood of passing on their genes are those best - adapted to their environments due to their having particular characteristics which are conducive to survival and procreation .
[ 2 ]
Hence , natural selection is not some willy - nilly phenomenon having no apparent rhyme or reason to it , but is a completely logical and -- more important -- observable process which helps explain to a great degree speciation and evolution in general .
This is especially true when selection is viewed in conjunction with ecological considerations .
[ 3 ]
Next , we come to this gem : " Through the study and analysis of a system 's components , a design theorist is able to determine whether various natural structures are the product of chance , natural law , intelligent design , or some combination thereof . "
I daresay this is outright bullshit .
First of all , evolution is not about chance .
Science is not interested in theories that attribute important phenomena to mere whimsy and caprice .
When ID advocates rail against the alleged role of chance in evolution , they betray their ignorance on the subject .
As I just explained , natural selection is hardly a matter of chance .
Nor is , as is popularly believed , mutation or what is sometimes called " random mutation . "
Mutation of course refers to changes in an organism 's DNA or RNA ( genetic material ) resulting from the miscopying of cells during cell division and also exposure to viruses , chemicals , and radiation , just to name a few of its sources ; and this act may or may not produce an effect which causes the organism to be measurably different in some way from its peers .
[ 4 ]
Thus mutation has identifiable causes which can be observed and assessed .
Even if we cannot in some instances ascertain why a mutation has occurred , we logically assume that there exists a cause which is not yet within our ability to grasp .
We do not use the holes in our understanding as an occasion to invoke God for the purpose of plugging those holes .
This is both unscientific and lazy .
But what is truly incredible about the Discovery Institute 's statement is the idea that ID " theorists " can determine if natural structures are a product of intelligent design .
How could they possibly determine whether the universe is intelligently designed when they have no other universe with which to compare it ?
Indeed , what would a non-designed universe look like ?
Or , what would an unintelligently designed universe look like ?
I am afraid that for the tunnel - visioned ID advocates , the achievements by men and women in the fields of biology , chemistry , physics and other sciences have had the exact opposite effect on them than the one it should have had .
Indeed , as Christopher Hitchens has noted , ID advocates have seen fit to use findings of science which have revealed further complexities in the natural world to assert that God is even cleverer than they had thought .
In this way , good science unwittingly serves to support the cause of the ID advocates ( in their view ) because by their own admission , the very nature of the ID " research " program requires that when reviewing scientific findings , they always do so with an eye toward their predetermined conclusion about intelligent agency .
Further , the Institute says , " Such research is conducted by observing the types of information produced when intelligent agents act .
Scientists then seek to find objects which have those same types of informational properties which we commonly know come from intelligence . "
And what are the objects we know come from intelligence ?
Paintings , automobiles , televisions , etc .
In other words , mostly manmade objects , along with the occasional bird 's nest and beaver dam .
But these objects clearly have design and purpose because we have either created them ourselves or have observed them built and used .
To a truly objective eye , the world does not appear to have a purpose , and to say that it does is -- once again -- to formulate a conclusion not supported by the evidence .
The problem here is the same as before in that we do not have any criteria for determining what an intelligently designed universe looks like .
Coming down the homestretch , " Intelligent design has applied these scientific methods to detect design in irreducibly complex biological structures , the complex and specified information content in DNA , the life - sustaining physical architecture of the universe , and the geologically rapid origin of biological diversity in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion approximately 530 million years ago . "
In the first place , by " these scientific methods " the statement means the ones I just demonstrated as being worthless in the preceding .
Second , we come to the darling " theory " of ID : " irreducible complexity " [ 5 ] -- the odd idea that some systems are too complex to have arisen through natural selection .
As Richard Dawkins has observed , supporters of irreducible complexity begin their argument simply by proclaiming that something is irreducibly complex , [ 6 ] and that if one part of the system is removed , the whole apparatus will not work properly .
However , I fail to see , for example , how by recognizing that removing the retina from a human eye will render it useless , this does any damage to evolutionary theory .
Evolution is predicated on the idea that genetic and biological compositions change over time as organisms adapt in accordance with their ( changing ) environments .
These adaptations very often involve a " progression " from relatively simple systems to more complex ones .
Rather than an argument against evolution , the eye may be rightly viewed as the intricate culmination of millions and billions of years of evolutionary change in those organisms from which humans are descended .
[ 7 ]
Finally , ID " theorists " who do not ascribe to the asinine view that the world is only a few thousand years old , frequently invoke the so - called Cambrian explosion in an effort to bolster their case .
Indeed , they brandish the Cambrian period as if it were some kind silver bullet to be shot into the heart of evolutionary theory .
But their optimism is misplaced .
More and more evidence is being uncovered which suggests that the " explosion " was not as sudden as initially thought .
As Fortey , Briggs , and Wills have observed , Two independent lines of evidence have prompted a critical re-examination of the Cambrian evolutionary ' explosion ' .
The first has involved a closer look at the nature of the fossil record and the phylogenetic relationships of Cambrian animals .
The second is based on the estimated sequence divergence of times of critical genes in the major groups of living animals , where these reflect deep phylogenetic branching .
Both lines of evidence indicate that the important branching events separating the animal phyla from their various common ancestors happened much earlier than the base of the Cambrian ; the fossil record cannot be taken literally as a chronology of phylogenesis . [ 8 ]
As such , the authors further note , " It may not be generally appreciated by biologists that first occurrence in the fossil record is not necessarily the same as time of origination . "
While this fact may not be appreciated by some biologists , as far as I can tell it is certainly not appreciated by any IDist .
It should also be pointed out that although ID advocates like to claim that the beginning of Cambrian period lends credence to the idea of intelligent agency , the subsequent extinction of Cambrian organisms poses yet another problem for ID .
If the universe is intelligently created , how does one account for the fact that over 99 % of all species that have ever existed are no more ?
That 's some design .
Rather than deal a blow to evolutionary theory , the implicit lesson of the Cambrian " explosion " seems to confirm one of its fundamental maxims -- that only the fittest shall survive .
Thankfully , this principle also applies to scientific theories , and hopefully in due time the American public will realize that Intelligent Design is so insufferably weak that it should no longer be allowed to live .
My Response to an ID Advocate 's Criticism Expectedly , at least one person was n't very satisfied with my assessment of Intelligent Design .
A man named ( or calling himself ) Lee Bowman gave all sorts of reasons why I am wrong in believing that ID is an illegitimate theory .
Based on some cursory internet research , Mr. Bowman appears to be a man who scours the web looking to slay Darwinian dragons in forums and online reviews .
Normally I would not even think about dedicating an entire article to respond to a comment , but Mr. Bowman raises some important points , on which he is wrong .
Before proceeding , I would like to take a moment to observe a melancholy truth about proponents of ID .
And that is that no matter what evidence you give them , no matter what experiments you perform or hypotheses you scientifically validate or refute , no fact is too inconvenient for the ID advocate .
The sheer ambiguity of the ID " hypothesis " allows for any and all kinds of evidence to fit this paradigm someway , somehow .
Needless to say , such a potentially all - encompassing hypothesis is scientifically useless .
Let us bear this in mind , shall we ?
First , Mr. Bowman takes issue with me because I refuse to recognize that the existence of an intelligent agent is a legitimate hypothesis from which to commence scientific inquiry for the reasons I just state above .
He also takes issue with my use of the word ' God ' instead of ' intelligent agent . '
Truth be told I was using ' God ' not so as to imply a particular god , but simply as an abbreviation for ' intelligent designer . '
But fine , I will use ' intelligent agent (s ) ' or ' designer (s ) ' in this article , even though I would be willing to bet a good chunk of change that Mr. Bowman believes in the existence of the Judeo - Christian God .
Also , in a rather curious critique of a remark in which I said that ID proponents believe that a designer created everything , he says , " The specifics that you follow with are not suggested or implied , i.e. ' designed everything , ' " Not suggested or implied ?
If I 'm not mistaken , this means he is saying that ID posits that it may be that only some of our universe is intelligently designed , as opposed to it being designed entirely .
If this is the case then he has just made his job even more difficult than if he had said that the whole universe is intelligently created .
Whereas an advocate of universal ID sees design everywhere and therefore automatically attributes the existence and nature of things -- stars , animals , proteins , etc. -- to design , Mr. Bowman would have to determine which objects , species , and phenomena are the result of intelligent agency and which ones are not .
And not only would Mr. Bowman have the same problem of identifying design without having any conception of what design looks like in the first place , he would have to hope that his inevitably arbitrary classification of things into the categories of ' designed ' and ' not designed ' would ultimately be correct , lest his subsequent " research " be dependent entirely on erroneous premises .
Pardon me while I allow myself a haughty chuckle , but how would one possibly confirm the veracity of such classifications ?
One would not because one would literally have no idea from which fundamental principles to proceed .
But let 's have some fun .
Let us assume that indeed , design truly could be detected in things .
It does not necessarily follow , however , that only one designer is responsible for all that is designed .
Indeed , Mr. Bowman himself mentions the possibility of intelligent agents .
Does this mean he would readily grant the possibility that every single thing that is designed has a separate individual designer ?
By recognizing the existence of design , we invite -- even beg -- the possibility that there are as many intelligent designers as there are things designed , since after all , the existence of multiple designs need not imply a single designer .
Many ID advocates like to point to paintings as evidence of painters and buildings as evidence of builders , but we of course know these things to be designed because we designed them .
If we apply this same exact logic to the natural world , we would have to conclude that the sun is evidence of a sun designer , a tree evidence of a tree designer , a human evidence of a human designer , and so on , because they are separate things just like paintings and buildings are separate things and have separate designers .
To assume a single designer is to conceptually unify an abundance of phenomena ( meaning all the objects that are designed ) without any real or sufficient justification for doing so .
Positing that a designer or designers are responsible for those phenomena which we do not believe can be explained by " natural " causes , is to provide an explanation which raises a series of unanswerable questions about this hypothetical designer (s ) ( e.g. who designed the designer / s and where did it / they come from ? ) and discourages further scientific inquiry into those matters which have been explained away by the invocation of intelligent agency .
Such an explanation , of course , is no explanation at all .
Mr. Bowman then asks if I deny that " what [ natural selection ] has to select from is random . "
But the premise of this question is wrong because natural selection does not select .
Nature " selects " those organisms best - suited to survive in their environments .
Next , Mr. Bowman , who says he is a scientist , goes completely off - the - reservation .
The remarks are worth quoting at length for the sheer amusement they inspire :
While we cannot know for sure why intelligences would construct lifeforms , there are clear possibilities .
One , to see what one can come up with , and to observe the results , not that different from going to the movies for a vicarious experience .
A second possibility is that bioforms are vehicles for spirit entities ( you , for instance ) to partake in an earthly experience .
My conclusion , [ Oh please do tell us ! ] based on experimentation , is that consciousness is external from the biological construct .
To be honest , personally I cannot discount the possibility of a " greater reality " or a " higher consciousness " ( but not a designer , mind you ) which we could not possibly begin to comprehend .
Certainly , the puzzle of existence is the greatest mystery of all .
However , I would never allow a vague subjective feeling to color my understanding of the physical world .
Mr. Bowman 's claims here ( as elsewhere ) are pure speculation .
Why would an intelligent designer (s ) design ?
To him , " there are clear possibilities , " which means that Mr. Bowman must have access to some information that the rest of us simply do not because many of us cannot see these possibilities .
Contending that an intelligent agent might be motivated by the desire for a " vicarious experience " and " to see what [ it ] can come up with " is to anthropomorphize said agent by ascribing to it human motives , and this dear friends , reeks of the noxious fumes of creationism .
His second possibility , that organisms are earthly vehicles for " spirit entities " is hardly a testable hypothesis .
How does one test this " clear possibility " ?
Indeed one does not .
But the news is not all bad .
As you just read , based on Mr. Bowman 's own experimentation , " consciousness is external from the biological construct . "
What an experiment that must have been .
For centuries scientists and philosophers have grappled unsuccessfully with the mind - body problem , but at this moment Mr. Bowman assures us that he has solved this conundrum once and for all through his own experimentation , whose results he declines to provide .
For my part , I have seen no evidence to suggest that consciousness can exist separate from the organism to which it belongs .
Mr. Bowman then says that evolution is " not statistically plausible . "
According to what model and figures we do not know , because again he does not provide any data .
Even if we were to grant him this point , he would have to demonstrate that ID is more statistically plausible than evolution , which he does not and could not .
It goes without saying that that is one scholarly article I will be waiting to read ( in vain for the rest of my life ) .
Next , Mr. Bowman disputes my contention that " the [ human ] eye may be rightly viewed as the intricate culmination of millions and billions of years of evolutionary change in those organisms from which humans are descended " by calling this , " Hand waving and conjecture . "
And why is it ?
According to him , my remarks about the eye , as well as the extensive research of Nilsson , " overlook the eye 's inherent complexities , which are many . "
Truth be told , while the human eye is impressive on many levels , it is far from perfect .
For example , human beings ( and vertebrates in general ) have blind spots owing to the eye 's inefficient composition .
Due to the upside - down and backwards configuration of our eyes , light must first go through the cornea , then the lens , and then through all kinds of blood vessels and cells before the photons finally reach the rods and cones of the retina .
Only then is the data ( light ) processed by the brain in the form of neural impulses . [ 9 ]
For Mr. Bowman to say to that Nilsson -- a renowned , respected , and perhaps most important , peer - reviewed authority on the human eye -- overlooks the eye's " inherent complexities " ( whatever that means ) is to make a very bold claim which better have some serious scholarship behind it , because Nilsson certainly does .
I have a feeling that Mr. Bowman cannot say the same .
Lastly , Mr. Bowman declares simply , " Engineering and design are evidence . "
Evidence of what ?
Engineering and design ?
Indeed , that would be the world 's most blatant tautology .
But engineering ( noun ) and design ( noun ) are only evidence of engineering ( verb ) and design ( verb ) if we know that the evidence before us is in fact engineered and designed .
Let me say again that we do not know this for the reasons I have stated in this article .
To assert that the universe ( or even just certain objects or animals ) are intelligently designed , is not only to assert an understanding of what intelligent design looks like and entails , but is to claim an understanding of what non-design and / or unintelligent design looks like , and also to be able to tell the difference between them using what will undoubtedly be arbitrary criteria .
Therefore , ID is not a legitimate scientific theory , but the exact opposite : a purely speculative hypothesis whose breathtaking ambiguity serves not to advance understanding , but to stifle it by suggesting the unknowable and the untestable as an explanation for natural phenomena . [ 1 ]

A dog walker has spoken of the horror of witnessing three youths stamp a new born deer to death in a park in Dorset .
Keith Arthurs was walking his dog in Upton Country Park , near Poole , when he saw three teenage boys wearing hoods attack the fawn on Wednesday night .
He did not intervene for fear of being injured .
The RSPCA collected the body and took it to Lynwood Vets in Wareham .
Police are appealing for the public 's help in finding the boys .
Mr Arthurs said : " I was disgusted and horrified . "
He added : " One of them hit the fawn across his head .
" Then they dropped it on the floor and they all took turns stamping on it .
" It [ went ] on for a few minutes . "
The area is popular with walkers and cyclists .
Pc John Snellin , wildlife officer for Dorset Police , said : " Twenty - three years I have been in the force and I do n't think , in all honesty , I have seen anything quite as barbaric and horrendous as this .
" It worries me what these youngsters might go on to do . "
1. Improving the quality of heterojunction of HIT solar cell
The structure of the HIT solar cell allows a possible reduction in recombination loss of the electrical element ( charged carrier ) by surrounding the energy generation layer of single thin crystalline silicon ( c - Si ) with high quality ultra - thin amorphous silicon ( a - Si ) layers .
SANYO has recently managed to improve the quality of the HIT solar cell junction through developing a technology for depositing a higher quality a - Si layer over the c - Si substrate while protecting the c - Si surface from being damaged .
The result was an increase in the open circuit voltage ( Voc ) from 0.725V to 0.729V .
2. Reduction of optical absorption loss
In the solar cell , sunlight hitting the surface needs guidance to the c - Si , the energy generation layer , with the smallest possible absorption loss .
For the HIT solar cell , reducing optical absorption loss in the a - Si layer , which covers the front and rear surfaces of the c - Si , and the transparent conductive layer was a challenge .
Absorption of short - wavelength solar radiation by the a - Si layer and that of long - wavelength solar radiation by the transparent conductive layer were the causes of the optical absorption loss .
SANYO has recently developed know - how to reduce optical absorption loss in both the a -Si and transparent conductive layers .
As a result , the short circuit current ( Isc ) improved from 39.2 mA / cm2 to 39.5 mA/cm2 .
3. Reduction of resistance loss
In the solar cell , generated electric current is collected and taken out through the surface grid electrode .
SANYO recently realized lower - resistance electrode material for use in the grid electrode and a higher - aspect ratio through improving printing technology , leading to a success in reduction of resistance loss when an electric current flows through the grid electrode .
As a result , the fill factor ( FF ) was improved from 0.791 to 0.80 .
Los Angeles tops the list of America's " 10 Meanest Cities " in its treatment of the homeless as criminals , two legal advocacy agencies for the poor say in a report proposing alternatives for handling the down - and - out .
The survey of 273 cities by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty and the National Coalition for the Homeless based its rankings on the number of laws targeting the homeless by making it illegal to sleep , eat or sit in public spaces .
" Homelessness in America is a human - rights crisis right here at home , " said Maria Foscarinis , executive director of the law center .
" As foreclosures continue and the recession deepens , the crisis is affecting more and more Americans .
But while some cities offer a helping hand , too often , as documented in our report , cities adopt unjust laws and practices that punish people simply for being poor and homeless . "
Tulin Ozdeger , the law center 's civil rights program director , argued that it costs more to jail a homeless person in violation of the " inhumane " laws than to provide permanent housing .
Other cities rounding out the list in the report , titled Homes , Not Handcuffs , are 2 ) St. Petersburg , Fla . ; 3 ) Orlando , Fla . ; 4 ) Atlanta;5 ) Gainesville , Fla . ; 6 ) Kalamazoo , Mich . ; 7 ) San Francisco ; 8 ) Honolulu;9 ) Bradenton , Fla. ; 10 ) Berkeley , Calif .

The FDIC closed four more banks on Friday , and the following graph shows bank failures by week for 2009 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
So far there have been 57 FDIC bank failures in 2009 .
It appears there will be close to 100 bank failures this year .
Note : Week 1 ends Jan 9th .
This is nothing compared to the S&L crisis .
There were 28 weeks during the S&L crisis when regulators closed 10 or more banks , and the peak was April 20 , 1989 with 60 bank closures ( there were 7 separate weeks with more than 30 closures in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s ) .
The second graph covers the entire FDIC period ( annually since 1934 ) .
Back in the ' 80s , there was some minor multiple counting ... as an example , when First City of Texas failed on Oct 30 , 1992 there were 18 different banks closed by the FDIC .
This multiple counting was minor , and there were far more bank failures in the late ' 80s and early '90s than this year .
The third graph includes the 1920s and shows that failures during the S&L crisis were far less than during the ' 20s and early ' 30s ( before the FDIC was enacted ) .
Note how small the S&L crisis appears on this graph with the change in they - axis !
The number of bank failures soared to 4000 ( estimated ) in 1933 .
During the Roaring ' 20s , 500 bank failures per year was common - even with a booming economy - with depositors typically losing 30 % to 40 % of their bank deposits in the failed institutions .
No wonder even the rumor of a problem caused a run on the bank !
Of course the number of banks is n't the only measure .
Many banks today have more branches , and far more assets and deposits .
The FDIC era source data is here - including by assets ( in most cases ) - under Failures and Assistance Transactions
The pre-FDIC data is here .
Mobile media service provider looking to expand its already - wide horizons
QuickPlay Media Inc. , mobile powerhouse for TV / video service solutions , announced today the closing of a $ 12 million Series D round of financing .
This is the company ’s first expansion of new capital since September 2007 , when it raised $ 15 million in Series C funding .
Founded in 2004 , the Toronto - based media company boasts of handling all aspects of any mobile media sharing by providing a solution to manage , distribute , and monetize video services .
Its key software , called the “ QuickStart ” solution , is a streaming and download service for Video on Demand , Audio on Demand , live TV , and radio .
PrimeTime2Go is another of QuickPlay ’s software solutions , advertised as a customizable structure specifically designed for serving customers who want to download shows from NBC , ABC , and other leading networks to their phones .
In a year where the importance of mobile media is blasting off , QuickPlay is proving itself a contender with a hefty list of clientele .
Providing live and on - demand video services for over 150 media companies on 15 major mobile operators in North America and Europe , the company has already demonstrated its potential for widespread market penetration .
For Rogers Wireless , Bell Mobility , and Alltel customers , QuickPlay provides service for MTV ’s reality and talk shows .
Given away by a giant banner on the front page of its website , the company also appears delighted to power SIRIUS|XM Radio for the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch , the first of which is available exclusively through AT&T .
Not to mention partnerships with Live Nation , the NBA , NBC , and others , these are just a few examples of QuickPlay ’s many connections in the entertainment industry .
Led by GMP Securities L.P. and supported by existing VC partners General Catalyst Partners , JLA Ventures and Ventures West , this latest round of funding is to be directed especially at QuickPlay ’s OpenVideo Platform and PrimeTime2 Go .
It 's happening all over again .
The ritual that abortion providers go through when they learn that one of their own has been slain or terrorized by the anti abortion hate mongers .
You 're in your garden , or cleaning your garage , and you get a call from someone who is online .
Then the phone calls begin ... the disbelief , sobbing , remembering a very wonderful man .
And eventually the anger .
Although we are in shock , we are not surprised .
Dr. Tiller has been targeted before and has spent most of his time defending himself against anti's at the clinic and in the Kansas government with several criminal complaints .
In March he was acquitted of 16 counts of " failing to get a second opinion . "
And many providers have noticed an increase in harassment outside clinics .
So much so that providers have started Enough !
Basta !
Stop Bullying at Women 's Clinics with a page on Facebook under that name .
The group has raised about $ 2000 to put videos of harassment on the internet so that the public can understand the context of hate outside clinics .
There is more information at the ACN website as well as a place to donate .

In the last few weeks as people have started reading the US ARC of Liar they have also started asking why there is such a mismatch between how Micah describes herself and the cover image .
Micah is black with nappy hair which she wears natural and short .
As you can see that description does not match the US cover .
Many people have been asking me how I feel about the US cover , why I allowed such a cover to appear on a book of mine , and why I have n’t been speaking out about it .
Authors do not get final say on covers .
Often they get no say at all .
As it happens I was consulted by Bloomsbury and let them know that I wanted a cover like the Australian cover , which I think is very true to the book .
I was lucky that my Australian publisher , Allen & Unwin , agreed with my vision and that the wonderful Bruno Herfst came up with such a perfect cover image .
I never wanted a girl ’s face on the cover .
Micah ’s identity is unstable .
She spends the book telling different version of herself .
I wanted readers to be free to imagine her as they wanted .
I have always imagined her looking quite a bit like Alana Beard , which is why I was a bit offended by the reviewer , who in an otherwise lovely review , described Micah as ugly .
She ’s not !
The US Liar cover went through many different versions .
An early one , which I loved , had the word Liar written in human hair .
Sales & Marketing did not think it would sell .
Bloomsbury has had a lot of success with photos of girls on their covers and that ’s what they wanted .
Although not all of the early girl face covers were white , none showed girls who looked remotely like Micah .
I strongly objected to all of them .
I lost .
I have n’t been speaking out publicly because to be the first person to do so would have been unprofessional .
I have privately been campaigning for a different cover for the paperback .
The response to the cover by those who have n’t read Liar has been overwhelmingly positive and I would have looked churlish if I started bagging it at every opportunity .
I hoped that once people read Liar they would be as upset as I am with the cover .
It would not have helped get the paperback changed if I was seen to be orchestrating that response .
But now that this controversy has arisen I am much more optimistic about getting the cover changed .
I am also starting to rethink what I want that cover to look like .
I did want Bloomsbury to use the Australian cover , but I ’m increasingly thinking that it ’s important to have someone who looks like Micah on the front .
I want to make it clear that while I disagree with Bloomsbury about this cover I am otherwise very happy to be with them .
They ’ve given me space to write the books I want to write .
My first book for them was a comic fairy book that crossed over into middle grade ( How To Ditch Your Fairy ) .
I followed that up with Liar , a dark psychological thriller that crosses over into adult .
There are publishers who would freak .
No one at Bloomsbury batted an eye .
I have artistic freedom there , which is extraordinarily important to me .
They are solidly behind my work and have promoted it at every level in ways I have never been promoted before .
Covers change how people read books
Liar is a book about a compulsive ( possibly pathological ) liar who is determined to stop lying but finds it much harder than she supposed .
I worked very hard to make sure that the fundamentals of who Micah is were believable : that she ’s a girl , that she ’s a teenager , that she ’s black , that she ’s USian .
One of the most upsetting impacts of the cover is that it ’s led readers to question everything about Micah :
If she does n’t look anything like the girl on the cover maybe nothing she says is true .
At which point the entire book , and all my hard work , crumbles .
No one in Australia has written to ask me if Micah is really black .
No one in Australia has said that they will not be buying Liar because “ my teens would find the cover insulting . ”
Both responses are heart breaking .
This cover did not happen in isolation .
Every year at every publishing house , intentionally and unintentionally , there are white - washed covers .
Since I ’ve told publishing friends how upset I am with my Liar cover , I have been hearing anecdotes from every single house about how hard it is to push through covers with people of colour on them .
Editors have told me that their sales departments say black covers do n’t sell .
Sales reps have told me that many of their accounts wo n’t take books with black covers .
Booksellers have told me that they can’t give away YAs with black covers .
Authors have told me that their books with black covers are frequently not shelved in the same part of the library as other YA — they ’re exiled to the Urban Fiction section — and many bookshops simply do n’t stock them at all .
How welcome is a black teen going to feel in the YA section when all the covers are white ?
Why would she pick up Liar when it has a cover that so explicitly excludes her ?
The notion that “ black books ” do n’t sell is pervasive at every level of publishing .
Yet I have found few examples of books with a person of colour on the cover that have had the full weight of a publishing house behind them .
Until that happens more often we ca n’t know if it ’s true that white people wo n’t buy books about people of colour .
All we can say is that poorly publicised books with “ black covers ” do n’t sell .
The same is usually true of poorly publicised books with “ white covers . ”
Are the big publishing houses really only in the business of selling books to white people ?
That ’s not a very sustainable model if true .
Certainly the music industry has found that to be the case .
Walk into a music store , online or offline , and compare the number of black faces you see on the covers there as opposed to what you see in most book stores .
Does n’t seem to affect white people buying music .
The music industry stopped insisting on white washing decades ago .
Talented artists like Fats Domino no longer needs Pat Boone to cover genius songs like “ Ai n’t That a Shame ” in order to break into the white hit parade .
( And ai n’t that song title ironic ? )
There is , in fact , a large audience for “ black books ” but they were n’t discovered until African American authors started self - publishing and selling their books on the subway and on the street and directly into schools .
And , yet , the publishing industry still does n’t seem to get it .
Perhaps the whole “ black books do n’t sell ” thing is a self - fulfilling prophecy ?
I hope that the debate that ’s arisen because of this cover will widen to encompass the whole industry .
I hope it gets every publishing house thinking about how incredibly important representation is and that they are in a position to break down these assumptions .
Publishing companies can make change .
I really hope that the outrage the US cover of Liar has generated will go a long way to bringing an end to white washing covers .
Maybe even to publishing and promoting more writers of color .
But never forget that publishers are in the business of making money .
Consumers need to do what they can .
When was the last time you bought a book with a person of colour on the front cover or asked your library to order one for you ?
If you were upset by the US cover of Liar go buy one right now .
I ’d like to recommend Coe Booth ’s Kendra which is one of the best books I ’ve read this year .
Waiting on my to be read pile is Shine , Coconut Moon by Neesha Meminger , which has been strongly recommended to me by many people .
Clearly we do not live in a post - racist society .
But I ’d like to think that the publishing world is better than those many anecdotes I ’ve been hearing .
But for that to happen , all of us — writers , editors , designers , sales reps , booksellers , reviewers , readers , and parents of readers — will have to do better .
Update : Because some recent commenters have n’t heard that Bloomsbury have changed the cover here is a link to the new cover .
Are Americans wimps ?
Is there anything more absurd than the U.S. Congress ’s decision to deny funds to close Guantanamo , on the grounds that this might result in detainees being held on American soil ?
Excuse me , but is n’t this taking the “ not - in - my - backyard ” principle to absurd lengths ?
We ’re not talking about letting a suspected terrorist walk around free in your hometown while he awaits trial ; we talking about putting them in jail while they are tried ( and by a military tribunal ) .
If convicted , they ’d end up in prison ( along with over 200,000 other federal prisoners already incarcerated and the more than 3,000 convicted murderers now on death row ) .
If acquitted , they could still be deported .
This episode betrays a certain schizophrenia about America ’s role as a world power .
On the one hand , the foreign policy elite continually tells Americans that the United States is the “ leader of the free world , ” and that they have a long list of global responsibilities .
As a result , the United States spends a lot of money on its national security apparatus , tells lots of countries how to run their own affairs , maintain an extensive array of military bases , and send its armed forces into harm ’s way in various faraway lands .
Indeed , William Pfaff is not far off in saying that the United States has become “ addicted to war . ”
But on the other hand , U.S politicians somehow believe that all this overseas activity should n’t have any impact here at home , apart from making us stand in long security lines at the airport .
So President Bush did n’t raise taxes to pay for the war on terror or the war in Iraq , and now Congress does n’t think the American people would tolerate having a couple of hundred suspected terrorists in prison somewhere in the United States .
Frankly , if Americans are that skittish and self - absorbed , the country has no business exercising any sort of “ global leadership ” and the various Congresspersons who voted to deny the funds should immediately demand the abrogation of all existing alliances , the termination of all military activities overseas , and a return to a strict policy of isolationism .
I do n’t think that ’s a good idea , by the way , but at least our Congressional representatives would be being consistent .

The former chief commander of the Soviet Navy has revealed information on UFOs that until recently had been secret .
The Soviet Navy had so many encounters with mysterious objects raising from or diving into the ocean that a special analytic group was set to make weekly reports to the naval commander - in - chief .
The Russian website Free Press ( svpressa.ru ) interviewed that officer on July 16 .
Vladimir N. Chernavin , 81 , was the chief commander of the Soviet Navy and deputy minister of defense of the USSR from 1985 to 1992 .
He is the recipient of several high Soviet and Russian state honors .
The material he presented is peppered with the names of other distinguished Soviet naval officers .
Some of those officers have spoken before about their knowledge of UFOs , but others are being publicly associated with the phenomenon for the first time .
Among the information Chernavin revealed are these statistics provided by former naval captain of the first rank Vladimir Azhazha : “ Fifty percent of meetings with UFOs are connected with the ocean , and 15 percent with lakes . ”
Forty - four percent of cases have been recorded in the Atlantic Ocean , 16 percent in the Pacific , 10 percent in the Mediterranean Sea .
Azhazha also recounted an incident in the Pacific Ocean , when a Russian submarine was pursued by six unidentified objects , which emerged from the water and took flight after the submarine surfaced to evade them .
Azhazha is the author of dozens of books and articles on UFOs .
He was the captain of the experimental submarine Severyanka in the 1960s and has recounted his experiences with unidentified objects under water before .
Former rear admiral and nuclear submarine commander Yury Beketov is quoted describing events that occurred in the Bermuda Triangle .
“ We repeatedly observed that the instruments detected the movements of material objects at unimaginable speed , around 230 knots ( 400 km . per hour [ 250 m.p.h. ] ) .
It ’s hard to reach that speed on the surface – only in the air [ is it readily possible ] …
The beings that created those material objects significantly exceed us in development . ”
Naval intelligence expert and captain for the first rank Igor Barklay noted that the unidentified objects were most often spotted in deep water near where military forces are concentrated – off the Bahamas , Bermuda , Puerto Rico and the east coast of the United States .
Unexplained activity in Lake Baikal is also recorded .
In 1982 , divers on a training exercise encountered swimmers in silver outfits with no visible breathing apparatus .
They were at a depth of 50 meters ( 164 feet ) .
Three people died trying to pursue the mysterious swimmers .
Abstract
This document provides summaries about the two serializations of the HTML 5 [ HTML5 ] vocabulary specification .
It documents the differences between the two serializations and their associated mime types .
It ’s intended to be readable as a “ standalone ” document .
Editorial note
Editor 's Draft 5 July 2009
This document is for review by the HTML Working Group and is subject to change without notice .
This document has no formal standing within W3C .
Please consult the group 's home page and the W3C technical reports index for information about the latest publications by this group .
Introduction
HTML is the publishing language of the World Wide Web .
HTML 5 specification [ HTML5 ] includes the description of an abstract vocabulary for writing Web pages .
It defines the semantics : what should be a title , a list or a paragraph among others .
It also defines the grammar : how these elements should be nested .
Serializations
The process of writing down an actual markup for these defined semantics is called a serialization in computer science .
The rules for writing the markup can be different depending on the application and processing context .
A same language semantics can have multiple serializations ( ways of writing it ) .
The choice of serialization as consequences on the way user agent will process the document .
HTML 5 serializations
The precedent versions of the HTML vocabulary ( HTML + , HTML 2.0 , HTML 3.2 ) were written using SGML syntax rules .
HTML 4 had already two syntaxes : SGML ( called HTML 4.01 ) and XML ( called XHTML 1.0 ) .
HTML 5 , the abstract language , can be written , at least , in two different syntaxes : html and XML .
You will choose a syntax depending on your developer needs , markets and applications contexts .
The rest of this document explains what are the constraints associated to the choice of your serializations .
MIME Types
For the purpose of processing documents in user agents :
A document served with the application / xhtml+xml MIME type is defined as an XHTML document ( meaning that conformant users agent will parse it with an XML parser , and process it as a document in the XHTML syntax ) .
A document served with the text / html MIME type is defined as and HTML document ( meaning that conformant users agent will parse it with an HTML parser , and process it as a document in the HTML syntax ) .
On the desktop
When opening a document with a browser ( not sent by a Web server ) , the MIME type is unknown from the browser .
Browsers trust the filename extension to process the file in a particular mode ( html or xml ) .
For processing HTML documents as XML , filename must end with .xhtml or .xht or .xhtm .
or or .
For processing HTML documents as HTML , filename must end with .html .
Note : once the file is put on a server , these extensions will trigger the right MIME type ( except if they are changed ) .
Most servers are configured to send a specific MIME type depending on the extension of the filename .
MIME Types rules for HTML 5
XHTML must be served with an XML MIME type , such as application / xml or application / xhtml+xml .
or .
HTML must be served as text / html .
Versatile Documents
A HTML document is a document that conforms to both the HTML and XHTML syntactic requirements , and which can be processed as either by browsers , depending on the MIME type used .
This works by using a common subset of the syntax that is shared by both HTML and XHTML .
Versatile documents are useful to create for situations where a document is intended to be served as either HTML or XHTML , depending on the support in particular browsers , or when it is not known at the time of creation , which MIME type the document will ultimately be served as .
Imagine the following simple document served with utf - 8 encoding , it is possible to serve it as text / html and application / xhtml+xml .
HTTP header to send with the document for HTML
Content - Type : text / html ; charset=utf -8
HTTP header to send with the document for XHTML
Content - Type : application / xhtml+xml ; charset=utf -8
Finally the document itself .
<! DOCTYPE html > < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > < head > < title > Versatile document </ title > </ head > < body > < p >< q> The medium is the massage .
</q > - < cite > Marshall McLuhan</ cite > </ p> </body > </html >
In order to successfully create and maintain versatile documents , authors need to be familiar with both the similarities and differences between the two syntaxes .
This includes not only syntactic differences , but also differences in the way stylesheets , and scripts are handled , and the way in which character encodings are detected .
Syntax
Should I reorganize the tables in family of issues .
Depending on the mime type chosen for sending the document on the Web , some syntax rules become critical for an appropriate document parsing .
Both with html and xml parsing , choices will have consequences on the way the document is interpreted .
List of syntax differences between html and xml serializations in HTML 5 Feature HTML XHTML doctype required .
The doctype triggers the strict rendering mode .
<! doctype html > optional , if used must be well - formed XML .
i.e. <! DOCTYPE html > , with optional PUBLIC and / or SYSTEM identifiers .
case sensitivity
( attributes , elements , doctype ) not case sensitive < p CLASS = " poem " >
A text </P> case sensitive < p class = " poem " >
A text </p>
Non self closing tags ( ex : tr )
In HTML , certain elements allow the omission of either or both : html ( both ) , head ( both ) , body ( both ) , li ( end tag ) , dt ( end tag ) , dd ( end tag ) , p ( end tag ) , colgroup ( both ) , thead ( end tag ) , tbody ( both ) , tfoot ( end tag ) , tr ( end tag ) , td ( end tag ) , th ( end tag ) Non self closing tags require both a start and an end tag self closing tags ( ex : br ) self closing tag syntax ( trailing slash ) is allowed on void elements ( base , link , meta , hr , br , img , embed , param , area , col and input ) , but forbidden on other elements . < br > < br />
End tags for void elements are forbidden .
may use either the self closing tag syntax or have an end tag immediately follow the start tag .
< br></br> < br/> attribute minimization allowed < input disabled > < input disabled=disabled > < input disabled=' disabled '> < input disabled =" disabled " > not allowed < input disabled =' disabled ' > < input disabled =" disabled " >
Unquoted attributes allowed < p class=straight > not allowed < p class = " straight " >…</p> CDATA section not allowed allowed <![ CDATA [ < p class= " poem " >
A text </ p > ] ] >
Processing instructions not allowed allowed Named character references can be used é cannot be used except : & , < , > , " and ' ( though you can create your own dtd ) Contextual tolerance for < and & characters < allowed in < script > , < style > , < title > , < textarea > & allowed in < script > , < style > not allowed Namespace prefixes not allowed allowed xhtml Namespace declaration allowed < html xmlns = " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " > required < html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " >
Unicode characters set of XML 1.0 lang attribute lang xml:lang id attribute id xml:id and id noscript element allowed forbidden xml : base not allowed allowed character encoding recommended to use HTTP Content - Type header .
Also possible to use < meta charset = " utf - 8 " > recommended to use HTTP Content - Type header .

Experience hath shewn , that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have , in time , and by slow operations , perverted it into tyranny .
- Thomas Jefferson
We celebrate our Nation ’s Birthday in a few days .
It ’s a good time to reflect on what we Americans stand for …and what we do n’t .
At a time we are fighting tyranny overseas , let us not forget to stand up to tyranny in our own backyard .
There is a concept in America we call “ term limits ” .
They apply to everyone in office , including Peter Douglas , Executive Director of the California Coastal Commission .
Can anyone name someone besides Mr. Douglas who has reigned in office as long as Sir Peter ?
In a Monarchy , kings reign … in a democracy , elected officials serve the people - all of the people for limited terms .
- Richard Oshen filmmaker
Amendment 22 to the United States Constitution ratified February 1951 , specifies term limits for the President of the United States .
Seems that Mr. Douglas thus declares himself to be above the constitution .
Like the rights to property
Mr D despises , he seems to view the constitution as a petty annoyance .
In a 1997 speech at a conference in Monterey … Peter Douglas called for the U.S. Constitution to be amended to make courts the “ arbiters ” in what he called the “ debate ” over property owners ’ rights .
That seems to be the issue right there , Mr. Douglas :
Property rights is not a debate .
It is the LAW OF THE LAND .
Me thinks this is the trouble in a nutshell .
Did Mr. Douglas or did he not take a Civil Service oath to defend and protect the constitution of the United States ?
If he did , he has n’t done a good job of it … if not it is a charade on scale unparalleled in California , possibly the nation , and must not be permitted to stand any longer .
In my 90 minute interview with Peter Douglas for SINS OF COMMISSION , Mr. Douglas makes a bold , provocative statement on camera that he is not a civil servant - Question : If Mr. Douglas is not a civil servant , then who or what does Peter Douglas serve ?
I was appointed on a seven to five vote .
And there have been at least 11 attempts to get rid of me over the years because people do n’t , for whatever reason , uh , ca n’t control me .
And I ’m ( Stammers ) the only non-civil service employee of the Coastal Commission .
Everybody else is civil service .
- Peter Douglas , SINS OF COMMISSION
If he is not a civil servant … all the more reason to to send him packing .
Especially after the Ramirez Canyon travesty SHAME ON YOU !
Time to break up the CCC ’s corrupt fiefdom , especially with so many overlapping regulatory agencies in the state .
It seems to me the resource agencies can be streamlined - trim the fat , and become much more efficient thus saving an already overburdened budget , and WE the people , lots of money .
The commission ’s little scheme works like this :
The governor selects 4 commissioners , the speaker 4 and legislature 4 then , they in tern , keep anointing Peter , over , and over , and over again .
If that is n’t a racket , a shell game … what do you call it ?
I call it time for Term Limits .
You serve a term , or two - just like the president … then thank you , and buh - bye !
Protection of the environment and protecting our human rights guaranteed under the constitution ought not be at odds with each other , they support each other , and need each other to survive .
Douglas has cunningly put them at odds and uses it to wage class warfare .
- Richard Oshen , Filmmaker
People are inseparable from the land … although the Triple C is trying real hard .
Americans have the constitutional right to own property , Mr. Douglas .
ALL their property … and to be secure on that property .
Property Rights is not a privilege like a drivers license - it is an inalienable right .
Mr. Douglas , it seems , does not like the idea of we the people owning land at all , yet he owns land … and a house .
Property and property rights are what separates free men from serfs and indentured servants .
Take away the right to own land and be secure on it and people can never be secure .
Once upon a time , thirty plus years ago , it sounded like a good idea to isolate the CCC from the politics of politics .
The point is , over time , that seemingly “ good idea ” to isolate a regulatory commission from our democratic electoral process contributed mightily to its corruption and , along the way , made it subservient to its political patrons - not the people of the state of California .
- Richard Oshen , Filmmaker
Combining all three branches of government into one entity for “ expediency ” is a Kangaroo court .
It is what the coastal commission has become : writer of its own laws , enforcer of the laws they write , judge , jury , and executioner .
That is not America .
Who protects the people ?
Not the government of California - and certainly not the attorney general of the state .
T he attorney general is litigating the people on behalf of the Triple C to the tune of upwards of $ 2 billion dollars per year .
They are using our own money to fight us .
Where are the CCC ’s checks and balances ?
The answer , sadly , for all of us is … there are none .
A dysfunctional coastal commission handsomely benefited the big picture plan of certain self - interest Non Governmental Oragnizations to such a degree it appears the CCC is their de facto enforcer - the legal muscle in the service of the elite ones who secretly contribute to them - not the people of California .
Tom Hayden tried to break up this little PONZI SCHEME back in1988 , but it was soundly defeated by the same elitist interests that still pull the CCC ’s strings today .
Last year Senator Denise Ducheney introduced a bill that would prohibit the commission from appealing itself .
Which to this writer , sounds like a very normal thing to do - to prevent a commission from appealing itself
It too was squashed by these same NGOs and their elite supporters .
Where is the legislative oversight ?
There is much more to it …. the politics of fire … the devaluation of property , destruction of the family farm , more open space than we can afford , the destruction of infrastructure from lack of property taxes , people living in fear of retribution if they speak out .
The CCC is not the STASI .
When the governor of our state tell us education must be sacrificed because there is no money left , and you cast your eyes up to dark billowing clouds of smoke , and expensive leased aircraft zooming overhead , when a fleet of weed - wackers could have prevented all or most of it - you begin to see the huge scope of the disaster by these Pirates of California .
The tyranny by small imperceptible changes that has been obscured for the last 30 + years comes into focus and once seemingly isolated dots connect .

Yes , well past time for Mr Douglas to go - but to go not because someone is anti this , and someone else is pro that , but because no one is above the law .
It is time we , the people of California get down to the business of determining the Coastal Commission ’s next chapter post Douglas and whether we repair or replace the California Coastal Commission .
It is time for a change in California .
Time to breathe fresh air into a stale decadent demagoguery .
General Motors held on to their self righteous beliefs to the very end .
We can not afford to .
The future of California hangs in the balance .

On Monday , after nine days of racing and hundreds of kilometers , we stopped .
We rested .
For some , the rest day simply comes and goes .
For others , it disturbs the rhythm of the race .
But for most , it is a time to relax , to talk with our families , to laugh with our teammates , to nap and , more than anything else , to disconnect from the Tour de France .
On a rest day we have the luxury of being in the same hotel for consecutive nights , a rare occurrence on the Tour .
The rest - day program is often simple : a short ride with the team and interviews with reporters , and the rest of the day is ours .
Naturally , we hope and pray that the rest - day hotel is a five - star joint .
We ’re cyclists ; we do n’t ask for much .
Good food , free wireless and comfortable beds make us happy .
But we drew the short straw on this one , and our rest - day hotel was a step above camping .
Luckily for us , our chefs , Sean and Laura , made it seem better than a stay at the Peninsula .
Well , almost .

As the saying goes , the way to a man ’s heart is through his stomach , and that is especially true for cyclists .
Because of Sean and Laura , the initial disappointment in our rest - day hotel was countered with meals of curry rice and chicken , heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella , paella and Monday night ’s feast of potato salad and barbecue turkey legs .
There ’s nothing like returning from a ride to the smell of sweet barbecue .
It feels like home .
Internet radio , once on its deathbed , is likely to survive after all .
On Tuesday , after a two - year battle , record labels and online radio stations agreed on new royalty rates that cover music streaming .
Many of the music sites had argued that the old rates were so high that they were being forced out of business .
That could have come back to haunt the record labels , since for many people the sites are becoming a useful way to discover music .
“ This is definitely the agreement that we ’ve been waiting for , ” said Tim Westergren , the founder of Pandora , one of the most popular Internet radio sites with 30 million registered users .
In 2007 a federal royalty board ruled that all so - called webcasters needed to pay a fee , set to increase to 0.19 cent a song next year , each time they streamed a song for a listener .

That 's My Kid Too
The real science is obvious and overwhelming .
Vaccines do n't cause Autism .
Mercury in vaccines did n't cause Autism .
Jenny McCarthy 's son was vaccinated after mercury was removed from the MMR ( measles , mumps , rubella ) vaccine .
Autism rates have n't dropped as a result of mercury being removed from vaccines .
Autism rates are the same in vaccinated and non-vaccinated kids .
There are big studies around the world showing this to be true .
They are the best science we have and science is our only hope in solving this .
Chip Denman said it best , ( Forgive my paraphrasing ) " Science is not a smorgasbord .
You do n't pick and choose what you want to believe .
You sit down and take what you 're served . "
Autism rates wo n't be changed by Jim Carrey or Jenny McCarthy but there will be dead and injured people as a result of their anti-vaccine campaign .
Some people claim there already are : jennymccarthybodycount.com
Read about measles , mumps and rubella and the damage they did before vaccines .
We 've forgotten the damage these diseases and others brought before vaccines .
Ask your grandmother .
If we stop the vaccines the Center for Disease Control thinks we 'll have 2.7 million deaths worldwide annually from measles alone .
That said , we can't blame the parents of autistic children for their frustration .
Having a child with these problems is incredibly difficult .
It 's heartbreaking .
It 's maddening .
It 's not fair .
You really want to blame someone or something .
I know , ( Cue the violins ) I 've got a son with Autism .
Cut the violins .
I 'm crazy for him .
He 's the greatest kid ever .
As for the movie trailer : Personal anecdotes are not science but they sure look compelling on screen .
It 's exciting to see people mad and yelling and trying to save their kids .
Most of them have nothing but the best intentions but they 've fallen for a scam .
Oddly enough , there IS a conspiracy .
The vaccine scare is a known and well documented scam started by people wanting to make money off the growing Autism panic .
It 's not hard to find the names of the people who started this and you can read about their motivations .
It 's somehow funny to me that there is a conspiracy and that the people shouting about the conspiracy are standing on the wrong side but that 's probably just me .
You see that part towards the end of the movie trailer where parents are talking about the improvements they 're seeing in their children ?
That 's my kid 's story too .
He is in a regular school , in a regular 3rd grade class , and he 's keeping up with the other kids .
He laughs and plays .
He tells us he loves us .
We did n't change his diet or put him through dancing witch doctor cures .
We spend a lot of time teaching him the things he needs to learn .
We taught him to look at people when they talk to him and a zillion other things that kids should do naturally .
The improvements are amazing .
We 're lucky that way .
Diet and detox be damned , I 'm pretty sure this is the one thing all of those parents in the film who are claiming the great improvements did .
I need to say that I do n't think I love my kid more or spent more time than those people whose children have n't improved .
Autism is weird and complicated .
I think we 're no closer to understanding why some kids improve and others do n't than we are to knowing what causes it .
We need science to help these kids .
It 's going to take a lot of money and scientists and those " oh so evil " drug companies to pay for the studies .
I hope they find a pill that helps and that they get rich off it .

Wolfram Alpha What Google 's New Rival Knows -- and Doesn't

WASHINGTON  As a New York money manager and investment banker at four Wall Street firms , Charles E. F. Millard never reached superstar status .
But he was treated like one when he arrived in Washington in May 2007 , to run the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , the federal agency that oversees $ 50 billion in retirement funds .
BlackRock , one of the world ’s largest money - management firms , assigned a high school classmate of Mr. Millard ’s to stay in close contact with him , and it made sure to place him next to its legendary founder , Laurence D. Fink , at a charity dinner at Chelsea Piers .
A top executive at Goldman Sachs frequently called and sent e-mail messages , inviting Mr. Millard out to the Mandarin Oriental and the Ritz - Carlton in Washington , even helping him hunt for his next Wall Street job .
Both firms were hoping to win contracts to manage a chunk of that $ 50 billion .
The extensive wooing paid off when a selection committee of three , including Mr. Millard , picked BlackRock and Goldman from among 16 bidders to manage nearly $ 1.6 billion and to advise the agency , which Mr. Millard ran until January .
But on July 20 , the agency permanently revoked the contracts with BlackRock , Goldman and JPMorgan Chase , the third winner , nullifying the process .
The decision was based on questions surrounding Mr. Millard ’s actions during the formal bidding process .
His actions have also drawn the scrutiny of Congressional investigators and the agency ’s inspector general .
Moments go by and the teens continue to mill around .
One of them stuffs candy into his pockets as the girl blocks him from the view of the employee , who had moved back behind the glass - encased counter .
" It was horrible , " she said .
" My whole life had to change , and I could n't do anything for myself any more .
The hardest thing is that people kept thinking I was man , and calling me sir , which really annoys me .
I try to dress in feminine clothes and wear make - up to look nice , but it 's really hard when you 're my size . "
Two years later in 2005 , the hormone levels again began to soar , and Tanya 's mum sought out a second specialist who discovered the tumour had grown again and was now the size of an orange .
When fees masquerade as privileges
Late last year , I received an offer my credit union did n't want me to refuse .
To reward me for being a good customer for about 20 years , it wanted “ to give me one less thing to worry about . ”
Immediately , I began to worry .
The more I read , the more red flags I saw .
The credit union , which is in Dallas , automatically enrolled me in something called “ Overdraft Privilege . ” Red Flag No. 1 : Beware banks offering privileges for which you did n't ask .
Overdraft protection is a banking euphemism for a fee grab , and it 's becoming common practice .
As the recession has eroded banks ' lending profits , they 've sought to make up the difference by increasing fees on everything from ATM transactions to credit cards .
But overdraft exploitation is becoming their most lucrative as well as their most egregious and predatory practice .
My credit union 's program was pretty typical .
I could overdraw my account by as much as $ 800 , yet be spared “ the embarrassment of having an item returned unpaid , additional merchant penalty fees and the inconvenience that comes with bouncing a check . ”
Red Flag No. 2 : I 've never bounced a check , and I have a savings account linked to my checking account to cover such a problem if I ever do .
Why would I want this service ?
Well , if I did n't want it , I had to call and have it removed .
Red Flag No. 3 : The opt - out clause — the favored ploy of phone companies , credit card issuers and other masters of customer abuse .
It 's their way of saying , “ We do n't believe you would actually buy this service , so we wo n't give you choice . ”
I put the notice under the electron microscope and read the fine print , which set off Red Flags No. 4 , 5 , and 6 .
“ Overdraft Privilege ” was actually a line of credit .
Every time I overdrafted , I received the privilege of paying a $ 33 service fee .
The fee could be increased at the credit union 's discretion , and , of course , all disputes would be resolved through arbitration .
The letter also contained a halfhearted disclaimer : Overdraft Privilege was designed “ to cover you in the event of a haphazard mistake — not to encourage careless spending . ”
Red Flag No. 7 : the bold - faced lie from the marketing department .
Careless spending is , of course , exactly what it encourages .
It was n't protection , it was the seeds of a debt spiral in which fee would stack upon fee .
The more careless I was , the more money the credit union would collect .
I called the next day and opted out .
Many depositors , though , apparently do n't .
Fees for insufficient funds and overdraft protection generated about $ 35 billion for banks last year , according to a study by Bretton Woods , a management advisory firm that 's studied the issue for a decade .
Texas institutions alone collected $ 3.2 billion , more than most other states .
Overdraft fees run as high as $ 38 , with the median being $ 27 per transaction , according to a report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released in November .
The report found that not only were the fees among the most common , they tended to occur on the smallest transactions — the median dollar value among the nation 's largest banks was a mere $ 20 .
In other words , the banks are charging more in fees than the overdraft itself .
On an annualized basis , the interest rate for a $ 27 fee on a $ 20 transaction would be more than 3,500 percent .
And of course the fees fall hardest on those with the least financial literacy , affecting low - income customers and young adults the most , the report found .
More than three - fourths of banks have such a program and , like my credit union , enroll customers automatically , according to the FDIC .
All of which means overdraft protection is n't a privilege or a convenience .
It 's a racket — protection only in the way that Tony Soprano would use the word .

Lessons in Buddhism from an iconoclastic scholar By Ajay Singh , UCLA Today , Feb 27 , 2009 Berkeley , CA ( USA ) --
As one of the world ’s leading authorities on Buddhism , Gregory Schopen has shattered many myths , notably the notion that Buddhist monks in ancient India renounced money and property .
<< Gregory Schopen :
In his Faculty Research Lecture on March 10 , Gregory Schopen hopes to illuminate a little - known aspect of Buddhism : the fact that it was one of the earliest social organizations in India to develop what might be called a corporation .

While his painstaking research certainly helped Schopen demystify monasticism in the land of Buddhism ’s birth , he owes his remarkable academic success not so much to scholarship but to his grandfather , a cowboy in South Dakota .
“ He told me something that I ’ve never forgotten and which , though it seems very simple , has governed my entire scholarly life , ” said Schopen , a specialist in Indian Buddhist Studies who chairs the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures .
“ He said , ‘ Do n’t pay too much attention to what people say , but watch what they do , ’ and that , in some ways , is all I ’ve done . ”
Take the still - popular stereotype about destitute monks .
Ignoring scholarship that stressed their unworldly ways , Schopen studied ancient Indian inscriptions , which record gifts made to Buddhist monasteries , and established that more than 50 percent of the donors were monks .
“ Now , if they had given up their money , how could they do this ? ” said Schopen .
He ’s one of those rare Buddhism scholars who has the linguistic training to decipher not just ancient texts but inscriptional and archaeological evidence as well .
Well - versed in Sanskrit , Prakrit , Pali and Tibetan , Schopen probably knows more about classical Buddhism than the entire line of reincarnated Dalai Lamas , and it ’s no wonder that his work has significantly altered the way other religions are studied .
On March 10 , Schopen will deliver the 106th Faculty Research Lecture on a topic that ought to resonate with anyone concerned about the global economic slump : “ The Buddha as a Businessman : Economics and Law in an Old Indian Religion . ”
A prestigious forum for celebrating the diverse academic talents of UCLA ’s faculty , the lecture will be held at the Freud Playhouse .
In his talk , Schopen hopes to illuminate a little - known aspect of Buddhism : the fact that it was one of the earliest social organizations in India to develop what might be called a corporation .
“ In terms of Indian history , the Buddhists were the first to do this , ” said Schopen .
“ And they had to work out all sorts of problems that have a lot in common with modern corporate law . ”
Ancient Indian Buddhists , for example , dealt with such issues as how they could own property and whether an order of monks was a legal entity , added Schopen , pointing out that Wall Street has much to learn from the Buddha , who instructed his monks 2,500 years ago not to make unsecured loans .
Schopen first became interested in Buddhism while growing up in South Dakota .
His tiny hometown , Deadwood , had its own Chinatown , and he spent a lot of time in the local museum looking at Chinese and Buddhist artifacts .
“ I was very young when I saw this stuff and wondered what it was , ” Schopen recalled , adding with a laugh : “ I ’m still trying to find out exactly what it ’s all about . ”
He ’s in no hurry .
A field that ’s as rich as it is narrow , Indian Buddhism offers much to stoke Schopen ’s curiosity – and he has the good fortune of being able to pursue his intellectual interests without actually experiencing any of the stresses and strains of traveling to India .
In fact , he ’s never been to India .
“ It ’s an oddity , ” he admitted , explaining why : “ The Buddhist tradition , which has always been my focus , largely disappeared from India starting around the 11th century . ”
Instead , Schopen has spent quite a bit of time in Japan “ because I want to see how Buddhism works in a culture – among real people , ” he said .
Schopen finds the widespread Western fascination with Buddhism “ highly artificial and a little bit silly because it takes place completely in the abstract . ”
The average Westerner is not interested in the “ totality of what Buddhism is – a way of interacting and being human – but with a certain set of free - floating ideas that have been connected with Buddhism , ” he explained , adding : “ I have a problem with that . ”
One of his favorite images of Buddhism as it ’s practiced in America is from a photograph of devotees in a Thai Buddhist temple in Los Angeles : “ All the local Thai people are doing worship to the Buddha image in the front ; in the back is a whole row of white guys meditating , ” said Schopen .
“ These are completely different approaches to the same phenomenon – the picture is worth a thousand words . ”
By any measure , Schopen is an iconoclast .
A Taiwanese newspaper once described him as an “ exceptionally rare species – an academic who writes not only lucidly but also eloquently , charmingly , and very often wittily . ”
And the fact that he has n’t written any books – just articles and papers compiled into texts – makes Schopen all the more exceptional .
So how has he survived academia ’s ruthless “ publish or perish ” environment ?
“ I have a very healthy respect for my own ignorance , ” he said with characteristically Buddhist humility , adding that “ we know so little about most of this stuff that it seems irresponsible to make large , sweeping statements in large , sweeping books . ”
Besides , he quipped , “ I ’m also deeply suspicious of intellectuals , which is a little bit ironic since I am one . ”
The fact that Schopen won the esteemed MacArthur Award in 1985 has surely cemented his reputation as an outstanding scholar any university would be proud of .
“ It changed the way people approached me and probably made my academic career somewhat smoother , ” he admitted .
“ But I ’ve always done pretty much what I ’ve wanted to do , ” he added , “ and that , too , I got from my grandfather . ”

Stormy Daniels , the porn star who is mulling a Senate run in Louisiana against Sen.
David Vitter , wants to get together with Sarah Palin .
“ As a woman who is often criticized and dismissed by the media , I obviously can relate to Governor Palin on many levels , ” Daniels said in a statement .
“ Given this , I am very interested to hear what she has to say about the challenges women like ourselves who are not afraid to display our sexuality face when it comes to being taken seriously as leaders . ”
Also , she hopes for a sit - down with Palin in August .
“ I am planning to hold to my timetable of making an official announcement at the end of the summer , " she said .
" So it is my hope that Governor Palin and I can have a chance to sit down sometime in August . ”
She adds : " People tend to try and trivialize values issues as somehow not as important as other issues , ” Daniels said .
“ But if our values are not backed by the responsibility to make the tough choices and to understand the consequences of our actions then we are doomed to failure as a society . "
It 's “ only through the exercise of personal responsibility can we prevent government from impinging on our rights and intruding in our lives , ” Daniels said .
“ I am looking forward to taking the opportunity to discuss with Governor Palin -- as one strong woman to another -- how we can best restore responsibility to our families and to our nation . ”
No word from the Palin camp if Palin has accepted -- or plans to accept -- or not .
( Also , did you know that Daniels regularly describes herself as " pro-condom " ? )

I know a woman who stripped her way through college .
Shes now a corporate headhunter , pulling down a six figure annual salary , shes married , and shes got a kid .
Her story , as they say , ends happily ever after .
Sadly , she ’s the only stripper I ’ve ever “ known ” ( and not in the Biblical sense , either ) .
Sure , Ive ENCOUNTERED many an exotic dancer back in the day , but I ca n’t say I ’ve ever really known them any better than , say , the guy who delivers my pizza .
And that ’s not its because I believe I ’m too good to get friendly with a stripper ; quite the contrary .
I ’ve just always imagined there are lines an exotic dancer does n’t want crossed ; some fat dork from Jersey asking “ You wanna grab lunch some time ? ” might be just the sorta line - crossing I ’d imagine they ’re uncomfortable with .
However , I have n’t frequented a strip club since “ Strutters ” in Long Branch , circa ’ 89 / ’90 , with Big Bry .
“ Strutters ” was a juice bar , which meant the performers ( oh , who am I kidding ?
the chicks who get their kit off ) would get labia - dangling naked , because there was no booze on the premises .
What a wild , wonderful world it was to discover …
For about a month .
Then , Bry and I got tired of giving away hard - earned cash just to look at naked ladies .
Mind you , these were the days before the internet ( when the options one had to look at nude women you were n’t involved with were limited ) and long before I ’d ever marry ( at which point , I got to see a naked lady for free regularly AND do stuff with her ) , but that first glimpse at a Live Nude Girl clutching a brass pole with her thighs to the beat of “ I Remember You ” still lingers in my cabeza .
Oddly enough , it ’s not the ladies who made it all so memorable , but rather the dudes jockeying the stage
Beyond the standard “ Do n’t touch unless you ’re TOLD to touch ” there ’s no universal etiquette for a strip club .
After the condom on the banana demonstration , you ’re not handed a manual in Health class entitled “ How to Conduct Yourself and Not Be Creepy at the Peelers ” , so behavioral patterns in da club range from guy - to - guy .
Bry and I were the “ We - like - to - see - brown - and - pink - eyes - up - close - but - don’t - need - to - slide - the -back-of-our-palms-across - your - lips - while - you - accept - our - cash ” types ; we were there to get our freak on in the most civilized way possible .
Show us your meat curtains , yes , but regard us with enough intelligence to know that you have zero interest in us beyond the exchange of currency for this privilege .
We were happy to hand the dancers our tips , rather than make the bill exchange from lips to cleavage , or worse , from fingers to vag / ass .
There was no seduction necessary , because we did n’t buy into the fantasy – which is probably why we never became regulars .
Both of us knew that , in the real world , none of these foin , foin ladies would take a leak on us if we were on fire at their feet in a public toilet after their water pill just kicked in , so we could n’t pretend that the furtive glances and come - hither eye contact was anything more than role - playing .
And if I want to enter a magical world of make - believe , I ’ll watch old “ Mr. Rogers ’ Neighborhood ” episodes .
While in Strutters , Bry and I spent as much time looking at our fellow patrons as we did looking at pussy .
There were the OPEC Guidos – the Italian dudes whose hair was slicked back with so much oil that , fuck Iraq – Bush should ’ve went to war on these dudes ’ heads .
There were the OP ’s – the guys who came solo , who I always imagined stepping up to the ticket counter at a movie theater and sighing “ One , Please . ”
There were the Thread - Bares – the fellas who accepted so many lap - dances that their pants looked like they belonged to the Michael Palin ’s prisoner character in the opening credits of “ Monty Python ’s Flying Circus ” , as he hangs from chains on a dungeon wall , uttering “ It’s … ”
But the most fascinating category of strip - clubbers we used to obsess over were the True Believers – the guys who bought into the myth , and seemed to seriously believe they had a shot with these women once “ Girls , Girls , Girls ” ended .
I ’m sure that , if they ever noticed me gawking at them , the True Believers would ’ve assumed I was into cock – so intense was my fascinated gaze .
But I never had to worry about being caught studying them , as they never …
NEVER took their eyes off the prize , man .
These dudes were locked onto their targets – whichever girl was on the catwalk at the moment – like a NORAD - programmed ICB .
This would reach a height of utter disturbance when the ladies finally worked their way over to the fellas in question .
The fucking eye contact was so intense , you ’d almost buy that there was a Chuck - Woolery - level love connection in their future .
But then you ’d look at the parties involved – a tanning - bed frequenting , twenty - something gorgeous Goddess , decked out in fuck - me pumps and clothes that ’d do the Emperor proud , and a thirty year old Indian - American in thick specs , thinning , black - matted hair matching that of his Father , who , incidentally , was seated beside him , also macking on the stripper with a grin that ’d make Mola Ram in “ Temple of Doom ” look like Ghandi – and realize that the “ Pretty Woman ” paradigm only works if the guy with the cash doling out strawberries is Richard Gere .
On the night of our second - to - last visit to Strutters , Bry and I took the opportunity to talk to one of the dancers about their Oscar - worthy performances with some of the least desirable - looking men in Monmouth County .
The woman in question sauntered over to us , wearing an addled expression , asking if either of us were interested in a lap dance .
“ You seem upset ? ” I observed .
“ That prick over there just stuck his finger in my asshole , ” she replied .
“ Like right IN it ? ” Bry asked .
“ Can you believe it ?
What an animal . ”
Proving that chivalry was n’t dead , Bry immediately pushed twenty bucks into the woman ’s hands , saying “ Here – you deserve this . ”
“ Sit down , ” she said , getting into lap - dancing position .
“ No , that ’s cool , ” Bry countered .
“ I ’d rather just talk . ”
Somewhat surprised , the girl sat beside us at the bar .
We chatted for almost a half hour , inquiring about her life and what made he want to dance in the first place .
Periodically , Bry would hand our new friend another twenty bucks , guilt - ridden over the fact that one of our own gender would breach the girl ’s exhaust , uninvited , without so much as a “ By your leave ” .
We learned so much about the dancer ’s life in that half hour , but more than that , we learned that it was possible for the insanely beautiful to find a pair of trolls interesting .
I mean , here was this heavenly creature , engaged in a conversation with us , getting to know us not for what we could give her , but because we showed her a little human compassion in her hour of need .
We did n’t look at her like she was a pair of tits ( even though she was completely naked ) , and she did n’t look at us like we were those Hindi True Believers down the bar – one of whom who ’d been very forward with his pointer digit .
Before she had to head back to the stage for her set , we asked if she wanted to grab some late - night chicken salad at the Inkwell – the legendary Long Branch bohemian eatery with the dim lighting and the collegiate clientele that closed at 4 a.m .
She said she could n’t tonight , because the boss on duty was a real hard - ass about the girls leaving with patrons .
We shook hands , and she was off , heading to the stage .
Rather than have her see us as the kind of guys who ’d talk to her like human beings for half an hour only to ogle her while she worked the pole later on , Bry and I excused ourselves from Strutters and headed home , all - the - while discussing our newfound friend as well as the utter tragedy of the True Believers who thought for a minute that they were being treated with any degree of sincerity as they forked over their bills .
A week later , Bry and I went back to Strutters .
As we paid the cover charge , we saw our new friend onstage , pelvis - thrusting into some dope ’s face .
Rather than make her uncomfortable , we opted to hang out on a side couch ’ til her set was over , refusing the legion of lap dances offered to us by the ladies waiting for their sets .
When the girl got off stage , she offered us this very concerned look as she approached us .
We wondered if we ’d done something wrong by coming back to the club during her act , now that we were all friends and whatnot .
But as she joined us on the couch , she immediately dispelled that misconception in and oddly familiar way .
“ What ’s the matter ? ” Bry asked .
“ Some prick over there stuck his finger in my asshole , ” she offered , shaking her head .
“ What – again ? ” I inquired .
“ Is that like a frequent on - the - job hazard ? ”
“ What ? ” she yelled over the blaring music .
“ That Hindu guy did the same thing to you last week . ”
The girl nodded at me , a bit perplexed , and then said “ You guys want table dance ? ”
And then , it became clear that not only did the girl not remember us from the week before , but also that finger - in - the - asshole she ’d complained about probably did n’t happen either .
We ’d been played ; she ’d marked us as the wannabe - sensitive types who thought too much of themselves to gawk at gash and mash our faces into boobs .
We were too proud to behave like the standard clientele , and y’know what they say – “ Pride goeth before the fall . ”
And as we not only fell but plummeted toward the realization that we ’d been had , it dawned on me that somewhere in that bar , someone was looking at Bry and I and labeling us as the kinda guys who actually believed they were better than everyone else in the club , because they were sensitive and viewed the women as more than just business - types hell - bent for loot ; they saw the working girls as people who , given the chance , would rather have a conversation with them than thrust their Brazilians within an inch of their maw .
And the standard label for guys like that ?

It is a shame that some Americans are so gullible , to the outlandish propaganda and lies spat in the newspapers , television and radio about Obama ’s health care agenda .
They have demonized the British , Canadian and other worthy plans .
Hidden under a sub-rosa undercover , these radical entities are determined to keep the special interest organizations in absolute power .
Comprising of the money - draining profitable insurance companies and their rich stockholders .
They do n't want any changes to the broken system of medical care , because it will hurt the status quo .
I was born in England , in the county of Sussex and until the inception of the European Union and the European Parliament dictating to Britain .
That they must accept millions of foreign workers , the nations medical system was exemplary .
I never had to wonder if I would have to file bankruptcy , to pay my medical bills , or listen to the incessant ring of debt collectors on the phone .
On several occasions I ended up in the cottage hospital and their was never a cost applied to it , never a ream of paperwork .
No doctor , no hospital or specialist ask me for my Social Security number , drivers license or if I was covered by a predatory for - profit insurer .
Today the British Isles is being submerged under a barrage of legal and illegal immigrants , who have never paid into the system , have caused some rationing .
Prior to the importation of foreign labor my trips to doctor , to hospital , the eye or a dentist was paid from my taxation .
Unless we pass a national health care agenda , Americans will never know what it 's like to breeze through their lives , without worrying about paying for health care ?
Tell your Senators and Congressman you want an alternative to the -- GET RICH -- insurance companies , before a Universal health care is killed .
202-224-312 REMEMBER THE INVESTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS DON'T WANT THEIR PIECE OF THE $ $$ TRILLION$ $$ DOLLAR PIE DISTURBED .
EVEN SOME POLITICIANS
HAVE THEIR DIRTY FINGERS IN THE PIE ?
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE , A GOVERNMENT SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM WILL ASSIST IN REVITALIZING THE WILTING US ECONOMY .

All I know is I still have no health care .
Nothing ZERO .
My blood pressure is VERY VERY HIGH .
I 'm a veteran ( Albeit not of the current war ) , and I think nobody in government gives a fuck .
Not sure what Kucinich did or did n't did .
One man is n't going to fix the shit that exists as our representatives .
And uh while I might be responsible for my own health care , I can't afford it .
So I guess that means I either eventually hit the emergency room with some chronic preventable shit or I die .
This is kind of where I hate libertarians .
If I am going to die why not you too bitches ?
Cause you figured out how to make living ripping people off , makes you better than me ?
FUCK YOU .
I actually can't even understand what I am reading here .
So I hope it 's a good thing .
My health care plan goes like this .
( in my opinion ) but the fascist fuckwads want to rip us off .
So it can't be this simple .
I Hope you ALL DIE .

I think it was Saskatchewan .
A province in Canada was the first , and the whole country followed .
Why ?
Think about this : if Pennsylvania got single payer on the state level , businesses would relocate to Pa. because they would n't have to pay their workers health benefits .
Other states would lose business , so they would follow .
I think this is Dennis Kucinich 's strategy .
I heard about this strategy on the Pennsylvania state level , from our local Green Party rep .
Carl Romanelli .
There 's a lot happening at the state level as far as moving forward implementing single payer .
Correct me if I 'm wrong , but I heard about this strategy right from the horse 's mouth .

Phil , I hear ya !
It 's a SIN , a travesty , etc ... that any American is without health care .
We are NOT the great nation we think we are !
And anti-single payer is all propaganda .
It 's all propaganda by the rich and the health insurance companies .
Everyone wants it .
You 're better off not owning anything in this country unless you 're rich .
They 'll take it off you to pay for your medical bills .
Pretty soon they 'll start not accepting people at emergency rooms , people with no insurance 's only way to get treatment .
Hey , why not ?
What a country !
The BEST !
Everyone looking out for everyone else !
Or is it : I got mine , so FUCK you !
Or I 'm a politician getting kickbacks from health insurance lobbyists , so FUCK you !
We should dress like people from other countries , like Israelis , to get our taxpayer aid and use it for health coverage .
Imagine how much $ $$ we 're giving to foreign countries !
And millions of Americans have no health care coverage , and hundreds of millions have SHITTY coverage !
Do n't forget , SICKO was about Americans WITH health care coverage !

Big Dan - not to the " culture of life " crowd .
If the poor can not be cannon - fodder for the military - industrial complex , they have no economic value .
In urban areas , unemployment is way over 50 percent because the masses are only " human resources " for the corpocracy if they are buying cheap crap at walmart .
The jobs for these people are permanently GONE !
If folks are n't buying health insurance ( or having employers buy it ) , they are not " human resources " for the medical / health / insurance complex because no one is making excessive profits off their premiums nor utilizing overpriced services ( that the insurance company will try to deny anyhow ) .
When the repugs / blue dogs need votes from the ignorant masses , they trumpet wedge issues like abortion and " value voters . "
After the election , these politicians and special interests have nothing but disdain for the masses .
At least until the next time they need a wedge issue , like " socialism " .

The neocons have decided there is no need to provide healthcare for the masses .
For young and healthy young men and women , they can generate surplus value for the corpocracy by serving the military industrial complex as a human resource that exchanges blood for oil .
For others , healthcare is a waste - the next great “ breakthrough ” will be a growing appreciation of the efficiencies that result from the burning of humans as fuel .
This process allows the body 's organic matter to directly contribute to the economic growth of society without the thousands of years that are needed to convert organic matter into oil reserves .
The repugs / blue dogs are looking out for our well - being .
To economically prosper , America needs to burn the bodies of " undesirables " to fuel our economy .
Not only will there be benefits from harvesting the poor , infirmed , or elderly that result from the laws of thermo-science , the economic benefits and economies of scale that will result from consumption of humans for fuel make providing universal healthcare economically inefficient .
Until people become useless to the ruling class , they participate in our economic system adding to the creation of wealth through the surplus value of their wages ( if employed ) or to their contributions to either the military - industrial or the medical / health / insurance complex .
When their economic usefulness no longer serves the needs of the ruling elite , we convert the surplus value of their being into an energy commodity .
The powerful interests that will benefit from this economically efficient production cannot be stopped - just consider it another example of " the - invisible hand " that guides our economy slapping you in the face .

While I can appreciate the frustration with the status quo , I take exception to Phil 's " one man 's not going to fix the [ smelly , brown sticky substance ] " in reference to Dennis Kucinich and to Another Joe 's " The powerful interests ... cannot be stopped ... "
Pessimism is self - defeating .
Consider the observations of historian Howard Zinn in A Power Governments Cannot Suppress :
There is a basic weakness in governments , however massive their armies , however vast their wealth , however they control images and information , because their power depends on the obedience of citizens , of soldiers , of civil servants , of journalists and writers and teachers and artists .
When the citizens begin to suspect they have been deceived and withdraw their support , government loses its legitimacy and its power .
You are right Phil , one man ( Kucinich ) by himself cannot make a difference .
But the informed masses of the American people can make all the difference .
Educate yourselves ; educate others ; get involved !
In this instance , if you feel strongly about single - payer health care , contact PDA , learn about its " Healthcare NOT Warfare " Campaign , find out what you can do to help , learn which representatives support single - payer , which have sold out to the bogus " public option " plan ; support and work for candidates like Marcy Winograd who will take on not only the neocons but corporate America .

Ernie – not a pessimist , just tellin ’ ya , this is AMERICAN CAPTIALISM !
The healthcare system is simply the result of free markets
As long as workers make a net contribution to the general economic good , then market forces of supply and demand will gravitate towards equilibrium where those workers will live because price the free market places on economically productive workers will be higher than the demand for their death .
Those that have ( 1 ) .
Health insurance can be productive assets to the medical / health / insurance industrial complex . ( 2 ) .
Those that are young and health enough to be productive assets to the military - industrial complex will naturally find their highest and best use there .
Other humans will be “ harvested ” and converted into energy to run our cars , heat the rest of our homes , and provide for an expanding , hi-tech lifestyle .
When workers , medical / health / insurance industrial complex assets , or military - industrial complex fodder are no longer is making net contributions to the general economic good , then market forces will move price towards equilibrium where these depreciated assets will die because the price of that depreciated asset will be less than the free market price for that mass of bio-energy economic .
They key is that we eliminate all government interference with these natural , God - given market forces .
The “ Ownership Society ” will remove all of the Marxist forces and socialistm .
When we allow free markets to determine the relative net worth of each individual based on : ( 1 ) .
Each person ’s accumulation of wealth , and ( 2 ) .
Contribution to the general economic good ; then we will be allowing God ’s “ invisible hand ” to fairly and objectively assess each person ’s right to live .
In other words , we will be handing the “ design ” of our society back to the “ intelligent designer . ”
Of course , God ’s will reaches globally , so we will need to create a more equitable balance between the net providers of labor , military - industrial , and medical / health / insurance industrial complexes .
We need to prevent immigration and allow the demand for each individual to reflect the economies of scale within each divinely created boundary .
If we immediately deport or lock up all illegal immigrants , that will correct market distortions in the supply and demand .
This , in turn , will insure that those human beings that the free market determines to be “ surplus lives ” to be distributed across global boundaries consistent with global plans .
Not only will this restore market forces , but it will tend to accelerate the elimination of excess populations , starting with the world ’s poorest nations .
While increasing our supply of energy will be an important outcome of these new market policies regarding the value of life , perhaps most importantly , these forces will allow the oligopoly that God has created to control our energy , defense , and medical needs to maintain increasing profits .
This , in turn , will place downward pressures on the value of depreciated human resources , more fully assuring that mother earth will be able to provide for the economic needs of the world ’s affluent and elite .
Perhaps subsidizing the existence of the poor made sense under “ compassionate conservative ” principles from earlier times .
Clearly , with the ability to convert human bodies to high quality energy resources , we can avoid the costly proposition of exchanging human blood for oil .
The public expenditures for the military represent a government subsidy for an inefficient energy market .
The capitalists that own the war machine can continue endless wars without doing so for energy .
The military - industrial complex , if freed from the shackles of securing energy and more fully maximize profits and more efficiently harvest the global population of depreciated human resources .
It is time to wring the last socialist subsidies out of our economy and allow free markets to more fully determine who will inherit the earth and who will not be able to pass into the Kingdom of Heaven through the eye of a needle .
Of course , more tax - breaks for the wealthy and eliminating the “ Paris Hilton ” tax will a much more viable strategy for economic growth and a jobless recovery than wasting scarce resources on healthcare for depreciated human assets .

You can be sure that I am not attacking Kucinich .
One of the only TWO Senators I trust .
I am simply saying that two Senators are not going to fight and win against all the fascist Senators .
And I doubt Ron Paul ( the second Senator I trust ) is for Health Care , since Libertarians do n't want government providing anything but defense and what the Constitution says .
There 's some cracks in that description --- but since I was a Libertarian and left because they did n't give a crap about electronic vote tabulation devices , I left .
I am saying the complex charts out there should be simplified .
You live ,
You pay tax , the tax pays for health care .
It 's a closed loop , if the cost goes up the tax goes up to match the cost .
The moment you inject insurance , you have just made dirty tricks be the end result e.g.
Expensive Health Care when Terminal / Chronic crap creeps in .
or No Health Care at all .
No Health Care at all is what I have now .
Actually since 1985 .
;o )
So I 've heard plenty of shit out there over the years , but no action .
Pessimism is a poor description .
Frustration and Anger is more like it .
And no accountability with the ongoing shituation with the media + electronic voting + broken chain of custody + caging +
Oh hell ..
I 'm done explaining myself .
And I do n't think my ASCII chart was a representation of Single Payer Health Care .
I do n't even know that I believe that 's the best thing .
I think like I said , You pay tax , the tax should keep the people healthy .
Call that whatever the fuck you want .
I call it common sense and basic humanity 101 .
When you try to make a profit , logic is replaced with fuzzy math and we end up like we are now with $ 65 Trillion Sucked into the Ether .
Nice that the banks are making a profit , too bad that profit is n't paying for OTHER BAILOUTS .
It 's comming down to a super bubble .
Since they still have n't fixed the root problem of the markets monetary system .
Overleveraging the fractional reserve .
Already loans are being taken out to build .
You'd think we'd need to sell the existing foreclosed homes first would n't ya ?
na ... I am not a pesimist .
I am pissed off constitutionalist and do n't see officials responding at all , just breaking their oaths .
So is socialized heal care right for you ?
It is for me .
Until we actually follow the Constitution again .
We no longer live in a Constitutional Republic --- if you have n't noticed , perhaps it 's time to notice .

We have a tendency in America to argue for or against a concept based on our own personal philosophy or view of the world , what advances our personal interests , or the interests of our party , family , organization , or region .
Perhaps viewing the issue from a management or systemic perspective might result in innovative approaches to the issue .
The American national mindset , citizen philosophy , lack of citizen motivation to be proactively healthy , and governance model make the socialization of health care in America very problematic , particularly at this point in time .
A country needs to know its limitations .

There were those that thought abolishing slavery was " problematic " .
There were those that thought allowing women to vote was " problematic " .
There were those that thought eradicating polio and small pox was " problematic " .
There are those that thought paying a fair wage was " problematic "
But those got done anyway .
I said all that to say ... that some things , as difficult as they may seem to be are WORTH the effort anyway .
Providing health care should n't be done because it 's easy to do ... it should be done because it 's the HUMANE thing to do .
Would you want to face a cancer diagnosis without decent insurance ?
America has reached it 's limitations of consumerist , corporate , me and only me , how much does it cost non-sense .
Now it 's time to be human again and find ways to employ the unemployed , care for the ill and house the homeless .
It 's what 's human ... I could care less about your systems analysis .

Germany 's far - right National Democratic party ( NPD ) has triggered outrage with plans for a Third Reich - style " training centre " in a small village .
The mastermind of the scheme is Jürgen Rieger , a lawyer and deputy leader of the anti-immigrant , anti-EU party that is steeped in pride for Adolf Hitler and the " achievements " of the Nazi regime .
The idea is for the old Hotel Gerhus at Fassberg , near Hanover , to become a place of pilgrimage for NPD devotees , where they can learn about the " menace " of immigration , the " criminality " of Roma gypsies and the " innate decency of law - abiding German nationalists " .
Mr Rieger , 61 , has also tried to open Boys From Brazil - style " breeding centres " in other locations ; the plan being for all white , Ayran racists like himself to produce offspring to people the Fourth Reich , which he believes is coming one day .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The abandoned hotel went into receivership 24 hours before Mr Rieger signed a 10 - year lease on it with the debt - ridden owners .
The receiver , Jens Wilhelm , had hoped to be granted an order this week to force the neo - Nazis off the property , but a court rejected his move .
It means Mr Rieger and the NPD are there until another court hearing can be convened .
His refusal to give up his plan is likely to cause a furore in Fassberg .
Left - wing , anti-Nazi groups are already promising marches that would inevitably lead to violence near the 80 - room property .
A foretaste came at the weekend when shots were fired near the hotel and young people from the left and right faced off with pepper sprays and batons .
Police have mobilised 24 - hour patrols .
Mr Rieger is also trying to open a museum in Wolfsburg dedicated to the Nazi leisure organisation Strength Through Joy .
The NPD has about 7,000 members and lawmakers sitting in regional parliaments , but none in the Bundestag .
Four very different Irish - American brothers - Kevin , Jimmy , Tommy and Sean - have sworn to live by the code of " family first . "
But as they become increasingly involved in the ruthless world of New York organized crime , their loyalties to their friends , to their loved ones , and especially to each other will be put to the ultimate test .

In our exclusive interview , he wanted to explain why he filed for Chapter 11 this week , which stopped a planned foreclosure of the mansion scheduled for today .
" Bottom line ... this case is about bank fraud , " he says .
We are posting the entire interview .
To understand certain parts , here is a thumbnail sketch of what Dykstra claims happened .
He says when he bought Wayne Gretzky 's estate two years ago , a broker from Washington Mutual promised him a single $ 17.5 million loan , but delivered only $ 12.5 million .
Dykstra says he was urged to go get a second $ 8 million mortgage , to complete the $ 17.5 million and allow him to have some extra cash , as the house , Dykstra says , appraised for $ 25 million .
Dykstra says the broker promised he could refinance both mortgages into one affordable payment after 60 days .
But the baseball legend claims the mortgage broker disappeared .
There was no re-fi .
Meantime , he was paying close to $ 200,000 a month in mortgages , and his income was only $ 125,000 , that money coming from a promissory note he received after selling his car wash business .
Unable to continue paying more than he was making , Dykstra says he was forced to sell the promissory note back to the owners of the car wash to pay off the second mortgage .
That erased his nest egg , he says .
Dykstra refused to talk about Index Investors , which , as we reported yesterday , is the company actually moving to foreclose on his mansion , saying Dykstra owes $ 910,000 .
Dykstra is suing Index and its owner , Jeff Smith , for violating state usury laws , among other claims .
Finally , Dykstra says he is 111 - 0 in making good stock market bets , though he would not say how much money he 's making .
And when I asked him where he plans to be financially in a year , he said , " I 'll be living the dream . "
Lenny Dykstra 's attorney , Jon Hayes , says that the baseball legend 's assets far exceed the $ 0 - $ 50,000 listed in the emergency Chapter 11 filing .
" Lenny has not filed his property schedules yet , and therefore the computer defaulted on the statistical box of the first page of the petition at zero , " Hayes says .
He added that the property schedules are due in two weeks .
" I expect them to show assets exceeding $ 50 million , " Hayes says .
But if they are $ 50 million , and debts are $ 31 million , leaving a net worth of $ 19 million , can you file for bankruptcy ?
Hayes says it 's very common to do so .
" We filed to stop the foreclosure . "
THE effect of Barack Obama 's rhetoric on the Middle East is one of the most important , fascinating and utterly elusive elements in geo-strategic considerations at the moment .
I find myself veering between Obama - youthful optimism that he really is speaking to the Muslim masses in a way that matters , and world - weary cynicism that has to ask : " Where 's the beef , Jack ? "
If Obama produces beneficial change through inspirational leadership , his rhetoric will be seen as among the most powerful words in history .
On the other hand , if he says all this beautiful stuff and nothing happens and he does n't do anything about it , he will have been just the crooner who distracted the world with sweet serenades while it declined into peril and possibly misery .
But this is a column about a more modest subject .
One of the few absolutely concrete , no - compromise demands Obama has made of any state is his call for an end to Jewish settlements in the Palestinian West Bank .
Obama 's Cairo speech was uncompromising : Jewish settlements in the West Bank must stop .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been equally tough .
There is no exception for " natural growth " or anything else : settlements must stop .
This is about as clear as mud , and your humble correspondent is merely one among millions who cannot make out quite what these words actually mean .
Their political purpose is clear .
Obama is showing the Muslims that he can be tough on Israel , too .
But I do not know what the practical purpose of the words are .
Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last Sunday responded to Obama 's speech with his own declaration : " We have no intention of building new settlements or expropriating additional land for existing settlements . "
That strikes me as reasonable .
Israel will occupy no more Palestinian land for settlements .
But Netanyahu 's position allows for natural growth and for all the growth now planned , while Obama 's people give the impression they are against this .
A clue to the confusion , and perhaps the double and triple game the Obama administration is playing , lies in the refusal of US spokesmen to say what " an end to Israeli settlements " means .
Does " no natural growth " mean that if one mother in a settlement has a baby , then another person in the same settlement has to move out ?
That 's nonsense as it could not be measured or enforced .
Understanding the confusion requires two pieces of background .
The settlements grew after the 1967 war , the second war Israel fought with Arab armies bent on its destruction .
As a result of the war , Israel reunified Jerusalem and formally annexed some of the city 's neighbourhoods into Israel proper .
It also set up settlements in strategic locations on Palestinian land .
There are three types of settlers .
Fairly secular Jews who just want cheap housing live in big settlement blocs that are in effect suburbs of Jerusalem .
Most of these settlers live close to the 1967 borders .
Then there are the ultra-Orthodox Jews of Jerusalem , many of whom do n't work and also need cheap housing .
They , too , generally live very close to the 1967 border .
Finally there are the ideological Zionists who believe in the biblical claims of Jews to Judea and Samaria , the Jewish names for the West Bank .
They live mainly in settlements deep inside Palestinian land .
Some live , provocatively , in the middle of Palestinian population centres .
Some are official settlements and others are illegal ( under Israeli law ) outposts .
Almost all mainstream Israelis agree that the illegal outposts will be uprooted the minute there is an agreement with the Palestinians .
A critical consideration is that in every serious Israeli - Palestinian negotiation the Palestinians have accepted that the main settlement blocs right next to the 1967 border will be retained by Israel in any final settlement .
However , the Palestinians will be compensated by an equal amount of territory of equal quality from within Israel .
This means that places such as Maale Audumin and Gush Etzion will always be part of Israel .
From Israel 's point of view it is inconceivable that they could be prevented from normal development within their existing boundaries .
George W. Bush recognised this in a letter to Ariel Sharon in 2004 , but the Obama administration says it is not bound by that letter .
Nonetheless , the Obama administration also does not envisage those settlements becoming part of a Palestinian state .
Thus the administration 's vagueness about what it means by no more settlements shows it is playing a game with everyone .
A couple of other facts to bear in mind .
We are not talking about huge numbers of people .
There are seven million Israelis .
About 280,000 of them live in settlements beyond the areas of Jerusalem that Israel has annexed , and every peace plan has always envisaged that a good number of these will stay with Israel .
Nonetheless , when peace is struck , Israel will have to forcibly withdraw settlers , as it did from Sinai when it made peace with Egypt and from Gaza a couple of years ago .
Israel has not authorised any new settlements since 1999 .
Its critics argue that there has been some bad faith in that new neighbourhoods of existing settlements are sometimes constructed a kilometre or two away from existing settlements , thus taking new land .
One problem is there is no map of what the boundaries of the settlements are .
Netanyahu has promised to take no new land and the Americans would be right to expect him to stick to that commitment .
But in reality this is a tiny issue in the Middle East , and not remotely a serious obstacle to peace .
The Palestinians have several times been offered a state in land equivalent to all of the West Bank and Gaza and a capital in East Jerusalem and refused it .
A few hundred or so Israeli housing units are not the key to the future of the Muslim world .
But , for the moment , Obama is dealing in symbols .
And he is doing so , for the most part , symbolically .

By John Stossel - July 22 , 2009
It 's crazy for a group of mere mortals to try to design 15 percent of the U.S. economy .
It 's even crazier to do it by August .
Yet that is what some members of Congress presume to do .
They intend , as the New York Times puts it , " to reinvent the nation 's health care system " .
Let that sink in .
A handful of people who probably never even ran a small business actually think they can reinvent the health care system .
Politicians and bureaucrats clearly have no idea how complicated markets are .
Every day people make countless tradeoffs , in all areas of life , based on subjective value judgments and personal information as they delicately balance their interests , needs and wants .
Who is in a better position than they to tailor those choices to best serve their purposes ?
Yet the politicians believe they can plan the medical market the way you plan a birthday party .
Leave aside how much power the state would have to exercise over us to run the medical system .
Suffice it say that if government attempts to control our total medical spending , sooner or later , it will have to control us .
Also leave aside the inevitable huge cost of any such program .
The administration estimates $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years with no increase in the deficit .
But no one should take that seriously .
When it comes to projecting future costs , these guys may as well be reading chicken entrails .
In 1965 , hospitalization coverage under Medicare was projected to cost $ 9 billion by 1990 .
The actual price tag was $ 66 billion .
The sober Congressional Budget Office debunked the reformers ' cost projections .
Trust us , Obama says .
" At the end of the day , we 'll have significant cost controls , " presidential adviser David Axelrod said .
Give me a break .
Now focus on the spectacle of that handful of men and women daring to think they can design the medical marketplace .
They would empower an even smaller group to determine -- for millions of diverse Americans -- which medical treatments are worthy and at what price .
How do these arrogant , presumptuous politicians believe they can know enough to plan for the rest of us ?
Who do they think they are ?
Under cover of helping uninsured people get medical care , they live out their megalomaniacal social - engineering fantasies -- putting our physical and economic health at risk in the process .
Will the American people say " Enough ! " ?
I fear not , based on the comments on my blog .
When I argued last week that medical insurance makes people indifferent to costs , I got comments like : " I guess the 47 million people who do n't have health care should just die , right , John ? "
" You will always be a shill for corporate America . "
Like the politicians , most people are oblivious to F.A. Hayek 's insight that the critical information needed to run an economy -- or even 15 percent of one -- does n't exist in any one place where it is accessible to central planners .
Instead , it is scattered piecemeal among millions of people .
All those people put together are far wiser and better informed than Congress could ever be .
Only markets -- private property , free exchange and the price system -- can put this knowledge at the disposal of entrepreneurs and consumers , ensuring the system will serve the people and not just the political class .
This is no less true for medical care than for food , clothing and shelter .
It is profit - seeking entrepreneurship that gave us birth control pills , robot limbs , Lasik surgery and so many other good things that make our lives longer and more pain free .
To the extent the politicians ignore this , they are the enemy of our well - being .
The belief that they can take care of us is rank superstition .
Who will save us from these despots ?
What Adam Smith said about the economic planner applies here , too :
The politician who tries to design the medical marketplace would " assume an authority which could safely be trusted , not only to no single person , but to no council or senate whatever , and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it .

Last week we shared a great hack to let you back up and play your Wii games from an external hard drive .
That hack has been made easier by eliminating the need for a Wii downgrade .
[ Update : Mike 's tutorial is no defunct .
Check our guide , How to Back Up and Play Your Wii Games from an External Hard Drive , instead . ]

Why would you want to play your games off a hard disk ?
Wii games cost anywhere from $ 20 - 50 , while an external hard drive that can hold all your Wii games — assuming you do n't already have one on hand — costs $ 100 or less .
Backing up your games to an external hard drive attached to your Wii costs less than the replacing two premium games , and has the added benefit of loading your games radically faster .
Last week we shared a Wii backup tutorial , put together by Lifehacker reader Mike .
With a newer Wii or an upgraded your dashboard , the process involved quite a bit of tinkering and downgrading your dashboard .
Mike sent us an updated guide that 's easy to follow and has very detailed step - by - step instructions for enabling the hack on Wii consoles sporting the new 4.0 dashboard .
All you need for the hack is a Wii you do n't mind mucking around in , a blank SD card , an external USB 2.0 hard drive that will be totally dedicated for the project , and a handful of software tools freely available online .
Check out Mike 's excellent and updated tutorial at the link below for more details .
Thanks Mike !

Now OCR is used everywhere from data entry to license plate recognition and has become a key tool for recognizing and digitizing handwritten and scanned documents .
Manchester City are on the verge of completing a deal to sign Emmanuel Adebayor from Arsenal , the Guardian understands .
The two clubs have agreed a fee , believed to be closer to Arsenal 's asking price of £ 25 m than City 's original offer of £ 20 m , and the striker is in Manchester discussing terms on a five - year contract worth between £ 150,000 - 170,000 a week .
Adebayor , who would become the ninth striker on City 's books , was identified as a realistic target last week , leading the club to end their interest in Barcelona 's Samuel Eto'o .
Talks with the Togolese have moved rapidly over the last few days , and though the striker was initially keen on a move to Serie A , it is believed the scale of the salary persuaded him to move north .
City hope the 25 - year - old will now be able to take some part in their pre-season tour to South Africa , with Mark Hughes 's squad due to fly out tomorrow .
Carlos
Tevez will be on board after the club confirmed his arrival on a five - year contract .
" Carlos is an international player of the highest class who possesses all the attributes that will help drive this club forward , " Mark Hughes , the City manager , said .
" He is not only outstanding technically but he is a reliable goalscorer and someone who will contribute fully to the team ethic .
He gives us another exciting , attacking dimension .
I cannot wait to welcome him to City . "
He knew something was wrong when at the end of the day his tip jar was empty .

It ’s another WipEout Wednesday , and we ’re back with the fourth in our series of developer diaries featuring the WipEout HD Fury add - on pack .
This week we have Rita Linsley , an artist from the WipEout HD development team .
Enjoy !
Hey all you kids out there , my name is Rita and I ’m one of the artists who worked on the new Zone Tracks for the Wipeout Fury expansion pack .
I ’ve been asked to put together a blog post that gives some insight into their creation .
Thought Police Alert : Artistic license takes over from reason and scientific fact here , so feel free to ‘ skip to the end ’ if you think it all sounds like a bunch of nonsense …
1. ZONE : Intro & context
‘ Zone ’ is speed experienced in its purest state , with no weapons .
From a poetic point of view Zone can be likened to riding an atom in a particle accelerator .
The speed of the atom as it ‘ rides the torus ’ gets increasingly faster and faster , until ultimately it moves at such surreal speeds that it exists contiguously at all points along its path .
It becomes an omnipresent singularity along this path , a very peculiar entity with ‘ mixed dimensionality . ’
If we could become that little atom at that moment we would find ourselves connected to a psychedelic ‘ speed - dimension . ’
It would be one hell of a trip !
So zone mode is all about surreal abstract geometries , and shifting landscapes of colour that create an otherworldly atmosphere .
2. Landscapes Inspired by Nature ’s Fantastic Patterns
Zone has a psychedelic nature , so it was only natural to be inspired by patterns found in nature .
In particular fractal phenomena and ‘ humanity hugging ’ psychedelic philosophies :
Fractal energy flows through everything on this planet .
We see it in cloud formations , and in the majesty of epic mountain ranges : “ As above so below . ”
It ’s especially apparent in the springtime when plant forms starts to bud and bloom .
Symmetries , self similarity , and branching systems are everywhere !
We live in , and are all connected by a cosmic fractal - field of energy .
3. Four Sets of Geometry
There are four zone tracks , so four families of abstract shapes were created that looked / felt like they possessed a particular energy pattern .
I wanted to ‘ riff ’ off these ‘ nature patterns ’ for Wipeout , so mixed them with graphic design and graffiti aesthetics in an attempt to create an otherworldly psychedelic atmosphere .
Below are some of the concept shapes created for Zone 4 , riffing off the patterns above :
4. Time Constraint and Technique
I was working to an extremely tight schedule .
So , with such a fast turnaround I had to come up with a workflow that enabled the fast construction of objects that could be tested on the fly .
I liken the resulting process to a bunch of blues & jazz musicians having an impromptu session where they hunt for different permutations on a well known jazz standard .
They riff off a pattern , until that pattern becomes something else entirely , a fresh expression of something familiar .
Families of shapes were ‘ thrown out there ’ , which were then positioned alongside a tracks twists , turns and chicanes to see if they worked .
The design process was not a linear one , so it ’s difficult to describe in words .
Each family of shapes was triggered by the ‘ vibe ’ that I got from certain fractal phenomena I encountered on walks and internet surfs .
Zone 4 was inspired by Cambrian creatures & fern formations .
See pics above .
5. Speed Perception
When you travel deeper and deeper into the pattern of a fractal the pattern repeats its - self infinitely .
It is an infinite loop , which at a very huge stretch could be likened to the enclosed loop of a track .
When you travel deeper and deeper into the speeds of the zone , you enter a state of trance where you transcend reality and become like ‘ that atom ’ that exists contiguously at all points along its path … the pattern repeats , the pattern repeats , the pattern repeats – and “ Dimensionality becomes a function of consciousness ” Reference : ( Ian McEwan : Solid Geometry ) .
At these surreal speeds you become an ‘ infinite loop ’ .
A cosmic piece of fractal consciousness in a golden state of flow !
Hope you enjoy riding the zone fellow pilgrims .
God -speed !

The Dutch anti-piracy outfit BREIN has won its court case against The Pirate Bay .
The Amsterdam court today ruled that the site must cease all operations in The Netherlands within 10 days , or else pay penalties of 30,000 euros ( $ 42,300 ) a person , per day .
In an Amsterdam court last week , BREIN ’s lawyer argued that The Pirate Bay is responsible for millions of copyright infringements every day , and that the site should therefore be blocked to visitors from The Netherlands .
Interestingly , the news came as a total surprise to Fredrik , Gottfrid and Peter who said they received no official summons and were not aware of the case .
In a counter move , the three sent a letter to the Amsterdam court , asking it to dismiss the case and impose damages against BREIN instead .
Today , the verdict was made public and The Pirate Bay has lost the case .
The judge ruled that The Pirate Bay has to stop all of their activities in The Netherlands within ten days .
If they do n’t comply all defendants will be ordered to pay 30,000 euros ( $ 42,300 ) per day in penalties up to a maximum of 3 million euros ( $ 4,231,000 ) total .
The court argued that BREIN had done enough to inform the three defendants about the court case , although they were never officially summoned .
In a letter to the court the defendants had indicated that if they had know , they would n’t have the financial means to attend the hearing .
Because of this the court issued a default judgment and gave in to BREIN ’s demands .
Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde , who is one of the defendants told TorrentFreak that they will appeal the decision , and that they are currently looking for legal representation .
Interestingly , the verdict claims that The Pirate Bay does n’t have a registered owner , but holds the three accused responsible for it .
However , as we ’ve reported previously the site is in fact owned by a company called “ Reservella ” and not any of the defendants named in the case .
In addition to the three founders , GGF , the intended buyers of the Pirate Bay were also ordered to pay 30,000 euros ( $ 42,300 ) per day in penalties if they continue to operate the site as it is after the deal is closed .
Legal experts informed TorrentFreak that the current ruling can be largely attributed to the lack of defense , and the fact that the defendants failed to show up .
With this ruling in hand , it is not unlikely that BREIN will put pressure on Dutch ISPs if the Pirate Bay does n’t block Dutch visitors within 10 days .
Geoff Taylor , head of UK major label trade group BPI , wrote an op - ed piece for the BBC today in which he called Napster the " Rosetta Stone of digital music , " said it was " simple to understand and use , " and said that the music industry should have " embraced Napster rather than fighting it . "
While this might sound radical , it 's not actually a controversial position among major label executives anymore — a top RIAA executive said the same things to me last week at the Jammie Thomas - Rasset trial in Minnesota .
More interesting is the rationale for why such a deal never got done .
If Napster was truly the " Rosetta Stone " that unlocked the mysteries of digital online distribution , why was it sued out of existence ?
According to Taylor , the world of 1999 was n't ready for such a deal .
" To make music fully and legally available on the internet meant clearing the rights in millions of tracks for a huge number of countries , " he said , " agreeing how the revenue should be shared , implementing workable DRM ( which everyone considered fundamental at the time ) , developing technology to track all the downloads for royalty purposes , as well as creating a quality user experience people would pay for . "
Napster famously did n't bother about those things , and when it finally did get around to talking to the labels about actually compensating them and their artists for all that music being traded , the industry was insulted by the amounts offered .
Napster was n't " prepared to pay fair royalties or to partner in a business model that could sustain investment in new music , " said Taylor .
That 's too bad , since otherwise everything would have worked out great and we would now be living in a blanket - licensed digital music paradise .
Or would we ?
Revisionist history
The record industry 's Napster epiphany certainly came late .
Steve Knopper , who wrote about the industry 's tortured shift to online distribution in the recent book Appetite for Self - Destruction ( read our review ) , notes the resistance of the labels to services like Napster back in 1999 - 2000 .
Liquid Audio , for instance , was trying to launch a DRM - protected music service years before iTunes .
As Liquid Audio exec Gerry Kearby tells the story , " One day in a moment of pure honesty , [ a Sony rep ] said , ' Look , Kearby , my job is to keep you down .
We do n't ever want you to succeed . '
Some of them were more interested in experimenting than others , there 's no doubt about it .
But they were , in effect , buggy - whip manufacturers , trying to keep the auto at bay as long as they could . "
Napster , with its uncontrolled P2P distribution and no DRM , was even more unlikely to reach a deal with the labels , regardless of the money on the table .
And far from using Napster as a " Rosetta Stone " that helped them understand the online market , major labels instead launched terrible music services like PressPlay to control the distribution of DRMed music themselves .
At this point , it 's all ancient history .
The interesting question is , ten years after Napster , why has no similar , legal service been offered if the music biz recognizes its Napster mistake ?
Only in the last year are we starting to see services like Qtrax and Nokia 's Comes With Music and the new UK program that offers Universal 's music to ISP customers .
None of these are truly like Napster , and the fact that a Napster - style service has still not been legally licensed suggests that it certainly would n't have been licensed 10 years ago , either , back when labels were screaming for DRM and higher up - front payments from music startups .
Taylor is right to note that music has loosened its grip , has dropped most DRM , and is willing to license to all sorts of innovative services .
Music has gotten over its fear of the online world .
Had that been true a decade ago ( and had Napster truly been willing to do a workable deal ) , where might we be today ?

Is Twitter a craze or is it a technology that has a real role in the workplace as well as between family and friends ?
The statistic quoted in this book - more than 10 million users within 3 years - prove its popularity and it answers the basic questions about what Twitter is and how to use it .
Twitter is essentially a messaging service and given that we already have email , IM ( instant messaging ) , mobile phone texting , RSS and social networks what does Twitter offer ?
This book suggests four factors make it different :
• The limit of 140 characters per message means they are easy to write and to read
• Being on public access you can communicate with a new audience
• As messages are sent and received via a variety of mechanisms including mobile phones , PCs and websites they fit with nearly anyone 's workflow
• The " friendliness common on Twitter " is also a key characteristic
The book 's preamble concludes that Twitter is emerging as " a key business channel " and then , having presumably convinced you of its worth , gets down to the details of how to get started .
This book is an introduction to using rather than programming or modifying Twitter and it goes into the subject in great detail .
There is a lot of jargon associated with Twitter and you 'll find explanations of the basics such as " following " and " tweet " but also more advanced aspects such as DMs - " direct messages " which provide a private channel for messages intended for a specific individual .
Hashtags are also demystified in the first chapter .
There 's plenty of advice about how to use Twitter and about etiquette and it is all very easy to assimilate given that the information on the right hand page of a spread is accompanied by a full page screen shot on the left hand side .
One criticism of the book is that is overwhelmingly positive about Twitter and does n't even raise issues such as personal or professional security in this very public forum .
If you want to join in Twitter but are not sure how this book covers every aspect in words and pictures .

Teaching anecdotes
I asked the markers to keep track of the number of misspellings .
Out of about 400 papers marked , roughly 50 had " occurrences " misspelled .
I mentioned this to the class while discussing the midterm results , and told them there would be a question on the final exam asking for the correct spelling of " occurrences " .
This brought the expected laugh .
On the final exam , I placed a question that asked each student to write a function " occurrences " which counted the number of occurrences of a key value in a tree .
Part ( a ) of this question read , in full , " What is the correct spelling of the word ' occurrences ' ? " , for an easy and amusing two marks .
Part ( b ) , which asked for the code for the function , used " occurrences " in its text in the same fashion as the midterm question .
When we started marking , someone sang out , " Hey , this student spelled ' occurrences ' wrong ! " .
Then we had another , and another .
Out of 364 papers marked , there were 142 wrong answers to part ( a ) .
There were a number of students who spelled " occurrences " differently in their answers to parts ( a ) and ( b ) , but we did not keep statistics on this .
This course also had a lecture on the history of computer science .
I always enjoyed giving this lecture , but many instructors skipped it , because they did n't care for the material and it could not be tested anyway .
I put an essay question on the winter 1994 final exam .
For five marks out of a hundred , students had to write a 100 - word essay on one of three topics .
One of the topics was " Discuss the contribution of Alan Turing to the field of computer science . "
Here are four of the essays , in full , with all original mistakes reproduced .
( Mistakes in content , as opposed to spelling and grammar , can easily be detected with the help of Web sites giving brief biographies of Turing . )
Before World War II , Alan Turing created a simple computer consisting of 0's and 1's that would help solve polynomials .
During WWII , at Bletchley Park , he wast the first person to break the code of cryptography using an algorithm he formulated .
His most important contribution to the field of computer science was the creation of a computer that could tell in the next room if it was a machine or a human .
This research became the advent of artificial intelligence .
With Alan Turing 's contribution of AI , the research carried from there on .
In 1936 , Alan Turing creates a computer language which called " Turing " .
After the Second World War , he created a Turing test for this computer language .
This " Turing " language was the earliest computer language , and guards some authors to create some other computer language .
For example , Basic , Pascal , Ada , etc .
Actually : Alan Turing was the acestentor of all computer science .
He brought the great concept to the field of computer science .
Born in 1912 , Alan Turing is one of the major figure in computer science .
Early in his life he worked on programmable machines .
At age 24 , he demonstrated his new invention , a ' computer ' which took some types of tape as the main programming tool .
The machine was going to different places on the tape whether or not a certain state was achieve .
But one of his main proccupation was the artificial intelligence .
In 1950 he wrote an algorithm which allows humans to see if a computer is intelligent .
Touring died early , but his work still somehow actual even in this world where the changes in technology are so fast .
Alan Turing began his developments by building the first computational machine , based on BaBage 's plans ( Babage could not have accomplished his machine as he did n't have the precision machinery to build it . )
This machine was the first to calculate functions and values .
Alan throughout his carreer has been developing machine made calculating tools that will take some of the heavy burden of computations off the human shoulders .
Alan in conjunction with the U.S military , tried to develop machines that will calculate projectiles or bombs and missiles , machines that will break codes , calculate flying pathes etc .
Turing had a major role in algorithm development and proving its correctness .
Turing ended his brilliant carreer by injecting poison into an apple and eating it as he was fed up with society 's criticisms of his homosexuality ( Note .
and may that is why APPLE is called APPLE )
Another post about signal handling ?
There are probably lots of people who have blogged about signal handling in Linux , but this series is going to be different .
In this blog post , I ’m going to unravel the signal handling code paths in the Linux kernel starting at the hardware level , working though the kernel , and ending in the userland signal handler .
I ’ve tried to use footnotes for code samples which have links to the code in the Linux lxr .
Many of the code examples have been snipped for brevity .
As always , this post is specific to the x86_64 CPU architecture and Linux kernel 2.6.29 .
Hardware or software generated
Signals are not generated directly by hardware , but certain hardware states can cause the Linux kernel to generate signals .
As such we can imagine two ways to generate signals :
Hardware – the CPU does something bad ( divides by 0 , touches a bad address , etc ) which causes the kernel to create and deliver ( unless the signal is SIGKILL or SIGSTOP , of course ) a signal ( SIGFPE , SIGSEGV , etc ) to the running process .
Software – an application executes a kill ( ) system call and sends a signal to a specific process .
Both types of signals share a common code path , but hardware generated signals have a very interesting birth .
Let ’s start there and as we work our way up to userland we ’ll stumble into the software signal code path along the way .
Exceptions on the x86
Let ’s start by first understanding what an x86 exception is .
For that , we ’ll turn to the documentation :
[...] exceptions are events that indicate that a condition exists somewhere in the system , the processor , or within the currently executing program or task that requires the attention of a processor .
They typically result in a forced transfer of execution from the currently running program or task to a special software routine [...] or an exception handler .
At a high level this is pretty simple to understand ; the system gets in a weird state and the CPU immediately begins executing a predefined handler function to try to fix things ( if it can ) or die gracefully .
Let ’s take a look at how the kernel creates and installs handler functions that the CPU executes when an exception occurs .
Low - level exception handlers
Low level exception handlers are specified in the Interrupt Descriptor Table ( IDT ) .
The IDT can hold up to 256 entries and it can live anywhere in memory .
Each entry in the IDT is mapped to a different exception .
For example , # DE Divide Error is the first entry in the IDT , IDT [ 0 ] ; # PF Page Fault ‘s handler lives at IDT [ 14 ] .
When a specific exception is encountered , the CPU looks up the handler function in the IDT , puts some data on the stack , and executes the handler .
What does an entry in the IDT look like ?
Let ’s take a look at a picture from Intel :
Take a look at the fields labeled ‘ Offset ’ – this is field that contains the address of the function to execute .
As you can see , there are three fields labeled ‘ Offset . ’
Can you guess why ?
In order to actually set the address of the function you want to execute , you ’ll need to do some bit - shifting .
Each ‘ Offset ’ field is indicates which bits of the address of the handler function it wants .
You need to be really careful when writing the code that is responsible for creating IDT entries .
A bug here could cause your system to do really bizarre things .
We know what an IDT entry looks like , but what about the data that the CPU pushes on the stack before executing a handler ?
Unfortunately , I could n’t track down a picture of what the x86_64 puts on the stack and I can’t draw .
So , here is a picture of the data the x86 CPU puts on the stack from Intel :
When an exception occurs , the CPU pushes the stack pointer , the CPU flags register value , the code and stack segment selectors , and the instruction pointer on to the stack before executing the handler .
Nice , but where does the IDT itself live ?
The address of the IDT is stored in a CPU register that can be accessed with the instructions lidt and sidt to load and store ( respectively ) the address of the IDT .
Usually , the address of the IDT is set during the initialization of the kernel .
Let ’s see where this happens in Linux :
void __init x86_64_start_kernel(char * real_mode_data ) { int i ; /* [...] */ for ( i = 0 ; i < NUM_EXCEPTION_VECTORS ; i++) { set_intr_gate( i , early_idt_handler ) ; } load_idt ( ( const struct desc_ptr *) &idt_descr ) ; /* [...]
*/ }
Cool , so Linux creates a bunch of early handlers in case something goes bad during boot and then a few function calls later ( not shown ) , Linux calls start_kernel ( ) , which calls trap_init ( ) for your architecture which actually sets the handlers .
This is pretty important , so let 's take a look at the code for this .
Thankfully , Linux includes some descriptive function names , so we can see which exceptions are being set .
void __init trap_init ( void ) { /* ... */ set_intr_gate ( 0 , ÷_error ) ; /* ... */ set_intr_gate ( 5 , &bounds ) ; set_intr_gate ( 6 , &invalid_op ) ; set_intr_gate ( 7 , & device_not_available ) ; /* ... */ set_intr_gate ( 13 , & general_protection ) ; set_intr_gate ( 14 , & page_fault ) ; set_intr_gate ( 15 , &spurious_interrupt_bug ) ; set_intr_gate ( 16 , &coprocessor_error ) ; set_intr_gate ( 17 , &alignment_check ) ; /* ... */ }
Awesome , now let 's try to track down where these exception handlers are defined .
As it turns out , there is a little bit of C and assembly magic to string this all together .
The low - level exception handlers have a common entry and exit point and are " templated " with a macro .
Let 's take a look at the macro and some of the handlers in the kernel :
.macro zeroentry sym do_sym ENTRY ( \sym ) INTR_FRAME pushq_cfi $ - 1 /* ORIG_RAX : no syscall to restart */ subq $ 15* 8 , %rsp call error_entry DEFAULT_FRAME 0 movq %rsp , %rdi /* pt_regs pointer */ xorl %esi , %esi /* no error code */ call \do_sym jmp error_exit /* %ebx : no swapgs flag */ ND ( \sym ) .endm
So the macro uses the first argument sym as the name of the function , and the second argument do_sym is a C function that is called from this assembly stub .
We also notice from the stub above a very important ( and somewhat subtle ) piece of code : movq %rsp , %rdi
This piece of code puts the address of the stack pointer in %rdi and we 'll see why shortly .
First , let 's look at how the macro is used to get a better idea how it works :
zeroentry divide_error do_divide_error zeroentry overflow do_overflow zeroentry bounds do_bounds zeroentry invalid_op do_invalid_op zeroentry device_not_available do_device_not_available
This block of code uses the macro above to create symbols named divide_error , overflow , and more which call out to C functions named do_divide_error , do_overflow , etc .
The craziness does n't end there .
These C functions are also generated with macros :
# define DO_ERROR ( trapnr , signr , str , name ) \ dotraplinkage void do_# #name ( struct pt_regs * regs , long error_code ) \ { \ if ( notify_die ( DIE_TRAP , str , regs , error_code , trapnr , signr ) \ == NOTIFY_STOP ) \ return ; \ conditional_sti( regs ) ; \ do_trap ( trapnr , signr , str , regs , error_code , NULL ) ; \ } /*...*/ DO_ERROR ( 4 , SIGSEGV , " overflow " , overflow ) DO_ERROR ( 5 , SIGSEGV , " bounds " , bounds )
Those last two lines get substituted with the macro above , creating do_overflow , do_bounds , and more .
As you might have noticed , the functions generated have dotraplinkage which is a macro for a gcc attribute regparm which tells gcc to pass arguments to the function in registers and not on the stack .
Remember the movq %rsp , %rdi from the common assembly stub ?
That line of code exists to pass the address of the state the CPU dumped to the do_* functions via the %rdi register .
The do_* functions notify interested parties about the exception , re-enable interrupts / exceptions if they were disabled , and finally tells the upper layer signal handling code of the kernel that a signal should be generated and hands over the associated CPU state at the time the exception was generated .
Conclusion for Part 1
Wow .
What a wild ride that was .
There is a lot of trickery and subtle hacks in the Linux kernel .
Reading and understanding the code can make you a more clever programmer .
Dig in !
It is pretty cool ( imho ) to understand how you actually converse with the CPU and how the CPU talks to the kernel , and how that data is pushed to the upper layers .
The Intel CPU manuals , the gcc man page , and the Linux lxr are a big time help for deciphering this code , which can be cryptic at times .
Understanding what information you have at your disposal can let you do pretty crazy things in userland , as we 'll see in the next piece of this series .
Stay tuned , in the next piece of this series I 'll walk through the signal handling code in the kernel and show some crazy non-portable tricks you can do in userland .

She said that , after a few glasses of red wine , Theophanous convinced the woman to take a private tour of Parliament with him .
Ms Williams said the woman , who cannot be identified for legal reasons , agreed , believing there would be plenty of security personnel and people around .
But she said that , when they got to Parliament , Theophanous took the woman in the back door and showed her the upper house chamber , which was almost pitch black .
" The complainant then told the defendant that she wanted to leave .
There was no one there and it was dimly lit .
The defendant had tried to take her into a darkened area and now she felt trapped , '' Ms Williams said .
She said that Theophanous insisted that they keep going and took the woman to his office .
Ms Williams said that Theophanous then raped the woman on a couch in the room , covering her face with his hand so she could not scream .
She said he stopped when the woman 's phone rang and said nothing else to the alleged victim until after they had left the building .
" When they were outside , the defendant said ' What I like about you is that you are loyal . '
The complainant immediately perceived this to be a threat to keep quiet , '' Ms Williams said .
She said that , since the alleged incident , the woman had had a breakdown and moved to Greece to live with her parents .
Ms Williams said that Theophanous had continued to call and message the woman until as late as 2007 .
But Robert Richter , QC , for Theophanous , told magistrate Peter Reardon that the woman 's claims were pure fantasy and that she had only accused Theophanous of rape in an attempt to get money .
" The evidence will demonstrate that the complainant is a fantasist , a manipulative fabricator of stories , '' he said .
Mr Richter said that the woman was a prescription drug addict who had revised her statement 17 times before finally submitting the version before the court .
He said that , when she first complained to a solicitor about the alleged rape , she told him that it was in the winter of 2000 , not in September 1998 .
And he said that two of the three people to whom she claimed to have told of the rape directly afterwards said they did not believe she had ever talked to them about it .
He said that at the end of the committal he would request that Mr Reardon strike out the charges against Theophanous because no reasonable jury , properly directed , could find the woman to be a credible witness .
The parties to the case are attending a view of the scene of the alleged rape , and the alleged victim is expected to give evidence this afternoon .
The hearing continues .
( CNN ) -- A Philadelphia - area day care center said Thursday that members of a private swim club made racist comments about the center 's children , and the club then canceled their swimming privileges .
Some kids from the Creative Steps Day Care center say club members made racial remarks .
The Creative Steps Day Care children -- ages kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to the Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley , Pennsylvania , on June 29 .
The day center 's director , Alethea Wright , had contracted to use the club once a week .
During their first visit , some children said they heard club members asking why African - American children were there .
One of the boys told the Philadelphia Inquirer that a woman at the club said she feared the children " might do something " to her child .
Days later , the day care center 's $ 1,950 check was returned without explanation , Wright said .
The stepfather of one of the children was filing a complaint against the club with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission , the panel 's chairman , Stephen Glassman , said Thursday .
Watch one of the children say what he heard at the swim club »
The commission is investigating the allegations , spokeswoman Shannon Powers said , and will attempt to resolve the conflict out of court .
" Protests and public outcry wo n't do much to help these families , but the Human Relations Commission can determine the facts and hold people accountable for any illegal acts of discrimination , " State NAACP President J. Whyatt Mondesire , who serves as a commission member , said in a press release .
Sen .
Arlen Specter 's office said the Pennsylvania Democrat has sent a letter to the Valley Swim Club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps , saying , " I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today . "
On its Web site , the Valley Club disputed the allegations of racism .
" We had originally agreed to invite the camps to use our facility , knowing full well that the children from the camps were from multi-ethnic backgrounds , " the statement said .
" Unfortunately , we quickly learned that we underestimated the capacity of our facilities and realized that we could not accommodate the number of children from these camps .
All funds were returned to the camps and we will re-evaluate the issue at a later date to determine whether it can be feasible in the future . "
CNN attempted to speak with club President John Duesler on Thursday .
He said he had no comment and asked CNN to leave the club property .
But Duesler told two Philadelphia television stations that the children had changed " the complexion " and " atmosphere " of the club .
A small group of protesters gathered in front of the club Thursday and said they think Duesler 's statements prove that the club 's action was racially motivated .
" I was hoping it would n't be something that was so blatantly apparent .
I was hoping that it was overcrowding , " one protester said .
" When I read the statement by the club president , it made it blatant . "
Jim Flynn , who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children , said it was not racially motivated .
" There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards , " he said .
" As general members , we were not told that they were coming .
If we knew , we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway .
We could have had an option . "
He said two other day - care centers , neither of which included minority children , had previously been similarly disinvited .
A private Philadelphia boarding school said Thursday that it plans to help the day care center .
" We thought it was appalling what happened , " said Girard College Admissions Director Tamara Leclair .
She is meeting with the director of Creative Steps to sign a contract allowing the children to use Girard 's facilities this summer , as early as Monday .
" We 've had a wonderful response .
I even received an e-mail from a woman in Florida telling us we did the right thing . "

I 'm in a horrible rush , so have to keep my remarks on Goldman Sachs ' second quarter results brief .
I could say " crikey " and leave it at that .
But I will translate .
Just a few months after Wall Street and the City of London were in meltdown , Goldman has reported record net revenues for a three - month period of $ 13.8bn , which is a breathtaking 47 % higher than those generated in the preceding three months and in the equivalent period of last year .
It 's boom time again , especially in the trading of credit and currencies .
And oh how Goldman 's 29,400 staff have been rewarded .
Compensation for the three months was a handsome $ 6.65 bn or $ 226,000 per employee .
That brings remuneration per employee for the first half of the year to a none - too - cheap $ 384,000 .
And we 're only halfway through the year .
The media and political reaction to Goldman 's bounceback will be fascinating to observe .
It 's true that the investment bank has consistently performed better than most of its rivals .
But when that cataclysmic storm broke over the financial system last autumn , Goldman - like the rest - had to turn to taxpayers for a crutch in the form of guarantees for its debt , access to central - bank liquidity and capital .
It has recently declared that it can stand on its own feet again without taxpayers to lean on .
But some may well ask whether taxpayers should n't have demanded a bit more for their succour , given that Goldman is once again the world 's pre-eminent money - making machine .

This time it 's Wolf Blitzer 's turn to allow John Boehner to rattle off those Frank Luntz talking points without calling him out for it .
These guys always seem to overlook a few simple points .
One , just what everyone who has insurance is paying in premiums and just how high that cost is right now .
And two , the bureaucrat between patients and their doctors exists already , and it 's called the insurance company .
And third , when is one of these " news " men or women going to ask a member of Congress why they 're unhappy with their current health care coverage ?
BLITZER : Let 's talk about some of the domestic priorities under way right now .
The president wants health care reform , delivered a big speech on it yesterday .
And , in that speech , he said this :
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP ) BARACK OBAMA , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES :
So , when you hear the naysayers claim that I 'm trying to bring about government - run health care , know this :
They 're not telling the truth .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BLITZER : Are you among those naysayers who are suggesting he wants to bring about government - run health care ?
BOEHNER : Well , I think the president is ignoring reality .
The Congressional Budget Office came out with a score on Senator Kennedy 's bill , just part of the score -- of the -- of his bill , that says that the public option would cost over $ 1 trillion , and would cause 23 million Americans to lose their private health care coverage , and only 16 million of which would -- would be covered under the -- the government plan .
And , so , it 's not just me and others .
It 's -- it 's very clear that the so - called public option would be subsidized by the government .
It would draw people out of the private sector .
It would cause companies to just give up their coverage and force people into a government - run plan .
BLITZER : I know you do n't ...
( CROSSTALK )
BOEHNER : That 's not what we -- that 's not what we want .
What we want is , we want to work with the president to make sure that all Americans have access to high - quality , affordable health insurance .
BLITZER : I know you do n't want a government - run health insurance plan .
You want a private - run plan .
What about this proposal , this compromise , in between ?
Kent Conrad , the Democratic senator , suggesting co-ops , where you -- you band together hundreds of thousands of people , and you create a co-op that 's not government run .
It 's privately run .
But it -- but it would potentially do the same thing .
BOEHNER : You know , I think it 's worth exploring .
I have n't seen how this would work and what the rules would be .
But , clearly , it 's an idea that might be able to bridge the differences .
But , at the end of the day , we want to make sure that doctors and patients are making decisions about what care is in their best interest , not some government bureaucrat in between .
And , so , if there are ideas out there that will help promote a competitive health insurance system in America that provides access to all Americans to high - quality health insurance , I 'm for it .
BLITZER : Congressman , thanks very much for coming in .
BOEHNER : Thanks ,
Wolf .
It ’s been hovering in the upper 90s here in Atlanta , and weather like this makes me crave ice cream like no other .
This year , I ’m on the hunt for my favorite vegan ice cream !
The plan is to try new pints each week and share my findings right here .
I know , it ’s a tough life I ’ve got .
This week , I tried out Ice Supreme .
This is not just a dairy free ice cream treat ; it ’s almost completely raw and contains no soy at all .
That ’s handy , since it ’s really easy when you ’re cutting out dairy to go a little heavy on the soy .
Moderation is key , right ?
What better place to start than with ice cream !
The Stats
Ingredients : Filtered water , raw almonds , raw cashews , raw and toasted pecans , organic raw agave nectar , raw vanilla bean , himalayan crystal salt
Calories per 1/2 cup : 180
Total fat per 1/2 cup : 10g
Total saturated fat per 1/2 cup : 1.5g
Total fiber per 1/2 cup : 1g
1/2 cup contains : 2 % of your calcium and 6 % of your iron ( based on a 2000 calorie diet )
Price : $ 6.99 per pint
The Verdict
I picked up a pint of the Pecan Passion flavor .
Overall , for such an unprocessed treat , it was delicious !
That pint will definitely not languish in the freezer .
The ice cream was pretty tasty – sweet but not overly sweet with big chunks of pecan mixed in .
My only complaint is that it had a slightly grainy texture from the nuts .
That might have been from the toasted pecans , though , rather than the raw nuts that make up the base of the ice cream .
The Whole Foods here that carries it also stocks the Strawberry Supreme variety , so another round might be in order for this ice cream .
You can pick up your own pint at Whole Foods or your local co-op in certain states .
If your area does n’t carry it , they also sell pints on the Ice Supreme website .
The next time you read a health - related article on Wikipedia , it might have been improved through a new collaboration between the National Institutes of Health and the Wikimedia Foundation .
Ten experienced Wikipedia volunteers visited the NIH headquarters in Bethesda , Maryland , last week to train the scientists there on how to use and contribute to the world 's de facto outboard brain .
It was the first " Wikipedia Academy " to take place in the United States .
" One of our goals is to increase the scientists ' understanding of Wikipedia and the established practices and procedures that have evolved over the years , " said Frank Shulenberg , who organized the academy as head of public outreach for the Wikimedia Foundation .
" They need some instructions about what 's going on and why Wikipedia culture is like it is . "
While the subject experts have epigenetics and infectious - disease outbreaks down cold , they do n't really know the complex social dynamics of the site 's thousands of contributors .
Wikipedia , by virtue of its massive and open collaboration process , is often seen as the best example of crowdsourcing .
Thousands of people write , edit and source the articles that 300 million people a month look to for accurate information .
The academy event aims to bring more subject experts to what has become the de facto storehouse for human knowledge .
To open - government advocates , NIH 's move represents an important step toward recognizing how to reach people online .
" NIH could have gone the typical route and warned the public against using unreliable sources for information , but they get it :
That 's not going to happen , " wrote Matthew Barton at the Personal Democracy Forum .
" Wikipedia is going to stay popular , so it 's vital that it provides correct information . "
In science , Wikipedia 's bigger issue might not be accuracy .
As our own Thomas Goetz pointed out last year , the site does n't always have the most accessible articles on complex topics .
Still , having more people who actually know what they are talking about contributing to the site 's articles can't be a bad thing .
" I think the main point is that [ the NIH ] recognizes what a great opportunity for doing outreach Wikipedia is , " Shulenberg said .
" If you contribute to Wikipedia , you reach a large audience and we all want health - related information that 's reliable . "

Abstract : 1 . Perform static analysis of XIP ROM images ( dumping , restoring import and export tables , searching for unsafe function calls )
2 . Enable run mode debugging of system binaries running from ROM , by cracking the AppTRK debug agent 3 . ( Ab - ) use the AppTRK debug agent as a foundation for dynamic vulnerability analysis 3 .
Build an exemplary file fuzzer for the video - and audio codecs shipped with current Nokia smartphones 4 . List and briefly analyze the identified bugs 5 . Discuss further ideas and concepts , such as jailbreak shellcode , and an IRC bot trojan for Symbian
We aim to show that it is possible to find and exploit bugs on Symbian smartphones , even in preinstalled system applications , without having access to special development hardware , and that exploits and worms similar to those found on desktop systems may be possible on Symbian .
The bugs listed in this paper have been sent to Nokia and are currently under review .
Mobile phone manufacturers should be aware that remote vulnerabilities of the kind discussed in this paper could be used in targeted attacks to remotely compromise a smartphone ( track GPS , turn on mic , etc. ) , or as a means of propagation for mobile network worms .

China 's only children are often spoiled " little emperors " Officials in Shanghai are urging parents to have a second child , the first time in decades the government has pushed for more babies .
A public information campaign has been launched to highlight exemptions to the country 's one - child policy .
Couples who were both only children , which includes most of the city 's newly - weds , are allowed a second child .
The move comes as China 's most populous city becomes richer and older , with the number of retired residents soaring .
" Shanghai 's over - 60 population already exceeds three million , or 21.6 % of registered residents , " said Zhang Meixin , a spokesman for the city 's Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission .
Leaflet campaign
He said the current average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime was less than one .
ANALYSIS Micky Bristow , BBC News Chinese and foreign experts have been saying for some time that China needs to change its strict family planning rules .
If the country continues as it is , the proportion of elderly people in society will continue to increase .
This is a problem because it will leave a smaller group of workers paying for the country 's retired population .
But central government officials have consistently ruled out changing the national family planning policy .
They still believe that China has too many people - an opinion shared by almost everyone in the country .
That has left individual cities , such as Shanghai , to think up ways of coping with their own ageing communities .
" If all couples have children according to the policy , it would definitely help relieve pressure in the long term , " he added .
Decades of a strictly enforced one - child policy has produced new strains across the population and prompted exceptions in some family categories .
Rural parents are also allowed to have a second child , if the first - born is a girl .
In Shanghai , family planning officials and volunteers will make home visits and slip leaflets under doors to encourage couples to have a second child if both grew up as only children .
Emotional and financial counselling will also be provided , officials said .
By 2020 , the country 's most populous city is expected to have more than a third of residents aged 60 or above .
Policy relaxed According to the US - based Center for Strategic and International Studies , by 2050 the country will have just 1.6 working - age adults to support each retired person , compared to 7.7 in 1975 .
The state - controlled newspaper China Daily quoted one salesman who said he was cheered by the new attitude .
CHINA'S ONE - CHILD POLICY Written into the constitution in 1978 Government says has prevented about 400 million births
Many rural couples allowed second child if first is a girl Parents who are themselves only children can have two children Ethnic minority couples allowed two or more children
China 's child policy : your stories
Has the one - child policy worked ?
China 's ' perfect child ' generation Grey areas in one - child policy Send us your comments " I 'm not sure , but such policy really gives us one more option .
If family finance permits , I want to have two kids with my wife in the future , " said 25 - year - old Xiao Wang , who works at a local company .
Others were less enthusiastic .
" I do n't think we will have a second kid , " said 26 - year - old Xiao Chen , an office worker .
" After all , it is stressful work raising a child . "
Couples who ignore China 's birth control policies usually pay fines and may face discrimination at work .
The many only children of China have earned the nickname of " little emperors " for the love and treats lavished upon them .
China 's birth - control policies have been hugely controversial at home and abroad , as enforcement has involved forced abortions and other abuses .
It has also been blamed for a gender imbalance , as a traditional preference for boys has persuaded some parents to abort girl foetuses .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Norway ’s Opera Software opened a new , free service on Tuesday that enables simple sharing of personal computers ’ pictures , files or music with anyone on the Internet .
Opera Software 's file sharing service is seen in this undated handout file photo .
REUTERS / Opera Software
The new service , which the company has said would “ reinvent the Web ” is part of Opera ’s Web browser , enables direct downloading from personal computer to personal computer and removes any need for data storage at servers in the middle .
Files can be viewed with any browser .
Similar technologies have been available before for tech - savvy consumers , but these have required downloading separate software , paying usage fees , or a long process of uploading content -- limiting take - up of the services .
On Thursday last week , Opera posted a note on social networking website Twitter with a link to a Web page saying Opera would “ reinvent the Web ” on June 16 .
That heralding of the new service had helped Opera ’s share price surge in the past week , although it fell back slightly on Tuesday as the market digested the announcement .
“ There were some expectations ahead of the announcement , so the market is only mildly disappointed , said analyst Peder Strand at SEB Enskilda
Strand added , however , that the new service looked innovative and could become an important product differentiator for Opera ’s browser .
Shares in Opera were down 2.7 percent by 1028 GMT , underperforming the Oslo bourse ’s 0.8 percent rise and a 1.1 percent rise for European technology shares .
In spite of the early fall , the stock is still up over 12 percent in the last week , at close to a three - year high , giving it a market capitalization of about $ 544 million .
Opera has built some sharing services for photos and media into the browser but has also opened up the platform for any developers to build their own sharing services .
“ We believe it is the revolution of the Internet .
We see this as a disruptive technology for Internet services in the next one to five years , ” Phillip Gronvold , product analyst at Opera , told Reuters .
Opera is the world ’s third - largest browser maker with about 40 million users , but is far behind Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer and Mozilla Foundation ’s Firefox .
“ We hope to increase our desktop penetration with this service , ” Gronvold said .
“ We feel there ’s significant time - to - market benefits in browser space . ”
Internet Explorer is used for about 60 percent of global Internet traffic , Firefox has about 30 percent , and Opera is at 4 percent -- just ahead of Google ’s Chrome and Apple ’s Safari , according to Web analytics firm StatCounter .
Microsoft has run afoul of U.S. and European antitrust regulators for bundling its desktop browser with its operating system , which Opera , Mozilla and Google say is an attempt to drive them out of the market .
Microsoft said last week it plans to ship the newest version of its Windows operating system in Europe without Internet Explorer browser .
Microsoft ’s move could be a boon for rivals , but Opera has said this was not enough to restore competition .
Opera has a small share of the desktop browser market , but its mobile browser is the most widely used browser on handsets .
“ Opera today makes around 4 crowns ( $ 0.62 ) a year per desktop user on average , ” analyst Peder Strand at SEB Enskilda said .
“ If they double the number of users on the back of this product , it would be a huge success that will have a material financial impact for Opera , ” Strand said .
“ However , whether we can expect such a doubling of the customer base , has yet to bee seen , ” he added .
Gronvold said Opera was working also on a mobile version of Unite , but has not decided on a launch schedule .
Every day at Atomic Object starts with a brief , informal meeting .
In the corporate world , “ team ” meetings leave a bad taste in most people ’s mouths ’ as being unnecessarily long , drawn out and ultimately of little value .
AO ’s approach is a bit different than your typical sit - around - the - conference table meeting for a few reasons :
Meetings create a “ brain trust ” .
Clients generally have two or four employees working on a project at any given time .
Morning meetings give employees who are not necessarily involved with the project a chance to offer their wisdom , advice and problem - solving skills .
In effect , when hiring Atomic Object for your project , you are receiving the collective wisdom of the entire staff .
Meetings unify the team .
It is not always easy to tell what various groups are working on .
This is a chance to talk about what each employee is currently involved with .
Knowing what others have worked on in the past provides employees with a mental reference of who may be valuable to their projects in the future .
Anyone may suggest a topic .
Throughout the day , as ideas emerge , all employees are encouraged to add to the next morning ’s meeting agenda by placing a short note or keyword on the chalk board .
The chalkboard helps direct focus to the most relevant topics at hand .
The meetings are cheap .
Standing keeps it short .
No chairs , no tables allowed .
Meetings rarely go much past the five - minute mark .
This also eliminates the possibility of distraction by iPhones , laptops or any other device that could feasibly be resting on the table in front of the employee .
Learn from everyone ’s mistakes .
The reality is that while we always try our hardest not to , we do sometimes make mistakes .
The sharing of information and lessons learned at the meetings can save other employees from making similar mistakes .
This ultimately saves the company time , improves efficiency and increases client satisfaction .
Stand up meetings are very focused .
Once the meeting begins all topics are work - related .
No small talk .
Topics all relate back to relevant issues surrounding the office , current projects or the industry at large .
Meetings are scheduled at 9AM , with mandatory attendance .
This spurs employees to arrive at the office consistently and on time .
In a tech office where work can theoretically be done remotely , this creates motivation to spend time in the office on a consistent basis .
Time spent in the office often results in spontaneous collaborative efforts and problem solving sessions that in turn benefit our client ’s projects and our efficiency .
Employees keep each other updated .
The tech industry moves quickly .
A mountain of new information is published daily .
The meeting gives employees a chance to share the information they have personally found most relevant and valuable , which others may have missed .
Introductions are made .
As new employees and customers appear around the office , it gives everyone a chance to say “ hi ” and meet the new face .
This makes the new hire feel welcome , and fosters community within the office environment .
Meetings generate conversation .
As topics are discussed , ideas are fostered which lead to additional discussion .
This leads to discussion and collaborative opportunities among employees , after the meeting is adjourned .
URUMQI , China 
As the desert region of Xinjiang in northwest China settled into tense stillness after three days of deadly ethnic violence , a Communist Party leader from the region said that those directly responsible for the killings of 156 people in the initial rioting on Sunday would be punished with the death penalty .
The official , Li Zhi , the head of the party in Urumqi , which is Xinjiang ’s capital and the center of the violence , said that many people suspected of being instigators had been arrested and that some were students .
“ To those who have committed crimes with cruel means , we will execute them , ” Mr. Li said at a morning news conference .
“ The small groups of the violent people have already been caught by the police .
The situation is now under control . ”

Advertisement Honduras 's ousted President , Manuel Zelaya , has failed in a dramatic attempt to fly back to his country .
His plane circled the Tegucigalpa airport , but it could not land as the authorities had blocked the runway .
Earlier at least two people were killed as troops fended off Zelaya supporters converging on the airport .
Mr Zelaya , who was ousted a week ago , has now arrived in neighbouring El Salvador where he is due to meet regional leaders , who support him .
Mr Zelaya departed from Washington and was hoping to fly home , despite warnings from the self - declared interim government that he would not be allowed to land .
If I had a parachute I would immediately jump out of this plane

In pictures : airport drama Zelaya 's taste for drama
After several failed attempts to touch down at Tegucigalpa airport , where military vehicles were placed on the runway , the plane eventually flew to Nicaragua , where Mr Zelaya met President Daniel Ortega .
The deposed Honduran leader went on to El Salvador where he was due to meet the presidents of Argentina , Ecuador and Paraguay and the head of the Organization of American States ( OAS ) .
The new government , which said it came to power through due legal process , is offering to negotiate with the international community , the BBC's Stephen Gibbs reports from Tegucigalpa .
But it says one thing is not negotiable and that is the return of Mr Zelaya to the presidency , our correspondent says .
Two dead
As the plane was flying towards Tegicugalpa , troops in riot gear fired tear gas at thousands of Zelaya supporters , some of whom reportedly hurled stones .
CRISIS TIMELINE President Zelaya planned non-binding public consultation on constitutional change Critics say he wanted to stay in power 28 June : Troops seize and expel Zelaya ; parliamentary speaker becomes interim leader 29 June : US President Obama condemns the overthrow as illegal 4 July : Organization of American States suspends Honduras in protest at overthrow 5 July : Mr Zelaya 's jet is turned back from Honduras and clashes with troops leave at least one person dead

Thousands managed to break through the security cordon .
Hospital sources and police said at least two people had been killed and a number had been injured .
After Mr Zelaya 's plane was turned away , his supporters began chanting " We want blue helmets ! " , meaning UN peacekeepers .
Zelaya supporter Karin Antunez , 27 , was in tears .
" We feel sad because these coup soldiers wo n't let Mel [ Mr Zelaya 's nickname ] return , but we 're not going to back down , " she said .
" We 're going to keep marching so that our president comes home . "
Human rights activist Matias Sauceda , 65 , said : " This is a war .
Imagine - things are so bad , that the president is in the air and they do n't let him land . "
The new government has imposed a sunset - to - sunrise curfew .
OAS acts Speaking earlier from the plane , Mr Zelaya said troops had threatened action against the aircraft if it tried to land .
Manuel Zelaya says he remains the democratically elected leader " I 'm doing everything I can , " Mr Zelaya said .
" If I had a parachute I would immediately jump out of this plane . "
The military - backed by Congress and the courts - forced Mr Zelaya out of Honduras on 28 June over his plans to hold a vote on possible constitutional change .
" We are the authentic representatives of the people , " interim president Roberto Micheletti insisted .
On Saturday , the OAS suspended Honduras - the first time the organisation had taken such a measure since Cuba was suspended in 1962 , when it allied itself with the USSR .
Mr Zelaya is a supporter of left - wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
His opponents , which include the Supreme Court and a majority in parliament , accuse him of seeking to prolong his rule .
He had wanted to hold a popular vote on convening a constitutional convention - a move that could have removed the current one - term limit for presidents .

I was reading the May issue of Fortune Small Business , when I stumbled upon a great article .
Inspired by TiVo , one company decided to create a device that cuts your electricity bill by 10 - 15 % .
How do they do it ?
Simple .
Utility companies charge you different rates , depending on the day and time that electricity is consumed .
The cheapest rate is at 3 AM ( no wonder ) .
So this device accumulates electricity when it ’s cheap and then releases it during peak hours , when the rates are much higher .
Brilliant , is n’t it ?
Here is more from that article .
" Our product will allow customers to trim their bills painlessly , " says CEO Peter Corsell .
" Think of it as a kind of TiVo for electricity . "
The device , called GridPoint Protect , is the size of a small file cabinet and connects to the circuitbreaker panel .
( The company also offers a lower - capacity version designed for homes , which costs $ 10,000 . )
A built - in computer powered by a Pentium chip will make intelligent purchase decisions , buying when prices are low , then storing the electricity for later use .
That will make it possible to run your company during the workday with cheaper electricity that you purchased at 3 A .M .
Corsell , 28 , estimates that his device will shave a business 's electric bill by about 15 % .
Assuming monthly charges of $ 2,500 , the system would pay for itself in less than four years .
GridPoint Protect offers a second function : Because it stores electricity , it can double as a backup generator that is safer and faster than many models currently available .
Standard generators run on gas or diesel , and their carbon - monoxide exhaust fumes can be dangerous .
By contrast , GridPoint Protect uses safer gel - style batteries , similar to those that back up cellphone towers .
Standard generators also take a few seconds to power up , but GridPoint Protect kicks in within about 30 milliseconds , fast enough to prevent a company 's computers or other sensitive devices from crashing .
Founded in 2003 , GridPoint has raised $ 18 million from venture capital firms and private investors and now employs a staff of 50 , with no revenues until it sold its first units this spring .
The company features an all - star board of advisors , including tech guru Esther Dyson and Bill Bradley , the former presidential candidate and longtime member of the Senate Energy Committee .
" It 's a smart company , focused on a couple of regions where there 's a real need in the marketplace , " says Daniel Violette , a Boulder energy consultant .
Picture it - one day soon you might be at a cocktail party and encounter someone bragging not about his hot stock picks but about how much he saved on his electric bill .
