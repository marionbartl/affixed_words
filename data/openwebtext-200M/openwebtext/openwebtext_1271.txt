A complete microcontroller development kit for little more than the cost of a bare chip ?
That ’s what STMicroelectronics is promising with their STM8S - Discovery : seven dollars gets you not only a board - mounted 8 - bit microcontroller with an decent range of GPIO pins and functions , but the USB programmer / debugger as well .
The STM8S microcontroller is in a similar class as the ATmega328 chip on latest - generation Arduinos : an 8 - bit 16 MHz core , 32 K flash and 2 K RAM , UART , SPI , I2C , 10 - bit analog - to - digital inputs , timers and interrupts and all the usual goodness .
The Discovery board features a small prototyping area and throws in a touch - sense button for fun as well .
The ST - LINK USB programmer / debugger comes attached , but it ’s easy to crack one off and use this for future STMicro - compatible projects ; clearly a plan of giving away the razor and selling the blades .
The development tools are for Windows only , and novice programmers wo n’t get the same touchy - feely community of support that surrounds Arduino .
But for cost - conscious hackers and for educators needing to equip a whole classroom ( or if you ’re just looking for a stocking stuffer for your geeky nephew ) , it ’s hard to argue with seven bucks for a full plug - and - play setup .

Before Elizabeth Harper was frontwoman for slinky Brooklyn electro - pop trio Class Actress , she was another eponymous singer - songwriter .
And yeah , before she gained some local media renown as a singer - songwriter , Harper was a college drama major .
Those acting classes would appear to have paid off handsomely on the title track from Class Actress ' debut EP , Journal of Ardency .
For me , a big part of this coolly seductive song 's spell lies in the way it gracefully finesses the gulf between someone 's glamorous image of big-city nightlife and the narrator 's lonely , wounded reality .
" You think I 'm livin ' it , livin ' it , livin ' it , livin ' it up , " Harper repeats behind frosty snare thwacks , adding , " It 's a lie , lie . "
The galloping Italo - disco bass line and luxurious rubber - band synths evoke a night of cosmopolitan - clutching revelry at pricey Manhattan clubs , but the ponderously Depeche Mode - ish song title , unshowy melody , and earnest , expressive vocals tacitly acknowledge our narrator will no doubt be going home as she probably went out : alone .
So while the track 's moodily retro aesthetic suggests the nocturnal shadows of Glass Candy or Chromatics , its warm heart and bright hooks bring it closer to the communicative synth - pop of Annie , Little Boots , or stated influence Madonna .
Confessions on a dance floor , for real .

“ We ’ve known for a long time that Parker Griffith ’s principles are either for sale to the highest bidder or can change depending on how the poll results are looking , ” [ Brooks campaign manager Bruce ]
Tucker said .
“ He seems to speak out of both sides of his mouth .
When he ’s in Washington , he gives his support to [ House Speaker ] Nancy Pelosi .
When he’s in the district , he makes her sound terrible . ”
Today McDonald announced he would n't be running after all .
He 's raised nearly a million dollars so far .
One less Blue Dog we 'll have to contend with .
Last August DWT posed the question How Does One Justify Singling Out Just One Blue Dog-- In This Case Parker Griffith Of Alabama-- As The Worst Democrat In The House ?
It was n't a tough case to make , and back at the link I have a chart , a snarky photo and a video of another one nearly as bad .
Then just over a month ago I tried to point out that Griffith , a multimillionaire whose personal self - interest is always with the GOP , was hysterical about the estate tax .
Watch him on the House floor in November making duplicitous Republican Party talking points on the estate tax .
It would be virtually impossible to watch this and not guess he was either already a Republican or about to join that party : Today , when the mainstream media suddenly discovered Parker Griffith for the first time , as he announced he would be joining the GOP , Media Matters was prepared to show that his voting record had never strayed from that of any slimy Republican .
In fact there are 7 House Republicans with either an identical ProgressivePunch score on crucial votes or aone !
He opposed equal pay for women , opposed the stimulus bill , opposed clean energy legislation , opposed healthcare reform , voted against the budget and against regulating the banksters .
Basically , from the day he slipped into the House he was a charter member of the Boehner Boys .
His latest ProgressivePunch score on crucial issues is not just closer to every single Republican in the House than it is to progressives like Donna Edwards and Barbara Lee , it 's closer tothan it is to fellow Blue Dogs and conservatives like Leonard Boswell , Dennis Moore , Jim Cooper and Allen Boyd ( the only Democrat to sign on to Bush 's plan to abolish Social Security ) .
The Republican Party used to hate him and feel he was the perfect target for their fear and smear tactics ( click that NRCC ad ) .
Now they have to decide how heavily to lean on their hand - picked candidate who was due to run against him in November , Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks .
If today 's statement from Brooks ' campaign is any indication , it should be a delightful GOP primary .
Are the Democrats better off without Griffith in the House , forever and inexorably dragging the caucus further right and further away from the interests of working families ?
Well ... you know where the Pope goes poo-poo , right ?
This is the guy , as we mentioned last summer , who promised his constituents that if they re-elected him , he would vote against Nancy Pelosi , who he referred to as a mental case , as Speaker next year .
Now the DCCC wo n't have to waste another $ 1,000,000 trying to save a seat for someone who votes with the GOP all the time .
Come to think of it , they 'll need that money to try to save the seat of the only other House Democrat as bad as Griffith , Mississippi reactionary Travis Childers .
Blue America has a page , Bad Dogs , dedicated to defeating Blue Dogs .
If you have any interest in helping out , please let us know .
A few months ago I spent 30 - 40 sickening minutes on the phone with the DCCC 's recruit for Mike McCaul 's somewhat vulnerable seat in Texas , Jack McDonald .
His sole qualification was that he was rich and willing to spend his own money on a race .
He bragged to me about being a Blue Dog , but when I engaged him on the subject he was unsure what Blue Dogs are all about .
I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that the DCCC had found themselves another disastrous loser .
I called Larry Joe Doherty and begged him to run again .
( He was noncommittal . )

The largest known mass extinction in Earth 's history , about 252 million years ago at the end of the Permian Period , may have been caused by global warming .
A new fossil species suggests that some land animals may have survived the end -Permian extinction by living in cooler climates in Antarctica .
Jörg Fröbisch and Kenneth D. Angielczyk of The Field Museum together with Christian A. Sidor from the University of Washington have identified a distant relative of mammals , Kombuisia antarctica , that apparently survived the mass extinction by living in Antarctica .
The new species belongs to a larger group of extinct mammal relatives , called anomodonts , which were widespread and represented the dominant plant eaters of their time .
" Members of the group burrowed in the ground , walked the surface and lived in trees , " said Fröbisch , the lead author of the study .
" However , Kombuisia antarctica , about the size of a small house cat , was considerably different from today 's mammals -- it likely laid eggs , did n't nurse its young and did n't have fur , and it is uncertain whether it was warm blooded , " said Angielczyk , Assistant Curator of Paleomammology at The Field Museum .
Kombuisia antarctica was not a direct ancestor of living mammals , but it was among the few lineages of animals that survived at a time when a majority of life forms perished .
Scientists are still debating what caused the end - Permian extinction , but it was likely associated with massive volcanic activity in Siberia that could have triggered global warming .
When it served as refuge , Antarctica was located some distance north of its present location , was warmer and was n't covered with permanent glaciers , said the researchers .
The refuge of Kombuisia in Antarctica probably was n't the result of a seasonal migration but rather a longer - term change that saw the animal 's habitat shift southward .
Fossil evidence suggests that small and medium sized animals were more successful at surviving the mass extinction than larger animals .
They may have engaged in " sleep - or - hide " behaviors like hibernation , torpor and burrowing to survive in a difficult environment .
Earlier work by Fröbisch predicted that animals like Kombuisia antarctica should have existed at this time , based on fossils found in South Africa later in the Triassic Period that were relatives of the animals that lived in Antarctica .
" The new discovery fills a gap in the fossil record and contributes to a better understanding of vertebrate survival during the end - Permian mass extinction from a geographic as well as an ecological point of view , " Fröbisch said .
The team found the fossils of the new species among specimens collected more than three decades ago from Antarctica that are part of a collection at the American Museum of Natural History .
" At the time those fossils were collected , paleontologists working in Antarctica focused on seeking evidence for the existence of a supercontinent , Pangaea , that later split apart to become separate land masses , " said Angielczyk .
The fossils collected in Antarctica provided some of the first evidence of Pangaea 's existence , and further analysis of the fossils can refine our understanding of events that unfolded 250 million years ago .
" Finding fossils in the current harsh conditions of Antarctica is difficult , but worthwhile , " said Angielczyk .
" The recent establishment of the Robert A. Pritzker Center for Meteoritics and Polar Studies at The Field Museum recognizes the growing importance of the region , " he said .
This research is part of a collaborative study of Dr. Jörg Fröbisch ( Department of Geology , Field Museum , Chicago ) , Dr. Kenneth D. Angielczyk ( Department of Geology , Field Museum , Chicago ) , and Dr. Christian A. Sidor ( Burke Museum and Department of Biology , University of Washington ) , which will be published online December 3 , 2009 in Naturwissenschaften .
Funding for this research was provided through a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship of the German Research Foundation ( Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft ) to J. Fröbisch and grants of the National Science Foundation to C. A. Sidor .
Dr Pachauri described the row as a " serious issue " for climate research
The head of the UN 's climate science body says claims that UK scientists manipulated data on global warming should be investigated .
Dr Rajendra Pachauri , head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , said the matter could not be swept " under the carpet " .
The allegations emerged after e-mails written and received by UK climate researchers appeared on the internet .
The police are investigating whether the scientists ' computers were hacked .
Dr Pachauri told BBC Radio 4's
The Report programme that the claims were serious and he wants them investigated .
One string of email does not undermine the global science on climate change
Ed Miliband ,
UK Climate Change Secretary
" We will certainly go into the whole lot and then we will take a position on it , " he said .
" We certainly do n't want to brush anything under the carpet .
This is a serious issue and we will look into it in detail . "
The IPCC is the global scientific body established to review and assess the most recent scientific research on climate change .
Every five or six years , it publishes a series of key reports .
The findings in these documents are used by policymakers around the world to shape policies to tackle climate change .
' CLIMATEGATE ' TIMELINE 19 Nov -
Rumours appear on blogs that a hacker had obtained emails from CRU computers 20 Nov - UEA confirms emails and documents from CRU had appeared illegally on the internet 23 Nov - Climate " sceptics " say the e-mails show that data is being manipulated and call for an inquiry 1 Dec - Man at centre of row , Professor Phil Jones , stands down while inquiry is conducted 3 Dec - Saudi chief negotiator says row proves climate change is not caused by humans 3 Dec - UEA commission Sir Muir Russell , a former civil servant , to chair an independent inquiry 4 Dec - Head of UN climate science body says matter cannot be swept " under the carpet "
Chair for climate e-mail review Data row ' will affect Copenhagen ' E -mail row scientist steps down UK climate unit 's e-mails hacked Copenhagen :
What 's your solution ?
The row broke out last month when hundreds of messages between scientists at the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) and their peers around the world were put on the internet along with other documents .
Some observers allege that one of e-mails suggested CRU head Professor Phil Jones wanted certain papers excluded from the UN 's next major assessment of climate science .
Dr Jones , who has stood aside from his job pending the results of an internal review , strenuously denies this was his intention and says other e-mails have been taken out of context .
Critics of the scientific consensus have claimed that the e-mails undermine the case that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are causing global warming , and have dubbed the issue " ClimateGate " .
Phillip Stott , emeritus professor of biogeography at London University , says the allegations could have wider implications for climate researchers and policymakers .
" The IPCC does not carry out climate research , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
CLIMATE ANIMATION
A journey through climate history
" All it does , it brings together all the papers from round the world from peer - reviewing , etc , brings them together to make a position , but it depends of course on the legitimacy of the peer - reviewing process and that , in a sense , is what 's being brought into question . "
Saudi Arabia 's lead climate negotiator has said the e-mail row will have a " huge impact " on next week 's UN climate summit in Copenhagen .
Mohammad Al - Sabban told BBC
News that he expects it to derail the single biggest objective of the summit - to agree limitations on greenhouse gas emissions .
" It appears from the details of the scandal that there is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change , " he told BBC News .
" Climate is changing for thousands of years , but for natural and not human - induced reasons .
" So , whatever the international community does to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will have no effect on the climate 's natural variability . "
Jonathon Porritt , the former chairman of the UK Sustainable Development Commission , called the developments " very worrying " because the row threatened to undermine the integrity of the IPCC .
" Without that integrity , politicians cannot necessarily trust what the scientists have been telling them , " he warned .
" Clearing up the issue is absolutely crucial . "
But he added : " Having said that , we do need to be careful about which voices we are listening to .
" Whatever the significance of the e-mails are , it does not show that there is no link between human activity and climate change . "
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full
The UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband said the idea that the e-mail row would derail the Copenhagen summit was " nonsense " .
" One string of e-mails does not undermine the global science on climate change , " he told BBC News .
" There will be people who want to use it to say that this somehow casts doubt on Copenhagen or the scientific evidence ; frankly , I think that is nonsense and I think we need to resist listening to those siren voices . "
The University of East Anglia has announced that it has commissioned an independent review into how the e-mails ended up on the internet .
The review will cover a number of areas , including whether there is evidence of suppression or manipulation of data , and make recommendations about the management of its data .
I ’ve written at length how I wish version numbers were boring and why they are n’t .
What I have n’t done well is to express what I think that means .
In some recent conversations on the perl5 - porters mailing list and # p5p on IRC , I took a stab at a definition , which I ’ll repost here .
In part , my “ wishlist ” is to harmonize how $ VERSION is defined , how $ VERSION is statically parsed by ExtUtils : : MM-> parse_version and Module : : Build : : ModuleInfo , how $ VERSION is specified to use ( ) , what gets returned by UNIVERSAL :: VERSION and what version -> new ( $ version ) gives .
I ’d like to be able to “ round - trip ” a version any which way .
set it via package NAME VERSION
statically parse it and get the same thing back
eval “ use Foo $ version ” and succeed
get the same thing back from Foo->VERSION
give it to version -> new ( ) and get back the same thing .
I ’ve posted a test file that demonstrates these desired behaviors using the new ‘ package NAME VERSION ’ syntax in Perl 5.11.2 .
Here are some of the things that do n’t work :
‘ 01.23 ’ – this is interpreted as an octal .
Oops !
‘ 1_000 ’ – statically parsed with the underscore , but interpreted without by ‘ use NAME VERSION ’ , and version .
pm does n’t like it at all
‘v1.1000.2345 ’ – dotted integer components over 999 bleed over into the next field when converted to decimal , so this is really equivalent to decimal version 2.002345
‘v1.2_3 ’ – is this an “ alpha ” like v1.2.3 or is this v1.23.0 ?
Depending how this is expressed it can be interpreted either way
‘ 1.23_01 ’ – a good old fashioned “ alpha ” decimal version – but again , it parses statically one way but is interpreted another .
It ’s very possibly I ’m being too draconian – my wishlist means alpha version numbers would go away entirely ( and would have to be replaced with something else , certainly . )
But if I had to start over , these criteria would make version numbers much easier to deal with .
Dropping the atomic bombs on Japan were acts of race hatred against " Japs . "
They were heinous war crimes ; unwarranted and premeditated mass murder on a populace that was 95 % civilian — of course the vast majority were women and children .
The bombs were completely unnecessary to bring about a Japanese surrender and then US President Harry S. Truman knew it .
The atomic bombs did not save one million lives .
US President Harry S. Truman also knew that the emperor of Japan had accepted the terms of an unconditional surrender 19 days before the first atomic bomb was dropped .
Truman and his staff were cognizant and fully aware that the Japanese wanted to surrender ; Soviet Leader Joseph Stalin knew it ; and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his staff knew it also .
They all knew , yet they chose to ignore the Japanese emperor ’s official request to accept a Japanese surrender .
Here ’s the undeniable proof from Truman ’s own hand .
Consider :
On July 26 , 1945 , the Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender otherwise known as the Potsdam Declaration was issued .
Article 13 of that declaration plainly states :
We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces , and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action .
The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction .
This declaration was passed on through public as well as private channels and was well known to the government of Japan .
The allies had issued a similar ultimatum to Nazi Germany at the end of the Casablanca Conference in 1943 and reconfirmed it at Yalta in 1945 .
There was n’t a government in the world who did n’t understand the stated purpose of the Allies .
On July 18 , 1945 , exactly 19 days before the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan , in his own handwritten diary , Harry S. Truman wrote :
" Discussed Manhattan ( it is a success ) .
Decided to tell Stalin about it .
Stalin had told P.M. ( Churchill ) of telegram from Jap emperor asking for peace … "
This proves beyond a shadow of doubt that Truman knew the Japanese emperor had accepted the terms for unconditional surrender three weeks before the atomic bomb was dropped .
The term " Japs " was , of course , a racial slur against the Japanese in the 1940 ’s as much as it is today .
On top of that , further evidence shows that President Truman , along with his top advisers , had all agreed that Japan was trying to surrender at least three days before the first atomic bomb was dropped but feared that Japan might surrender to the Russians .
Proof of this can be found in the diary of Walter Brown , assistant to Secretary of State James F. Byrnes .
In his entry of August 3 , 1945 it is written that the President , Byrnes , and Admiral William D. Leahy , Chief of Staff to the President :
“ agrred [ sic ] Japas [ sic ] looking for peace .
( Leahy had another report from Pacific ) President afraid they will sue for peace through Russia instead of some country like Sweden . ” ( See p. 415 , Chapter 33 )
Further proof that Truman ordered the atomic bombings of Japan not for the stated reason of bringing about a Japanese surrender and saving one million American lives , but to frighten the Soviets out of Eastern Europe , and to keep them from expanding influence in Asia , comes from Manhattan Project scientist Leo Szilard .
Szilard met with US Secretary of State James Byrnes on May 28 , 1945 .
Byrnes was Truman ’s most trusted advisor and the only cabinet member who was present at Yalta .
Szilard recalled what Byrne ’s thinking was :
“ [ Byrnes ] was concerned about Russia ’s postwar behavior .
Russian troops had moved into Hungary and Rumania , and Byrnes thought it would be very difficult to persuade Russia to withdraw her troops from these countries , that Russia might be more manageable if impressed by American military might , and that a demonstration of the bomb might impress Russia . ” — ( Leo Szilard : His Version of the Facts , pg. 184 ) .
The Japanese knew what the terms for surrender were and the emperor of Japan personally had sent a telegram asking to surrender .
Nevertheless , knowing fully well that the Japanese had accepted those terms of unconditional surrender and knowing that an invasion of Japan was not necessary to bring about the end of the war , the United States became the very first nation in the history of the world to use an atomic weapon of genocide and mass destruction on a civilian city .
Truman and his advisors wanted to scare the Russians .
The USA had an atomic bomb and wanted to use it .
Who better to use it on than inferior " Japs " ?
Who better to test a weapon on than people who were not white and who were considered savages ?
Who could possibly think that race hatred by Americans did not play a huge part in this crime ?
Considering the above , how could any intelligent , self - respecting American ever believe the risible excuse that because the Japanese refused to surrender , the USA was forced to drop not one , but two atomic bombs on them to force them into quitting the war saving one million lives ?
That ’s an out - and - out lie .
Harry S. Truman , without a shadow of doubt , by your own admission , and that of your closest advisors , you are guilty of pre-meditated serial killings and mass murder in the first degree .
The Best of Mike ( in Tokyo ) Rogers
Mr Sarkozy is the first French leader to attend a Commonwealth summit UK PM Gordon Brown and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have proposed a multi-billion - dollar fund to help developing nations deal with climate change .
Mr Brown said the $ 10bn ( £ 6 bn ) fund should also be used to help developing nations cut greenhouse gas emissions .
Both spoke at the Commonwealth summit in Trinidad , the last major world forum before the global summit on climate change in Copenhagen on 7 December .
Many Commonwealth members are island states threatened by rising sea levels .
Mr Sarkozy , with UN chief Ban Ki-moon and Danish Prime Minister Prime Lars Loekke Rasmussen , is there to give weight to any climate change statement .
The topic was the only issue on the Commonwealth summit's agenda for the first day .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Opening the Trinidad meeting , Queen Elizabeth II said the Commonwealth had an opportunity to lead once more on climate change .
" The threat to our environment is not a new concern but it is now a global challenge which will continue to affect the security and stability of millions for years to come , " she said .
' Absolutely serious '
Mr Brown said half of the $ 10bn fund should go towards helping developing nations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and the other half towards helping them adapt to climate change .
ANALYSIS James Robbins , BBC diplomatic correspondent
It 's a highly unorthodox summit , which may be just what the Commonwealth needed to counter charges it is an irrelevant relic of Britain 's imperial past .
This time , key leaders from outside the Commonwealth were invited to the first day - given over entirely to the dominant world issue : climate change .
The UN secretary - general , the French president , and Denmark 's prime minister seized the chance of the last major political gathering before December 's crucial global negotiations to urge the heads of more than 50 nations here to lead by example and ease deadlocks between the developed and developing world .
If the Commonwealth is a microcosm of the wider world , spanning giant India , rich Britain , Australia and Canada , as well as some of the smallest and most vulnerable island states like the Maldives , then where better to argue that all leaders should prepare to make bold concessions to achieve a better outcome in Copenhagen ?
Judging whether or not this Summit really makes a difference may be impossible , but it has certainly raised the Commonwealth 's profile , and reminded the world beyond the Commonwealth that , at the very least , huge amounts of political effort are being expended to try to maximise success in Copenhagen .
The first cash would be made available next year , he said , before any emissions deal could take effect .
He is offering $ 800 m from the UK over three years , money that has already been budgeted for .
" What I feel the developing countries need to know is that we are absolutely serious that we would start now , " he said , quoted by Reuters news agency .
In separate remarks quoted by AFP news agency , Mr Sarkozy proposed a funding programme of $ 10bn a year in the years 2010 - 12 , and an " ambitious mechanism " for payments beyond those years .
He did not indicate how much France was prepared to contribute .
The two leaders said the move could encourage developing nations concerned about the economic consequences of reducing emissions to sign up to a climate treaty .
' Pressure ' on India The Commonwealth 's 53 nations comprise nearly two billion people , a third of the planet 's population .
The leaders are meeting days after pledges by the US and China to limit their greenhouse gas emissions , amid concerns that the Copenhagen meeting could fail to agree substantial cuts .
India has admitted that China 's decision to unveil emissions targets two weeks before the Copenhagen summit has put it under pressure .
THE COMMONWEALTH
Made up of former British colonies , dependencies and other territories , plus Mozambique Founded in 1931 Currently 53 members , with combined population of 1.8 billion Headed by British monarch , but no allegiance to Crown since 1947 Heads of government meet every two years
Profile : The Commonwealth What would the Commonwealth do for Rwanda ?
What 's your Copenhagen solution ?
Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh said China 's decision was a " wake - up call to India " .
Mr Ban said new and positive commitments from several countries over recent days were very heartening .
" My message to all the world leaders has been simple : stay focused , stay committed - and come to Copenhagen and seal a deal , " he said .
But in another Commonwealth country , Australia , the government 's plans to enact a law for an emissions trading scheme have been thrown into chaos by a revolt within the opposition Liberal Party , whose support is required to pass the bill .
The summit will also discuss Rwanda 's entry into the English - speaking club .
The Francophone nation has been seeking membership following disagreements with France over events leading up to the 1994 genocide .
The issue is likely to be controversial .
The nation 's entry bid has received strong backing from some member states .
However , some rights activists are angry that entry would reward a nation they say is guilty of abuses dating back to the 1994 genocide .
Meanwhile the UK has indicated it will try to block Sri Lanka 's bid to host the next Commonwealth summit over its handling of the recent war .
A UK government source said Mr Brown had " real concerns about Sri Lanka 's bid " .

Think about just how bizarre it is for Republicans to position themselves as the defenders of unrestricted Medicare spending .
First of all , the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan  and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare ’s creation , warning that it would destroy American freedom .
( Honest . )
In the 1990s , Newt Gingrich tried to force drastic cuts in Medicare financing .
And in recent years , Republicans have repeatedly decried the growth in entitlement spending  growth that is largely driven by rising health care costs .
But the Obama administration ’s plan to expand coverage relies in part on savings from Medicare .
And since the G.O.P. opposes anything that might be good for Mr. Obama , it has become the passionate defender of ineffective medical procedures and overpayments to insurance companies .
How did one of our great political parties become so ruthless , so willing to embrace scorched - earth tactics even if so doing undermines the ability of any future administration to govern ?
The key point is that ever since the Reagan years , the Republican Party has been dominated by radicals  ideologues and / or apparatchiks who , at a fundamental level , do not accept anyone else ’s right to govern .
Anyone surprised by the venomous , over - the - top opposition to Mr. Obama must have forgotten the Clinton years .
Remember when Rush Limbaugh suggested that Hillary Clinton was a party to murder ?
When Newt Gingrich shut down the federal government in an attempt to bully Bill Clinton into accepting those Medicare cuts ?
And let ’s not even talk about the impeachment saga .
The only difference now is that the G.O.P. is in a weaker position , having lost control not just of Congress but , to a large extent , of the terms of debate .
The public no longer buys conservative ideology the way it used to ; the old attacks on Big Government and paeans to the magic of the marketplace have lost their resonance .
Yet conservatives retain their belief that they , and only they , should govern .
The result has been a cynical , ends - justify - the - means approach .
Hastening the day when the rightful governing party returns to power is all that matters , so the G.O.P. will seize any club at hand with which to beat the current administration .
It ’s an ugly picture .
But it ’s the truth .
And it ’s a truth anyone trying to find solutions to America ’s real problems has to understand .
A singing toy mouse has been recalled after complaints that it sings the words " paedophile , paedophile " , the Sun reports .
Listen to the song played on the Today programme .
A fascinating , hot - off - the - presses story emerges from the emails that were hacked yesterday from the University of East Anglia ’s Hadley Climatic Research Centre .
It is one of many exchanges that shed light on the priority that the global warming alarmists give to politics and career advancement over science .
The story began when Steve McIntyre , the same researcher who was largely responsible for destroying Michael Mann ’s “ hockey stick ” graph purporting to show unprecedented warming in the 20th century , turned his attention to a famous article published by Keith Briffa of East Anglia ’s CRU in 2000 .
This article analyzed the diameters of tree rings , including rings from an area called Yamal in Siberia , and conveniently generated another hockey - stick shaped graph .
You can read an account of the ensuing controversy here .
McIntyre ’s work appeared to show that Briffa had cherry - picked trees in order to get the result he was looking for .
One fact that this story highlights is that global warming alarmists publish their results in scientific journals , but refuse to make the underlying data publicly available so that the validity of their analyses can be checked .
McIntyre ’s revelations caused a firestorm of controversy , in response to which the alarmist community circled its wagons to fend off the threat from an outsider .
This process can be clearly seen in the East Anglia emails .
The alarmists ’ effort to respond to McIntyre was complicated by the fact that Briffa had been ill and undergone surgery , and was then recuperating .
So several of them wrote to Briffa ’s co-author , Tim Osborn , for advice on how to respond to McIntyre ’s critique .
Osborn replied on September 29 , 2009 :
Hi Mike and Gavin , thanks for your emails re McIntyre , Yamal and Keith .
I ’ll pass on your best wishes for his recovery when I next speak to Keith .
He ’s been off almost 4 months now and wo n’t be back for at least another month ….
Regarding Yamal , I ’m afraid I know very little about the whole thing — other than that I am 100 % confident that “ The tree ring data was hand - picked to get the desired result ” is complete crap .
Having one ’s integrity questioned like this must make your blood boil … .
Apart from Keith , I think Tom Melvin here is the only person who could shed light on the McIntyre criticisms of Yamal .
But he can be a rather loose cannon and should n’t be directly contacted about this ….
So : these scientists do n’t really have any idea whether McIntyre ’s critique of Briffa ’s work is correct or not .
Even Briffa ’s co-author professes ignorance .
There is one person they could approach who could “ shed light on the McIntyre criticisms of Yamal . ”
But they do n’t do it .
Why ?
Because “ he can be rather a loose cannon and should n’t be directly contacted …. ”
In other words , his loyalty to the cause of climate alarmism may not be absolute .
This is much like the case noted here where Michael Mann , one of the recipients of the above email , warns against sharing information with someone named
Andy because he is “ not as predictable as we ’d like . ”
Despite having no idea what the facts are , the alarmists do n’t hesitate to formulate a position .
Thus , on the next day , September 30 , Osborn writes :
Keith ’s temporarily come in to get a handle on all this , but it will take time .
Likely outcome is ( 1 ) brief holding note that no cherry - picking was done and demonstrating data selection is defendable by our time tomorrow ; ( 2 ) longer piece with more evaluation etc. in around a week .
No point is posting something that turns out to be wrong .
That ’s good enough for Osborn ’s fellow alarmists .
Michael Mann replies :
great–thanks
Tim , sounds like we have a plan .
in our post , which we ’ll target for tomorrow as well , we ’ll simply link to whatever CRU puts up and re-iterate the sentiment of the temporary short response ( i.e. that there was no cherry - picking , a careful and defensible selection procedure was used ) and we ’ll mostly focus on the broader issues , i.e. that any impact of this one series in the vast array of paleoclimate reconstructions ( and the importance of the paleoclimate reconstructions themselves ) has been over - stated , why these sorts of attacks are not legitimate science , etc .
Note that the alarmists are willing to denounce McIntyre ’s work as “ not legitimate science ” even though , at this point , they still have no idea whether his analysis was right or wrong .
That is not , however , what they tell the outside world .
On September 29 , Andrew Revkin , environmental reporter for the New York Times , wrote to Mann asking about McIntyre ’s critique :
needless to say , seems the 2008 pnas paper showing that without tree rings still solid picture of unusual recent warmth , but McIntyre is getting wide play for his statements about Yamal data - set selectivity .
Has he communicated directly to you on this and / or is there any indication he ’s seeking journal publication for his deconstruct ?
Mann , ignorant of the facts , responds by slandering McIntyre :
Hi Andy , I ’m fairly certain Keith is out of contact right now recovering from an operation , and is not in a position to respond to these attacks .
However , the preliminary information I have from others familiar with these data is that the attacks are bogus .
It is unclear that this particular series was used in any of our reconstructions ( some of the underlying chronologies may be the same , but I ’m fairly certain the versions of these data we have used are based on a different composite and standardization method ) , let alone any of the dozen other reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean temperature shown in the most recent IPCC report , which come to the conclusion that recent warming is anomalous in a long - term context .
So , even if there were a problem w/ these data , it would n’t matter as far as the key conclusions regarding past warmth are concerned .
But I do n’t think there is any problem with these data , rather it appears that McIntyre has greatly distorted the actual information content of these data .
Given what is said in the other emails , that last attack on McIntyre appears to be simply fabricated out of whole cloth .
Mann concludes by buttering up Revkin :
Fortunately , the prestige press does n’t fall for this sort of stuff , right ?
mike
Of course not !
Revkin replies , “ Thanks heaps . ”
At the same time they were issuing these assurances to outsiders , however , the alarmists ’ internal communications were much more equivocal .
On September 30 , the day after he corresponded with Revkin , Mann asked Tim Osborn to confirm that a key 2006 paper co-authored by Osborn and Briffa was untainted by what is implicitly acknowledged to be Briffa ’s bad Yamal data :
And Osborn and Briffa ’06 is also immune to this issue , as it eliminated any combination of up to 3 of the proxies and showed the result was essentially the same ( fair to say this Tim ? ) .
Osborn ’s reply is hedged at best , and includes a rather insouciant admission that he is “ amazed ” that the journal Science agreed to publish his paper in the first place :
Mike ,
yes , you ’re right : figs S4 - S6 in our supplementary information do indeed show results leaving out individual , groups of two , and groups of three proxies , respectively .
It ’s attached .
I would n’t say we were immune to the issue — results are similar for these leave 1 , 2 or 3 out cases , but they certainly are not as strong as the case with all 14 proxies .
Certainly in figure S6 , there are some cases with 3 omitted ( i.e. some sets of 11 ) where modern results are comparable with intermittent periods between 800 and 1100 .
Plus there is the additional uncertainty , discussed on the final page of the supplementary information , associated with linking the proxy records to real temperatures ( remember we have no formal calibration , we ’re just counting proxies —
I ’m still amazed that Science agreed to publish something where the main analysis only involves counting from 1 to 14 !
:-) ) .
But this is fine , since the IPCC AR4 and other assessments are not saying the evidence is 100 % conclusive ( or even 90 % conclusive ) but just “ likely ” that modern is warmer than M[ edieval ] W[arm ] P[eriod ] . …
So , this Yamal thing does n’t damage Osborn & Briffa ( 2006 ) , but important to note that O&B ( 2006 ) and others support the “ likely ” statement rather than being conclusive .
Cheers
Tim
Another member of the climate alarmist cabal , Tom Wigley , gave this darker assessment of Briffa ’s errors with regard to the tree ring data on October 5 .
Note in particular his concern about the alarmists ’ practice of withholding data from public review :
Phil ,
It is distressing to read that American Stinker item .
But Keith does seem to have got himself into a mess .
As I pointed out in emails , Yamal is insignificant .
And you say that ( contrary to what M& M say ) Yamal is * not* used in MBH , etc . …
But , more generally , ( even if it * is* irrelevant ) how does Keith explain the McIntyre plot that compares Yamal - 12 with Yamal - all ?
And how does he explain the apparent “ selection ” of the less well - replicated chronology rather that the later ( better replicated ) chronology ?
Of course , I do n’t know how often Yamal - 12 has really been used in recent , post - 1995 , work .
I suspect from what you say it is much less often that M&M say — but where did they get their information ?
I presume they went thru papers to see if Yamal was cited , a pretty foolproof method if you ask me .
Perhaps these things can be explained clearly and concisely — but I am not sure Keith is able to do this as he is too close to the issue and probably quite pissed of [f ] .
And the issue of with - holding data is still a hot potato , one that affects both you and Keith ( and Mann ) .
Yes , there are reasons — but many * good * scientists appear to be unsympathetic to these .
The trouble here is that with - holding data looks like hiding something , and hiding means ( in some eyes ) that it is bogus science that is being hidden .
I think Keith needs to be very , very careful in how he handles this .
I ’d be willing to check over anything he puts together .
Tom .
This strikes me as a damning commentary on the entire alarmist enterprise .
Meanwhile , not only are Briffa ’s data flawed and seemingly cherry - picked , the assumptions on which the tree -ring studies are based may be bogus in the first place .
The email collection includes these two messages from a plant scientist , both within the last 60 days :
Dear Professor Briffa , my apologies for contacting you directly , particularly since I hear that you are unwell .
However the recent release of tree ring data by CRU has prompted much discussion and indeed disquiet about the methodology and conclusions of a number of key papers by you and co-workers .
As an environmental plant physiologist , I have followed the long debate starting with Mann et al ( 1998 ) and through to Kaufman et al ( 2009 ) .
As time has progressed I have found myself more concerned with the whole scientific basis of dendroclimatology .
In particular ;
1 ) The appropriateness of the statistical analyses employed
2 ) The reliance on the same small datasets in these multiple studies
3 ) The concept of “ teleconnection ” by which certain trees respond to the “ Global Temperature Field ” , rather than local climate
4 ) The assumption that tree ring width and density are related to temperature in a linear manner .
Whilst I would not describe myself as an expert statistician , I do use inferential statistics routinely for both research and teaching and find difficulty in understanding the statistical rationale in these papers .
As a plant physiologist I can say without hesitation that points 3 and 4 do not agree with the accepted science .
There is a saying that “ extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof ” .
Given the scientific , political and economic importance of these papers , further detailed explanation is urgently required .
Yours sincerely ,
Dr. Don Keiller .
Tree ring studies are vitally important to the conclusions reached by the U.N. ’s IPCC report , which is the main foundation for the claim that anthropogenic global warming has been “ proved . ”
That being the case , one would think that Briffa , one of the two or three primary authors of the tree ring studies , would have a ready response to these very basic questions .
But no : he did not reply to Dr. Keiller ’s email .
That prompted this second inquiry from Dr. Keiller :
Dear Professor Briffa , I am pleased to hear that you appear to have recovered from your recent illness sufficiently to post a response to the controversy surrounding the use of the Yamal chronology ; ( [ 5 ] http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/yamal2009/cautious/cautious.htm) and the chronology itself ; ( [ 6 ]
http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/people/briffa/yamal2009/)
Unfortunately I find your explanations lacking in scientific rigour and I am more inclined to believe the analysis of McIntyre ( [ 7 ]
http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=7588)
Can I have a straightforward answer to the following questions
1 ) Are the reconstructions sensitive to the removal of either the Yamal data and Strip pine bristlecones , either when present singly or in combination ?
2 ) Why these series , when incorporated with white noise as a background , can still produce a Hockey - Stick shaped graph if they have , as you suggest , a low individual weighting ?
And once you have done this , please do me the courtesy of answering my initial email .
Dr. D.R. Keiller
Again , one might assume that if the science surrounding global warming is settled , the alarmists would have good answers to such basic questions , and certainly would be willing to engage in debate in a spirit of open - minded inquiry .
Such , however , is not the case .
Phil Jones of East Anglia advised Briffa against trying to respond to the plant scientist on October 20 :
Keith ,
There is a lot more there on CA now .
[ I ’m pretty sure CA is Climate Audit , a web site where McIntyre posts . ]
I would be very wary about responding to this person now having seen what McIntyre has put up .
You and Tim talked about Yamal .
Why have the bristlecones come in now . [ 1 ]
http://www.climateaudit.org/?p=7588#comments
This is what happens – they just keep moving the goalposts .
Maybe get Tim to redo OB2006 without a few more series .
Cheers
Phil
As far as I can tell from the email archive , Briffa never did respond to the plant scientist .
Jones ’s email warning Briffa to be “ very wary about responding to this person now having seen what McIntyre has put up ” was written just three weeks ago .
It , along with the rest of the email archive , makes an utter mockery of the alarmists ’ claim that the science of global warming is settled in their favor .
On the contrary , the conclusion an observer is likely to draw from the CRU archive is that the climate alarmists are making up the science as they go along and are fitting facts to reach a predetermined conclusion rather than objectively seeking after truth .
What they are doing is politics , not science .
When I was in law school , this story was told about accountants : A CEO is going to hire a new accountant and summons a series of candidates .
He asks each applicant , “ What is two plus two ? ”
The first two candidates answer , “ Four . ”
They do n’t get the job .
The third responds , “ What do you want it to be ? ”
He gets hired .
The climate alarmists ’ attitude toward data appears to me much the same as that fictional accountant ’s attitude toward arithmetic .
UPDATE : More here and here .
And that ’s not all , for the week ending Dec 13th , there were 815 new snowfall records set .

looking for the aliens among us
Ancient astronaut enthusiasts are sure that humans were created by alien experiments .
And this time , they say they have tangible proof .
One would think that as popular science publications overflow with serious musings about what actual aliens might look like and what their bio-chemical compositions might be , the modern myth of human / alien hybrids walking among us would be discarded even by the most ardent ufologists .
And one would be wrong .
At least one follower of the ancient astronaut theory , Lloyd Pye , is determined to prove that aliens and humans knew each other in a very intimate way and he thinks he has the direct , physical evidence to convince scientists .
That evidence is a 900 year old skull of a young boy he calls the Starchild .
Found in Mexico during the 1930s , it ’s an odd artifact with an abnormally large space for a brain , shallow eye sockets with oval orbits , and canals for the optic nerves situated in the wrong place .
According to Pye , it looks like the result of a Gray alien and a human creating a hybrid and he ’s submitted the skull for DNA testing several times to prove that there may be some traces of an extraterrestrial lineage somewhere in its genome .
So far , the scientists who ’ve tested the sample confirmed that the child ’s mother was definitely human .
From the father ’s side , things are rather fuzzy at best so Pye is using that ambiguity to argue that the child ’s dad could very well be an alien .
Of course just because we have n’t been able to determine a genetic profile of the father does n’t mean that we need to set our sights on Zeta Riticuli .
But as most skeptics know , when it comes to pseudoscience , negative evidence carries the same weight to believers as any tangible proof .
This is why rather than provide a serious explanation for any of the mysteries of the skull , Pye simply exaggerates them and keeps reminding us that it looks an awful lot like the head of a Gray if you squint hard enough .
He also dodges the question of how alien genomes would resemble our own closely enough for producion of viable offspring and how we could detect some trace of genetic manipulation by an advanced extraterrestrial species .
In other words , Pye does n’t even know what he ’s trying to find other than validation for his ideas .
You see , some proponents of the ancient astronaut theory need a little something extra to their science to get that feeling of uniqueness , significance and companionship that most religious beliefs try to offer .
They ’re too skeptical about a traditional deity and so they embrace the idea of alien overlords because alien life is at least scientifically plausible .
When something in human history gives them pause , they use alien influence to craft an answer for themselves .
How did apes mutate into intelligent humans ?
Genetic “ upgrade ” from aliens who were experimenting with our biosphere at the time .
How did we go from cave dwellers to residents of vast city states that were the seeds of empires ?
Extraterrestrial guidance .
For every mystery or gap in their knowledge , there ’s a wide variety of alien tales to choose from , many of which combine ancient fiction or New Age beliefs into complex mythologies .
For them , it makes being human a lot more exciting .
This is why a strange skull which can be a handy Rorschach test for skeptics and believers alike is n’t just an interesting way to make money and gain publicity for Pye and his fans .
It ’s something to hold on to almost like a religious relic .
And because it ’s seems like the proof they ’ve been seeking all these years , they insist that its abnormalities are n’t abnormalities at all and that no doctor can classify them as human disorders , even if the tentative expert conclusion is that the skull represents a rare and severe case of brachycephaly .
It ’s just one of those beliefs that ’s too spectacular to let go without a fight .
SEOUL -- Prime Minister Stephen Harper will join more than 50 prime ministers and presidents at the leaders ’ summit on climate change in Copenhagen and push for a binding deal to commit the nations to cutting greenhouse gas emissions , Canwest News Service has learned .
The United Nations Conference on Climate Change begins in Copenhagen on Monday and culminates on Dec. 17 and 18 with a leaders ’ summit .
Over the weekend , U.S. President Barack Obama changed his travel plans and will now attend the leaders ’ meetings .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown will also be at the leaders ’ meetings .
Harper had said he would attend the conference but had not set a date for his attendance .
Now , Canwest News Service has learned , Harper will be there for the leaders ’ summit , although his aides caution that his plans have not yet been finalized .
“ The world needs a climate change deal , ” Harper said in Shanghai on the weekend during his visit to China .
“ The world wants a climate change deal , so I will remain very optimistic that everybody ’s moving in the right direction and something will come together in Copenhagen .
It may not be everything that everybody wants , but it ’s important that we make progress . ”
In Copenhagen , Harper will push for a binding deal , although it is still unclear what Canada ’s position is on the kind of targets that ought to be in that agreement .
Nevertheless , his aides say , he will stress that an agreement must be reached .
“ We have to have a deal .
We ca n’t just keep putting it off to the next summit , ” one of his closest advisers said .
Scientists say if greenhouse gases are not reduced and the change in global average temperature is not held to less than two degrees Celsius , there could be catastrophic environmental effects , such as prolonged drought , crop failures , floods , and rising sea levels , which will drown some smaller Pacific and Indian Ocean nations .
Harper ’s aides also say they are not being distracted by , nor do they want to argue about , the scandal involving some climate - change scientists who , in private e-mail messages that have surfaced over the past few weeks , suggested data supporting the conclusion that man-made pollution is causing climate change were altered or deleted .
“ One or two scientists fudging data does n’t mean the problem does n’t exist .
It ’s real , ” said one of Harper ’s closest advisers .
Canada has been painted by some , notably those in Europe and Great Britain , as “ the dirty old man on climate change , ” an image many environment activists in Canada blame Harper for .
The Harper government rejected the Kyoto Protocol and , despite promises to do so since being elected in 2006 , has yet to implement regulations to force Canadian polluters to cut greenhouse gases .
Instead , at almost every international forum where climate change has been discussed for the last three years , Harper has insisted that an effective international deal on climate change must , unlike the Kyoto Protocol , include the United States and China as signatories , as those two countries are the world ’s biggest polluters .
Johnnie Walker , owned by Diageo , did a brilliant ad / infomercial for their premium whisky .
The ad is called , “ The man who walked all around the World ” .
It is supposedly the true story behind Johnnie Walker and how from he started to produce one of the finest blends that Scotland has ever sold , from his small grocer store in Kilmarnock .
Of course , it is all weepy .
Of course , given Diageo is a giant company , this internet only advert has a large budget .
You are watching an ad that cost £ 1000 a second to make – even though all it really is is Robert Carlyle walking down a road .
So of course , it will pull a few heart strings .
( Heart strings being pulled and alcohol are not a good idea ) .
On an aside , Robert Carlyle certainly sounds more Scottish in this ad than he does normally .
However , the heart strings being pulled are not those of the viewer .
They belong to those who buy Johnnie Walkers and those who made it .
Diageo closed their bottling plant in Kilmarnock .
The town that had a 189 history with Johnnie Walker .
Over 700 people lost their jobs .
A decision confirmed in September , despite strong community opposition .
So much for the heart strings .
The $ $ $s always come first .
The Johnnie Walker you buy from now on will have no association with Kilmarnock .
It will be one of many cheap blended whiskies .
It may have Johnnie Walker on the label , but it will have no actual association with the town of Kilmarnock .

A researcher has blown the whistle on Thomas the Tank Engine , saying the classic series is pushing " conservative political ideology " onto kids .
Storylines written for Thomas and his steam - powered friends appeared to " punish individual initiative " , the Canadian study found , while female characters were shunted into support roles only .
Political scientist Shauna Wilton , who is an assistant professor in the Department of Social Sciences at University of Alberta 's Augustana Campus , said parents should be more mindful of children 's programming .
It played a major role in shaping a child 's conception of the world and in the case of Thomas the Tank Engine , it was not always constructive .
Dr Wilton said the show conveyed a number of positive political values such as tolerance , listening , communicating with others and contributing to the community .
Believe it or not , Windows 7's successor(s ) have been in the planning and early development stages for a while now .
We have n't posted anything about any of them yet , but we 've been watching closely to see if anything really interesting turned up .
Exactly two weeks ago , it did .
A LinkedIn profile , which has already been taken down , for a Robert Morgan , Senior Research & Development at Microsoft , has shone a sliver of light on the possibility of 128 - bit support coming to Windows 8 .
According to the LinkedIn page , which has been removed since , Morgan has been with the software giant since January 2002 , but we 're more intrigued with what his profile ( first paragraph ) and his status ( second paragraph ) before they disappeared :
Working in high security department for research and development involving strategic planning for medium and longterm projects .
Research & Development projects including 128 bit architecture compatibility with the Windows 8 kernel and Windows 9 project plan .
Forming relationships with major partners : Intel , AMD , HP , and IBM .
Robert Morgan is working to get IA - 128 working backwards with full binary compatibility on the existing IA - 64 instructions in the hardware simulation to work for Windows 8 and definitely Windows 9 .
Windows 8
News found Morgan 's profile first and immediately started trying to get in contact with him over Linked In .
When we saw this , we leaned back and waited to see if they could get a response from him .
They did .
The site claims it has managed to get an exclusive interview with Morgan and is letting its readers to ask questions .
The deadline is October 11 , 2009 so head on over and post your queries .
This news is interesting because we always thought Windows 7 would be the last release that had 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions .
This was brought on by the fact that Windows Server 2008 R2 , the server version of Windows 7 , was the first Windows Server release to be 64 - bit only .
The next client version of Windows should therefore follow suit , but apparently Microsoft is going to prepare it for 128 - bit as well .
We 're not saying Windows 8 will definitely come in 64 - bit and 128 - bit flavors , but Microsoft is moving down that path , and at the very least , Windows 9 just might .
While this little tidbit is news on its own , we feel it 's necessary to look at what we 've heard about Windows 8 so far .
In April 2009 , Codename Windows spotted a Microsoft job posting for a Lead Software Development Engineer in Test with this interesting description :
DFSR is Microsoft 's premier file replication engine and is an integral part of our branch office strategy and File Server role .
It can scale to thousands of servers and replicate hundreds of terabytes of data .
We have shipped the technology that powers file sharing in Windows Live Messenger , Windows Meeting Spaces ( Vista ) and Branch Office replication in Windows Server 2008 which has strong customer deployment .
DFSR technology saves MS - IT and our customers more than 80 % WAN bandwidth by using advanced On - The - Wire differential compression .
For the upcoming version of Windows , new critical features are being worked on including cluster support and support for one way replication .
The core engine is also being reworked to provide dramatic performance improvements .
We will also soon be starting major improvements for Windows 8 where we will be including innovative features which will revolutionize file access in branch offices .
That same month , ZDNet found another job posting that also described some interesting details :
In Windows Server 2008 R2 release , the Server UX Test team ( under the File Server Management organization ) is finalizing the MMC [ Microsoft Management Console ] based User eXperience ( UX ) / Interfaces for the File Server Role .
Currently the team owns DFS [ Distributed File System ] Management , Share and Storage Management , FSRM [ File Server Resource Manager ] & Classification UI , Disk Management , SMFS .
For Windows 8 , the SSD organization is working on the next version of the file server .
As the team moved to Windows 8 , you will have 2 main responsibilities - ( i ) put on the customer / design critique hat as we plan our next version file server management experience ( i ) participating in the architectural design , and development and driving automated testing for managing the next generation file server .
Our current automation does not meet the multi-machine paradigm requirement and so you will contribute significantly in the development of test automation to validate setup / configuration of the new server , managing configuration changes , performing diagnostics and reporting using Power Shell , Command line , Object Model , UI .

Democratic governor signs budget law
Michigan makes drastic cuts to education , social spending
By Tom Eley
2 November 2009
Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm , a Democrat and close political ally of President Barack Obama , on Friday signed into law a budget for 2009 - 2010 that drastically reduces state spending on education and social programs .
Michigan was the last US state to formally approve a budget , a result of a standoff between Granholm and Senate Republicans that delayed final passage one month into the state ’s new fiscal year .
Granholm actually signed six separate budget bills on Friday , bringing the total to 15 , which combine to allocate an overall $ 44 billion state budget .
In this process , Granholm used her line - item veto 70 times to cut spending by a further $ 127 million .
The largest of these vetoes was a $ 51.7 million cut for 39 school districts — mostly in southeastern Michigan — that spend at a higher rate than the state average .
The budget includes not a penny of new revenue from taxation , a victory for the Republicans who control the state senate .
For their part , Granholm and the Democrats , who control the lower house , never contemplated an income tax increase on the state ’s wealthy or taxes on the activities of major banks and financial institutions .
Granholm had proposed a series of regressive sales taxes .
The signings appeared to finalize massive cuts to public education averaging $ 292 per student for most of the state , and nearly twice as much in the 39 “ high - spending ” school districts .
Kevin McLogan , a representative of the Michigan Parent Teacher Student Association ( MPTSA ) , told the World Socialist Web Site the cuts would be “ devastating . ”
“ A lot of terrible things are going to happen , ” he said .
“ There are a lot of districts that are already in tough shape .
They will be pushed to the edge of receivership . ”
“ For other schools , there will be lot of cutting around the edges , ” he continued .
“ They will curtail busing , after - school programs , community education and alternative education .
Some districts will increase the amount of kids in the classroom , institute shorter school years , and force teachers to buy more of their own supplies . ”
The state will cut by 8 percent its Medicaid contribution to hospitals , clinics , nursing homes , and doctors who treat 1.7 million poor and disabled residents .
These cuts will translate into reduced access for Medicaid recipients .
“ Some nursing homes with a heavy Medicaid caseload may close , ” the Detroit News reports .
The cuts to Medicaid mean the loss of hundreds of millions in federal matching funds .
The state of Michigan is now the target of a lawsuit launched on behalf of 400,000 Medicaid recipients whose dental benefits were axed through a Granholm executive order in June .
An elderly woman from northern Michigan , Blanche D. LaVire , 76 , died as a direct result of Granholm ’s order .
LaVire was to be treated for a grave dental infection in July .
She died from complications associated with the spread of the infection while waiting for emergency paperwork to be approved by the state .
The budget cuts include , among other items :
Aid to cities and towns down 11 percent , or $ 100 million in all .
These cuts will result in a new wave of reductions carried out at the local level .
Affected will be police and fire protection , libraries , streets , water service , and sewerage .
A scholarship program , Michigan Promise , providing grants of between $ 1,000 and $ 4,000 to assist about 100,000 state residents to pay for college .
These students will see a substantial increase in their tuition as early as the spring .
The elimination of these scholarships was part of an overall 61 percent cut to student financial aid .
Also eliminated were state nursing scholarships , the Michigan Work - Study Program , and the Part - Time Independent Student Program .
A reduction of 0.4 percent for state colleges and universities , which were spared a deeper cut by federal stimulus money targeted to higher education .
“ Federal stimulus law prevented 2010 cuts to college operations , ” noted columnist Peter Luke of Mlive.com .
“ [ But ] in 2011 , Michigan ’s 15 public universities will have a giant target on their backs . ”
A $ 62 million cut to state mental health services .
Using her veto , Granholm cut deeper than the austerity budget produced by the legislature .
The Democratic governor vetoed $ 7 million to fund the Michigan State Fair , an exposition held in Detroit that has been an annual tradition since the nineteenth century .
In fact , $ 6.6 million of the outlay was funded by the fair itself , so Granholm ’s veto saves the state a net of only $ 500,000 .
Granholm also used her veto to cut $ 5 million in payments to hospitals that treat the indigent and uninsured patients , funding for a senior food aid outreach project in two counties , and a volunteer health clinic in Bay City .
In signing the bill , Granholm said that Senate Republicans bear responsibility for the savage cuts .
“ This is the budget we have , but it is not the budget we need , ” the governor said .
“ It is a budget I do n’t agree with and do n’t support .
It makes cuts that are too deep and are too painful for kids going to college , families keeping their families healthy and keeping their streets safe . ”
These protestations are fraudulent .
The Democratic Party controls not only the governor ’s mansion , but the state house of representatives .
There has never been any fundamental disagreement among Granholm , House Democrats , and Senate Republicans over the need to drastically cut social spending .
There were only tactical differences over how much this year ’s budget should be funded through the federal stimulus package — depleting those resources for next year ’s budget — and whether or not to increase forms of the state ’s regressive sales tax .
Politicians in both parties are in agreement that this year ’s cuts are only the beginning .
Unlike cuts made in some earlier recessions , it is generally accepted that the reductions made this year will not only be permanent , but even be deepened in the future .
It is estimated that the new budget for 2010 , barely a day old , already faces a $ 100 million shortfall , not counting the education fund , which is largely funded by the state sales tax .
Current estimates put the budget deficit for 2011 at $ 750 million .
As the Detroit Free Press noted , “ Michigan ’s budget problems will almost certainly worsen before they improve .
Tax revenues are expected to remain flat or decline .
Program needs — from welfare to the cost of public employee salaries and benefits — will continue to grow .
( Most of the state ’s unionized employees are scheduled to get a 3 % pay increase next spring . )
And about $ 1.4 billion in onetime federal stimulus money to balance the 2009 - 10 books will be gone . ”
GUEST blogger Dr Robert Stovold weighs up some Creationist arguments , and finds them wanting .
Having tried ( and failed ) to smuggle Creationism into schools in the guise of “ Intelligent Design ” , Creationists now have another Trojan Horse strategy – bundling their ideas with Darwin ’s masterpiece itself in the form of a Creationist introduction to Darwin ’s On the Origin of Species .
Ray “ Bananaman ” Comfort is giving away more than 100,000 copies of Charles Darwin ’s work at 100 top US universities .
Â
His parasitic introduction is available here
The part dealing with Charles Darwin ’s biography is actually rather good – almost as if he ’d plagiarised the work of someone else ?
Â
Sure enough , Googling several key phrases from Comfort ’s introduction proves beyond reasonable doubt that he had .
Â
Whole passages were lifted without attribution from Dr Stan Guffey ’s work , A Brief History of Charles Darwin . Â
For example : Ray : During his great adventure as the Beagle ’s naturalist , Darwin had studied certain aspects of the morphology and biogeography of the many species of plants and animals that he had observed .
He eventually concluded that species exhibited varying degrees of similarity because they were to varying degrees related .
Stan :
On his great adventure as the Beagle ’s naturalist Darwin had noted and begun to ponder certain aspects of the morphology and biogeography of the many species of plants and animals that he had observed .
In particular , he had begun to explore the possibility , and eventually concluded , that species exhibited varying degrees of similarity because they are to varying degrees related .
Hmm .Â
A case of “ Descent with modification ” , to use Darwin ’s phrase ?
Â
This and other examples of Comfort ’s plagiarism have been highlighted by fellow sceptics here Comfort is even biased in the way he presents his references .
Â
For example , evolutionary biologist Professor Steve Jones is referenced as “ Steve Jones ” , but Creationist Charles Thaxton is “ Charles B. Thaxton , Ph.D. ” .
Â Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins is “ Richard Dawkins ” , but Creationist author David Dewitt is “ David A. Dewitt , Ph.D. ” Â
( It should actually read “ DeWitt ” , but never mind …. ) .
Sandwiched between a plagiarised biography and biased references are several canards from the Creationist canon , such as ( and I paraphrase ) “ evolution is simply a matter of chance ” , and “ the complexity of living things requires a designer ” .
Â
I ’ve refuted both lies with an analogy that I ’ve used for years , which I ’ll share with Freethinker readers in the form of an amusing conversation I once had with a Creationist : Creationist : Design requires a designer – it could n’t arise by random chance !
Me : Would you say that order requires an orderer ?
Creationist : Yes .
Me :
So why is it that all the small cornflakes send to settle at the base of the box ?
Â
Do you think it ’s because God put them there ?
Creationist :
No – it must be , well , gravity pulling the small flakes down .
Me : Would n’t gravity have pulled the large flakes down as well ?
Â
Why do the small flakes fall further ?
Creationist : I do n’t know .
Me :
It ’s because small flakes fall through large gaps , but large flakes can’t fall through small gaps .
Â
The flakes sieve themselves .
Â
Random shaking of the box coupled with a non -random filtering law ( which we might call “ the furthest - falling of the smallest ” or “ the persistence of the largest ” ) leads to an ordering of flakes over time , with no intelligent input required .
Â Random shaking is analogous to random mutation , and “ the survival of the fittest ” ( Natural Selection ) is analogous to “ the persistence of the largest ” .
Â Cornflakes and living things are both self - ordering systems , filtering out smaller flakes and deleterious mutations respectively .
Â
Cornflakes become more organised over time , and organisms become better - adapted .
Creationist :
There must be more to it than that ?
Â
There must be !Â
There has to be !

A more detailed refutation of Comfort ’s nonsense is beyond the scope of this blog , but will appear in a future print edition of The Freethinker .

Dean Miller , an Australian fur seal biologist , was the first person to spot the large white object floating past Macquarie island in the far south - west corner of the Pacific Ocean .
" I 've never seen anything like it .
We looked out to the horizon and just saw this huge floating island of ice , " Miller told the Australian Antarctic division .
" It was a monumental moment for me as it was the first iceberg I have seen . "
Estimated to be about 50 m high – from the waterline – and 500 m long , the iceberg is now about five miles ( 8 km ) off the north - west of Macquarie island , halfway between New Zealand and Antarctica south - west corner of the Pacific Ocean .
Scientists have said it is rare for icebergs to be seen so far north .
Neil Young , an Australian Antarctic division glaciologist , said : " The iceberg is likely to be part of one of the big ones that calved from the Ross ice shelf nearly a decade ago .
" Throughout the year several icebergs have been drifting slowly northwards with the ocean current towards Macquarie Island .
We know there are also a few more icebergs 100 km - 200 km to the west of the island . "
Several huge icebergs broke off from Antarctica 's Ross ice shelf and the Ronne ice shelf in 2000 and are now drifting away from Antarctica .
The first was about 190 miles long and 23 miles wide .
Scientists believe the iceberg off Macquarie will break up and melt rapidly as it meanders northwards .
However , before melting it could present a danger to ships , Young said .
Since the start of satellite records in 1979 , total Antarctic sea ice has increased by about 1 % a decade , according to Nasa .
The US space agency says it is unclear whether the small overall increase in sea ice expanse is a sign of meaningful change because ice areas vary considerably from year to year and from sector to sector .
Considered individually , only the Ross sea sector had a significant positive trend , while sea ice extent has actually decreased in the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas .

In August 1820 , a dying John Keats wrote a letter to his soul mate , Fanny Brawne , that begins with a fond salutation — “ My dearest girl ” — but goes quickly downhill .
“ I am glad there is such a thing as the grave , ” he wrote .
“ The world is too brutal for me . ”
It ends with a romantic flourish : “ I wish that I was either in your arms full of faith or that a thunderbolt would strike me . ”

Zombieland : A Great Video Game Movie
Up front I need to say one thing : I stopped watching the Tigers - Twins game last night midway through the epic 10th inning to go see this movie .
I was lucky enough that I could still follow the gamecast over my iPhone during the previews , until my Tigers lost that is .
Bah , there is always next next year .
With that said , I had a bit of distaste in my mouth and was slightly grumpy when the movie began .
I needed a pick - me - up , a quick fix to a dreary , rainy evening .
Having just played through and loved several stages of Nazi Zombies in CoD , Zombieland seemed like an obvious choice of a flick to see .
My expectations revolved around the film being filled with exploding zombie heads , some comedy , and a decent plot to tie it all together .
I was not disappointed .
While not related to a gaming property per se , like District 9 before it the film contains many characteristics of what we know and love about modern gaming .
Zombieland is , at its very least , a great Left 4 Dead scenario .
Four different heroes brought together under strenuous circumstances are pitted against zombies of all different types : sexy girl zombies , heffers , and clowns are all included .
The video game novelty of on - the - fly weapon switching is there , as is the hilarious exploding zombie head .
The movie has a fun , loose flow to it .
It does n’t force the characters to survive , or to save humanity .
Their only goal is to get to where they are going , forming bonds along the way .
The comparison to games is intentional ( although not necessarily to L4D ) : full of action , story when needed , and slightly over - the - top .
All of this is wrapped in a conscious effort of the film to be self - aware .
The main character , Columbus , keeps a “ rules ” list for surviving in a zombie world .
The reference to “ violent video games ” is a quotable reason why the youngest hero is able to shoot a zombie with no remorse ( to survive ) .
The “ team ” of heroes was extremely likable , almost to the point where the film seemed like a multiplayer campaign being played out with real actors who interacted well together .
Even the somewhat - forced love story is taken in stride as if the characters know that this is what normally comes with the zombie survival territory .
Zombieland had me itching to play L4D afterwards .
For the second time this year , an enjoyable video game movie was made without a video game property to be based on .
It has left me wondering if this is Hollywood ’s way of hitting the genre without necessarily being tied to the cliches associated with video game movies — having to rehash game history for new viewers and forcing key game identifiers into a story come to mind .
Video games often try to be like movies , and transferring a property like that back onto the silver screen is like making a copy of a copy : it never turns out well .
Perhaps creating movies that are well - scripted gaming scenarios is the correct way to go .
Regardless of all of that , Zombieland is an exceptionally fun film that plays out like a great game : you know what ’s coming next but love experiencing it anyways .
A trail of footprints in the snow led Ypsilanti police to a man who stole a Christmas gift from a woman 's car this morning , a police news release said .
The 45 - year - old Ypsilanti man was arrested after being found at an apartment in the 500 block of North Congress Street about 12:45 a.m. , the release said .
A 22 - year - old woman reported that she looked out her bedroom window and saw a man walking away from her car with a drill she bought for someone as a Christmas present .
It 's unclear how the man got into her car .
She rushed downstairs and saw him cross the street , then lost sight of him , a police incident log said .
Officers followed footprints to the apartment and heard people inside arguing about bringing stolen property there , the release said .
Officers were given consent to search the apartment and did n't find the drill , but located a man matching the description of the thief .
His shoe size and tread matched up with the footprints , the release said .
Officers detained the man and followed another trail of footprints from the apartment to a Dumpster , where they recovered the drill still in its box .
The car owner positively identified the man as the thief .
He was taken to the Washtenaw County Jail on a parole violation , the release said .
He 's expected to be arraigned today on a charge of larceny from an automobile , police said .
WASHINGTON – How much does the U.S. government really trust Canada ?
Maybe less than you think .
Espionage warnings from the Defence Department caused an international sensation a few years ago over reports of mysterious coins with radio frequency transmitters , until they were debunked .
The culprit turned out to be a commemorative quarter in Canada .
But at the height of the mystery , senior Pentagon officials speculated whether Canadians were involved in the spy caper , according to emails marked " Secret / NoForn " and obtained this week by The Associated Press under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act .
" I do n't think it is an issue of the Canadians being the bad guys , " the Pentagon 's counterintelligence chief wrote , " but then again , who knows . "
In the emails , released to The AP with names blacked out but job titles disclosed , Pentagon officials question whether they should warn military officers in the U.S. Northern Command , who regularly met Canadian counterparts about classified subjects inside bug - proof , government meeting rooms .
The rooms are known as secure compartmentalized information facilities , or SKIFs .
" Is n't the Canadian piece something that should be briefed to Northcom since the Canadians sit in their SKIFs ? " asked the Pentagon 's deputy director for counterintelligence oversight .
" Good point , " replied the Pentagon 's acting director for counterintelligence .
" It is possible that DSS ( the U.S. Defence Security Service ) sent their report to Northcom .
Then again , I do n't think it is an issue of the Canadians being the bad guys , but then again , who knows . "
Who knows ?
Canada is among the closest of U.S. allies , its continental northern neighbour and the leading oil supplier for the U.S.
The intelligence services of the two countries are extraordinarily tight and routinely share sensitive secrets .
U.S. President Barack Obama chose Canada as the destination of his first foreign trip , to underscore what he described as the two countries ' long - standing and growing friendship .
" I love this country and think that we could not have a better friend and ally , " said Obama , whose brother - in - law is Canadian , during his February visit to Ottawa .
In sensational warnings that circulated publicly in late 2006 and early 2007 , the Pentagon 's Defence Security Service said coins with radio transmitters were found planted on U.S. army contractors with classified security clearances on at least three occasions between October 2005 and January 2006 as the contractors travelled through Canada .
In January 2007 , the government abruptly reversed itself and said the warnings were not true .
But the case remained a mystery until months later , when AP learned that the flap had been caused by suspicions over the odd- looking Canadian " poppy " quarter with a bright red flower .
The silver - coloured 25 - cent piece features the red image of a poppy – Canada 's flower of war remembrance – inlaid on a maple leaf .
What suspicious contractors believed to be " nanotechnology " on the coins actually was a protective coating the Royal Canadian Mint applied to prevent the poppy 's red colour from rubbing off .
The mint produced nearly 30 million such quarters in 2004 commemorating Canada 's 117,000 war dead .

AMES , Iowa - Researchers at Iowa State University have identified an enzyme that helps make tuberculosis resistant to a human 's natural defense system .
Researchers have also found a method to possibly neutralize that enzyme , which may someday lead to a cure for tuberculosis .
Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a contagious disease that is on the rise , killing 1.5 to 2 million people worldwide annually .
Reuben Peters , associate professor in the department of biochemistry , biophysics and molecular biology , is leading the team of scientists from Iowa State ; the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign ; and Cornell University , Ithaca , New York , that is attempting to find ways to minimize the disease .
The group had their research published in the Aug. 28 issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry , and their research is also scheduled to be the cover article in an upcoming issue of the Journal of the American Chemical Society .
When most infections are introduced into humans , the body defends itself with certain cells -- called macrophage cells -- that kill the invading micro-organisms .
The macrophage cells engulf and destroy these microbes , such as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis .
Peters found that the mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a defensive molecule that prevents the macrophage cells from destroying them .
Peters and his team named the defensive molecule edaxadiene .
Peters ' next step was to try to find molecules that bind with the edaxadiene - producing enzymes from tuberculosis and neutralize them .
This makes the tuberculosis cells unable to produce edaxadiene .
Without edaxadiene , tuberculosis cells would have a reduced ability to resist being killed by the macrophage cells .
Peters thinks he may have already found one .
" We have inhibitors that bind tightly to one of the enzymes that make edaxadiene in a test tube , " said Peters .
Finding an inhibitor that works outside of the test tube , and in humans , and is stable , and can be ingested safely by humans , and can help kill tuberculosis is a process that may take a decade .
But Peters sees a huge reward at the end of the process .
" This is the project where I tell my students , ' If we can make even just a 1 percent impact , we can save 15,000 - 20,000 lives a year . '
That is really a significant contribution towards alleviating human suffering , " said Peters .
Peters ' group found the molecule by comparing the genetic makeup of tuberculosis - which kills humans - to the type that kills cattle but does n't seem to have any effect on humans - Mycobacterium bovis .
" Their genetic sequences are more than 99.9 percent identical , " said Peters .
" However , whereas , tuberculosis causes disease in humans , the bovis variety is much less infectious in humans , although it does cause disease in cattle . "
One of the small differences in the genetic information between the two mycobacteria may hold the key to why one infects humans while the other does not .
" The bovis mycobacterium is missing only one nucleotide in the gene for one of the edaxadiene - producing enzymes , but that turns out to be very important as it prevents that enzyme from functioning , " he said .
" The critical piece for this idea is that Mycobacterium bovis does n't make edaxadiene , and does n't affect humans much , whereas Mycobacterium tuberculosis does make edaxadiene and is infectious in humans , " Peters said .
" We think this is the big difference between the two mycobacterium , mainly because this is the only difference I know of that seems to affect their infection process , " he added .
" This work presents tantalizing evidence that edaxadiene helps the tuberculosis bacterium evade the body 's defenses , " said Warren Jones , who oversees enzymology grants at the National Institutes of Health 's National Institute of General Medical Sciences , which funded the research .
" By exploring ways to block the production of this molecule , Dr. Peters is pioneering a new approach for combating this deadly pathogen . "
One of the hurdles that will confront Peters in finding human cures is that the effect of edaxadiene may be specific to humans , so the normal testing process may be difficult .
The normal testing sequence involves testing in the laboratory , then on smaller animals , then larger animals , and then to humans .
Since edaxadiene may be important for the ability of tuberculosis to infect humans , rather than animals , preventing production of edaxadiene by tuberculosis may not have much effect in animals , which will be challenging for the process of bringing a cure to drugstore shelves , according to Peters .
Peters added that he is eager to take on the next challenge in the fight against tuberculosis .
Peters ' research team includes Francis Mann , doctoral student ; Meimei Xu , associate scientist , both in ISU 's department of biochemistry , biophysics and molecular biology ; Sladjana Prisic , formerly a doctoral student in ISU 's department of biochemistry , biophysics and molecular biology ; Huayou Hu and Robert Coates , both from the University of Illinois ; and David Russell from Cornell .

Is the Glass - Steagall Act , the Depression - era law that blocked commercial banks from participating in riskier investment banking , set for a revival ?
That ’s what a new piece of legislation , introduced yesterday by Senators Maria Cantwell ( D - Wash . ) and John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , would do , forcing major changes to financial titans like JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup , and Bank of America .
But first , here ’s McCain on the new legislation on CNBC :
Reestablishing the firewall between commercial and investment banking poses a dilemma for banks such as JPMorgan Chase , which snapped up Bear Stearns ’ trading operations earlier this year , and massive Citigroup , which includes more staid consumer banking branches as well as riskier trading operations .
The already controversial , shotgun - wedded Bank of America and Merrill Lynch relationship would n’t survive if Glass - Steagall was revived , either .
And you can throw Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo into that mix , too .
The McCain - Cantwell legislation would give such institutions a year to break up their different banking arms .
The Depression - era law , you ’ll remember , was abolished in 1999 by the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , one of the most significant pieces of deregulatory legislation in the past few decades , paving the way for the emergence of financial behemoths like Wells Fargo , JPMorgan Chase , and Citigroup ( though Citi received somewhat of an exemption to grow even before 1999 ) .
It ’s a long shot at this point , but bringing Glass - Steagall back would be a watershed moment for financial regulation and major step toward scaling back the excesses and ridiculous risk - taking of the past decade or so .
At the very least it would protect consumers ’ savings from use in banks ’ riskier operations .
And talk about a role reversal for John McCain !
McCain voted for Gramm - Leach - Bliley back in 1999 — a vote to tear down a law he now wants to restore .
And as David Corn wrote last year , one of McCain ’s closest economic advisers during part of the presidential campaign was the godfather of deregulation himself , former Sen. Phil “ Nation of Whiners ” Gramm .
Rep. Maurice Hinchey ( D - N.Y. ) is going to introduce similar legislation in the House , the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday .
Hinchey tried to get his bill into the House ’s big financial - reform package earlier this month , but Democratic leadership blocked him .
Since the Senate probably wo n’t take up financial regulation until early 2010 , it ’s unclear how soon the McCain - Cantwell legislation will get its day in the sun .
It could be tucked into the Senate ’s financial regulation plans , or introduced as an amendment later in the sausage - making process .
Either way , it ’s a promising idea and an encouraging start to the Senate ’s financial overhaul .
Kudos where it 's due : not many design houses use tanks in their illustrations of a new road safety concept .
Transparentius , as with most good ideas , is remarkably simple -- you jack a camera onto the front of a truck , or lorry as they 're known in some places , and then project that image onto the back of your hulking transporter .
The effect of this is to render the truck figuratively transparent for the driver behind , who is enriched with a lot more information about what lies on the road ahead .
No word on how the rear projection is achieved or how sunlight glare is overcome , but knowing Art Lebedev , you can bet both challenges are solved in the most unaffordable fashion possible .
Anyhow , now that you 've got the idea , we 're throwing this one over to you dear mod-loving friends -- can you build this without remortgaging the house ?
[ Thanks , Dennis ]

Outgoing Virginia Governor Tim Kaine got a bit of a surprise during his radio show today , after “ Barry from D.C. ” called to thank him for his years of service .
“ Barry from D.C. ” was , however , President Obama .
“ Governor Kaine , this is actually the President of the United States calling , ” Obama said .
“ No , ” a nearly incredulous Kaine began .
“ Oh my God . ”

“ I have a complaint about traffic in northern Virginia , ” the president continued .
“ But , uh , rather than go there , I just wanted to say how proud we are of your service as governor of the commonwealth of Virginia and we wish you all the best this Christmas season after your terrific round of service for the people of Virginia . ”
Kaine said he was flattered by the president ’s call and said his warmest memory as Virginia ’s governor was when President Obama was elected .
“ I ’m excited to continue to be in service , as they say , ” he concluded .
Kaine , who leaves office in January , will be the next Democratic National Committee chairman .

This photograph of an icy , shallow cove off the Massachusetts coast nicely illustrates , in miniature , the phases of sea ice formation .
The light grey surface slush in the middle part of the photograph is frazil ice .
Frazil ice consists of free - floating ice crystals that form an icy mix often called grease ice .
It can extend down several meters from the surface .
Frazil ice will coalesce into thin sheets that are initially transparent but soon thicken and whiten .
When this occurs , the ice is referred to as nilas ice , which can be detected in the upper right part of the photograph .
Pancake ice is seen in the foreground .
This ice forms when surface turbulence breaks up nilas ice .
Collisions cause the fragments to round off .
Alternatively , pancake ice can form when turbulence and wind compress frazil ice causing it to coalesce .
Drift ice , observed in the center of the photograph , is isolated segments of thick nilas , floating free .
Fast ice is seen in the background , against the shore .
This is sea ice that 's become fixed to land , not moving with tide or current .

At the American Society of Clinical Oncology 's Breast Cancer Symposium held in San Francisco recently , researchers from the University of Rochester Medical Center made an announcement that at first glance may seem startling -- at least it may startle people who are unaware of the preventive and healing power of nutrients .
When they studied 166 women undergoing treatment for breast cancer , the scientists found the vast majority , about 70 percent , had something other than their cancer in common : they had very low levels of vitamin D in their blood .
What 's more , women whose disease had progressed to late - stage ( i.e. terminal ) cancer had the lowest levels of all .
According to the researchers ' statement to the media , their take away message about the breast cancer study seems to be simply that women with breast malignancies need to take high - dose vitamin D supplements to help protect bone mass and decrease fracture risk during cancer treatment .
They recommend that women with breast cancer take weekly high doses of vitamin D , at least 50,000 international units or more .
" Vitamin D is essential to maintaining bone health , and women with breast cancer have accelerated bone loss due to the nature of hormone therapy and chemotherapy .
It 's important for women and their doctors to work together to boost their vitamin D intake , " said Luke Peppone , Ph.D. , research assistant professor of Radiation Oncology at Rochester 's James P. Wilmot Cancer Center and a member of the National Cancer Institute 's Community Clinical Oncology Program research base in Rochester .
The scientists also pointed out that symptoms of vitamin D deficiency include muscle pain , difficulty sleeping , weak bones resulting in fractures , low energy , fatigue , lowered immunity , symptoms of depression and mood swings .
And these symptoms are also commonly seen in women who are undergoing breast cancer treatment with chemotherapy and / or radiation .
Surprisingly , what the researchers did n't point out is that the lack of vitamin D found in women with breast cancer could be the cause of their disease -- or least a factor in it .
As Mike Adams covered recently in , previous research has shown vitamin D can reduce cancer rates by 77 % ( https://www.naturalnews.com/021892_cancer_Vit... ) and vitamin D appears to play a specific role in preventing cancer of the breast ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027230_cancer_Vit... breast cancer ) .
Fortunately , some mainstream Western physicians are becoming aware of the value of vitamin D to prevent and treat malignancies .
In a paper recently published paper in the , a team of doctors from Legacy Emanual Hospital in Portland , Oregon , stated : " Because most physicians do not appreciate the role of vitamin D deficiency in predisposing the development of cancer , we have written this important report as a wake - up call to physicians and other healthcare workers in documenting the relationship of vitamin D deficiency and cancer .
Epidemiological data show an inverse relationship between vitamin D levels and breast cancer incidence ... "
In addition , the Legacy Emanual Hospital physicians pointed out that low vitamin D intake has been indicated in colorectal carcinogenesis and vitamin D deficiency has been documented in people with prostate cancer , ovarian cancer , and multiple myeloma , too .

When victimized by workplace food thieves , some curse , others write threatening notes .
Some might even contemplate surveillance cameras , if they ’re hit often enough .
Being an inventor , Sherwood Forlee found another way to fight back when his sandwiches repeatedly went missing from the communal fridge at the SoHo ad agency where he worked .
“ It kept happening , and one day I ’d had it , ” says Forlee , 29 , a designer and mechanical engineer who worked in the firm ’s product design division .
He considered stealth laxatives and sandwiches spiked with cat food .
But the light - bulb moment came when he was scanning the fridge in the apartment he shares with three roommates in Brooklyn , and came across an unidentified food item crawling with mold .
Next stop : the “ anti - theft lunch bag , ” a plastic baggie customized with green splotches that make a fresh sandwich look like a spore factory , deterring all but the most desperate snack stealer .
When he put it to work in the office , the theft stopped immediately .
“ When people see something like that , they do n’t even want to lay their hands on it , ” he says .
Forlee conceived of the item for personal use .
But “ when I did a little research , ” he says , “ I found it ’s a prevalent problem . ”
So in February he began selling the bags on his own Web site ( thinkofthe.com ) , alongside a handful of other items he ’s designed , such as the “ walls notebook , ” whose pages depict New York City walls , ripe for adorning with noninvasive graffiti .
Charging $ 10 for a box of 25 bags , Forlee quickly sold out of his first run of 2,000 boxes .
With a boost from Target , which briefly featured the product on its
Web site , demand has held steady , and he ’s currently on his fourth run .
Having since left the agency to pursue his own projects , Forlee no longer needs the bags himself .
But customers report success , he says .
“ People say they have n’t lost a lunch since , ” he says , noting that others buy them as a gag gift or to use for pranks .
Forlee plans to continue selling the bags , although he has no current plans to “ go mass market . ”
For one thing , he notes , “ If everyone has one , they become ineffective . ”

Writing by Britta O'Boyle .
The feathered creature called archaeopteryx , easily the world 's most famous fossil remains , had been considered the first bird since Charles Darwin 's day .
When researchers put its celebrity bones under the microscope recently , though , they discovered that this icon of evolution might not have been a bird at all .
An examination of its bone cells revealed for the first time that the 150 - million - year - old creature had the slow growth rate of a dinosaur , not a bird , an international research team reported this month .

Chromosomes house genetic material
This year 's Nobel prize for medicine goes to three US - based researchers who discovered how the body protects the chromosomes housing vital genetic code .
Elizabeth Blackburn , Carol Greider and Jack Szostak jointly share the award .
Their work revealed how the chromosomes can be copied and has helped further our understanding on human ageing , cancer and stem cells .
The answer lies at the ends of the chromosomes - the telomeres - and in an enzyme that forms them - telomerase .
FROM THE PM PROGRAMME

More from PM
The 46 chromosomes contain our genome written in the code of life - DNA .
When a cell is about to divide , the DNA molecules , housed on two strands , are copied .
But scientists had been baffled by an anomaly .
For one of the two DNA strands , a problem exists in that the very end of the strand cannot be copied .
Protecting the code of life
Therefore , the chromosomes should be shortened every time a cell divides - but in fact that is not usually the case .
If the telomeres did repeatedly shorten , cells would rapidly age .
The discoveries ... have added a new dimension to our understanding of the cell , shed light on disease mechanisms , and stimulated the development of potential new therapies
The Nobel Assembly Conversely , if the telomere length is maintained , the cell would have eternal life , which could also be problematic .
This happens in the case of cancer cells .
This year 's prize winners solved the conundrum when they discovered how the telomere functions and found the enzyme that copies it .
Elizabeth Blackburn , of the University of California , San Francisco , and Jack Szostak , of Harvard Medical School , discovered that a unique DNA sequence in the telomeres protects the chromosomes from degradation .
Joined by Johns Hopkins University 's Carol Greider , then a graduate student , Blackburn started to investigate how the teleomeres themselves were made and the pair went on to discover telomerase - the enzyme that enables DNA polymerases to copy the entire length of the chromosome without missing the very end portion .
Their research has led others to hunt for new ways to cure cancer .
It is hoped that cancer might be treated by eradicating telomerase .
Several studies are under way in this area , including clinical trials evaluating vaccines directed against cells with elevated telomerase activity .
Some inherited diseases are now known to be caused by telomerase defects , including certain forms of anaemia in which there is insufficient cell divisions in the stem cells of the bone marrow .
The Nobel Assembly at Sweden 's Karolinska Institute , which awarded the prize , said : " The discoveries ... have added a new dimension to our understanding of the cell , shed light on disease mechanisms , and stimulated the development of potential new therapies . "
Carol Greider , now 48 , said she was phoned in the early hours with the news that she had won .
She said : " It 's really very thrilling , it 's something you can't expect . "
Elizabeth Blackburn , now 60 , shared her excitement , saying : " Prizes are always a nice thing .
It does n't change the research per se , of course , but it 's lovely to have the recognition and share it with Carol Greider and Jack Szostak .
" Professor Roger Reddel of the Children 's Medical Research Institute in Sydney , Australia , said : " The telomerase story is an outstanding illustration of the value of basic research . "
Sir Leszek Borysiewicz , chief executive of the Medical Research Council , said : " The Medical Research Council extends its congratulations to Blackburn , Greider and Szostak on winning the 2009 Nobel Prize .
" Their research on chromosomes helped lay the foundations of future work on cancer , stem cells and even human ageing , research areas that continue to be of huge importance to the scientists MRC funds and to the many people who will ultimately benefit from the discoveries they make . "

Economist Peter Bernholz is an expert on the subject of national hyperinflations .
He has studied all the major cases of hyperinflation since 1980 .
His conclusion :
The tipping point occurs when a government ’s deficit exceeds 40 % of its expenditures .
Guess what ?
The U.S. will hit the 40 % mark in 2009 :
Hayman Advisors provided a good summary of Bernholz ’s research in their October letter ( via FS ) :
There have been 28 episodes of hyperinflation of national economies in the 20th century , with 20 occurring after 1980 .
Peter Bernholz ( Professor Emeritus of Economics in the Center for Economics and Business ( WWZ ) at the University of Basel , Switzerland ) has spent his career examining the intertwined worlds of politics and economics with special attention given to money .
In his most recent book , Monetary Regimes and Inflation : History , Economic and Political Relationships , Bernholz analyzes the 12 largest episodes of hyperinflations – all of which were caused by financing huge public budget deficits through money creation .
His conclusion : the tipping point for hyperinflation occurs when the government ’s deficit exceed 40 % of its expenditures .
It ’s important to note that the dollar does have some built - in protection as the world ’s current reserve currency .
That lets us get away with a higher debt - load than we should be able to .
The question is , how much protection does that offer ?
Also , how long will the dollar remain the world ’s reserve currency ?
As Bloomberg noted , the world ’s reserve banks are shifting away from US dollars .
They ’re shifting to currencies from countries with sound ( er ) monetary policy and less debt .
We ’re really in uncharted economic territory .
“ It ca n’t happen here ”
Hyperinflation in the US is hard to imagine .
It could never happen to us… right ?
Well , fiat money has always collapsed eventually .
I wonder if people in those countries ever saw it coming .
My gut says the vast majority never saw it coming , but every case is unique .
Hedging Against Hyperinflation
If we are on the road to hyperinflation , you ’ll definitely want to be in commodities .
Stocks may do OK , but generally do n’t keep up with inflation during hyperinflation .
The exception would be commodity producers , such as gold miners .
Foreign currency funds are another way to play it .
I did a writeup on two mutual funds I like as inflation hedges here .
Jim Rogers likes agriculture plays better than precious metals : Cotton , sugar , etc .
I ’m mostly using metals to hedge against inflation , but Mr. Rogers ’ suggestions certainly warrant a closer look .
If you ’re looking to read more on the topic , Peter Bernholz ’s research is featured in his new book Monetary Regimes and Inflation : History , Economic and Political Relationships .
Looks interesting , I ’ll probably pick one up with my next Amazon order .
Hat tip to Michael Panzner .
He has an excellent writeup on the risks here .

An official document from the Department of the US Air Force reveals that the military base in Palanquero , Colombia will provide the Pentagon with “ … an opportunity for conducting full spectrum operations throughout South America … ”
This information contradicts the explainations offered by Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and the US State Department regarding the military agreement signed between the two nations this past October 30th .
Both governments have publicly stated that the military agreement refers only to counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations within Colombian territory .
President Uribe has reiterated numerous times that the military agreement with the US will not affect Colombia ’s neighbors , despite constant concern in the region regarding the true objetives of the agreement .
But the US Air Force document , dated May 2009 , confirms that the concerns of South American nations have been right on target .
The document exposes that the true intentions behind the agreement are to enable the US to engage in “ full spectrum military operations in a critical sub-region of our hemisphere where security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded terrorist insurgencies … and anti-US governments … ”
The military agreement between Washington and Colombia authorizes the access and use of seven military installations in Palanquero , Malambo , Tolemaida , Larandia , Apíay , Cartagena and Málaga .
Additionally , the agreement allows for “ the access and use of all other installations and locations as necessary ” throughout Colombia , with no restrictions .
Together with the complete immunity the agreement provides to US military and civilian personnel , including private defense and security contractors , the clause authorizing the US to utilize any installation throughout the entire country - even commercial aiports , for military ends , signifies a complete renouncing of Colombian sovereignty and officially converts Colombia into a client - state of the US .
The Air Force document underlines the importance of the military base in Palanquero and justifies the $ 46 million requested in the 2010 budget ( now approved by Congress ) in order to improve the airfield , associated ramps and other installations on the base to convert it into a US Cooperative Security Location ( CSL ) .
“ Establishing a Cooperative Security Location ( CSL ) in Palanquero best supports the COCOM ’s ( Command Combatant ’s ) Theater Posture Strategy and demonstrates our commitment to this relationship .
Development of this CSL provides a unique opportunity for full spectrum operations in a critical sub-region of our hemisphere where security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded terrorist insurgencies , anti-US governments , endemic poverty and recurring natural disasters . ”
It ’s not difficult to imagine which governments in South America are considered by Washington to be “ anti-US governments ” .
The constant agressive declarations and statements emitted by the State and Defense Departments and the US Congress against Venezuela and Bolivia , and even to some extent Ecuador , evidence that the ALBA nations are the ones perceived by Washington as a “ constant threat ” .
To classify a country as “ anti-US ” is to consider it an enemy of the United States .
In this context , it ’s obvious that the military agreement with Colombia is a reaction to a region the US now considers full of “ enemies ” .
Counter - Narcotics Operations Are Secondary
Per the US Air Force document , “ Access to Colombia will further its strategic partnership with the United States .
The strong security cooperation relationship also offers an opportunity for conducting full spectrum operations throughout South America to include mitigating the Counternarcotics capability . ”
This statement clearly evidences that counternarcotics operations are secondary to the real objetives of the military agreement between Colombia and Washington .
Again , this clearly contrasts the constant declarations of the Uribe and Obama governments insisting that the main focus of the agreement is to combat drug trafficking and production .
The Air Force document emphasizes the necessity to improve “ full spectrum ” military operations throughout South America – not just in Colombia – in order to combat “ constant threats ” from “ anti-US governments ” in the region .
Palanquero
Is the Best Option for Continental Mobility
The Air Force document explains that “ Palanquero is unquestionably the best site for investing in infrastructure development within Colombia .
Its central location is within reach of …operations areas…its isolation maximizes Operational Security ( OPSEC ) and Force Protection and minimizes the US military profile .
The intent is to leverage existing infrastructure to the maximum extent possible , improve the US ability to respond rapidly to crisis , and assure regional access and presence at minimum cost .
Palanquero supports the mobility mission by providing access to the entire South American continent with the exception of Cape Horn … ”
Espionage and Warfare
The document additionally confirms that the US military presence in Palanquero , Colombia , will improve the capacity of espionage and intelligence operations , and will allow the US armed forces to increase their warfare capabilities in the region .
“ Development of this CSL will further the strategic partnership forged between the US and Colombia and is in the interest of both nations …
A presence will also increase our capability to conduct Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) , improve global reach , support logistics requirements , improve partnerships , improve theater security cooperation and expand expeditionary warfare capability . ”
The language of war included in this document evidences the true intentions behind the military agreement between Washington and Colombia : they are preparing for war in Latin America .
The past few days have been full of conflict and tension between Colombia and Venezuela .
Just days ago , the Venezuelan government captured three spies from the Colombian intelligence agency , DAS , and discovered several active destabilization and espionage operations against Cuba , Ecuador and Venezuela .
The operations - Fénix , Salomón and Falcón , respectively , were revealed in documents found with the captured DAS agents .
Approximately two weeks ago , 10 bodies were found in Táchira , a border zone with Colombia .
After completing the relevant investigations , the Venezuelan government discovered that the bodies belonged to Colombian paramilitaries infiltrated inside Venezuelan territory .
This dangerous paramilitary infiltration from Colombia forms part of a destabilization plan against Venezuela that seeks to create a paramilitary state inside Venezuelan territory in order to breakdown President Chávez ’s government .
The military agreement between Washington and Colombia will only increase regional tensions and violence .
The information revealed in the US Air Force document unquestionably evidences that Washington seeks to promote a state of warfare in South America , using Colombia as its launching pad .
Before this declaration of war , the peoples of Latin America must stand strong and unified .
Latin American integration is the best defense against the Empire ’s aggression .
* The US Air Force document was submitted in May 2009 to Congress as part of the 2010 budget justification .
It is an official government document and reaffirms the authenticity of the White Book : Global Enroute Strategy of the US Air Mobility Command , which was denounced by President Chávez during the UNASUR meeting in Bariloche , Argentina this past August 28th .
I have placed the original document and the non-official translation to Spanish that I did of the relevant parts relating to Palanquero on the web page of the Center to Alert and Defend the People “ Centro de Alerta para la Defensa de los Pueblos ” , a new space we are creating to guarantee that strategic information is available to those under constant threat from imperialist aggression .
This is the fifth in a series of posts about the proposed Google Book Search settlement .
As we 've explained in earlier posts , when it comes to evaluating the proposed Google Books settlement , the principal potential benefit to the public ( increased access to books online ) must be weighed against the potential drawbacks ( impediments to competition , inadequate protection for privacy ) .
Another potential downside for the public in the proposed settlement is the risk of censorship .
To understand the importance of this risk , keep two things in mind .
First , while bookstores are entitled to pick and choose their inventory , Google Books hopes to be much more than a simple bookstore .
In the words of Google 's CEO Eric Schmidt : " Imagine one giant electronic card catalog that makes all the world 's books discoverable with just a few keystrokes by anyone , anywhere , anytime . "
In other words , Google Books will have many characteristics that we associate more with the research libraries from which its books are drawn than with traditional bookstores .
Second , as Prof. Geoffrey Nunberg reminds us : " This is almost certainly the Last Library , after all .
There 's no Moore 's Law for capture , and nobody is ever going to scan most of these books again . "
If Google 's scans under the proposed settlement are likely to be the only chance millions of books will have for a digital life , then the potential for censorship is something to be taken very seriously indeed .
If the books can't be found by researchers , it will be as though they were cast down the Memory Hole .
Censorship by Rightsholders
The biggest censorship risk created by the proposed settlement is from copyright owners .
The proposed settlement gives rightsholders ( until April 2011 ) the power to " Remove " their books from the Google Books corpus altogether .
Once a book is removed , not only wo n't you be able to read it online , you wo n't even be able to find it using full - text search .
In short , these books would simply cease to exist as far as users of Google Books are concerned , despite the fact that courts have ruled that indexing copyrighted works is a perfectly legal fair use .
Moreover , even the libraries who contributed the book for scanning would n't have a digital " backup " in their collections , as these removed books would also vanish from the digital copies that Google gives back to the research libraries ( the " Library Digital Copies " and the " Research Corpus , " in the lingo of the settlement agreement ) .
Why would a rightsholder want to self - censor ?
First , remember that the author of a book is often not the rightsholder .
As a result , the copyright in a book can be purchased and then used to suppress further publication ( a trick Howard Hughes tried ) .
Moreover , sometimes the author or author 's heir ( or corporate successor ) wants to suppress a work ( Prof. R. Anthony Reese describes a number of historical examples of post- publication suppression efforts by authors and rightsholders in this article ) .
In the world of research libraries , of course , this kind of censorship is impossible — no research library would pull cards from the catalog and destroy copies of published works at the behest of those who own the copyright in those books .
Yet this is exactly what the proposed settlement would permit for the " Last Library . "
And most galling is that the settlement does not even require that a complete list of these " Removed " books ever be made publicly available ( in Google 's web search , in contrast , Google includes entries for results that would have appeared , but for DMCA takedown demands , and makes those demands publicly available through Chilling Effects ) .
At a minimum , books that are " removed " should remain in the database for full - text search , and Google should remain able to offer a " Library Link " ( i.e. , a link that directs a researcher to a library where the book can be found ) .
Even more troubling is the possibility of selective alterations of the texts of the books themselves .
In Section 3.10 ( c ) ( i ) , the settlement forbids Google " except as expressly authorized by the Registered Rightsholder " from altering the text of scanned books when displayed to users .
That 's certainly a good thing , as far as it goes — we should n't want Google to be able to go in and selectively edit books .
But Google is allowed to selectively edit if " authorized " by the copyright owner .
Why is this permitted ?
And if the rightsholder " authorizes " Google to make changes , can Google refuse to do so ?
Will the fact of alteration be publicly visible to the reader ?
The answer is not clear .
But clearly the better rule is a prohibition on anyone making editorial alterations in the text of scanned books ( again , no library would allow a copyright owner to selectively blackline books in the stacks ) .
Any other option creates the chilling prospect of " revising history " as imagined in Orwell 's 1984 .
Censorship by Google
The proposed settlement also gives Google a troubling degree of discretion when it comes to choosing which books will be publicly accessible .
For example , Section 3.7(e ) makes it clear that Google can exclude any scanned book it likes from public access " for editorial or non-editorial reasons . "
If it excludes a book for " editorial reasons , " it must notify the Registry ( but not the public ) , and the Registry may look for an alternative partner ( " Third - Party Required Library Service Provider " ) to host the book .
There is nothing that requires the Registry to do so , nor any guarantee that such a partner will step forward .
In addition , in order to meet its obligations under Section 7.2(e ) of the proposed settlement , Google need only make 85 % of the books it scans from its library partners publicly accessible through full - text search , consumer purchase , or the institutional subscription database .
Assuming that Google has already scanned approximately 8 million books that are in - copyright , that means Google can make more than 1.2 million of these books disappear from its publicly accessible services for any reason and still meet its obligations under the settlement .
And , again , nothing in the settlement requires Google to make the list of omitted books available to the public .
Censorship by Government
Finally , it 's worth noting that governments will doubtless exploit the leeway that the settlement gives to both rightsholders and Google to pull books off the digital shelves of Google Books .
It 's all too easy to imagine foreign governments pressuring their citizens to " remove " books from public access on Google .
It 's also likely that foreign governments will pressure Google to omit books from Google Books .
If that comes to pass , neither Google nor the rightsholders will be able to say that they are legally constrained by the settlement from complying short of legal process .
Had the settlement agreement been written to forbid this kind of censorship , both rightsholders and Google could have responded to censorship demands by saying " come back with a court order . "
And , finally , remember that Google may , under the settlement , sell off the entire Google Books project .
So even if you believe that Google would never cave to foreign governments or engage in selective censorship , keep in mind that 10 years from now , Google Books might be owned by an entirely different corporate master .
Iran is gathering momentum to become a great regional power with global implications .
It is already a nuclear weapons power , with externally - acquired nuclear weapons .
But the question facing Iranians and the external community is the style of governance of the country , and its specific international and grand strategy objectives .
Iran 's present geo-strategic position is also transformed in importance by the end of the Great Game ( or at least the component of it which began with the Russo - Persian Treaty of 1813 , transformed with the Anglo - Russian Convention of 1907 , and arguably concluded with the new Russo - Iranian understandings of the past few years ) .
In a parallel , and overlapping , dynamic , the China - Iran historical link has returned to the fore , especially given the PRC 's position as a major supplier of vital refined petroleum to Iran , and a client for Iranian crude oil .
The fact that the West has " lost " Turkey and Iran ( and the fact that Iran is now working closely with Turkey on a range of issues , but motivated mutually by the energy network controlled by Moscow ) to some extent empowers the Iranian clerical leadership , but this may be insufficient to paper over the differences between the competing , and possibly mutually destructive , clerical power factions .
Even so , the fact that Iran , Turkey , and Russia have come together effectively ends the economic and strategic isolation of Iran , and helps it build its confidence in rejecting Western intervention and pressure over domestic nuclear power and weapons programs .
Thus , the Middle Eastern states in particular , but equally the Indian Ocean and Euro - Mediterranean states , must now consider that Iran 's rise as a strategic power will continue .
The only question which remains is whether the clerical administration will be able to retain power , whether it will gradually morph into a secular governance structure , or whether it will be overthrown by a truly secular force .
There also remains the prospect for Iran 's geographic dismemberment , and some in the UK and US policy structures have openly pushed for the break - up of the Iranian state as a solution to the present situation .
This , however , could be equated to curing a disease by shooting the patient .
In mid-November 2009 , Hojjat - ol - Islam Gholam Hossein Mohseni -Ejhei , a former Minister of Intelligence & Security , and presently Attorney General , said that the Islamic Administration was vulnerable only from inside .
Iran geographically is a large country of 1,648,195 square km , the 17th largest nation - state , and possesses a unique geo-strategic situation , with a population of approximately 73 - million ; a long history , strong intellectual and cultural tradition , nationalism , and bountiful natural resources , especially its vast resources of oil and natural gas .
It has 12 percent of the world 's proven reserves of petroleum and also has the world 's second largest reserves of natural gas .
Iran is located in a critical area between two zones of energy , the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea , which contains 70 percent of world 's known energy reserves and 60 percent of its natural gas .
It has a 1,570 - mile coastline on the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman , with command of the strategic Strait of Hormuz .
Iran rightly sees itself as an important regional power and indeed is the center of gravitation and the lynchpin state in the greater Middle East from Pamir to the Mediterranean Sea .
Iran has borders with 15 countries without a single true strategic friend along its long borders .
It has been subjected many times to invasions of Russia and Great Britain in 19th and 20th centuries , and dismembered several times .
For example , under the Treaty of Gulistan in 1814 , Iran was forced to cede not only Georgia , but also eight other provinces , and under the Treaty of Turkemanchi , in 1828 , Iran was forced to hand over additional Iranian territory to Russia .
In 1907 , Britain and Russia signed an agreement which divided Iran into zones of influence , but this agreement failed in its objectives due to activities of Iranian nationalists and other reasons .
During World War I , and especially World War II , Iran was occupied , and the Soviet Union in 1945 openly and directly instigated separatists in Iran .
The Red Army supported Azerbaijani~ and Kurdish republics in Iran , but Soviet activities were frustrated by US Pres.
Harry Truman .
Iraq invaded Iran in 1990s , using chemical and biological weapons and killing more than 400,000 , maiming close to one - million .
The Iranians have not forgotten any of this ; the current Islamic overlay on the country - so apparent to external analysts - in no way hides nationalist sentiment at home .
Moreover , the Russians , who have forged a new Eurasian network following the unreported victory of Moscow in the Great Game , have also not abandoned their own caution over Iran and Turkey .
Senior Russian officials do not believe that the pragmatically - based new relationships with Tehran and Ankara change underlying mutual suspicions .
One very senior Russian Federation minister recently told Defense & Foreign Affairs .
" We have been dealing with the Turks and the Persians for 500 years .
We do not believe that they have changed , and they do not believe that we have changed . "
Given the fact that Iran is located at the crossroad of Eurasia , and subject to many attacks in the past ; and with five nuclear powers in the immediate vicinity , it is clear that Iranian officials and the public are conscious of the country 's defense needs and its right to develop defensive capabilities to ensure the security of the state against internal disintegration and external aggression .
Here the issue is responsibility of a government .
The Islamic Republic is unstable , and supports international terrorist groups .
It not only denies the Holocaust of the Jews and others in World War II ( a fundamental tenet of the reconstruction and unity of the post - War West ) , but is openly and repeatedly seeking the destruction of the State of Israel .
These factors alone - quite apart from the domestic repression and inefficient economic and infrastructural policies of the Government of the Islamic Republic - give the international community pause ; there can be no calm in the international community when such an unstable leadership has nuclear weapons .
If Iran had a more responsible and responsive government - one which is not threatened by internal factions - then it seems clear that the US and even Israel could live with a nuclear Iran .
Now that Iran has crossed the Rubicon and is almost able to domestically produce nuclear weapons , the question arises as to what policy the West should adopt to prevent , or cope with , Iranian instability leading to a possible catastrophe .
It could be argued that Moscow would benefit from a more stable Iran , as a trading and strategic partner , but such stability and wealth could also make a secular Iran less dependent on Moscow , and more open to a revived rapprochement with the West .
For the moment , Moscow finds its interests protected by the " dynamic instability " of Iran .
The Iranian ( and for that matter Turkish ) relations with the Russians are complex .
Tehran and Ankara each recognize the strategic supremacy of Moscow in the region and are gravitating toward the Kremlin in order to benefit from the ascent of Russia .
At the same time , there is a profound revival of historical sentiments in the three countries and this increasingly becomes a major influence on their respective strategy and policy formulation .
Russia , as noted , has a long history of bitter wars with both Turkey and Iran , as a result of which both countries lost both large amounts of territory and regional posture to triumphant Russia .
This legacy is very much alive and is manifesting itself in growing mistrust and latent hostility between Russia and the two countries .
It will be impossible for either Russia or Iran and Turkey to overcome and ignore this legacy while striving to consolidate strategic cooperation on the basis of contemporary circumstances .
Yes , Turkey and Iran will continue to closely cooperate with Russia against the US - led West , but they will continue to mistrust Russia as well .
In stark contrast , Persia - now Iran - and China have a long tradition of close cooperation and interaction along the Silk Road .
These contacts can be traced back at least three millennia .
With the exception of the Mongol surge , there has never been a major conflict between Persia / Iran and China , let alone war .
That these countries are thousands of miles apart contributed to the absence of war .
However , in Iranian political culture and tradition there is a profound difference between the hostile attitude toward Russia and friendship toward and trust in China .
Presently , the dependence of the PRC on imported oil and gas is growing .
As the PRC economy expands , this dependence grows fast .
The PRC considers Iran and Central Asia to be the main sources of imported energy .
Originally , the PRC sought to transport hydrocarbons by a web of pipelines across Central Asia to China .
However , the vast majority of the imported hydrocarbons are needed to feed the rapidly growing industrial base in south - eastern China , along the coast of the East China Sea .
Hence , it would be significantly cheaper and simpler to deliver the growing volumes of hydrocarbons by tankers .
Enter Iran 's new role in the PRC grand strategy .
Iran is considered as the primary venue for reaching out to Central Asia .
The evolving PRC energy policy is based on transporting hydrocarbons by pipeline to the coast of the Arabian Sea and onward by tanker to China .
This grand strategic surge will be consolidated in a few years once the US completes its withdrawal from Afghanistan .
Then , a PRC - sponsored Iranian - Pakistani condominium is planned to be established in Afghanistan in order to get the hydrocarbons to the main ports in Gwadar and Chah - Bahar .
Both Tehran and Islamabad are cognizant that in return for their cooperation in , and facilitation of , the PRC energy policy they would be provided with a PRC strategic umbrella against both the US and regional foes ( India , Israel , and even Russia ) .
This grand strategy is the key to the growing PRC influence in Tehran .
It is also the main source of the mullahs confidence that they will be able to weather the US pressure without having to give up too much to Russia , the current strategic power in the region .
Given this background , what options could Western states consider in dealing with the present Iranian clerical leadership ?
1. Negotiations and diplomatic engagement between the West and Iran experienced a miscarriage long ago .
An apocalyptic Iranian Administration which believes in dissimulation ( taghieh ) and for foreign policy decisions consults with the Quran ( estekhareh ) is unlikely to be a partner for " peace " or even stable , mutually beneficial relations .
It is not a normal and rational administration .
Iran 's strategy is to buy time .
If Tehran 's clerics engage in negotiation , it will be a means of deception to buy time to reach its strategic aim .
As Suntzu put it , when an emissary of a state comes to the negotiation table and at the same time continues preparation , then be sure it will advance .
2. Sanctions will not be effective .
Russia and the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) will not agree to meaningful sanctions because they both have economic and strategic interests in Iran , and even if they cooperated with the West for what the West believes would be effective sanctions , it would not bring the Islamic regime to its knees .
Sanctions have failed in all other instances in the past 50 years , and Iran - especially with its new outlets via Russia and Turkey - is far less vulnerable than was , say , Chile , Serbia , or Rhodesia .
3 . Neither war nor a military strike by Israel or the US , which some quarters have advocated , would be effective .
A military strike would not solve the problem - which , it is stressed again , is about leadership and not about nuclear weapons - and , on the contrary , would be detrimental to the interests of the West in the region .
It would bring incalculable harm to Israel than good , and would catapult the entire region into chaos , possibly leading to a military nuclear exchange .
In the event of a military strike against Iran , the Islamic Republic would most probably attack US interests in the region , simply because the clerics in Tehran and Qom do not believe that an Israeli military strike could be conducted without US connivance and support .
Iran would fire missiles at Tel Aviv and strategic Israeli targets , and proxy wars from HAMAS and Hizballah would be waged against Israel .
Most importantly , Iran would almost certainly use the cover of the conflict to attack the UAE and Saudi oilfields and refinery installations using its Shahab - 3 and other medium - range ballistic missiles .
It could take at least five - million barrels of Saudi oil a day out of the international market , thereby potentially increasing oil prices up to $ 10 a gallon at tile pumps , exacerbating the Western economic dilemma .
It would thus be unwise for the Saudi Government to instigate war against Iran , which , in any event , it would not be likely to do .
Iran may also attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz .
Any war in the region may start simply , but would be difficult to end .
4 . A fourth option for the West would be to encourage a change of government in Iran from the inside .
The best strategy , as all strategic philosophers aver , is to avoid a direct confrontation with power , and maneuver around it .
A large segment of the Iranian people demonstrated during recent months , following the June 12 , 2009 , Presidential elections , that they would be ready to overthrow the clerical Government .
They do not believe in the viability of meaningfulness of reform of the clerical administration .
The Islamic Republic , through its domestic and foreign policies , has created two important enemies : the people of Iran and the US and Israel .
A military strike and aggression against Iran would - as Iraqi Pres .
Saddam Hussein discovered - cause many Iranians who would otherwise oppose the Government to unite in support of an administration which they hate .
Indirect , psychological strategies and operations would support internal momentum .
The UK and US have clearly attempted this to some small degree in recent years , but often with the objective of fragmenting Iran .
Those operations have proven inconsequential and counter - productive .
The foundation of the Islamic state structure is shaky .
The element of fear of the Government is gone from the population .
There is , in Iran , widespread challenge to the State , and disruption of the rule of " Supreme Leader " Ayatollah Ali Hoseini - Khamene 'i .
The leadership is divided and it has created a political vacuum .
Khamene 'i on December 1 , 2009 , moved overtly for the first time against Pres. Mahmud Ahmadi -Nejad since the June 2009 Presidential elections .
He ordered Ahmadi -Nejad to release five British yachtsmen who had been captured and detained for infringing Iranian sovereign waters a week earlier .
Ahmadi-Nejad complied , releasing the yachtsmen on December 2 , 2009 .
The opening shots have been fired in the new round of internal conflict between the clerical groups in Iran .
The leaders around Khamene 'i favor removing Ahmadi - Nejad - a delicate maneuver considering the President 's influence in the Pasdaran ( Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps : IRGC ) and its Basij component - and replacing him with someone who remains loyal to the Islamic leadership but appears less threatening to Israel and the West .
Some elements close to Khamene'j have been promoting Tehran Mayor Mohammed Baqer Qalibaf as the ideal candidate .
The Iranian clerical leadership is aware that internal schisms are its biggest threat .
It is significant that , in the face of this , however , there is unity in overarching strategic objectives in Tehran and Qom : retention of clerical rule ; growing regional dominance and security ; and projection of authority into the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean .
These objectives demand a reintegration of Iran into the global energy markets , particularly through overland links to Europe and the PRC , and an ability to control oil and gas sea lanes through the Persian Gulf , Arabian Sea , and Red Sea ( all Indian Ocean sea lanes ) .
The strategic alliances with the PRC and Russia are critical elements of this , as is Iran 's participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) .
Significantly , these parameters would also apply to a secular Iranian Government , should one emerge , but the difference is that an Iran under secular governance would more readily revive a comfortable modus operandi with the West , minimizing the need to destabilize the region .
But it would be difficult for the West to demonstrate to Moscow that such a move would not reduce the delicately - balanced Russian influence and dominance of the Iranian market and resources , especially given the delicately - balanced Russo - PRC relations .
The PRC and Russia both provided significant intelligence and technical support to Tehran to manage hostile street crowds in most Iranian cities in the aftermath of the blatantly - manipulated Presidential elections of June 12 , 2009 .
Moscow and Beijing both recognize that suppression of internal unrest was at the core of managing the most significant threat to the clerical leadership and therefore their respective influence in Tehran : the restive , and now emboldened , Iranian population .

Whether it be an economic downturn , a design mis-step , an unexpected injury , a technicality , or plain old politics , there are myriad reasons why the even the best - laid plans in Formula 1 sometimes collapse before reaching fruition .
The 2009 season was riddled with plans being changed on the fly due to unexpected circumstances , and AUTOSPORT takes a look back at 10 of the most significant .
BMW Sauber will be a force in 2009
This was one of the big subplots during the winter of 2008 - 9 .
BMW
Sauber could never be accused of disguising its ambitions , and when it mightily irritated Robert Kubica by sacrificing his chance to win the 2008 title in order to divert all of its resources to the F1.09 , it was clearly declaring itself an early contender for the 2009 championship .
A big part of its confidence lay in its commitment to KERS , ironic that this part of the car would trigger its downfall - the system it developed did n't work particularly well , and the accompanying aerodynamic compromises proved insurmountable .
Donington will be redeveloped for the British Grand Prix
There were promises .
There were traffic plans .
There were simulators , talk of debentures , and arrows slung at the doubters .
There were holes dug .
And denials - there were a lot of denials .
And finally , there was a collapse , and unfinished building site with an uncertain future .
Toyota maintains F1 commitment
" We will continue F1 and other motorsport activities while cutting costs , " Toyota Motor Corporation president Katsuaki Watanabe said in January .
Ten months later , one of the most expensive F1 teams in history raised a tearful white flag and farewelled the sport , having spent hundreds of millions of dollars on 139 starts , 278.5 points , and crucially , zero wins .
Loeb to make F1 debut
When you 've dominated a championship in the manner that Sebastien Loeb has the WRC this decade , it 's natural to consider finding another world to rule .
There was no question over Loeb 's desire to try his hand at F1 , but the enthusiasm within the walls of Toro Rosso - with which he was expected to race at Abu Dhabi - was more difficult to judge .
His failure to qualify for the necessary superlicence eventually sunk his hopes .
Schumacher 's 2009 comeback
Talk about making the best of a bad situation .
Once it became clear that Felipe Massa would make a full recovery from his freak accident in Hungary , Ferrari 's mission was to find a suitable understudy .
The prospect of that person being Michael Schumacher seemed scarcely believable , although it later transpired that talks reached an extremely advanced stage .
In the end it was continuing problems from an earlier neck injury that extinguished the comeback and gave Luca Badoer a second chance at the age of 38 .
Schumacher got his wish in the end though , signing a race deal with Mercedes earlier this week .
Williams and Renault reunited
Williams and Renault enjoyed some good times together in seasons past , and the prospect of them teaming up together in 2010 was a very real one .
But the uncertainty over Renault 's future , caused by the crash scandal created an opening for Cosworth to make a pitch , and Williams was sufficiently impressed with its technical prowess that it decided to reunite with its engine partner from 2006 .
Fans to have more access to drivers
Nothing wrong with the sentiment - F1 has become too inaccessible for its supporters , so let 's close the gap a little - but the action plan needs a little more work .
The introduction of extra autograph signing sessions was admirable , but anecdotal evidence suggests that the reality sometimes fell short .
Locating an autograph session in an area restricted from most fans , as reportedly happed at one circuit , was a particular howler .
Red Bull to get Mercedes engines
The prospect of Red Bull racing with Mercedes power in 2010 was a very real one , with both parties signing an agreement in principle relatively early in the season .
But the McLaren Mercedes break - up complicated matters , and by November Red Bull was forced to concede that it would have to look elsewhere for engines .
Prodrive to enter F1 under Aston Martin banner
Well - resourced and with an experienced former F1 team principal David Richards at the helm , Prodrive was one of the favourites for selection as one of the three new teams in F1 for 2010 .
And tantalisingly , it was potentially going to race under the Aston Martin flag .
No-one was more surprised than Prodrive when it was overlooked , but the team remains committed to finding a way onto the grid .
Rosberg to BMW
As early as Monaco , Nico Rosberg was publicly floating the idea of a future away from Williams .
The German 's desire for a race - winning car had some rumours placing him at McLaren , but it was BMW Sauber that emerged as the leading contender for his signature .
But when Mercedes ' plans to go it alone gathered steam , Rosberg became its first signing .
Posted by John , October 29th , 2009 - under Socialist Alternative .
At the centre of the Australian political situation today is the contradiction between the deep crisis in world capitalism on the one hand and the ongoing stability and political quiet in Australia on the other writes Corey Oakley in Socialist Alternative .
TURMOIL IN THE WORLD SYSTEM
As Tom Bramble has outlined in Crisis and contradiction in the world economy , the world economic crisis is deep seated and systemic – easily the most serious economic turning point since the Great Depression .
The economic consequences have been severe , particularly for workers .
But the crisis has also caused deep political convulsions in the world system .
This is what Mick Armstrong wrote on behalf of the National Executive of Socialist Alternative in the pre-conference bulletin last year :
The whole ideological framework – free market economics – which has been dominant for the last 25 years has been severely discredited .
This puts the ruling class and its ideological hangers on very much on the backfoot .
It will take time for them to regroup and to come up with a new ideological framework to defend their system .
This opens up a space for alternative world views .
Socialist ideas … can potentially find a much greater resonance in the coming years .
However … Marxists do n’t argue that recessions and cuts to living standards lead automatically to working class resistance .
Mass sackings can make workers angry and embittered but they can also lead to demoralisation and a retreat into focusing on simply staying alive .
But major crises rupture the pattern of everyday life and open up the potential for political turmoil and major struggles .
The pattern will inevitably vary enormously from country to country but economic crises destabilise governments and commonly lead to sharp political polarisations both to the left and to the right .
In general terms , this outline stands .
We were right to say that the crisis could cause political convulsions , but it was also important to point out that the way it flowed through could be contradictory , and differ widely from country to country .
It is also important to note that we raised the potential space opening up for socialist ideas in terms of “ the coming years ” – we never talked about it in terms of what would happen in the first 12 months of the crisis .
We have covered many aspects of the political fallout in the magazine Socialist Alternative over the past year – the general strikes in France , Italy and Greece ( there was another among public sector workers in Romania in October ) ; the MPs perks scandal in Britain ; the collapse of the social - democratic vote in the European elections in June ; factory occupations in Ireland , South Korea and elsewhere ; and intensified class struggle in China , South Africa and Latin America , among other things .
In recent months , one of the most significant developments has been the resurgence of the American right , which has been running an intense , vitriolic campaign against Obama , drawing on the long history of anti-communism and racism in the US to denounce him as a socialist enemy of America .
This campaign is not , as it is often portrayed , simply a reflection of the anger of the grass - roots far right .
It is being driven by a section of capital which is pursuing a policy of class warfare , determined to crush any idea that the “ big government ” can intervene on behalf of workers , and trying to turn around the battering free - market ideology has received in the last 18 months .
In Europe we have just seen a number of elections that reflect the tumultuous political climate .
In recent elections the German SPD suffered its worst defeat in the post - war period , slumping to less than a quarter of the vote .
While this put the right in power , it is of great importance that the disillusionment with Social Democracy found a significant outlet on the left .
The Die Linke vote rose to 11.9 % , which when combined with the Green vote is almost equal to that of the SPD .
In parliamentary elections in Portugal last week , the main social - democratic party lost 10 % of its vote .
But as in Germany , the left gained .
The Left Boc vote went up to 10 % and it doubled its number of MPs .
The German result in particular is a step forward from the mid-year Euro elections , where most of the disillusionment with social - democratic parties flowed to the mainstream or far right .
On the other hand , there is no indication that the rise of the far - right in Eastern Europe has been pushed back in recent months .
And we do not want to overstate the positives on the left .
Things have gone forward in Germany – but Die Linke is far from being a revolutionary formation – and in most of the rest of Europe the far left has struggled to have an impact .
As well , while there have been working class struggles in Europe , they have not been of such a scale as to start to decisively turn the situation around .
Nonetheless , we can say that on a global scale there is widespread anger and disillusionment among both workers and sections of the middle class , though this has manifested in different ways in different countries , and has , as we predicted , found expression on both the left and the right .
If we combine that with the ongoing ideological turmoil among the bourgeoisie , we can say that , although there have not been any huge outbreaks that have transformed the situation one way or another , the economic crisis has had a significant political impact as it has worked its way through .
AUSTRALIAN STABILITY
And yet when we turn to Australia the term “ stability ” seems among the best with which to sum up the situation .
The Rudd government remains dominant in the opinion polls .
There have been virtually no significant social or industrial struggles , or polarising arguments around political issues .
Neither the left or the right have made gains .
What we have witnessed instead is a deepening of the process that began in the last years of the Howard government – an increasingly depoliticised atmosphere in society , the ebbing away of significant ideological battles , and a general lack of intense feeling about politics .
Why is this the case ?
The economic situation
First , let ’s look at the economic situation .
There are a series of factors that have meant that , economically , Australia has avoided the worst of the world crisis so far .
Australia went into the crisis in relatively good shape economically – with low unemployment , and nothing like , for example , the sub - prime volcano that was bubbling away under the surface in the US .
The much talked about fact that the export market to China has held up better than expected has made a major difference .
This has probably been decisive in holding the Australian economy up .
Australia ’s financial institutions have not collapsed – indeed the Australian banking sector has done better than almost anywhere else in the world .
Counter - cyclical measures , in particular the stimulus spending and sharp reductions in interest rates , have had a stabilising effect .
As a result of these different factors , the Australian economy is undoubtedly better placed than most around the world .
Australia ’s official unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent ( it actually fell by 0.1 % in September ) compares favourably with Spain : 18 per cent , Ireland : 11.7 per cent , the US : 9.7 per cent , Germany : 8.3 per cent and Britain : 7.8 per cent .
The housing market and retail sales have held up .
People are not losing their homes in large numbers .
There have not been major corporate collapses leading to mass sackings as has been seen in the US auto industry .
This relative economic stability has led to and intersected with a series of political factors .
The political impact of the stimulus package
The stimulus package has bolstered the government ’s credibility among voters .
Because there have not been major corporate collapses , and the financial industry has remained relatively stable , the government intervention has been focused on schools , infrastructure projects and cash handouts to workers .
There is no bitterness over handouts to the corporate crooks who caused the crisis , as is the case with the billions of dollars in bailouts handed to the Wall St bankers , who are blamed not only for the crisis , but for turfing millions of people out of their homes .
More social spending was always going to be popular , but what gave the government even more traction – and skewered the opposition ’s scare campaign about debt – was the fact that the stimulus package is perceived to have worked .
There is no doubt that as the financial crisis hit a year ago , and into the first half of this year , there was a very high level of anxiety among workers – so the Liberals ’ argument that we should “ do nothing ” and rely on market mechanisms was never going to fly .
One thing that definitely has flowed through here is the conviction that extreme free - market policies caused the world crisis , so the government ’s spending measures have met with very little right - wing resistance among the mass of society .
The end result of this is that Rudd is one of the very few social - democratic leaders in the world to enjoy widespread support .
Until recently Obama had been the other major exception – that cannot be said in the same unequivocal manner now , as the healthcare debate has damaged him on the left as well as the right .
Greece – where the social democrats were returned in elections in October – is an example , but social - democracy faces a considerable opposition on its left , making the situation vastly different to here where the Greens have been almost totally invisible since the 2007 election , and have done nothing to cohere a left wing alternative ( ditto for the unions , who I ’ll come back to ) .
Rudd ’s poll ratings are formidable .
The October 6 Newspoll had primaries running 46/35 to Labor , and a two party preferred of 58 / 42 the same way .
The Greens are on 10 % .
This is at the higher end of what we have seen , but Rudd ’s approval rating and the ALP TPP vote has been at extraordinary levels for a long period of time .
We should not draw from this , however , that Rudd is widely loved , or that he is supported with much conviction .
Within his own party and the union movement he is generally despised .
His ascent to the leadership was pure pragmatism on the part of the party powerbrokers , and it his only his success in winning the election – rather than any political loyalty – that keeps the party behind him .
Although the union leaders are not willing to wage a struggle against him , few have much hesitation in laying into Rudd politically .
More broadly it is hard to gauge exactly how deeply held support for Rudd is .
On the one hand , his opinion ratings indicate a consistently high level of support .
On the other , it is arguable that this is precisely the fact he is a non-polarising figure – he does n’t stir up strong emotions either way – that explains his good poll results .
There must be a lot of Liberal voters currently backing Rudd who do n’t mind him because he does n’t seem that different to Howard .
And while the Greens have been invisible , their poll numbers have improved since the election , indicating that there are plenty on the left who will preference against the Liberals , but are not particularly tied to Rudd .
There are other indicators that relate to Labor ’s core support base .
Labor party membership did not surge when Rudd won – in contrast , for example , to the 100,000 who ( even if briefly ) joined the British Labour Party after Blair took over .
When union officials slag off at Rudd at rallies or mass meetings there is no evidence of opposition from the crowd – usually quite the reverse .
If it is true that a lot of the support for Rudd is quite soft then there is the possibility that it can fall off very quickly if there is a major crisis , something that could be made worse for Rudd by the fact that most of his support in the party is based purely on his popularity with voters .
Ruling class backing for Labor
But if the Labor party and voters are n’t head over heels in love with Kevin Rudd , it ’s a different story for the bourgeoisie .
There has never been a Labor government in Australia that has had such unequivocal backing from the ruling class .
That ’s not to say that there are no conservative critics in the intelligentsia .
Obviously the likes of Andrew Bolt and Janet Albrechtsen criticise him quite sharply .
But they are isolated , ideological extremists .
It is indicative that most critics of Rudd amongst the commentariat are also climate change skeptics – a view totally out of line with mainstream bourgeois opinion .
All the main spokespeople for the bourgeoisie are enthusiastic backers of the government .
Of the commentators , even ideological right wingers like Gerard Henderson , Dennis Shanahan and Paul Kelly have good things to say about Rudd .
Other core members of the media establishment like Michelle Gratten are enthusiastic supporters .
Almost every economics writer has backed the government ’s strategy for dealing with the crisis – and most have spent time ridiculing the opposition .
Turning to industry leaders , it is a standing joke in the ALP that Heather Ridout is the second most senior member of the government .
The Business Council and the Chamber of Commerce are not as enthusiastic , but nor can they be called critics .
None of the major capitalists , sections of the government bureaucracy , the military or other component parts of the ruling class have campaigned against the government .
The Treasury and the Reserve Bank , for example , have backed Rudd down the line .
This ruling class backing significantly adds to the sense of stability , and the lack of political polarisation in society .
It is in stark contrast to the US , where even though a large section of the bourgeoisie backs Obama , another section is prepared to create a highly volatile political environment by viciously opposing him , a situation that until now no section of the ruling class has been prepared to step in and decisively try to stop .
Union disquiet – but inaction
It is undoubtedly the case that many in the union movement – perhaps even most – are unhappy with the Rudd government .
The construction unions are up in arms about the ABCC , and feel betrayed by Labor .
But more broadly , most unions are unhappy with Fair Work Australia , recognising privately at least that it keeps a large part of WorkChoices intact .
( This reality , by the way , is part of the explanation for ruling class support for Rudd – he was able to succeed in implementing the industrial agenda that Howard began .
Losing the Liberal government to achieve this was a price worth paying for the ruling class ) .
Union disquiet has meant that there are plenty of speeches made against Rudd and Gillard in various union forums , and precious few who will go into bat for the government .
The situation is nothing like what it was in the Accord years , when any bucking of the government was come down on like a ton of bricks .
But on the other hand , the unions have been without exception hopeless when it comes to standing up to the Labor government and launching some kind of fightback .
Even the construction unions , who seem to have done some things to try and resist the ABCC , have mostly done so behind the scenes .
There has been nothing in the way of a sustained public struggle against any of Labor ’s policies .
Continued contraction of struggle over social issues
On top of the low level of industrial struggle , there has been a continuation of the decline in protest and debate around other social issues .
Issues that have sparked passion and protest in the past – war , Aboriginal rights , refugees , student issues like fees and VSU , hostility to figures like George Bush – have almost all died away .
The main exception is the same - sex marriage campaign , which has been able to mobilise some numbers .
But it is hardly a burning issue in society , and although the demand for same - sex marriage rights is widely supported , its mobilising capacity has not gone beyond the gay and lesbian community , and there is little sign that it will anytime soon .
The other issues that there have been some mobilisations around are climate change and Palestine .
In the case of climate change , there is little sense the campaign is going anywhere .
And with Palestine it is clear that even though the issue resonates with people from Arab and Muslim backgrounds ( and to a lesser extent with non-whites more broadly ) it has virtually no traction with the mass of the working class or students .
The reality is , because of this , that Palestine is not a major issue in Australian society , something that , again , is not going to change soon .
And in all these cases we are talking about small mobilisations – in the thousands at best – nothing like the mass protests we saw against WorkChoices and the war .
In terms of an explanation for this ongoing decline , there are two factors .
One is the general non-polarised atmosphere in society .
The other factor is the more medium term decline of issues based struggle .
After WorkChoices , there were virtually no ideological battles or ongoing protests around any of the issues that dominated the earlier years of the Howard government .
The “ culture wars ” , as they were known , were in effect over long before Howard lost office .
And in terms of issue - based protests , there was nothing of much significance after the defeat of the mass anti-war movement in 2003 .
Element of continuity is important
In terms of coming to grips with the totality of the situation , it is important to grasp the continuity from the previous period that has impacted the political climate since the onset of the economic crisis .
Look at some of the examples of the turmoil in the world system .
In Britain , disillusionment – even bitterness – with Labor existed before the crisis .
Before the crisis hit in South Africa and China there was a rising level of struggle .
In these cases the crisis exacerbated what were existing conflicts and tensions .
Australia , by contrast , went into the crisis following a long boom , which while hardly brilliant for workers , was not devastating .
The crisis also hit after a long period of contraction of the left , low strike rates , low unionisation and relative social peace – a social peace that existed in its most marked form in the 2 years immediately preceding the financial collapse last year .
Combine this with the fact that the downturn has been relatively shallow in Australia so far , and you can start to understand the situation that we are in .
No international ruptures that have cut through
The other factor to take into account in the Australian situation is that although there have been significant political developments internationally , none of them have cut through here .
There has not been a major war that impacts on Australian politics ( the Gaza War palpably did not do this ) .
There has not been a major working class uprising in any Western country , or in our region , to shake things up here .
CONTRADICTIONS IN THE AUSTRALIAN SITUATION
While it is important to honestly assess the particular realities in Australia that have made the situation different here from elsewhere , we do not want to fall into the trap of thinking Australia is and will remain cut off from the effects of the world crisis .
There are a series of factors that indicate that the bubble insulating Australia from the world crisis cannot hold indefinitely .
The economy
While it is true that unemployment is relatively low here , this hides the true reduction in working hours , which is the more real measure of economic contraction .
As we pointed out in our magazine in September :
More than 500,000 Australians stopped working long hours in the past year .
The number of people working 50 hours a week or more has shrunk by 232,000 , a fall of 13 per cent .
The number working between 41 and 49 hours has shrunk 14 per cent , while the number working 30 to 39 hours has grown by more than 300,000 .
So while there have not as yet been wide - scale mass sackings , the living standards of large numbers of workers are being driven down .
And precisely because the world economy is still in a deep mess , facing the possibility of a double - dip recession or long years of stagnation , the Australian economy could still get into very serious trouble .
The response to the Reserve Bank decision to raise interest rates gave a sense of the true feelings of many capitalists and economists , who reacted with fear , and speculation that even a minor tightening of monetary policy could pull Australia into the global whirlpool .
In particular , the situation with China – whose ongoing growth is crucial to the Australian economy – is extremely unclear .
The massive stimulus spending by the Chinese government may have worked so far , but it is far from certain this will last into the future .
In the US , the tone has started to change quite sharply over the last month , with many economists warning that the stockmarket resurgence was premature , and that the US economy is in for a long period of stagnation , or even another collapse .
But even if the most optimistic scenarios for the Australian economy play out , the measures taken in the last year have built in problems that will inevitably arise in the future .
One that we have talked a lot about is debt .
At some point , the government will have to rein in spending , and start to attack workers ’ living standards in order to restore the surplus and cut down debt to acceptable levels .
Combine this with the effect of rising interest rates .
Part of the reason the housing sector has held up is the low interest rate level .
As rates go up , workers who have had their hours cut can find it increasingly difficult to make repayments .
This is made worse by the fact that unemployment is forecast to rise at least for the next 18 months .
And for workers who have taken advantage of the first homebuyers ’ grant the situation could be worse .
This grant was not actually a grant , in the sense that it was money to help people buy a home , but effectively just credit for a deposit – the reason being that the grant was immediately reflected in a comparable rise in house prices .
That is , there is a credit bubble built into Australian housing prices that will likely burst at some point .
Add these things together – the prospect of falling house prices , rising unemployment , higher interest rates and sharp cuts in government spending – and you have a combustible mix .
On top of the possibility that ongoing economic turmoil internationally can flow through here we need to add the potential for significant political developments that can start to reshape the political landscape in Australia .
It is hard to tell where the current flurry of sabre rattling about Iran and agonising about Afghanistan will go .
But we definitely can’t rule out the possibility of a new war in the next year or two as the ongoing economic crisis and imperialist rivalries feed off each other .
And of course there is the possibility of workers ’ upheavals or the rise of a new radical left internationally that could , particularly if it was centered in a country like the US , have an impact on politics here .
While we ca n’t speculate about the pace of developments , or the form that future upheavals will take , the underlying crisis in the world system means that at some point , major ruptures are likely .
S
o we should n’t operate on the expectation that the current calm in Australian politics will continue indefinitely .
But on the other hand we have to work out how to deal with the situation as it is now .
We need to avoid the temptation to telescope events .
It could be months or more likely years before a more politicised period opens up .

Experts urge to adjust family norms
By Lan Tian ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-11-28 07:24
The photograph reflects the gender imbalance story of China .
More boys than girls were in this kindergarten in Beijing on Friday when a China Daily photographer visited it .
Yan Xiaoqing
Worsening gender imbalance and an aging population have prompted experts to intensify their call for adjustments in the country 's decades - old family planning policy .
The experts have urged the government to ease the family planning policy , which allows most of the couples to have only one child , after latest data showed that 33.31 million more boys than girls were born in China between 1980 and 2000 .
Adjusting the family planning policy in the 12th Five - Year Plan ( 2011 - 15 ) will be beneficial to families as well as social development , said Yuan Xin , a professor in Tianjin - based Nankai University 's population and development institute .
The country 's male to female birth ratio has been changing , with more boys born since the 1980s .
Worldwide , the average is 103 to 107 boys for every 100 girls .
But last year , it reached 120.56 in China , Yuan said .
Except Tibet , all provinces , municipalities and regions have this gender imbalance , with the situation being most serious in Jiangxi , Anhui and Shaanxi provinces , he said .
" The gender gap in China will continue to widen in the short term , " Yuan said .
China began its family - planning policy in the 1970s by encouraging a couple to have only one child , and made it binding on all , except minority ethnic groups and rural residents , in 1982 .
Though the policy has prevented 400 million births , experts have criticized it for creating a host of problems from gender imbalance to an aging population .
" The policy has succeeded in preventing the country 's population from growing too fast , " Hu Angang , one of China 's leading policy advisers , wrote in the Economic Information Daily on Thursday .
But " now , we should implement a new population policy of ' one - couple , two children ' to counter the problem of aging population , " said Hu , who is the director of the center for China studies in Tsinghua University .
The country 's population growth rate has dropped to less than 10 per 1,000 since 1998 .
Last year , the rate was 5 per 1,000 , while Chinese women 's fertility rate fell to less than 1.8 , which means the country is facing the problem of having fewer children , he said .
By 2050 , 31.1 percent of China 's population will be above 60 , much higher than the world average of 21.9 percent then .
And India is expected to have 244 million more working - age people - between 15 and 59 years - than China by 2050 , according to the UN Population Division , Hu said .
Zhai Zhenwu , director of the school of population and sociological studies at Renmin University of China , agrees that the family planning policy should be adjusted .
" I think the adjustment should start after 2011 .
But the transition of the policy should be smooth , " he told China Daily .
" We are aware of the problem and working on a comprehensive and sustainable policy that would cover not only the size , but also the structure , quality and distribution of the population , " Zhao Baige , deputy director of the National Population and Family Planning Commission , said last month .
Many couples are eager to have two children .
" I 'd like to have two children if the policy allows , even though it means a heavier burden on the family , " said Tang Ying , a 26 - year - old human resources official in Beijing .
A recent survey by Beijing - based market research organization Horizon Research shows that nearly 40 percent couples with one child want to have two children .
And only 7 percent of those who have two children think that having just one child is better .
But experts said a policy adjustment was fraught with uncertainties and problems of its own .
Instead , " to fundamentally solve the problem of gender imbalance , we should change the deeply rooted traditional preference for the male child " , Yuan said .

A former magistrate who spent two years in jail before being cleared of rape has lost his legal battle to sue his accuser for £ 300,000 damages .
Anthony Hunt , 66 , from Dorset , was jailed for four years in 2003 , but had his conviction quashed on appeal in 2005 .
His initial attempt to sue his accuser for malicious prosecution failed last October after a high court judge ruled that the woman , known as AB , was not the prosecutor .
Today the court of appeal upheld that decision , in a ruling which underlined the role of the crown as prosecutor in protecting key witnesses from damage claims .
Women 's rights groups greeted it with " a huge sigh of relief " .
If Hunt 's claim had succeeded it could have cleared the way for alleged victims of unwitnessed crimes to be personally sued for damages in cases where defendants were acquitted .
Anna Mills , a solicitor acting for AB , said yesterday that her client " feels vindicated by the decision " .
She said : " Before Lovells [ law firm ] agreed to assist AB with this case she had personally spent in excess of £ 60,000 defending Mr Hunt 's claim .
She has suffered more than 14 years of severe psychological and emotional trauma . "
In the quest for smaller , faster computer chips , researchers are increasingly turning to quantum mechanics -- the exotic physics of the small .
The problem : the manufacturing techniques required to make quantum devices have been equally exotic .
That is , until now .
Researchers at Ohio State University have discovered a way to make quantum devices using technology common to the chip - making industry today .
This work might one day enable faster , low - power computer chips .
It could also lead to high - resolution cameras for security and public safety , and cameras that provide clear vision through bad weather .
Paul Berger , professor of electrical and computer engineering and professor of physics at Ohio State University , and his colleagues report their findings in an upcoming issue of IEEE Electron Device Letters .

The team fabricated a device called a tunneling diode using the most common chip - making technique , called chemical vapor deposition .
“ We wanted to do this using only the tools found in the typical chip - makers toolbox , ” Berger said .
“ Here we have a technique that manufacturers could potentially use to fabricate quantum devices directly on a silicon chip , side - by - side with their regular circuits and switches . ”
The quantum device in question is a resonant interband tunneling diode ( RITD ) -- a device that enables large amounts of current to be regulated through a circuit , but at very low voltages .
That means that such devices run on very little power .
RITDs have been difficult to manufacture because they contain dopants -- chemical elements -- that do n’t easily fit within a silicon crystal .
Atoms of the RITD dopants antimony or phosphorus , for example , are large compared to atoms of silicon .
Because they do n’t fit into the natural openings inside a silicon crystal , the dopants tend to collect on the surface of a chip .

“ It ’s like when you ’re playing Tetris and you have a big block raining down , and only a small square to fit it in .
The block has to sit on top , ” Berger said .
“ When you ’re building up layers of silicon , these dopants do n’t readily fit in .
Eventually , they clump together on top of the chip . ”
In the past , researchers have tried adding the dopants while growing the silicon wafer one crystal layer at a time -- using a slow and expensive process called molecular beam epitaxy , a method which is challenging for high - volume manufacturing .
That process also creates too many defects within the silicon .
Berger discovered that RITD dopants could be added during chemical vapor deposition , in which a gas carries the chemical elements to the surface of a wafer many layers at a time .
The key was determining the right reactor conditions to deliver the dopants to the silicon , he found .
“ One key is hydrogen , ” he said .
“ It binds to the silicon surface and keeps the dopants from clumping .
So you do n’t have to grow chips at 320 degrees Celsius [ approximately 600 degrees Fahrenheit ] like you do when using molecular beam epitaxy .
You can actually grow them at a higher temperature like 600 degrees Celsius [ more than 1100 degrees Fahrenheit ] at a lower cost , and with fewer crystal defects . ”
Tunneling diodes are so named because they exploit a quantum mechanical effect known as tunneling , which lets electrons pass through thin barriers unhindered .
In theory , interband tunneling diodes could form very dense , very efficient micro-circuits in computer chips .
A large amount of data could be stored in a small area on a chip with very little energy required .
Researchers judge the usefulness of tunneling diodes by the abrupt change in the current densities they carry , a characteristic known as “ peak - to - valley ratio . ”
Different ratios are appropriate for different kinds of devices .
Logic circuits such as those on a computer chip are best suited by a ratio of about 2 .
The RITDs that Berger ’s team fabricated had a ratio of 1.85 .
“ We ’re close , and I ’m sure we can do better , ” he said .
He envisions his RITDs being used for ultra - low - power computer chips operating with small voltages and producing less wasted heat .
“ Chip makers today are having a great difficulty boosting performance in each generation , so they pack chips with more and more circuitry , and end up generating a lot of heat , ” Berger said .
“ That ’s why a laptop computer is often too hot to actually sit atop your lap .
Soon , their heat output will rival that of a nuclear reactor per unit volume . ”
“ That ’s why moving to quantum devices will be a game - changer . ”
RITDs could form high - resolution detectors for imaging devices called focal plane arrays .
These arrays operate at wavelengths beyond the human eye and can permit detection of concealed weapons and improvised explosive devices .
They can also provide vision through rain , snow , fog , and even mild dust storms , for improved airplane and automobile safety , Berger said .
Medical imaging of cancerous tumors is another potential application .
His coauthors on the paper included Si-Young Park , and R. Anisha , both doctoral students in electrical engineering at Ohio State ; and Roger Loo , Ngoc Duy Nguyen , Shotaro Takeuchi , and Matty Caymax , all of IMEC , an industrial research center in Belgium .

For 2 1/ 4 years now I have been saying that there is no chance of a repeat of the Great Depression or anything like it -- that we know what to do and how to do it and will do it if things turn south .
I do n't think I can say that anymore .
In my estimation the chances of another big downward shock to the U.S. economy -- a shock that would carry us from the 1/3 - of - a- Great - Depression we have now to 2/3 or more -- are about 5 % .
And it now looks very much as if if such a shock hits the U.S. government will be unable to do a d----- thing about it .
We could cushion the impact of another big downward shock by a lot more deficit spending -- unemployment , after all , goes down whenever anybody spends more ( even though sometimes falling unemployment comes at too - high a price in rising inflation ) , and the government 's money is as good as anybody else 's .
But the centrist Democratic legislative caucus has now dug in its heels behind the position that we cannot undertake more deficit spending right now because we have a dire structural health - care financing proble afrer 2030 .
The Republican legislative causes has now dug in its heels behind the position that the fact that unemployment is 10 % shows not that policy earlier this year was too cautious but rather that it was ineffective .
And the Obama administration has not been able or has not tried to move either of those groups out of their current entrenchments .
We could cushion the impact of another big downward shock by recapitalizing the banks again .
But the failure of the Fed and the Treasury in the aftermath of Lehman to grab a share of the upside from its capital injection and purchase operations for the public in the form of warrants means that there is no coalition anywhere for a repeat or anything like a repeat of propping - up the banking system : the right thinks it is an unwarranted intervention in the free market , the left thinks that it is a giveaway to the undeserving and feckless superrich , and the center is bewildered because it is an enormous and poorly - structured intervention in the market , it is a giveaway to the undeserving and feckless superrich , and the optics are terrible .
So if another big bad shock hits the U.S. economy , what could the Obama administration possibly do ?

In 2005 , Michael S. Dell ’s namesake company was getting pounded .
His competitors were selling personal computers and servers built on cheap , popular and powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices , while Mr. Dell had stuck loyally with slower chips from Intel .
In an e-mail note to Intel ’s chief executive , Paul S. Otellini , Mr. Dell threatened to switch to A.M.D. “ I am tired of losing business , ” Mr. Dell wrote .
“ We are losing the hearts , minds and wallets of our best customers . ”
Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $ 1 billion in the last year .
“ This was judged by your team to be more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues , ” he wrote .
Dell delayed buying A.M.D. chips , and Mr. Otellini said in a later e-mail message to a colleague that Dell was “ the best friend money can buy . ”
Such payments to PC makers , along with other aggressive business tactics , are at the heart of the antirust lawsuit filed against Intel on Wednesday by New York ’s attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo .
Mr. Cuomo ’s case  the first antitrust charges against the company in the United States in more than a decade  follows similar actions by regulators in Europe and Asia .
Serious Sam has a warm place in the hearts of PC gamers as something of a bastard child of Duke Nukem .
He 's a character with all the attitude of Duke with none of the hopes of doing anything other than blowing the holy hell out of everything he sees .
Serious Sam was something of an anachronism when it was released back in 2001 , but now the gameplay mechanics feel positively ancient .
Do n't worry though , that 's a very , very good thing .
Serious Sam HD may seem like a lazy port on paper , but it 's everything you remember , with a brand new layer of polish .
Title Serious Sam HD Developer Devolver Digital Publisher CroTeam Price $ 19.99 ( Steam Only ) Platform PC , Xbox 360 upcoming for $ 15
The game now runs on the Serious Engine 3 , and all the weapons and monsters have impressive new texture work .
There are multitudes of options for tweaking your visual experience , so gamers who like to dig deep into the graphical settings of their games are going to be in heaven .
That being said , the levels are still rather spartan ; do n't expect to see the level of detail and verisimilitude you get with a modern game , built from the ground up on a current - generation engine .
This is clearly an older title with refreshed textures and models .
It 's also important to note that there is nothing new here .
No new game modes , missions , or secrets ... just a straight port of Serious Sam : The First Encounter with updated graphics and a new engine .
The price tag on Steam is only $ 20 , but that was also the price of the original game at retail .
Depending on your feelings concerning inflation , that 's either a rip - off or a great deal .
So what are you paying for ?
Anarchy .
Sheer , unadulterated anarchy .
The game throws hundreds — if not thousands — of enemies at you , level after level .
You 'll often go long periods of time without taking your finger off the trigger .
The enemies explode into bloody chunks , you collect any health or ammo you find , and then you move on to the next area .
There is a story , if you can call it that , but you do n't need to bother with it .
The only point of the game is to kill everything you see .
Your health wo n't regenerate , the enemies have very basic AI , and the game is almost completely linear .
What it lacks in features it makes up for in insanity .
Why would CroTeam need to code in thinking enemies when they all just run at you in overwhelming numbers ?
You 'll be attacked by hordes of shrieking harpies , you 'll have to pump hundreds of minigun rounds into charging bulls , and of course the galloping skeleton ... everything is there to make sure you 'll rarely have the opportunity to take a breath .
These days we 're trained to figure out where the cover is , kill a few enemies , and then fall back while our shields or health recharge .
Here those skills are worthless , as you 'll need to continually move , pay attention to where the next wave is coming from , and keep track of the somewhat limited ammo for your more effective weapons .
That 's it .
It never changes until the game is over .
It never gets more complex .
If you 're looking for a game that will make you think ... well , you 're out of luck here .
If you want something that jams a steel spike into your fight or flight center , you 've come to the right place .
Bring some friends
At $ 20 it wo n't be hard to convince some friends to pick this up as well , and the co-op is where the game begins to really shine .
You can play with up to 16 people at once through the campaign , and you do n't need to do much strategizing outside of , again , killing everything you see .
The enemies will scale depending on how many friends you bring into the fight , and you can set up any number of options to make the experience harder or easier .
If you want a real challenge , toggle friendly fire to ON .
This is a tough game to play with a roomful of people when you suddenly have to watch where your bullets are going .
It would be easier for fans of the game to get excited if we were offered some new game modes or levels or ... well , anything , but if you 're new to the game there 's a ton to love here .
And again , the $ 20 price tag make this an almost impulse buy if you 're in the mood for some brainless fun .
Sometimes you just need to kill scores of hellish enemies with a handheld cannon , and the fun 's never over until the guns go * click . *

Houston , Texas ( CNN ) -- Annise Parker made history Saturday as Houston 's first openly gay mayor .
Parker , who served five years as city controller , beat former city attorney Gene Locke with 53.6 percent of the vote in a runoff election .
Both are Democrats who faced off for the second time because neither emerged with more than 50 percent of the vote in the November 3 election .
Parker 's election also makes her the second woman to become mayor of Houston .
Other cities such as Providence , Rhode Island , and Portland , Oregon , have picked openly gay mayors .
Houston is the fourth - largest U.S. city .
Parker 's victory is also remarkable because a few years ago , Houston rejected a referendum to offer benefits to same - sex partners of city workers .
Also , the city sits in a state where gay marriage is against the law .
" Houston is a multiracial , multicultural , international city .
And I think my election will send a message to the world that Houston is a city that might surprise a lot of folks , " Parker said before the runoff .
Parker , 53 , has never shied away from , nor made an issue of , her sexual orientation .
She has been with her partner for 19 years and they have two adopted children .
She was elected to the city council and then spent the past five years as city controller .
She ran for mayor on a platform of fiscal conservatism .
" I have always stood up for the fact that I am gay .
It 's part of the resume that I bring to the table , but it 's just a piece of the package , " she said .
After the mayoral race entered a runoff , conservatives and anti-gay activists mounted an intense campaign against Parker .
Houston residents received flyers in the mail that highlighted Parker 's support from gay groups and her relationship with her partner .
" There 's a certain segment of Houston , there 's a certain segment of society that has problems with the issues around sexual orientation , " Parker said .
" But the citizens of Houston have elected me six consecutive times to public office .
They know me , they trust me .
" I think it 's a small and shrinking minority of Houstonians who have that attitude and I look forward to it as being mayor of all of Houston , " she said .
Turnout was light Saturday .
Only 16.4 percent of the eligible voters cast ballots , according to the results from Harris County , Texas , where Houston is located .
Locke received 46.4 percent of the vote .
Parker will take office in January , replacing Bill White who could not run because of term limits .
CNN 's Ed Lavendera and Don Lemon contributed to this report .
The earth we abuse and the living things we kill will , in the end , take their revenge ; for in exploiting their presence we are diminishing our future - Marya Mannes
We keep hearing the cries every day to save the planet !
Environmentalists campaign everyday to save life on this planet !!
Recently I witnessed a campaign in which some celebrities wanted to save planet Earth !
Celebrities whose lifestyle consume n times more natural resources than the common man – appear in ads appealing to the common man not to waste ( ? ) natural resources !!!
Trees are cut down to create movie sets , chemicals used in action scenes for explosions pollute the air more than the smoke from a two wheeler , consumption of natural resources by most celebrities is n times more than that of a common man and yet some of their speeches sound as if it is the common man who is destroying the nature and they are the ones who are trying to rescue it !!
It has become a fashion to organize runs , led by some celebrity , for the sake of “ Saving the Planet ” .
The anchors in the “ Save Mother Earth ” programs keep reminding the viewers about the planet being under threat !!!
Is n’t it the biggest joke of all times ?
How on earth can earth be under threat ?
It is not the planet Earth that is under threat .
It is the human race that is under threat .
Not just planet earth , but even life on earth will not just survive but even thrive even if the human civilization comes to an end due to a global nuclear war .
If all mankind were to disappear , the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed thousands of years ago .
If insects were to vanish , the environment would collapse into chaos .
Planet Earth is too big a thing for humans to be able to threaten it .
The tsunamis , earth quakes , floods , hot summers , volcano eruptions all clearly show who is under threat , planet earth or human race :)
The only difference between birds and humans is that birds have this superior ability to build their beautiful well structured homes and yet leave the landscape as it was before .
The ability of planet earth lies in the fact that it can wipe out the trace of all this pollution caused by humans in a single super volcano , which also would wipe out all humans , and then start life afresh and within next few thousand years the green life and great forests would be back on earth – minus humans .
Even if there is a global nuclear war , there are millions of species on this planet who can survive the aftermath of that .
Only humans will be wiped out partly by the war , and remaining due to post war effects .
Life on earth will be back to its pre human - intelligence era within a few centuries and the aliens who land here after that will not even have any clue about the intelligent life having once lived here .
There were no environmentalists when the poor bird Dodo was wiped out of the face of this planet !
Why ?
Because extincion of the poor Dodo did not threaten the human race .
But the growing world pollution today is definitely a threat to the human race , and hence all this awareness campaigns .
Culture and Nature
A living planet is a much more complex metaphor for deity than just a bigger father with a bigger fist .
- David Brin .
One of the major reasons for plundering of natural resources by humans is the absence of duty towards nature in our conscience which is then clouded by greed .
The moment I believe someone who says that God created earth and other resources for human beings to consume , it implies that nature be treated as a commodity , and be plundered endlessly without any guilt .
The ancient vedic texts make nature an integral part of extended divinity and ask humans to treat it as a community in which they live in , not as a commodity .
The vedic texts by saying , “ Taru Devo Bhava ” preach that a tree is the same as God .
Well , if nature was a commodity for human consumption , then why did God create humans billions of years after life on earth was born , billions and billions of years after universe itself was created ?
Why were dinosaurs created millions of years before humans ?
If the history of life on earth was written as a 1000 page book , humans will appear only in the last line of the last page of that book !
Doesnt it then look like that humans were created by God to show it to Earth and other species here the disastrous life a greedy intelligent species like humans can live ? :)
“ Christianity , with its roots in Judaism , was a major factor in the development of the Western worldview … .
A basic Christian belief was that God gave humans dominion over creation , with the freedom to use the environment as they saw fit .
Another important Judeo - Christian belief predicted that God would bring a cataclysmic end to the Earth sometime in the future .
One interpretation of this belief is that the Earth is only a temporary way station on the soul ’s journey to the afterlife .
Because these beliefs tended to devalue the natural world , they fostered attitudes and behaviors that had a negative effect on the environment . ”
– Donald G. Kaufman and Cecilia M. Franz , Biosphere 2000 : Protecting Our Global Environment , 1996
The early morning prayer of the hindus saluting mother earth ends with “ Paadasparsham Kshamasvame ” means
“ Oh Mother Earth , please forgive me for I will be touching you with my feet for the rest of the day ” !
The ancient vedic texts bring about natural consciousness in humans by assigning divine status to all life forms including trees and animals , which also extends to all other forms of nature from stars to sun to mountains and rivers .
“ I realized that Eastern thought had somewhat more compassion for all living things .
Man was a form of life that in another reincarnation might possibly be a horsefly or a bird of paradise or a deer .
So a man of such a faith , looking at animals , might be looking at old friends or ancestors .
In the East the wilderness has no evil connotation ; it is thought of as an expression of the unity and harmony of the universe ” – William O. Douglas , Go East , Young Man , 1974
As Mahatma Gandhi once rightly said ,
" Nature provides enough for our need , but not for our greed . "
And Gandhi also said this : “ God forbid that India should ever take to industrialism after the manner of the west … keeping the world in chains .
If [ our nation ] took to similar economic exploitation , it would strip the world bare like locusts . ”
Conclusion :
Planet Earth is NOT in danger , why ?
Because humans are no match to its self healing capacity .
Human race IS DEFINITELY IN DANGER because they cannot play by the rules of nature .
So please stop labelling the enviromentalism campaign as if it is a charity being done by intelligent humans to save and protect planet earth .
Let us be straightforward and accept that , environmentalism is the last ditch attempt to save human race from extinction on this beautiful living planet , which will continue to live and thrive irrespective of human existence here .
I am I plus my surroundings and if I do not preserve the latter , I do not preserve myself .
– Gasset , Jose Ortega Y

Even before it�s completed� .
IT MUST FALL !
The reasons Netanyahu ( see report below ) gives for construction of the proposed wall are nothing but LIES !
The wall is to guarantee the further imprisonment of the people of Gaza� .
no other reason .
The crossings into Egypt are the only ways out of the existing prison camp .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak at least lied in a more diplomatic manner when discussing the situation , as can be seen in THIS report .
From the report �..
The two pieces of the fence slated to be built cover 70 kilometers of the Nitzana region from Be�erotayim in the south to Rafah in the north , and 15 kilometers directly paralleling and just north of Eilat � two areas viewed as particularly attractive to border infiltrators .
Rafah in the north ????
Rafah is on the Egyptian / Israeli border ????
Palestine obviously does not / nor will ever exist as far as Israel is concerned .
The motives are obvious� .
and THE WALL MUST FALL !
Netanyahu okays Israel - Egypt border wall
Bethlehem � Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved the construction of a wall along the border between Israel and Egypt , Israeli media reported on Tuesday .
The decision came , according to Israeli daily Ma�ariv , after consultations involving security , political , and financial officials in Israel .
Netanyahu believes construction of a barrier will stop smuggling and the migration of Africans seeking work or asylum in Israel .
The decision , according to Ma�ariv , was made as a result of an increase in the number of African immigrants crossing into Israel .
" The only place in the world where it takes tens of meters walk to cross from the third world to the first world is Israel�s southern borders , " Netanyahu was quoted as saying in the report .
According to Ma�ariv , the plans for the border wall will be ready in early summer , and there is more than one option for the nature of proposed barrier .
The Israeli Defense Ministry submitted a five billion - shekel ( 1.3 billion US dollar ) proposal to build a wall similar to the separation wall being built around the West Bank .
Ma�ariv reports that another option , suggested by Israeli Ministry of Finance , is erection of an electronic fence at a cost of 450 million NIS .
Meanwhile , Israeli ministry of internal security suggested a mix of both suggestions .
Ma�ariv added that model sections of the suggested walls would be built to test their efficiency on the ground .
Also on Tuesday , Egyptian police shot and critically wounded an Eritrean immigrant on Monday evening while he attempted to cross into Israel on the Sinai desert border .
Egyptian security sources told Ma�an that the man was injured during an exchange of fire between Egyptian border police and traffickers hired to smuggle migrants into Israel .
At least 17 migrants have been killed at the border since May .

On the city ’s east side , where auto workers once assembled cars by the millions , nature is taking back the land .
Cottonwood trees grow through the collapsed roofs of homes stripped clean for scrap metal .
Wild grasses carpet the rusty shells of empty factories , now home to pheasants and wild turkeys .
This green veil is proof of how far this city has fallen from its industrial heyday and , to a small group of investors , a clear sign .
Detroit , they say , needs to get back to what it was before Henry Ford moved to town : farmland .
“ There ’s so much land available and it ’s begging to be used , ” said Michael Score , president of the Hantz Farms , which is buying up abandoned sections of the city ’s 139 - square - mile landscape and plans to transform them into a large - scale commercial farm enterprise .
Advertisement
“ Farming is how Detroit started , ” Score said , “ and farming is how Detroit can be saved . ”
The urban agricultural movement has grown nationwide in recent years , as recession - fueled worries prompted people to raise fruits and vegetables to feed their families and perhaps sell at local farmers ’ markets .
Large gardens and small farms -- usually 10 acres or less -- have cropped up in thriving cities such as Berkeley , where land is tough to come by , and struggling Rust Belt communities such as Flint , Mich. , which hopes to encourage green space development and residents to eat locally grown foods .
In Detroit , hundreds of backyard gardens and scores of community gardens have blossomed and helped feed students in at least 40 schools and hundreds of families .

It is the size and scope of Hantz Farms that makes the project unique .
Although company officials declined to pinpoint how many acres they might use , they have been quoted as saying that they plan to farm up to 5,000 acres within the Motor City ’s limits in the coming years , raising organic lettuces , trees for biofuel and a variety of other things .
The project was launched two years ago by Michigan native and financier John Hantz , who has invested an initial $ 30 million of his own money toward purchasing equipment and land .
It will start small .
Next spring , the farm is expected to begin growing crops on about 30 acres of land , Score said .
Because it has been difficult for Hantz and his team to purchase large contiguous parcels , much of the acreage has been grouped into smaller “ pods . ”
Each will grow different crops , depending on the condition of the soil and what buildings remain on the land , Score said .

Hantz executives envision a city where green fields and apple orchards flourish next to houses and factories , and forests thrive alongside interstates and highways .
The team is still figuring out what will grow where :
Tree groves could be planted where the soil is too contaminated to grow food , and empty factory buildings may be converted to house hydroponic fields to raise specialty vegetables , fruit and cooking herbs .
“ People look at these abandoned houses and think , ‘ No one could live there .
Let ’s tear it down , ’ ” said Score , a former business development consultant for Michigan State University ’s agricultural extension program .
“ I look at it and think , maybe we could grow mushrooms inside there . ”
The idea of turning this former American manufacturing capital into an agrarian paradise is not that far - fetched , at least not with history as a guide .

The city , one of the Midwest ’s oldest , began as an agricultural settlement in the early 1700s with “ ribbon ” farms -- long , narrow stretches of land -- carved out along the edge of local rivers .
And until its industrial boom of the early 20th century , this swath of southeastern Michigan was covered in apple and peach orchards and miles of grapevines .
In 1910 , about 80 % of the 396,800 acres of Wayne County was being farmed , according to research collected by Michigan State .
By 1925 , as the auto industry boomed , that figure fell to 47 % .
Today , fewer than 21,000 acres are being farmed .
Local leaders say they are encouraged by the idea of farm jobs coming to Detroit , which could help ease the region ’s grim economic situation :
The Detroit - Livonia - Dearborn area had an unemployment rate of 17.7 % in October , the highest in a region of 1 million residents or more , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Advertisement
But local officials put the number far higher : Mayor Dave Bing recently said that nearly half of the city ’s workers are either unemployed or underemployed .
These officials support the effort to redevelop the estimated one - third of Detroit ’s 376,000 parcels that are either vacant or abandoned .
And in a city where there are no major grocery store chains , and more than three - fourths of the residents buy their food at convenience stores or gas stations , the idea of having easy access to fresh produce is appealing .
“ There is real potential for this to work , because land prices in Detroit are low and there ’s a demand for local food , ” said Bill Knudson , an agricultural economist at Michigan State .
“ The million - dollar question is whether that local - food trend is permanent , ” Knudson said .
“ If it is , then this plan works because you have more than a million consumers in the city and nearby areas to sell to .
If not , you ’re going to have a hard time getting enough acreage put together to make the costs of running a commercial operation feasible . ”

City officials also remain cautious about the project .
They point out that commercial farming brings with it numerous hurdles that other commercial projects do n’t .
Their concerns include figuring out who would pay for cleaning pollutants out of the soil and removing utility infrastructure , such as gas and sewer lines ; how to rewrite the city ’s zoning laws ; and how to adjust property tax rates and property values to allow for commercial farming .
“ Urban farming will be part of Detroit ’s long - term redevelopment plan , ” Bing said in a statement .
However , he added , “ as a city built primarily for manufacturing and industrial production , preparing land for widespread agricultural purposes is a process that cannot occur overnight . ”

Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland had the splashier roles in The Wicker Man , the 1973 occult horror set in a fictional Hebridian island demented by paganism , but it was the performance of Edward Woodward , who died today , that made that film so haunting .
Woodward was cast in the role of devout Christian police sergeant Neil Howie , dispatched from the mainland to investigate the disappearance of a young girl , after actors including Michael York and David Hemmings turned it down .
It 's hard to imagine how slick , pin-up performers as these would have brought the same emotional punch to that terrible , awe - inspiring climax , in which Howie hollers to God and sings The Lord Is My Shepherd as he is immolated .
It 's one of the most truly appalling sequences in cinema .
But much of the scene 's power is all about the actor : after spending the whole of the film in such upstanding , even self - righteous bafflement , his clear - eyed terror make this a deeply moving conclusion – unusual for a horror that had more than a touch of the Hammer to it .
Woodward specialised in righteous enforcers : men of honour , grappling with temptation ; men to trust and respect , and not to get on the wrong side of .
He shares more with the likes of The Conversation - era Gene Hackman than , say , the stars of The Sweeney .
A lot of these clips have a saxophone - friendly langour to them ; they also show Woodward alone , with his thoughts – here was a man who did n't need a lot of back - up to make a scene compelling .
When The Wicker Man was released , Woodward was already well - known in the UK as rebellious TV spook Callan , a role he played from 1967 to 1972 .
Here he is strengthening his fists while resisting the bottle .
And here he is , failing to resist as he rails against the death of a colleague .
There 's a wonderful moment about two minutes in , when Callan , stumbling with grief and booze , says : " If one of us cracks , we all could .
Because there is an ugly black streak , bloody deep , and it's welling up in the likes of us , and holding it down is what makes us good at our jobs .
That 's all . "
It could be a statement of intent for all of his characters .
The Wicker Man had not , at the time , reached cult classic status – it was the 1980 Australian film Breaker Morant , in which Woodward played the title role as the drover , horseman , poet and soldier sentenced to death for his part in the summary execution of several Boer prisoners and a German missionary , which first brought him to international attention .
But it was Woodward 's role in 1980s CBS series The Equalizer that cemented his fame .
Then in his 50s , the actor played a former secret agent who strives to atone for past sins through the gratis offering of services as a troubleshooter , protector and investigator .
New York was a world away from the homespun locations and wobbly production values of his previous cop roles , but Woodward brought with him the same blend of earnestness , cynicism and thoughtfulness .
The show paced itself around its star , finding focus in his stillness .
Here was a man who did n't need his gun to make a point ; who was n't afraid to sing , alone , at night , nursing a scotch .
Woodward was , in fact , a prolific singer , recording 12 albums of songs , as well as three of poetry .
Here he is , perfectly balancing the emotion and enunciation on this They Didn't Believe Me .
You can feel his training here – he became Rada 's youngest ever student when he was admitted aged 16 .
After graduating , he became a respected stage actor , with seasons in the West End , at Stratford , on Broadway and at the National under Laurence Olivier .
But it was n't all training .
To all Woodward 's performances , there 's a fundamental truthfulness that shines through .
When he was five , he won a talent contest in Wallington , for which he was awarded a penknife .
But it was n't long before the silver coating began to peel , revealing some far more mundane metal beneath .
" You start doing deals with Americans , " he once said , " particularly the big Hollywood ones , and you 'll appreciate the story about the silver penknife . "
Despite a triple heart bypass in 1996 , and a prostate cancer diagnosis in 2003 , Woodward was still working until very recently .
In 2007 he had a funny cameo in Simon Pegg 's comedy Hot Fuzz , a mildly Wicker Man-inspired comedy about the sleepiest town in the country , plagued with an alarmingly disproportionate accident rate .
Then there was an episode of The Bill from 2008 , possibly an inspiration for Michael Caine 's elderly vigilante drama Harry Brown .
And , from March this year , he spent a couple of months on EastEnders , playing Tommy Clifford , another old soul atoning for past sins ( in this case the accidental killing of Patrick Trueman 's fiancee ) .
In an interview in March this year , Woodward revealed that on his first day on the set of EastEnders he embarrassed himself ( in his words ) by throwing his arms round Pam St Clement and asking her how she was .
" As I walked away , I realised I 'd never met her before in my life .
Because I watch EastEnders I , like any other viewer , think I know these people . "
That seems to sum up the humility of the man ; a humility ( and a humour ) much in evidence in this clip of his opening a village fete in Cornwall , gently awarding some pint - size carnival queens their trophies .

A scout troop is being investigated by the police after its members shouted death threats and racist abuse at Jewish war veterans during a remembrance parade .
Dressed in full uniform , the explorer scouts , who were taking part in Remembrance Sunday service in Romford , Essex were heard to repeatedly shout " Let 's kill the Jews " at Jewish second world war veterans .
The head of the scouts in the area has issued a full apology for the incident , which was witnessed by a senior policeman standing a few feet away .
A Metropolitan police spokesman said the Met was investigating two allegations of " racially aggravated harassment " involving more than one member of the Romford explorer scout unit .
He would not say how many scouts were involved .
The Rev Lee Sunderland , who was taking part in the service , expressed shock after hearing the scouts shout : " Here come the Jews , let 's kill the Jews . "
Other witnesses said the racists chants were started by a boy believed to be 15 years old .
One of the troop has since come forward and been interviewed by police .
He has been ordered by the Scout Association to visit the rabbi of the Romford and district synagogue to apologise in person .
Jack Rose from the synagogue said : " They were boy scouts who are supposed to be true to their cause .
Somewhere along the line someone has been completely stupid or they really think these things . "
Rose said Chief Inspector John Harlow witnessed the incident .
He took statements from other witnesses and delivered a stern reprimand to the scouts for their behaviour .
Paul Freedman , an 84 - year - old Jewish former RAF pilot who laid a wreath at the service , challenged the scouts .
" I was absolutely fuming ... I told them I was a Jew and I 'd spent four and a half years in the RAF during the second world war , and that Jewish people had sacrificed so much for freedom , " he told the Evening Standard .
The county commissioner of greater London north - east scouts , Dean Jefferys , issued a letter of apology to the synagogue .
He said he was " shocked and appalled " and that all scout members offered their " most sincere and profound apologies " .
" I understand that a senior police officer spoke to all of the explorer scouts at the time of the incident .
All the young people were left in no doubt as to the seriousness of the remarks and the consequence of further such behaviour . "
Simon Carter , a spokesman of the Scout Association , said the scout who confessed to starting the chant flouted the scouting ethos .
" As scouts we promise to do our duty and to help other people .
Clearly this child has not lived up to this promise . "

The number of men working as school teachers has reached a five - year low leading to concerns about a lack of positive male role models , say experts .
The number of male primary teachers in Wales currently stands at 2,140 , compared to 11,807 women .
Children 's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler said the trend was worrying .
According to figures from the General Teaching Council for Wales ( GTCW ) , women make up 84.7 % of registered primary school teachers .
Mr Towler said children need positive male role models , especially during their early years .
He said a whole generation could be left without them during their formative years in school .
The number of male teachers is even fewer in nursery education , with only one registered in Wales in December 2009 .
Ben Dobson , 25 , qualified three months ago and is a nursery teacher at Alderman Davies Primary School in Neath .
CLASSROOM GENDER BALANCE 2005 : 10,264 ( men ) ; 27 , 956 ( women ) 2006 : 10,181 ( men ) ; 29,298 ( women ) 2007 : 10,130 ( men ) ; 28,555 ( women ) 2008 : 10,065 ( men ) ; 28,877 ( women ) 2009 : 9,935 ( men ) ; 28,944 ( women ) Source : General Teaching Council for Wales - registered teachers - secondary and primary - by gender in Wales " A lot of men go into secondary teaching rather than primary , I do n't think people realise how varied the curriculum is in primary schools , it would be great for people to have an insight , " he said .
" I work in a great team with excellent teachers , excellent practitioners and learning support assistants and we never allow ourselves to be in a one to one with a child - that 's for their protection and ours as much as anything .
" It 's the world we live in , you never put yourself in a compromising situation .
You do n't want it to interfere with your relationship with the children , you do n't want it to be sterile , but there are lines and boundaries and I feel very comfortable " .
Anna Davies said her son Charlie was taught by Mr Dobson , who calmed him down on his first day at school .
Good quality male teachers working here have had a positive impact
Lyn Griffiths , head teacher " I think that aspect - having a man in the classroom - is really helpful .
No one wants to leave their child screaming in school , " she said .
" Ben was able to help him , stop him crying and help him to get into nursery , which he then really enjoyed . "
Head teacher Lyn Griffiths said : " Our feeling is that good quality male teachers working here have had a positive impact .
They 're able to inspire both boys and girls and , in some instances , those boys without a male role model at home , it helps to inspire them to achieve . "
Jane Williams , from the early years department at the University of Wales , Newport said : " I think the reasons so few men come into early years education are firstly a public suspicion of why men want to work with young children , due to coverage in the media of paedophilia .
" Also , there is the lack of a credible professional career structure resulting in low wages and poor status , and there is a perception of it being regarded as a female role . "

A group of high school students in Tennessee has lost a lawsuit aimed at forcing school administrators to allow them to wear T - shirts to school displaying the Confederate flag .
A lawyer for the students had taken their free speech fight to the US Supreme Court .
On Monday the high court dismissed the case , Barr v. LaFon , without comment .
The action stems from a lawsuit challenging a 2005 policy banning images of the Confederate flag at William Blount High School in Maryville , Tenn .
The ban was enacted during a period of heightened racial tension at the school following an altercation between an African - American student and a white student .
In the months that followed , racist graffiti began appearing on school walls , including a drawing of a noose next to a Confederate flag in the boys ' restroom .
Between August 2005 and March 2006 , school officials encountered 452 student dress - code violations , including 23 involving displays of the Confederate flag , according to court documents .
Three students , Derek Barr , Roger Craig White , and Chris White , filed a lawsuit claiming the school 's anti-Confederate flag policy frustrated their desire to express their Southern heritage by wearing clothing depicting the Confederate flag to school .
School officials said their policy was aimed at preventing a disruption to the educational process in light of growing racial tensions on the campus .
Director of Blount County Schools , Alvin Hord , said he did not ban the Confederate flag because it was a " racist symbol , " but because of the ongoing racial confrontation at the school .
A federal judge agreed with school officials , upholding the school 's ban .
That ruling was later affirmed by the Sixth US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati .
In rejecting the case , the US Supreme Court action leaves in place the appeals court 's August 2008 ruling upholding the school policy barring depictions of the Confederate flag on T - shirts and other clothing at school .
The appeals court said school officials could reasonably forecast that images of the Confederate flag would " substantially and materially disrupt the school environment . "

New meat - eating dinosaur alters evolutionary tree

Paleontologists , aided by amateur volunteers , have unearthed a previously unknown meat - eating dinosaur from a fossil bone bed in northern New Mexico , settling a debate about early dinosaur evolution , revealing a period of explosive diversification and hinting at how dinosaurs spread across the supercontinent Pangaea .
A live embargoed webcast with the scientists will be held in advance of publication for credentialed reporters on Dec. 9 .
See details below .
The description of the new species , named Tawa after the Hopi word for the Puebloan sun god , appears in the Dec. 10 issue of the journal Science in a paper lead - authored by Sterling Nesbitt , a postdoctoral researcher at The University of Texas at Austin 's Jackson School of Geosciences .
Nesbitt conducted the research with his colleagues while a graduate student at Columbia University 's Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory and the American Museum of Natural History .
The fossil bones of several individuals were recovered , but the type specimen is a nearly complete skeleton of a juvenile that stood about 28 inches ( 70 cm ) tall at the hips and was about 6 feet ( 2 meters ) long from snout to tail .
Its body was about the size of a large dog , but with a much longer tail .
It lived about 214 million years ago , plus or minus a million .
The specimens are remarkable because they show little sign of being flattened during fossilization .
Tawa is part of a group of dinosaurs known as theropods , which includes T. Rex and Velociraptor .
Theropods for the most part ate meat , walked on two legs and had feathers .
Though most went extinct by 65 million years ago , some lineages survived to spawn modern birds .
One of Tawa 's most important contributions to science has to do with what it says about another dinosaur , Herrerasaurus , the center of a lively debate since its discovery in Argentina in the 1960s .
Herrerasaurus had some traits in common with theropods — including large claws , carnivorous teeth and certain pelvic features — but lacked other theropod traits such as pockets in vertebrae for airsacs .
Some paleontologists claimed it was so unusual it was outside the evolutionary tree of theropods , or even of dinosaurs .
Others placed it among the earliest theropods .
" The question was did those carnivorous traits arise in Herrerasaurus and in theropods independently or were they traits from a recent common ancestor that got passed down , " said Nesbitt .
" We had so few specimens of early theropods that it was hard to answer that question .
But now that we have Tawa , we think we have an answer . "
Tawa had a mix of Herrerasaurus - like characteristics ( for example , in the pelvis ) and features found in firmly established theropod dinosaurs ( for example , pockets for airsacs in the backbone ) .
Therefore , the characteristics that Herrerasaurus shares uniquely with theropods such as Tawa confirm the characteristics did n't arise independently and that Herrerasaurus is indeed a theropod .
The firm placement of Herrerasaurus within the theropod lineage points up an interesting fact about dinosaur evolution : once they appeared , they very rapidly diversified into the three main dinosaur lineages that persisted for more than 170 million years .
Herrerasaurus was found in a South American rock layer alongside the oldest members of two major lineages — the sauropods and the ornithischians .
" Tawa pulls Herrerasaurus into the theropod lineage , so that means all three lineages are present in South America pretty much as soon as dinosaurs evolved , " said Nesbitt .
" Without Tawa , you can guess at that , but Tawa helps shore up that argument . "
Tawa skeletons were found beside two other theropod dinosaurs from around the same period .
Nesbitt noted that each of the three is more closely related to a known dinosaur from South America than they are to each other .
This suggests these three species each descended from a separate lineage in South America , rather than all evolving from a local ancestor , and then later dispersed to North America and other parts of the supercontinent Pangaea .
It also suggests there were multiple dispersals out of South America .
The first Tawa fossils were discovered in 2004 by volunteers taking a week - long paleontology seminar with experts at the Ruth Hall Museum of Paleontology in Abiquiu , New Mexico .
The dig site , known as Hayden Quarry , is in a hillside on Ghost Ranch made famous by the painter Georgia O'Keefe .
Alex Downs , an instructor for the course , contacted Nesbitt and a colleague to ask if they 'd like to take a look at the fossils .
There was a thigh bone , part of a hip and what later turned out to be some unrelated vertebrae .
" When we saw them , our jaws dropped , " said Nesbitt .
" A lot of these theropods have really hollow bones , so when they get preserved , they get really crunched .
But these were in almost perfect condition . "
He was also surprised by how much material was preserved at this one site .
He and his colleagues began a full - scale excavation in 2006 .
Every summer since then , they 've continued to unearth new material .
The fossil bone bed extends for tens of meters along the hillside , promising years of painstaking work and perhaps additional significant discoveries .
African Desert Rift Confirmed as New Ocean in the Making
Geologists Show that Seafloor Dynamics Are at Work in Splitting African Continent
In 2005 , a gigantic , 35 - mile - long rift broke open the desert ground in Ethiopia .
At the time , some geologists believed the rift was the beginning of a new ocean as two parts of the African continent pulled apart , but the claim was controversial .
Now , scientists from several countries have confirmed that the volcanic processes at work beneath the Ethiopian rift are nearly identical to those at the bottom of the world 's oceans , and the rift is indeed likely the beginning of a new sea .
The new study , published in the latest issue of Geophysical Research Letters , suggests that the highly active volcanic boundaries along the edges of tectonic ocean plates may suddenly break apart in large sections , instead of little by little as has been predominantly believed .
In addition , such sudden large - scale events on land pose a much more serious hazard to populations living near the rift than would several smaller events , says Cindy Ebinger , professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Rochester and co-author of the study .
" This work is a breakthrough in our understanding of continental rifting leading to the creation of new ocean basins , " says Ken Macdonald , professor emeritus in the Department of Earth Science at the University of California , Santa Barbara , and who is not affiliated with the research .
" For the first time they demonstrate that activity on one rift segment can trigger a major episode of magma injection and associated deformation on a neighboring segment .
Careful study of the 2005 mega - dike intrusion and its aftermath will continue to provide extraordinary opportunities for learning about continental rifts and mid-ocean ridges . "
" The whole point of this study is to learn whether what is happening in Ethiopia is like what is happening at the bottom of the ocean where it 's almost impossible for us to go , " says Ebinger .
" We knew that if we could establish that , then Ethiopia would essentially be a unique and superb ocean - ridge laboratory for us .
Because of the unprecedented cross - border collaboration behind this research , we now know that the answer is yes , it is analogous . "
Atalay Ayele , professor at the Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia , led the investigation , painstakingly gathering seismic data surrounding the 2005 event that led to the giant rift opening more than 20 feet in width in just days .
Along with the seismic information from Ethiopia , Ayele combined data from neighboring Eritrea with the help of Ghebrebrhan Ogubazghi , professor at the Eritrea Institute of Technology , and from Yemen with the help of Jamal Sholan of the National Yemen Seismological Observatory Center .
The map he drew of when and where earthquakes happened in the region fit tremendously well with the more detailed analyses Ebinger has conducted in more recent years .
Ayele 's reconstruction of events showed that the rift did not open in a series of small earthquakes over an extended period of time , but tore open along its entire 35 - mile length in just days .
A volcano called Dabbahu at the northern end of the rift erupted first , then magma pushed up through the middle of the rift area and began " unzipping " the rift in both directions , says Ebinger .
Since the 2005 event , Ebinger and her colleagues have installed seismometers and measured 12 similar �though dramatically less intense�events .
" We know that seafloor ridges are created by a similar intrusion of magma into a rift , but we never knew that a huge length of the ridge could break open at once like this , " says Ebinger .
She explains that since the areas where the seafloor is spreading are almost always situated under miles of ocean , it 's nearly impossible to monitor more than a small section of the ridge at once so there 's no way for geologists to know how much of the ridge may break open and spread at any one time .
" Seafloor ridges are made up of sections , each of which can be hundreds of miles long .
Because of this study , we now know that each one of those segments can tear open in a just a few days . "
Ebinger and her colleagues are continuing to monitor the area in Ethiopia to learn more about how the magma system beneath the rift evolves as the rift continues to grow .
Additional authors of the study include Derek Keir , Tim Wright , and Graham Stuart , professors of earth and environment at the University of Leeds , U.K. ; Roger Buck , professor at the Earth Institute at Columbia University , N.Y. ; and Eric Jacques , professor at the Institute de Physique du Globe de Paris , France .

You suggest that Charles is continuing an adulterous affair .

Prince Charles
Is the head of the Church of England so his priority is to the Bible and it 's teachings .
One which clearly stands against Idolatry and Adultery of which he is Chief .
Most of those churches are now lying empty , the leaders expressed his marriage would not be accepted and their was a divide it 's not amazing however that he was still allowed to marry and is slowly becoming popular again .
Despite the media who keep them quite low profile , many papers still report on their movements , the general consensus is they are now '' legally ' ' married and Camila would become Queen in the event of Charles taking the throne !
--- Carla5754 on 7/2/08
He is a mommies boy but he stood his ground by continuing his adulterous affair long into his marriage despite his mother disliking Camila and disapproved of ever him marring her being a( commoner ) long before he married Diane .
Hence he married Diana because she was young , naive , beautiful and won him popularity of which he enjoyed for a time , for him it was all about the the throne .

You are not quite right about the monarchy .
It does not interfere with the government , but for example if the government decided not to hold a general election after the maximum 5 year period , the monarch would compel an election .
Remember , the police and the armed forces swear allegiance to the Queen ( or King ) not to the Prime Minister .
And from your distance , I do n't think yuo can really judge the relative maturity , personalities and / or achievments & mistakes of PC & PW --- alan_of_UK on 7/1/08
Who knows ,
Maybe one of them will stand up and take control and it go back to the old ways ?
Stranger things have happened ,
Look at Israel ,
It became a nation again after 2400 yrs or so !
Maybe England is the little horn ( the 11th ) from which the AC rises ?
I still think it 's Spain ( 11th ) !

P.C. is still a mama 's boy and approaching senior citizen status .

Truthfully , the monarchy has little sway but more for appearances .
UK loves their traditions and the monarchy is part of it .
So be it .
Great for tourism .
For appearances , hopefully William will take the reins .
But in the big picture , it does n't really mean all that much anymore .

Charles does his gardening without servants ... and talks to his plants .
But that is perhaps not as silly as it sounds .
Plants do respond to sound .

Prince Charles could n't gather his usual granola breakfast together without the help of a busload of servants .
He 's helpless without someone to boss around .
It 's doubtful he'd have any influence beyond the breakfast bar or pony ride .
--- Elder on 6/29/08
One possible reason why Charles became suspect he said that he support's the idea of having all faith equal around the time he wanted to marry Camila Parker Bowles in a to disguise the churches view on his Adultery in line with marrying .
The Arch Bishop who expressed his support towards Divorced Charles in line with setting the pace for his marriage which is against the Church of England surprisingly became Arch Bishop just in time to marry him because all the others refused to accept what he wanted to do .
HOW ABOUT THAT !
The same Arch Bishop has being involved with a few off the cuff statements and remain unpopular with his Antichrist views .

Sorry but you are wrong !
Prince Charles is 1st in line to the throne .
The monarch is always followed by the eldest son , or if there is no son , by the eldest daughter .
Prince Charles is the eldest son of the Queen , so will succeed her .
( He may feel that for various reason .. advanced age , unsuitability because of his matrimonial past ... that he does not want to succeed , in which case the crown would pass to his eldest son )
If he dies before the queen , the crown would pass to his eldest son ( not to his surviving brother ) --- alan_of_UK on 6/27/08
Charles is next in line for the Crown .
Unless he dies , or abdicates , he will be the next king in England .
Why cant he be , Barb ?

Prince Charles can't become king , it will be his eldest son .
Correct me if I 'm wrong please Alan .
--- NVBarbara on 6/27/08
Prince Charles is n't running for President and whenever , if ever , he becomes the King , he 'll be too old for anything but gardening and tea .
He 's harmless as a flea that drinks tea , defending his pea(s ) , instead of broccoli .
He 's no more the AC than Mima Lee .
The AC is hiding in secrecy , but one day many will see that blasphemer .
The bible says that he will be revealed .
He will give the temple mount to Israel but betray Israel and take back the temple mount for himself at mid-trib .
2 Thess 2:4
He will become the one who makes desolate when he reneges on his covenants , ejects the Jews from the temple .
After he reveals himself , his reign of terror will become unspeakable for the 2nd half of the trib .

The Bible says that the whole world will worship the beast ( same as the antichrist ) .
I do n't see the whole world worshiping Prince Charles !
Worship involves giving honor to him , accepting his authority over God's .
Millions are already doing this .
The beast is a political / religious power .
It claims to have the authority to change God 's laws and times ( prophecied in Daniel 7:25 )
It ruled for 1260 years before receiving its fatal wound .
That wound is nearly healed .

He gave power and life to the image of the beast and caused the people who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed . ( Verse 16 ) He causes both small and great rich and poor to receive the mark .

There are many legions of antichrists , or adversaries to Christians .
There is only one Antichrist who they are all working for .
The man of Lawlessness , the man of Rebellion against God and God 's people , the man whose spiritual father is Satan .
I expect his bloodline is full of witches and Satanists .

Joe_ DO you remember what & how many times Jesus asked Peter Just before he Ascended into Heaven ?
3 times Jesus asked Peter if he Loved him .
The 3 deniles was the reason for this action .

" anti- means in oppostion to . "
Not really .
In Greek , " anti ' " means " alternative , substitute " .
For example , president is " proedros " .
Vice - president ( the substitute for , not opponent of , the President ) is " antiproedros " .

Protesters said they did not want the new government to let them down
Thousands of people have protested on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa demanding the removal of a US military base there .
The local mayor called on new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama " to put an end to Okinawa 's burden and ordeal " .
Japan and the US agreed in 2006 to relocate the Futenma base from an urban area to reclaimed land but the PM 's election has rekindled opposition .
The protest comes ahead of this week 's visit by US President Barack Obama .
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Tokyo says the row over the relocation of the base threatens to sour relations between Japan 's new government and the country 's key security ally .
Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada warned it was unlikely to be resolved before Mr Obama arrives in Japan on Friday .
Japan 's new government has expressed a determination to have a less subservient relationship with the US .
Coral reefs Organisers of the protest claimed 21,000 people took part .
Mayor of Ginowan , Yoichi Iha , told the rally : " I urge Prime Minister Hatoyama to tell President Obama that Okinawa needs no more US bases . "
The Futenma base is currently in a busy urban area
One protester , Yoshiko Yonamine , told AFP news agency : " Okinawans voted for the new administration , thinking it would remove the base from the island .
I do n't want it to betray us . "
The base is in a busy city centre and amid local concern about noise , pollution and crime the two countries agreed in 2006 to move it to reclaimed land on Okinawa 's coast .
But , our correspondent says , there is opposition to the new site too because of possible damage to coral reefs .
Okinawa is host to about half the 47,000 - strong American force in Japan .
Mr Hatoyama , whose election in August ended more than half a century of conservative dominance , has suggested the base could be moved off the island , or perhaps out of Japan altogether .
The US insists Japan honour the 2006 agreement to move to the coastal Camp Schwab area .
The agreement would see Japan fund the replacement base and the transfer of 8,000 US marines to Guam by 2014 .

A MELBOURNE man who murdered a Sudanese refugee after saying he was " going to take the town back " by killing blacks was today jailed for 16 years in the Supreme Court .
Justice Elizabeth Curtain said she was not satisfied that the vicious bashing death of Liep Gony , 19 , by Clinton Rintoull was racially motivated , according to the Herald Sun .
The judge said Rintoull , 24 , was driven by a sense of anger and frustration and a belief violence involving a group of youths congregating at the Noble Park railway station was out of control .
Justice Curtain said that prior to bashing the victim , Rintoull sprayed racist graffitti in a flat he shared with friends which read " F - - k da niggas ' ' .
He was later seen in the street carrying a pole and told a neighbour : " These blacks are turning the town into the Bronx .
I am looking to take my town back .
I 'm going to kill the blacks . "
Justice Curtain said she did not believe the attack was racially motivated because a few days before the incident Rintoull had made sandwiches for a homeless African man who was living in a derelict Noble Park property .
What do you think about this ?
Tell us below .
Rintoull , of Noble Park pleaded guilty to one count of murder and one count of of intentionally damaging property in Noble Park on September 26 , 2007 .
A co-accused , Dylan Sabatino , 21 , who also joined in the attack on Mr Gony was jailed for six years .
He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and one count of intentionally damaging property .
The pair hit Mr Gony , who was extremely drunk , repeatedly with their metal poles , fracturing his skull , and then left him to die .
Sentencing the pair , Justice Curtain said that on September 23 , 2007 Rintoull was involved in an altercation with a group of Sudanese youths at Noble Park railway station and he called 000 and alleged he had nearly been stabbed .
He said that if the police would not do something he would take matters into his own hands .
The judge said he confronted Mr Gony on waste ground opposite a derelict house and attacked him for no reason , striking him on the head and body with the pole at least 15 times .
He was then joined by Sabatino who also struck Mr Gony with a pole a number of times .
Ms Laurie told police Rintoull and Sabatino , 22 , returned after the beating and washed the bloodied and bent metal poles used to kill their victim .
" I bashed a nigger and I think he 's dead , '' Rintoull said .
Justice Curtain made an order banning the media from using photographs of the two killers , ruling they might be at risk of retribution in jail .
She set a maximum jail term for Rintoull of 20 years and a maximum term for Sabatino of 10 years .
( Washington , DC ) - New US government figures showing slower growth in the prison population are cause for hope that the United States may be turning away from its longstanding policies of mass incarceration , Human Rights Watch said today .
Statistics released today by the Bureau of Justice Statistics ( BJS ) , a branch of the US Department of Justice , showed that the US prison population grew by 0.8 percent from 2007 to 2008 , the slowest annual growth in eight years .
Twenty states reported a decline in their prison populations , with New York , Georgia , and Michigan reporting the largest reductions .
" These numbers suggest that the United States may be turning away from the policies that have given it the world 's highest incarceration rate , " said David Fathi , director of the US Program at Human Rights Watch .
" But as the world 's leading jailer , the US still has a long way to go . "
The BJS statistics show that the United States has more than 2.4 million people behind bars on any given day , and an incarceration rate of 754 per 100,000 residents .
This is the highest incarceration rate in the world , and is several times higher than rates in other democracies like England and Wales ( 154 per 100,000 ) , Canada ( 116 ) , and Japan ( 63 ) .
The report also reveals significant racial disparities in US criminal justice policy , with black men incarcerated at a rate six and a half times as high as that of white men .
As the financial crisis has created record budget deficits , many states have amended their sentencing laws to reduce the use of incarceration ; others have granted early release to prisoners convicted of minor , nonviolent offenses .
" The United States may finally be learning what other democracies have long known - that incarceration is expensive and socially destructive , and should only be used as a last resort , " Fathi said .
Yesterday may have seen the release of Grant Morrison 's " Batman and Robin " and Jason Aaron and Steve Dillon 's " Punisher , " but the new comic release we 've been looking forward to the most was the " Female Force " biography of " Twilight " creator Stephenie Meyer !
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2009/11/12/stephenie-meyer-comic-book-twilight/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ;
We 've been excited about this one since we saw the trailer for the motion comic last week , and now that it 's out , we 've forced -- er , asked ComicsAlliance contributor Chris Sims to give us his review of the shameless cash - grab series and its latest attempt to stay only one step behind the cultural zeitgeist !
When you 're doing a biography of Stephenie Meyer , you 're going to run into a problem right off the bat , namely the fact that Stephanie Meyer is really f-- king boring .
Really , we 're not even trying to dis Meyer here , but the fact of the matter is that she just has n't done a whole lot .
She never sailed down the Mississippi like Mark Twain , she never married a complete lunatic like F. Scott Fitzgerald did , heck , she never even did a ton of coke and got run over by a van like Stephen King .
We can sum up her entire life in twenty words .
Watch :
" Stephenie Meyer grew up in the Southwest , got married , had kids , wrote some books about vampires and got rich .
Batman . "
We threw " Batman " in there to make it more exciting .
That is the sum total of information provided by this comic , and yet Bluewater and writer Ryan Burton have given us an issue that is twenty - eight pages long .
So how do they pad out the rest of it ?
Simple :
They put Dracula in it .
Now , we at ComicsAlliance are pretty big fans of the Everything Is Better With Dracula school of thought , but this just seems weird .
To be fair , he 's not actually called Dracula , and while the monocle and widow 's peak combination is more reminiscent of Count von Count , as he 's later shown with framed pictures of Max Schreck as Count Orlock and Vlad the Impaler , it 's pretty clear what the implication is , and it does n't make a lot of sense .
Of course , this is the only one of the " Female Force " comics that we 've read , so who knows ?
Maybe this is a recurring theme .
Maybe the one about Princess Diana was hosted by the Wolf - Man .
" She was very active in campaigning against land mines !
ARROOOOOO !! "
Two other things are notable about Fake Dracula : One , he has superpowers -- he can light a candle just by touching it -- which makes him the most exciting person in this comic by default , and two , he has a big ol ' book about Stephenie Meyer :
We 're not Melvil Dewey or anything , but we 're pretty sure that qualifies as a tome .
And god knows how they managed to fill it up .
Anyway , after an introductory shot of a wolf going " auow , " a noise which nothing has ever made ever but which we think is supposed to be a howl , it 's time to get down to the business of an extremely poorly drawn comic .
The art in this book is atrocious .
It 's a shame , because as you can tell from the panels above , artist Dave MacNeil is capable of if not great , at least decent work , and we assume one of two things happened that led to his sub-DeviantArt quality stuff here :
Either this became a rush job to get it on shelves before " New Moon " hit theaters , or he hit pages with descriptions like :
Page Five
Draw two literal topographic maps of Arizona .
Make sure to put an inset panel of someone writing Stephenie Meyer 's name so that we can talk about how it 's spelled weird .
... and just stopped giving a damn .
Seriously , what the hell is this ?
Apparently Meyer went to school at Pablo Picasso High , home of the Fightin ' Cubists !
And that 's not an isolated incident , either .
The entire book is slipshod and seems barely edited , like a scene of Meyer 's romance with her future husband , whose name is misspelled at least once as " Chirstian , " where they 're shown hanging out ...
... at their local dinner .
But the awfulness does n't all come from MacNeil , as Burton manages to write sentences so ham - handed that they come in a package from Hillshire Farms :
" It seemed as though every other girl was ... different .
Or , perhaps , she was the one who was different . "
" The perfect setting -- the perfect backdrop -- for us vampires .
Not too much sun , just enough shadow ... surrounded by forest , rainy ... and out of way ...
Paradise .
Vampire territory . "
And our personal favorite :
" From there , it only took nine months from ' hello ' to ' I do ' .
Stephenie was 21 when she married Chirstian [ sic ] ... also known as ' Pancho . ' "
Thanks to the Midnight Movie Dracula voice that Burton has foisted on his narration , that last one comes off not as compelling narrative , but more like Robert Stack giving a woman 's last known whereabouts on an episode of " Unsolved Mysteries , " right before he advises you to call in with any information you might have about a man named Pancho .
It 's when art and writing come together , though , that this thing achieves the absolute peak of its awfulness .
As we said , Meyer 's life itself does n't have much going on , so in order to spice things up , Burton and MacNeil engage in absolutely shameless techniques at padding things out .
In the absence of anything magical -- what with this being a biography about a writer of fiction -- they turn to a tenuous link to palmistry , actually drawing the state of Utah on her hand ...
... in a five - panel sequence that takes up an entire page .
Shortly after that , there 's a break where Fake Dracula eats a spider .
Why Fake Dracula is eating a spider , we have no idea , but that 's three pages that Burton did n't have to worry about trying to fill with the actual biography that people are ostensibly paying for , and he manages to rack up another four recapping the dream Meyer had that was the basis for " Twilight . "
Which means that this is a dream that has already had both a book and a movie made about it , both of which have been experienced by the comic 's target audience already .
Although to be fair , we 're assuming that the comic is unique in adding Meyer herself creepily leering at teenagers while they make out in the woods :
Eventually things start to wind down , and after a hilarious montage representing the booming popularity of " Twilight " that includes these two monstrosities ...
... we finally find out why Fake Dracula 's been narrating the story .
In what is the most mind - shattering cliche that he could 've possibly pulled out , Burton reveals that " Twilight " is just part of the sinister vampire master plan to make people love vampires !
For the monsters ... are reeeeeeeaaaaaallllll !!!!!
Sure , Stephenie .
Write more .
Knock yourself out .
But you , Burton ?
I think we 've had enough of you .

Darlington - built Tornado was unaffected by the freezing conditions
Passengers were rescued by a steam locomotive after modern rail services were brought to a halt by the snowy conditions in south - east England .
Trains between Ashford and Dover were suspended on Monday when cold weather disabled the electric rail .
Some commuters at London Victoria faced lengthy delays until Tornado - Britain 's first mainline steam engine in 50 years - offered them a lift .
They were taken home " in style " , said the Darlington - built engine 's owners .
Train services in Kent were hit hard by the freezing conditions at the start of the week .
If any operators want to modernise their services by using steam trains , I would be happy to give them a quote
Mark Allatt , A1 Steam Locomotive Trust
The weather - related disruption included three days of cancellations for Eurostar services through the Channel Tunnel .
Tornado , a £ 3 m Peppercorn class A1 Pacific based at the National Railway Museum in York , was in the South East for one day , offering " Christmas meal " trips from London to Dover .
Its " Cathedrals Express " service , the last mainline journey in its first year of operations , was about to depart when staff heard about the stranded passengers .
About 100 people were offered free seats , according to Mark Allatt , chairman of The A1 Steam Locomotive Trust - the charity which built Tornado .
' All credit '
He said : " It was a nice way to finish for Christmas , though I think some of the rescued passengers did n't realise they 'd even been travelling on a steam train until they got off . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Allatt , who was on the service at the time , said he only saw a handful of other trains between London and Dover throughout Monday .
He added : " If any of the train operators want to modernise their services by using steam trains , I would be happy to give them a quote . "
A spokesman for Southeastern Trains congratulated Mr Allatt on his " moment of glory " .
He said : " I 'm sure those passengers were saved from a lengthy wait , all credit to him . "

I have to feel sorry for my progressive friends , of whom there are a few , who had so much hope for the new administration , and were convinced that the election of Barack Obama would lead to a significant shift in American foreign policy .
One can hardly blame them for their election night elation : after all , eight years of relentless militarism and knee - jerk belligerence were finally over , and a new day was dawning – or so they thought .
Since it would be in dubious taste to say " I told you so , " I ’ll refrain and simply note the facts : the Obama administration has been a major disappointment to self - described liberals and Democratic party activists ( outside the unions ) on a wide range of issues , including not just foreign policy but also civil liberties and healthcare " reform . "
During the presidential election campaign , candidate Obama tore into the Bush administration ’s reckless disregard for civil liberties .
On his campaign web site , he promised he would :
" Revise the PATRIOT Act .
Barack Obama believes that we must provide law enforcement the tools it needs to investigate , disrupt , and capture terrorists , but he also believes we need real oversight to avoid jeopardizing the rights and ideals of all Americans .
There is no reason we cannot fight terrorism while maintaining our civil liberties .
Unfortunately , the current administration has abused the powers given to it by the PATRIOT Act .
A March 2007 Justice Department audit found the FBI improperly and , in some cases , illegally used the PATRIOT Act to secretly obtain personal information about American citizens .
As president , Barack Obama would revisit the PATRIOT
Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security Letters , sneak - and - peek searches , and the use of the material witness provision . "
Yet the National Security letters provision of the Act is one of three the Obama - ites are insisting must be reauthorized , virtually unchanged .
What this entails is giving the FBI the power to coerce Internet service providers , banks , credit reporting companies , and even libraries into surrendering any and all information about individuals targeted by the feds as a potential " terrorist . "
In effect , the government now has access to a vast pool of sensitive data which could be – and has been — used to compile dossiers on American citizens not accused of any crime .
Adding insult to the injury done to what is left of our liberties , this provision of the Patriot Act makes it a federal crime for the recipient of a National Security letter to reveal that he has indeed received such a letter .
Tyranny operates best in the dark – at least in its first stages .
Candidate Obama also came out against warrantless wiretaps :
" Eliminate Warrantless Wiretaps .
Barack Obama opposed the Bush Administration ’s initial policy on warrantless wiretaps because it crossed the line between protecting our national security and eroding the civil liberties of America citizens .
As president , Obama would update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act to provide greater oversight and accountability to the congressional intelligence committees to prevent future threats to the rule of law . "
This is yet another Bush - era " anti-terrorist " innovation that the Obama - ites are intent on retaining , and they have gotten the alleged " liberals " in the Senate to go along with it , in spite of earlier criticisms by some , such as Sen. Patrick Leahy .
Now that the Good Guys are in power , they want the same " tools " used to undermine the Constitution that the Bush administration demanded and got with very little opposition , you ’ll recall , from the Democrats .
Another provision , the " material support " statute , makes it a crime to give " material support " to " terrorist " groups , including not just al - Qaeda , but any and all groups and causes disfavored by the US government .
The form of " support " can be " intangible , " i.e. intellectual support , and it need not be intentional .
Commentary on current affairs that criticizes , say , the US occupation of Afghanistan could be defined as " intangible " support to the terrorist cause – and land the author in jail .
It is another question entirely as to whether Obama ’s Justice Department would actually prosecute such a case , but this provision does indeed give them the option – which they clearly want to retain .
These reversals are not all that inexplicable when one considers the course the administration is taking in the foreign policy realm .
After all , the President can hardly fulfill another of his campaign promises – reorienting the " war on terrorism " away from the Iraqi front and towards the Afghan front – and not expect an increased threat of terrorism .
If you are going to invade and occupy Afghanistan – and routinely launch attacks on the soil of Pakistan – it is hardly surprising that these folks will be motivated to strike back .
As Garet Garrett , the remarkably prescient conservative critic of global interventionism , put it half a century ago :
" Is it security you want ?
There is no security at the top of the world . "
We can have an empire , or we can have our old republic back .
We can not have both .
Pay no attention to the daily soap opera of Obama ’s public agony over the decision to escalate the Afghan war : this is public relations leading up to the inevitable decision to go along with Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s Afghan " surge . "
Washington is all atwitter over Afghan envoy Karl Eikenberry ’s leaking of his two cables to the White House cautioning Obama on sending more troops to support a corrupt government in thrall to drug - dealers and warlords : but Eikenberry , you ’ll recall , is a former commander of the Afghan troops , now retired , who was eased out by the President .
The decision to escalate has already been made , according to CBS News .
All this buzz about " dissent " in the ranks and Obama ’s doubts is just a way to set up the narrative that people like Andrew Sullivan , with characteristic willingness to suspend disbelief , have readily embraced .
What the Republicans are attacking as " dithering , " says Sullivan , is instead " a relentless empiricism , " evidence that in this White House " we actually have an adult prepared to allow the various choices in front of us be fully explored . "
Yet the President is hardly going to abandon his stance , adopted during the campaign and elaborated ever since , that Afghanistan is " the right battleground , " that we ca n’t allow any " safe havens , " and that the Bushies " neglected " the Afghan front but the Obama - ites wo n’t .
Withdrawal , as he and his minions have said often enough , is not an option , so the question remains : how does he sell the Afghan adventure to a war - weary , economically challenged nation ?
It ’s all a question of marketing , and knowing your audience : liberals and progressives would n’t rally around the philosophical " idealism " of the neocon - controlled Bush administration , which took the rightness of its " liberation " theology ( and it was a theology ) for granted .
In order to appeal to his core constituency in the media and the white - wine - and - brie crowd , Obama must position himself as a thoughtful " pragmatist , " who has sincerely mobilized his brain trust to concentrate on the problem of Afghanistan , and – after much give - and - take – has come up with an honest solution .
Self - described " progressives " are particularly prone to bow before the rule of the experts : this , after all , is the very heart of their economic and social doctrines , which hold that the mass of humanity can ( and must ) be uplifted by all - wise technocrats and government officials , who , naturally , have everyone ’s best interests at heart .
By the way , the same argument - from - authority is being made to address objections to the administration ’s healthcare " reform " project , coming from the left as well as the right : we are told that the " experts " agree forcing everyone to buy insurance and providing the insurance industry with a captive market is the best way to drive down costs and provide healthcare for those who ca n’t afford it .
So what if it sounds counterintuitive .
You ’re not an expert – so what do you know ?
This " the experts agree " narrative gives the Obama - ites an out : when the inevitable occurs , they can always say no one knew we would fail .
That , you ’ll recall , is the excuse the Bushies gave when we invaded Iraq and found no " weapons of mass destruction . "
Yes , they wailed , but everybody thought the weapons were there : it was n’t just us , but the intelligence agencies of our allies , and even many war opponents ( not including Antiwar.com ) .
We could n’t have known : no one could have known .
But of course they could have known if they ’d listened to Scott Ritter , not to mention the views expressed in this space .
In the Afghan case , you could have known if they ’d studied a little history – say , the history of the Soviet Union ’s unsuccessful attempt to pacify Afghanistan and set up a puppet government .
They could have known if they ’d listened to Matthew Hoh , who recently resigned his position with the Foreign Service in protest over the administration ’s policies in Afghanistan .
They could have know if they had n’t been locked into a number of easily disproved assumptions , such as the conceit that we can have sufficient knowledge of and influence over Afghan society to effectively control what goes on over there .
This last is the core reason why the warlords of Washington will never relinquish their Afghan domain voluntarily , without being militarily defeated and driven out as they were in Vietnam .
The Obama administration is specifically committed to the idea that the US government can and should determine what is best not only for its own citizens but for the inhabitants of the rest of the world .
Washington ’s only god is power , and their every act is an act of worship at its altar .
Which is why , in spite of whatever good intentions they might have started out with , in the end the Obama - ites are no different from their Republican predecessors – and the sooner " progressives " and other well - meaning fans of this administration reconcile themselves to this fact , the more likely they are to understand current events .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I ’ve been asked by The Hill – Capitol Hill ’s newspaper of record — to comment regularly on current issues , and the first installment appears here .
Check out their web site for future contributions .
Well , it looks like we at Antiwar.com are in for yet another long fundraising campaign , which is so far producing little - better - than - average results .
In my last column , I promised that , after a short respite , I would start hectoring you again – and here I am , more than fulfilling that pledge .
If today ’s column was n’t enough , I want to underscore the dangers posed by the Obama administration to the prospect of a more peaceful world .
It is precisely because of his reputation as a liberal - slash - progressive that President Obama is well - positioned to sell a policy of relentless war in Afghanistan , and Pakistan – for the same reason Richard M. Nixon was able to sell America ’s tilt toward China during the cold war years .
Hoping Obama will deliver on his domestic promises , all too many progressives can be counted on to look the other way if the primary victims of his foreign policy are foreigners .
As for the reality that our empire - building project is bankrupting the country – well , as another great " progressive " once put it , we should n’t worry about the national debt because , after all , we only " owe it to ourselves . "
Just as it took years for the left - wing of the Democratic party to wake up to the tragedy of Vietnam , so the same holds true for the ongoing tragedy of Afghanistan .
We here at Antiwar.com , not being partisans , nor even very " progressive " by any measure , are not handicapped in our critique of a war - making President who seems intent on repeating the mistakes of LBJ .
In the beginning , we paid a price for that : a large number of our supporters , who voted for Obama , were displeased by our criticisms of his foreign policy , and said so .
Undeterred , we responded by stepping up our attack – and events , unfortunately , are confirming our instincts .
The mainstream media , which is openly supportive of the President , is giving him a pass on foreign policy , as in all things .
The conservatives , of course , are criticizing him for not being militaristic enough .
Who , then , is left to critique his interventionist policies ?
That ’s our job , and we ’re doing it .
Now we need our readers and supporters to help us continue our work .
Because we ca n’t do it alone : we need your help .
It ’s just that simple .
So do n’t just sit there : contribute today .
De Belgische premier Van Rompuy werd door zijn collega 's benoemd tot eerste Europese ' president ' , Catherine Ashton tot minister van Buitenlandse Zaken .
Een keuze voor twee onbekende gezichten .
Herman Van Rompuy was al geruime tijd de grootste kanshebber om de eerste permanente voorzitter van de Europese Raad van staatshoofden en regeringsleiders te worden .
Maar er lag één groot obstakel op zijn weg : de Britse premier Gordon Brown .
Die kon niet anders dan zijn voorganger Tony Blair , die zich net niet openlijk kandidaat had gesteld voor die functie , te steunen .
Blair was evenwel niet aanvaardbaar voor de Europese socialisten , die dat lieten blijken door de post van Hoge Vertegenwoordiger op te eisen .
Brown was compleet verrast door de houding van zijn Europese geestesgenoten .
Maar om geen gezichtsverlies te lijden , kon Brown niet anders dan Blair zo lang mogelijk blijven verdedigen .
Vlak voor het diner van de regeringsleiders gisteravond kon een woordvoerder van de Zweedse voorzitter echter melden dat premier Fredrik Reinfeldt opgelucht was dat de socialisten hun onderlinge problemen hadden opgelost .
Weg vrij
Even voordien was duidelijk geworden dat de Britse premier Gordon Brown bereid was gevonden om de weg vrij te maken voor Herman Van Rompuy als ' president ' .
Daarop konden de socialistische regeringsleiders op hun vergadering in de Oostenrijkse ambassade de Italiaan Massimo D'Alema laten vallen als hun officiële kandidaat voor Hoge Vertegenwoordiger .
Ze opteerden voor de Britse Catherine Ashton .
De huidige commissaris voor Handel werd al lang genoemd als een zeer ernstige kanshebber .
Maar na het afhaken van de Brit David Miliband kozen de socialisten publiekelijk voor D'Alema , zodat Brown de schijn kon ophouden dat hij voor Tony Blair als president bleef vechten .
D'Alema was echter voor weinigen aanvaardbaar wegens zijn communistische verleden en zijn anti-Amerikaanse en anti-Israëlische houding .
Met Ashton viel de puzzel in elkaar .
De EVP en de kleine , oude lidstaten kregen hun zin met Van Rompuy ; de socialisten en de Britten kregen de Hoge Vertegenwoordiger ; en één van de topfuncties gaat naar een vrouw .
Nagelbijten
Gistermorgen was het echter nog nagelbijten geweest voor Van Rompuy .
Hij werd gesteund door een meerderheid van de regeringsleiders , maar alles dreigde te zullen afhangen van de manier waarop Reinfeldt de diner - vergadering zou leiden .
De regeringsleiders , en zij alleen , waren op het diner in het Justus Lipsiusgebouw in de Wetstraat aanwezig .
In een apart zaaltje wachtten Van Rompuys diplomatiek adviseur Dirk Wouters en de Belgische permanente vertegenwoordiger bij de EU , Jean de Ruyck , op eventuele instructies .
De Zweedse premier en zijn collega 's bevonden zich op onverkend terrein .
Er bestaan immers geen regels , geen procedures voor de invulling van deze nieuwe jobs .
De Zweed kon het dus nog gemakkelijk verknoeien .
Alles bleef mogelijk in de broeierige atmosfeer van zo 'n top - diner .
Er kan worden gemarchandeerd ; er kan een onvermoede nieuwe kandidaat opduiken .
' Van Rompuy moet zich voorbereiden op diverse scenario's ' , zei een diplomaat 's middags nog .
In de namiddag werd het weer even spannend toen de Zweedse minister van Buitenlandse Zaken Carl Bildt op zijn website betreurde dat de EU voor een ' minimalistische oplossing ' dreigde te gaan ' die Europa 's kans op een sterke stem in de wereld zou verminderen ' .
Maar nog voor het diner kwam dus het verlossende woord van de socialisten en kon de Zweedse voorzitter Van Rompuy en Ashton op het diner officieel voordragen voor goedkeuring door zijn collega's .
Wat ontsnapte aan andere Belgen , Guy Verhofstadt en Jean - Luc Dehaene , valt Van Rompuy in de schoot : een Europese topfunctie .
Uiterlijk op 1 januari 2010 treedt Herman Van Rompuy in functie .
Leterme II
Niets lijkt nog een terugkeer van Yves Leterme ( CD&V ) naar de Wetstraat 16 in de weg te staan .
De portefeuille Buitenlandse Zaken zou naar de huidige minister van Ontwikkelingssamenwerking Charles Michel ( MR ) gaan .
Inge Vervotte ( CD&V ) , die in de nasleep van de Fortis - zaak samen met Leterme en Jo Vandeurzen ontslag nam , staat dan weer met stip genoteerd om Michel op te volgen .
Vraag is of de wissels in de regering snel zullen worden doorgevoerd , of dat de vijf regeringspartijen eerst uitgebreid gaan onderhandelen over een nieuwe regeerverklaring .
' Wij willen in elk geval eerst weten wat Leterme wil realiseren en hoe hij dat denkt te doen ' , aldus een federale vicepremier .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) - A week after abruptly quitting his longtime job as a CNN television news host and commentator , Lou Dobbs said on Thursday he is considering career options including possible runs for the White House or U.S. Senate .
CNN host Lou Dobbs ( C ) is confronted by protesters ( L ) and escorted by police during a march on the holiday for slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in New York in this January 21 , 2008 file photo .

“ Right now I feel exhilaration at the wide range of choices before me as to what I do next , ” Dobbs , whose outspoken views on immigration and other topics often angered liberals , told Reuters in a telephone interview from New York on Thursday .
Dobbs , 64 , a veteran CNN anchor who had become one of the most divisive figures in U.S. broadcast journalism , announced last Wednesday he was leaving CNN after spending the better part of 30 years at the 24 - hour cable news network .
He still hosts a daily radio show .
A Texas native , Dobbs has drawn fire from Latino leaders and civil rights groups for frequent on - air remarks about U.S. border control and immigration that critics saw as demonizing illegal immigrants .
He was also seen as lending credence to the “ birther ” conspiracy theory , whose adherents believe President Barack Obama ’s Hawaiian birth certificate was faked to hide a Kenyan birthplace that would make the first black U.S. president ineligible for his office .
Dobbs acknowledged his commentary also stirred friction with CNN executives .
Discussions with CNN / U.S. President Jonathan Klein made it clear Dobbs ’ style of combining news and opinion was untenable at the network , Dobbs said .
“ They wanted to reverse direction on my show from what had been a news debate and my opinion to a middle - of - the road , as Jon Klein styled it , non-opinion show , ” he said .
“ It was just not gratifying to me to sit there and read a news show -- and I much prefer to be more engaged . ”
Dobbs vowed to carry on expressing his views “ fully and straightforwardly in the public arena no matter what I decide to do next . ”
Since his departure , some have speculated he might run as a candidate for the U.S. Senate in New Jersey , where he has a home , or even run as a third - party candidate in the 2012 U.S. presidential elections -- options he says remain on the table .
“ I am ruling nothing out .
... I have come to no conclusions and no decisions , ” he said .
“ Do I seek to have some influence on public policy ?
Absolutely .
Do I seek to represent and champion the middle class in this country and those who aspire to it ?
Absolutely .
And I will . ”
THE world has less than 20 years left to save the orangutan , according to conservationists who predict the charismatic red ape will become extinct if no action is taken to protect its jungle habitat .
There are thought to be 50,000 - 60,000 orangutans still living in the wild in Malaysia and Indonesia , but deforestation and the expansion of palm oil plantations have taken a heavy toll .
" The orangutans ' habitat is fragmented and isolated by plantations , they can't migrate , they can't find mates to produce babies , '' Tsubouchi Toshinori from the Borneo Conservation Trust said .
Environmentalists are calling for the creation of wildlife " corridors ' ' in Malaysia to link the scraps of jungle where orangutans have become trapped by decades of encroachment by loggers and oil palm firms .
Mr Tsubouchi said that although studies have predicted orangutans will disappear within 50 years if their habitat continues to vanish , action needs to be taken within the next two decades to stall that process .
" We have to establish the corridors in 10 or 20 years , otherwise we wo n't be able to do anything later , '' he said .
Some 80 per cent of the world 's orangutans live in Borneo , which is split between Malaysia and Indonesia , and the rest are found in Indonesia 's Sumatra province .
" What we have left today is maybe only 10 per cent of what we used to have before , '' Marc Ancrenaz from the environmental group Hutan said .
Hutan focuses on conserving the 11,000 orangutans in Malaysia 's Sabah state in Borneo .
An aerial survey carried out by Hutan and wildlife authorities in Sabah last year revealed some 1000 orangutan treetop " nests ' ' located in 100 small patches of forest completely surrounded by palm oil plantations .
Mr Ancrenaz said that if immediate action was taken , there is still a good chance of ensuring the long - term survival of the primate as there is still enough genetic diversity for it to thrive .
" Unlike the rhinoceros whose numbers are so few , we still have a decent size population for the orangutan , '' he said .
" If they are going to become extinct , it will not be in the next 10 years . "
Experts say that wildlife corridors would enable orangutans to move across the fragmented landscape and alongside rivers to seek food and mates .
The corridors could be used by other endangered species such as the pygmy elephant and rhinoceros , but progress on the initiative has been slow .
The Malaysian palm oil industry , often criticised for its poor environmental performance , pledged to fund the corridors at an October conference but nothing has yet been done .
Malaysian Palm Oil Council chief executive Yusof Basiron said he was waiting for environmentalists to advise how much land would be needed , and denied that lack of action was threatening the species ' future .
" Last time they said the orangutans will go extinct in 2012 , now they say in 15 or 20 years - why keep on shifting the goal posts ? '' he said .

Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas this afternoon struggled to explain his decision to charge the county 's presiding criminal court judge , Gary Donahoe , with three felony counts -- bribery , obstructing a criminal investigation , and hindering prosecution .
But Thomas could n't offer any evidence to the assembled media scrum that Donahoe actually had accepted a bribe of any sort .
Instead , he and Sheriff Joe Arpaio ( who stood next to Thomas at the lectern ) offered the same vague allegations they have made for nearly a year regarding the county 's planned court tower , currently under construction .
In fact , the county attorney said no evidence exists that the veteran judge personally has received anything in the way of a personal financial benefit during the flap over the $ 347 million construction project .
Arizona has a " very broad " definition of bribery , Thomas said in response to requests for specificity .
Thomas seems to be alleging that the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors , the county 's Superior Court bench , and their " shared " outside counsel , Tom Irvine and Ed Novak of Polsinelli Shughart , are an unholy " triad " working to block his and Arpaio 's legitimate investigation into the tower 's construction .
But today 's announcement that Donahoe now faces felony charges -- when the only evidence of " wrongdoing " on the judge 's part is a series of rulings that Thomas and Arpaio vehemently disagree with -- is unprecedented even in Maricopa County .
Donahoe also is the same judge who ordered detention officer Adam Stoddard to jail last week for swiping a defense attorney 's notes -- drawing Sheriff Joe 's ire .
Even the Valley 's usually compliant press corps seemed incredulous with the announcement of criminal charges against the highly respected Donahoe , who is retiring from the bench in the near future .
But Thomas insisted that he was n't pursuing a criminal case against Donahoe as a preemptive strike hours before the judge was set to hold a hearing that could have ended with Thomas being barred from prosecuting any county supervisor .
He later told the gaggle , " If I 'm not explaining this well , I hope you 'll help me . "
Say what ?
" In fairness , " Thomas said , after enduring increasingly pointed questions , " I admit this is a hard thing to believe . "
He was referring to his allegation that a judge would accept " something of value " ( the bribery count ) in exchange for his decisions .
But because the charges at first blush seem so over the top , some reporters initially thought that Thomas meant it was hard to believe the County Attorney 's Office would take such a drastic step against the judge .
But Thomas suggested that Donahoe had been obstructing justice " until about two hours ago , " referring to when the judge canceled a hearing scheduled for this afternoon on matters related to the County Attorney 's ongoing criminal investigations .
" The hearing this afternoon was part of an ongoing criminal act , " Thomas said .
The hearing was scheduled in response to a notice filed by the supervisors ' attorney , Tom Irvine .
Irvine apparently was planning to argue that the hiring of special prosecutors from Washington , D.C. was illegal , since the supervisors had not authorized it .
Thomas said the hearing before Donahoe would have forced his prosecutors to publicly reveal grand jury secrets , which is against the law .
Yesterday two county supervisors , Mary Rose Wilcox and Don Stapley , were revealed to be facing criminal indictments .
It is unclear whether the D.C. prosecutors somehow participated in bringing evidence to the grand jury in those cases .
Also , last week , Thomas ' office filed a " racketeering " lawsuit in federal court , which bizarrely accused the supervisors , their lawyers , and the judges of being a criminal enterprise under RICO laws .
Because of that pending suit , Thomas said , Donahoe should have recused himself from considering Irvine 's legal argument in court today .
" That 's how lawless this behavior was , " the County Attorney said .
" Nobody is above the law . "
But to many in attendance , it seemed as if Thomas and Arpaio simply do n't like the way they keep losing in Donahoe 's court :
Judge Donahoe removed the County Attorney 's Office from investigating the court tower construction , he rejected the notion of holding indicted superivisor Don Stapley in contempt of court for alleged wrongdoing , and he jailed detention officer Adam Stoddard on a contempt of court charge .
So first Thomas filed a RICO lawsuit alleging that Donahoe and other superior court judges are part of some vague and convoluted conspiracy , working together to see that the new court tower ( with all those big offices and marble floors ) is built and the sheriff 's office / county attorney 's office investigation is thwarted .
Then they charge the big kahuna himself , Judge Donahoe , with criminal counts .
That 's one way to rid themselves of a judge they do n't like , and perhaps find another jurist more sympathetic to their point of view .
But Donahoe was n't willing to recuse himself just yet , perhaps because the RICO allegations are so silly and vague .
Until he was implicated in this morning 's direct complaint , he had planned to go ahead with the hearing anyway .
So they charge him with three felonies ???
Wow .
" We are going to get to the bottom of this , and we are not going to be obstructed anymore , " Thomas breathlessly told the press conference .
Is that a threat ?
Sure is .
Here 's how a somber Arpaio explained his side of things : " Sometimes , you have to do what you have to do . "
Yeah , you gotta .
Thomas and Arpaio told reporters that Judge Donahoe is required to make his initial appearance January 11 .
At that point -- unless reason somehow begins to prevail in this county , or unless some higher authority steps in -- he 'll need to enter a plea to the charges in front of him and submit to booking .
Thomas noted that his prosecutors will seek to move the case forward at a preliminary hearing after the initial appearance , not through a grand - jury indictment .
The preliminary hearing is a public proceeding , while grand - jury proceedings are closed .
By the time we reached the end of this press conference and read through the convoluted paperwork proffered by Thomas ' prosecutors , we only had one question :
Where are the feds ?
5 Year End Tax Planning Strategies to Consider
The year is drawing to a close , and many of you are probably trying to figure out what you can do to find an extra tax break or two .
You probably know that you can give more to charity or try your best to make the maximum contribution to your eligible retirement plan .
But there are a few other things you can do .
For those in certain situations , there are some specific tax moves that can save you money .
Here are 5 end of the year tax moves :
1. Investments
If you are interested in limiting the effects of your investment losses , the tax code can help .
Even with the comeback the stock market is trying to make , many people still find that they have capital losses .
You get up to $ 3,000 as a deduction on long term capital losses .
But wait !
You can also match your long term capital losses with your long term gains on a dollar for dollar basis .
If you have $ 18,000 in losses and $ 12,000 in gains , you can use the gains to absorb the losses .
Then you are down $ 6,000 .
Take the $ 3,000 deduction , and your net loss carry - forward is $ 3,000 instead of $ 18,000 .
You can also avoid limitations of the wash rule when you sell your winning stocks , since the wash rule only applies to losers .
You may not be able to purchase losers for 30 days after selling , but you can turn around and repurchase winners right after selling them .
2. New Car Purchases
Did you buy a new car this year ?
Have you been planning to buy a new car ?
If you buy a new car by the end of the year , you can deduct excise , taxes and other fees , up to $ 49,500 of the purchase price of the car .
There are phase outs for this deduction beginning at $ 125,000 for single taxpayers and $ 250,000 for married taxpayers .
Unfortunately , the car credit is only valid for cars whose deals closed sometime between February 17 , 2009 and December 31 , 2009 .
If you ’re still working on a deal on January 1 , 2010 , too bad .
And if you closed the deal on February 16 , 2009 , you ’re out of luck .
And the car has to be new , not used .
Be careful when using this tax credit .
A used car may actually be a better deal , even if you do n’t get the tax credit .
If you are n’t absolutely set on a new car , run the numbers before buying for the sake of the tax credit .
3. Medical Expenses
If you spend more than 7.5 % of your adjusted gross income on medical expenses , you can get a tax deduction doe un-reimbursed medical experiences .
After tax dollars spent on health insurance premiums ( including Medicare Part B and Part D premiums ) count .
Your co-pays count as well .
You ca n’t count over the counter medications , though .
It is also worth noting that if you are self - employed and you purchase individual insurance or a group plan through your business ( including a sole proprietorship ) , you can get a tax break .
So , keep track of your medical expenses and see what you can do in the way of reducing your tax bill .
4. American Opportunity Credit
This is a tax credit aimed at students .
If you have a modified adjusted gross income of less than $ 80,000 as a single taxpayer , or less than $ 160,000 for couples , you can take this tax credit for up to $ 2,500 for qualified expenses ( up to $ 4,000 ) related to education .
This can include expenses for books , tuition and school projects .
We plan to use this credit for my husband ’s Ph.D. project .
If you pay money in 2009 for spring semester 2010 , you can take the credit this year .
5. Unemployment Benefits
If found yourself out of work this year , and collecting unemployment benefits , you might be able to take advantage of an exemption this year .
While unemployment benefits are normally taxed as regular income , this year the economic stimulus package allows for an exemption of $ 2,400 for each individual .
So remember this if you have been collecting unemployment .
You can also choose to have 10 % of your benefits withheld so that you do n’t have to try to come up with what you owe all at once .
You can visit the IRS website to find more information about available tax credits and tax breaks for extenuating circumstances .
You can also consult your tax professional to get an idea of what you might be eligible for , and to learn what documentation you might need .

As I do n’t live in LA or Vegas , I do n’t have the opportunity of getting into the Star Trek scene .
The number of times I ’ve met respectable Star Trek personalities can be counted on one finger .
Now I ’m not a believer in destiny or fate , but sometimes coincidence is a little too much to ignore .
Such was the case on Friday , December 4th , 2009 .
I had an appointment that morning at 8:45 ( or 0845 hrs military time ) at Travis Air Force Base , about an hour drive from my home in Sacramento .
After the short appointment , I stopped by the on - base mini-mall to pick up a couple items .
As I was entering the clothing shop , I saw a sign featuring a photo of Denise Crosby in her Star Trek : The Next Generation uniform .
“ Presented by CJ Collectibles : Denise Crosby , Star Trek ’s Lt. Tasha Yar , December 4th 11:00 - 17:00 hrs ”
‘ That ’s today ! ’
I said to myself .
‘ How could I have been so lucky to be here on the very day that Denise Crosby will be here ? ’
I had a decision to make .
I could either go back to work right away or I could slack off for a couple hours until I was able to meet Denise Crosby , get her autograph and go back to work .
I carefully weighed the options for “ zero point six eight seconds ” and decided that I could explain being late to work , but I could never forgive myself for passing on this incredible opportunity .
I waited around and wasted time until 11 o’clock when I headed over to the booth where Denise would be signing autographs .
When I arrived , she was arranging her table with photos and Star Trek trading cards featuring Tasha and Sela .
I had her sign one of her photos for me and we talked briefly .
The guy running the event was offering to take photos and print them out on the spot for Denise to sign .
I could n’t pass on that offer .
We had our photo taken and I waited for the print .
To my extreme good fortune , the photo printer was having technical difficulties , so I was ‘ forced ’ to sit with Denise for about 45 minutes and wait until my photo was printed off .
During that time I was a party to many conversations with Denise and passing Star Trek fans .
One person asked what she thought of the movie Star Trek that hit theaters this past summer .
She said it was an exciting film and has successfully reinvigorated the franchise for a new generation who has n’t had the opportunity to grow up with Star Trek like so many of us have .
She surmised that younger people are used to newer technology and need much more visually exciting adventures than the Star Trek that we have been used to .
She also explained to one fan why she decided to leave Star Trek after one season .
She explained that she had a lot of acting training that was n’t being put to use on the TNG set .
She would stand on the bridge set for hours on end only to say a line here or a line there .
We also spoke briefly about how quirky the first season of Star Trek : The Next Generation seems today .
She particularly remembered the episode “ Code of Honor ” where Tasha had to fight another woman after the ruler of the people decided to make Tasha his “ first one . ”
Such a racist depiction of black people would never fly in today ’s society , but TNG was very under the radar at the time .
Denise Crosby is a very kind person .
When a rather strange fellow came up and asked some very peculiar questions to her , she was much more patient and friendly that I would have been .
Finally , the photo was ready and I got it signed by Denise .
I said goodbye and headed back to Sacramento .
I was late coming back to work , but no one even asked me where I ’d been .
It ’s like those hours that I spent waiting and visiting were meant just for me to meet the Star Trek icon .
Who knows ?
Maybe it was fate .
Last June , District Attorney David Capeless of Berkshire County , Massachusetts , announced that he was dropping all charges against 44 - year - old Bernard Baran , a man who has spent half his life behind bars on child molestation charges that the state no longer has the confidence to retry .
Baran was convicted in January 1985 of molesting six children at a pre-kindergarten day care facility in Pittsfield , Massachusetts .
He was released on bond in 2006 after an appeals court determined that his trial attorney had been incompetent and that the prosecution may have withheld key exculpatory evidence .
Baran says that during his jail term he was raped and beaten more than 30 times , necessitating six different transfers to new correctional institutions .
Such is the cost the prison system exacts on an openly gay man convicted of molesting children .
Baran was one of the first people in the country to be prosecuted in the day care sex abuse panic of the 1980s , a bizarre nationwide hysteria fed by homophobia , fears of Satanism , and a wing of child psychology that used unproven interrogation techniques that critics say caused children to recount sexual incidents that never took place .
In this case , prosecutor Daniel Ford , now a judge on the Massachusetts Superior Court , showed the grand jury that indicted Baran an edited video interview with the children .
According to court documents , the video shows several kids alleging that Baran had sexually abused them .
Edited out was footage in which some of the children denied any abuse by Baran , interviewees accused other members of the day care faculty of abuse or of witnessing abuse , and , most important , interrogators asked the same questions over and over — even after repeated denials — until a child gave them an affirmative answer .
Some children were even given rewards for their answers .
Withholding the unedited video from the grand jury was itself an act of misconduct .
An appeals court suggested that prosecutor Ford may also have withheld it from Baran 's trial attorney .
We can only say " may " because there has never been a hearing on the issue , and Baran 's trial attorney was far from competent .
( Judge Ford did not respond to multiple requests for comment . )
In granting Baran a new trial in 2006 , Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Francis Fecteau never moved beyond the inadequacy of Baran 's lawyer .
When the case reached the state appeals court , the justices not only upheld Fecteau 's ruling ; they looked more closely at Ford 's possible misconduct .
" While the record does not settle the question whether the unedited videotapes were deliberately withheld by the prosecution , " the ruling said , " there are indications in the trial transcript consistent with that contention . "
The court further noted that it took years for Baran 's appellate lawyers to get prosecutors to turn over the unedited tapes .
It also cited other examples of Ford 's failure to turn over exculpatory evidence , including evidence that two of the children who accused Baran may have suffered prior sexual abuse .
To make matters worse , the case against Baran was awash in homophobia .
According to court documents , the first parents to come forward with accusations against Baran in September 1984 had just days earlier registered a complaint with the center that Baran was " queer . "
The boy 's mother , who thought gays " should n't be allowed out in public , " much less permitted to work at day care centers , said she " did n't want no homo " watching her son .
When that child later tested positive for gonorrhea of the throat , Ford used the test against Baran at trial , even though a ) the child never accused Baran of forcing him to perform oral sex , b ) the child , in fact , specifically denied having sexual contact with Baran on the witness stand , c ) Baran tested negative for gonorrhea , d ) the boy had told his mother two months prior that his stepfather had orally raped him , and e ) on the very day Baran was convicted , charges against the stepfather were turned over to the district attorney 's office for possible prosecution .
Baran 's counsel was never informed of the allegation against the stepfather .
Addressing the gonorrhea issue in his closing arguments , Ford implied that Baran 's " lifestyle " made it probable that he contracted gonorrhea at other times and knew how to quickly eradicate it to cover his tracks .
In his closing argument , Ford likened Baran at a day care center to a " chocoholic in a candy store , " hypothesizing that in the " five or 10 minutes " he was able to be alone with a child without being seen by other staff or children , Baran " could have sodomized and abused those children whenever he felt the primitive urge to satisfy his sexual appetite . "
The appeals court that eventually overturned the conviction ruled that the incompetence of Baran 's counsel " facilitated the speculative , stereotypical , and deeply insidious links between homosexuality , gonorrhea , and child molestation . "
According to an affidavit signed by Baran 's boyfriend at the time , Ford spent an inordinate amount of time asking Baran 's boyfriend about his own sex life , employing variations of the word faggot and a mocking , drawn - out pronunciation of homosexual .
Baran 's boyfriend also claims he was pulled over by police officers and further harassed on a daily basis , and that Ford told him , illegally , that if he spoke with Baran or Baran 's defense attorney he would be arrested .
In upholding the ruling that granted Baran a new trial , the appeals court added in a footnote that if the state wanted to retry him , Baran could file a motion for a hearing on Ford 's alleged misconduct .
By dropping the charges , the D.A. avoided that hearing .
" In my opinion , " says Boston civil liberties attorney Harvey Silverglate , " the possibility of an embarrassing hearing into misconduct by a former prosecutor and now sitting Superior Court judge was the main reason , if not the reason , they decided to drop the charges .
The appeals court opinion cut a bit too close to the bone for them . "
So while Bernard Baran is free after 22 years of incarceration , there are no plans to look into the actions of the prosecutor , now a sitting judge , responsible for his conviction .
Ford 's career trajectory indicates the backward incentive structure that prosecutors face : Convictions produce rewards , while abuse rarely comes with a penalty .
Baran has said he is n't sure he wants to endure a lawsuit , but even if he did , he would be unlikely to get to Ford .
Prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from civil rights lawsuits , even in cases of misconduct that lead to false convictions .
They are rarely disciplined in other ways either .
Courts and bar associations tend to avoid professional sanctions .
A study released earlier this year by the Justice Project , a pro-defense advocacy group , concluded , " Despite the prevalence of prosecutorial misconduct all over the country , states have consistently failed to investigate or sanction prosecutors who commit acts of misconduct in order to secure convictions . "
The only way Ford 's actions in the Baran case might be examined would be for one of the state 's legal ethics boards to open an investigation , either on its own or in response to a complaint .
In a September article in Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly , a spokesperson for the state 's Office of Bar Counsel said that of the 1,000 or so complaints the office investigates each year , just " nine or 10 " involve the state 's prosecutors .
One Ford defender told the publication that it 's unfair to hold the judge accountable for something he did a quarter century ago .
But it is n't as if this is some musty , inconsequential case pulled from the depths of a Massachusetts courthouse .
There 's fresh damage here .
Ford 's successors spent 25 years defending his misconduct .
And Bernard Baran spent that time paying for it .

Nearly three months after General Stanley McChrystal went public with his request for more troops for Afghanistan , President Barack Obama is still not close to making a decision on just how large of an escalation he will approve .
Vagueness has been a consistent theme from the start , with officials bouncing between promising a decision “ soon ” and insisting that no decision was forthcoming .
Today , the White House says that President Obama wo n’t make a decision until at least after Thanksgiving .
In an interview yesterday , President Obama said he expects to make an announcement at some point in the “ next several weeks , ” but even then he was vague on if that would happen .
With Thanksgiving gone it seems the real question is if the escalation will be announced by Christmas .
After his disastrous escalation earlier this year , President Obama has been reluctant to announce his intentions in the increasingly unpopular war .
At the same time , officials have made it clear time and again that the various “ options ” he was considering were all escalations of varying sizes , and that at no point was serious consideration given to leaving Afghanistan or even reducing the military ’s presence .
President Obama fulfilled his campaign pledge regarding Native Americans US President Barack Obama has vowed not to forget American Indian tribes , as representatives gathered for a White House conference on native issues .
The first annual White House Tribal Nations Conference brings together one delegate from each of the 564 federally recognised American Indian tribes .
It is the first time in US history that they will all meet a sitting president .
The event is part of Mr Obama 's efforts to build bridges with American Indian and Alaska Native communities .
In opening remarks , which received a standing ovation , Mr Obama said : " You will not be forgotten as long as I 'm in this White House . "
The event 's agenda covers a variety of issues , from centuries old broken treaty promises to more modern issues such as healthcare , crime and poverty .
Mr Obama said he had asked every cabinet agency to provide him with a plan on how to improve relations between the government and tribes .
" We 're not going to go through the motions and pay tribute to each other , then furl up the flags and go our separate ways , " he was quoted as saying by Associated Press .
The president acknowledged the US federal government 's history of ignoring the needs and rights of American Indians and Alaska Natives .
Election pledges Mr Obama also said the widespread social and economic struggles faced by the communities were not acceptable and would change while he remained in office .
The historic summit is the first time such a large number of tribal leaders have attended a single gathering with the federal government .
Since taking office a year ago , the Obama administration has allocated $ 3bn ( £ 1.8 bn ) in stimulus funding to American Indian programmes .
The president also appointed a member of the Cherokee Nation to his White House team as senior policy adviser for Native American affairs - fulfilling an election campaign pledge .
He also appointed an American Indian as director of the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services - the first such appointment .
There are about two million Native Americans in the United States and one million in Canada .
The map above does not show Alaska and Hawaii .
Alaska has one Native American reservation - Annette Island .
There are no reservations for Native Hawaiians ( aka Kanaka Maoli ) in Hawaii .
There are 564 federally recognised Native American tribes , the largest being the Cherokee with a population of nearly 730,000 Other major tribes include the Navajo , Choctaw , Sioux , Chippewa and Apache
There are about 150 different Native American languages
Those living on reservations must obey federal laws , can vote in national elections and can serve in the armed forces , but they are also subject to tribal laws and elect tribal leaders Synonyms : American Indians , First Nations people

It 's an easy job , but nobody 's gotta do it
by Jeremy Hooper
Defending " opposite marriage " :
It has literally become her job .
Next stop is the New Jersey Family Policy Council :
So let 's see :
The state Supreme Court determined that we gay folk deserve equality under the law .
A state commission has found that the civil unions system has failed to deliver on that promise .
The governor and a seeming majority of the elected lawmakers are poised to grant us the delayed justice that is full marriage equality ( at least on on a state level ) .
But the New Jersey Family Policy Council is countering all that with Carrie Prejean ?!?
Look , if the battle is over who looks best in a bikini while traipsing along the Atlantic City boardwalk , we 'll admittedly defer to Ms. Prejean .
But when it comes to civics , constitutional law , the role of the judiciary , and the realities of the New Jersey public , you 'll have to excuse us if we choose ...
... to listen to more appropriately trained voices .
Your thoughts
Beyond Prejean , Bill and Georges Excellent Adventure !??!?!?
Bad presidential impersonators and a vapid beauty queen , I 'll be breathlessly awaiting Topo Gigio and a flurry of back flipping poodles .

So there really are lots and lots of same sex parented families now .
Even Grandparented .. why do n't some of these families just show up and say they do not
want her defending their families ?
Especially if they have smart teenage kids ,
it could really be a kick to see a multigenerational family stand up to that trollop .

OMG , unemployment would be more dignified than this .
So , I have 2019 in the pool when Carrie relents her words .

I 'm not sure .
Silicon breasts are not attractive .
Please send me your own bikini photo promptly so I can make sure .
Thank you .

I 'm a heterosexual female and AA to boot , and I am trying with every fiber of my being to figure out what these folks problem is with civil unions / same sex marriages .
They 've been a part of the fabric of society worldwide for centuries .
I do n't understand what business it is of theirs since , according to them , they 'd never be a part of one , nor do I understand how it will have any impact whatsoever on how they live their lives .
I may not understand what motivates them , but I do know that I am sincerely fed up with them and their antics .
I 'm 56 years old and I lived through segregation and the civil rights era in American history .
I know firsthand how it feels to deal with foolish people .
I 've experienced prejudice and discrimination that these folks have NEVER had to deal with .
I was born and raised in the South ( GA ) , and they can never convince me to do to someone else what has been done , and continues to be done , to myself and my family in this society only because we do not look like them .
I 'm damned by them at first sight .
It does n't matter than I 'm a graduate of UGA ( 1974 ) , or that I have advanced degrees in more than one discipline , or that I taught school for 33 years before retiring in May of this year , or that my daughter graduated high school and college with honors , or that she is 28 and has no out of wedlock kids , etc. Contributions and accomplishments mean nothing to these people .
I know how hard it is to continue going in the face of adversity .
There is no damn way that they can get me to discriminate against anyone on the face of planet earth .
I 'm sick of them .
I 'm going to oppose the spread of their hatred , prejudice , racism , and discrimination until the day I die .
This is just how strongly I feel about these scumbuckets .
They are a pus-filled boil on the face of humanity , and I 'm working on a daily basis to not cross the line from disliking them to outright hating them .

Rep. Barney Frank has shepherded the regulatory reform package along .
WASHINGTON ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The House passed legislation Friday aimed at preventing the next big financial crisis , ushering in the most sweeping set of changes to the banking regulatory system since the New Deal .
The bill , which passed 223-202 , imposes more oversight and stronger capital cushions for the largest banks and Wall Street firms .
It forces them to pay a total of as much as $ 150 billion into an emergency fund that could be tapped when a troubled company needs to be taken over and broken up .
The legislation also calls for the regulation of some derivatives and creates a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to regulate products such as credit cards and mortgages .
" We are sending a clear message to Wall Street , the party is over .
Never again will reckless behavior on the part of the few threaten the fiscal stability of our people , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a press conference after the bill passed .
" The legislation will finally protect Main Street from the worst of Wall Street . "
On the Senate side of Capitol Hill , the bill is moving much more slowly and final passage is likely months away .
As chairman of the House Financial Services committee , Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass . , has spearheaded the financial reform package since last Spring -- especially the part that creates the Consumer Protection agency .
" The bailouts of AIG and Bear Stearns would be not possible -- made illegal -- under this bill , " Frank said .
" If a company fails , it 'll be put to death . "
Overhauling the financial regulatory system has been a major priority of the Obama administration , which has been involved in almost every step of the nearly year - long process .
High ranking Treasury officials visited House Speaker Pelosi 's office this week , when some parts of the bill appeared in trouble .
" This legislation brings us another important step closer to necessary , comprehensive financial reform that will create clear rules of the road , consistent and systematic enforcement of those rules , and a stronger , more stable financial system with better protections for consumers and investors , " President Obama said in a statement .
House Republicans have been united in their opposition , saying the bill would provide a permanent bailout of Wall Street and a step toward socialism .
One of the bill 's lead opponents , Rep. Jeb Hensarling , R - Texas , said it would impose " sweeping draconian powers " on private businesses .
However , over the past several months , the bill has faced its biggest hurdles among Democrats .
Conservative Democrats picked apart different sections , especially the consumer protection agency , saying they worried it would hurt small businesses .
In fact , the plan for the agency has been watered down from the version first proposed by the White House .
It no longer would examine and enforce consumer protection rules at 98 % of credit unions and banks , most of them smaller .
It also would not regulate auto loans , even though auto loans are among the most common issued to consumers .
The Congressional Black Caucus held up the bill at one point , citing displeasure with the lack of support for loans and jobs to those in minority communities .
To smooth things over with those lawmakers , the bill transfers $ 3 billion from the federal bailout program to provide emergency loans capped at $ 50,000 to unemployed homeowners to help them prevent foreclosure .
It also would redirect another $ 1 billion of bailout money into federal neighborhood stabilization programs to redevelop abandoned or foreclosed homes .
Here 's what else it would do :
Federal Reserve :
The bill would allow Congress to order the Government Accountability Office to audit Fed activities , which the Fed says would interfere with the central bank 's ability to carry out independent monetary policy .
Derivatives :
The bill attempts to shine a brighter light on some of the different kinds of complex financial products , called derivatives , that are blamed for bringing down financial companies such as American International Group ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) and Lehman Brothers .
It would pass some of these derivatives on to clearinghouses , which would help pinpoint the value of such trades .
However , some derivatives would still be unregulated , including those traded by big agricultural and airline companies to mitigate risk .
Oversight :
It creates a new oversight council that would look out for major problems at large financial firms , giving the Federal Reserve a key role in enforcing tougher regulations on larger firms .
Breaking up :
It would also give regulators new powers to break up companies that have grown too big , if they threaten to destabilize the financial system .
Executive Compensation :
It would give shareholders the right to a nonbinding proxy vote on corporate pay packages .
The House rejected , by 223-208 , an amendment that would have effectively killed the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , replacing it with a council of existing regulators .
The members also voted down , by 241- 188 , an amendment that would have given bankruptcy judges new powers to lower balances on mortgages in order to prevent homeowners from losing their homes in foreclosure .
John Kenneth Galbraith wrote that all financial crises are the result of “ debt that , in one fashion or another , has become dangerously out of scale . ”
The recent financial crisis was no exception , with everyone — homeowners , private - equity investors , our biggest banks — taking on enormous amounts of debt .
If it ’s frustrating that the government is footing the bill to clean up the mess , it ’s even worse that the government helped pay for the debt binge that created the mess in the first place , thanks to a tax system that actually subsidizes borrowing .
Debt did n’t get dangerously out of scale because the system was broken .
It got out of scale , in part , because the system worked .
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
The government does n’t make people go into debt , of course .
It just nudges them in that direction .
Individuals are able to write off all their mortgage interest , up to a million dollars , and companies can write off all the interest on their debt , but not things like dividend payments .
This gives the system what economists call a “ debt bias . ”
It encourages people to make smaller down payments and to borrow more money than they otherwise would , and to tie up more of their wealth in housing than in other investments .
Likewise , the system skews the decisions that companies make about how to fund themselves .
Companies can raise money by reinvesting profits , raising equity ( selling shares ) , or borrowing .
But only when they borrow do they get the benefit of a “ tax shield . ”
Jason Furman , of the National Economic Council , has estimated that tax breaks make corporate debt as much as forty - two per cent cheaper than corporate equity .
So it ’s not surprising that many companies prefer to pile on the leverage .
There are a couple of peculiar things about these tax breaks — which have been around as long as the federal income tax .
The first is that they ’re unnecessary .
Few people , after all , can save enough to buy a home with cash , so home buyers naturally gravitate toward mortgages .
And businesses like debt because it offers them tremendous leverage , making it possible to put down a little money and potentially reap a huge gain .
Even in the absence of the deductions , then , there would be plenty of borrowing .
The second thing about these breaks is that their social benefits are pretty much nonexistent .
Advocates of the mortgage - interest deduction , for instance , claim that it increases homeownership rates .
But it does n’t : in countries where mortgage deductions have been eliminated , homeownership rates have n’t dropped .
Instead , the deduction simply inflates house prices .
The business - interest deduction , meanwhile , may lower an individual company ’s taxes , but it also means that the over - all corporate tax rate is higher , so its real impact is to give companies with lots of debt an unjustified advantage .
If the benefits are illusory , the costs are all too real .
Economies work best , generally speaking , when people are making decisions based on economic fundamentals , not on tax considerations .
So , as much as possible , the tax system should be neutral between debt and equity , and between housing and other investments .
It ’s not , and , worse still , as we ’ve seen in the past couple of years , debt magnifies risk : if companies or individuals rely on large amounts of leverage , it ’s much easier for bad decisions to lead to insolvency , with significant ripple effects in the wider economy .
A debt - ridden economy is inherently more fragile and more volatile .
This does n’t mean that the tax system caused the financial crisis ; after all , the tax breaks have been around for a long time , and the crisis is new .
But , as a recent I.M.F. study found , tax distortions likely made the total amount of debt that people and companies took on much bigger .
And that made the bursting of the housing bubble especially damaging .
So encouraging people to take on debt qualifies as a genuinely bad idea .
But it ’s not an easy situation to change .
In 2005 , a special Presidential panel on tax reform actually proposed eliminating the business - interest deduction and severely restricting mortgage - interest tax breaks .
Those proposals , predictably , went nowhere .
But we ’re in a different historical moment now : the perils of too much borrowing have never been clearer .
And there are precedents , on a smaller scale , for these kinds of changes .
In the U.S. , people used to be able to write off the interest they paid on credit cards .
That tax break was abolished in 1986 , and , the same year , the mortgage - interest deduction , which used to be unlimited , was capped .
Great Britain , meanwhile , abolished its mortgage tax break in 2000 .
Similarly , there are a number of countries , including Brazil and Belgium , that do n’t give corporate debt a tax advantage over equity , while , just last year , both Germany and Denmark cut back sharply on their business - interest tax breaks , limiting how much interest companies can write off .
Given the weak state of the economy and of housing prices , a wholesale rewriting of the tax code may be a bridge too far right now , but there are plenty of reforms — capping deductions , phasing them out over time , restricting their use by heavily leveraged companies — that would move in the right direction .
The clearest hurdle to these changes may be political , but the bigger hurdle is , in a way , psychological : because tax breaks on debt have been around so long , we can hardly imagine what it would be like if we changed them , and we tend to underestimate their influence in shaping our behavior .
Subsidizing debt seems harmless simply because we ’ve always done it .
But the fact that you ’ve had a bad habit for a long time does n’t make it less dangerous . ♦

Washington ( CNN ) --
Suicides among soldiers this year have topped last year 's record - breaking numbers , but Army officials maintain a recent trend downward could mean the service is making headway on its programs designed to reduce the problem , Army officials said Tuesday .
Since January , 140 active - duty soldiers have killed themselves while another 71 Army Reserve and National Guard soldiers killed themselves in the same time period , totaling 211 as of Tuesday , Gen. Peter Chiarelli , U.S. Army vice chief of staff , told reporters at a briefing Tuesday .
But he said the monthly numbers are starting to slow down as the year nears its end .
" This is horrible , and I do not want to downplay the significance of these numbers in any way , " Chiarelli said .
For all of 2008 , the Army said 140 active - duty soldiers killed themselves while 57 Guard and Reserve soldiers committed suicide , totaling 197 , according to Army statistics .
The Army is still trying to tackle why soldiers are killing themselves .
" We still have n't found any statistically significant causal linkage that would allow us to effectively predict human behavior .
The reality is , there is no simple answer -- each suicide case is as unique as the individuals themselves , " Chiarelli said .
He also said there were troubling new statistics showing an increase in suicide rates among young soldiers who have never deployed , another factor puzzling Army researchers .
To add to the Army 's problems , Chiarelli said there is a rise in numbers of soldiers abusing prescription drugs and alcohol upon returning from the war zones .
But Chiarelli said the news was not all grim .
" I do believe we are finally beginning to see progress being made , " he said referring to a downward trend in suicide numbers in recent months .
" The general trend line with the exception of a couple of months has been down . "
" We attribute this reduction in the number of suicides to the many actions we have taken since February to inform and educate leaders and soldiers on this important issue , " Chiarelli said .
Since March , the Army has implemented numerous programs and policies in an attempt to quickly slow the rate .
Programs range from a suicide prevention task force to a day off from official duties to focus on suicide prevention .
The service has implemented what it calls a Comprehensive Soldier Fitness Program , giving every soldier a mental assessment twice a year in the same style the Army tests soldiers for fitness .
" It gives the same emphasis to psychological , emotional and mental strength that we have previously given to physical strength , " Chiarelli said .
The Army also has tested a program that gave mental - health evaluations to a group soldiers returning from the war zone .
Some were treated face - to - face with mental - health providers while others were treated online by providers .
Chiarelli said the initial results were promising , and doctors said they could have great success treating patients online .
The test seems to give the Army some answers on how to treat the variety of soldiers from young to old .
" Younger soldiers prefer the online method of evaluation more than they do the face - to - face , and older soldiers -- some of you might not find this so surprising -- find face - to - face more to their liking , " according to the general .
Chiarelli also gave examples of Army bases that seem to have shown improvement in suicide warning signs and prevention this year resulting in decreased number of suicide rates , including Fort Hood in Texas , Fort Bragg in North Carolina and Fort Drum in New York .
Fort Bragg has had six suicides to date , Fort Hood has had two and Fort Hood has had 11 , but it is the largest U.S. military base with 60,000 troops .
There are Army posts , however , that were not showing signs of improvement .
" We are very concerned with the increase this year of suicide at Fort Campbell , Fort Stewart and Schofield Barracks , " Chiarelli said .
Fort Campbell , in Kentucky , has had 18 suicides so far this year , with 11 of them occurring in the first quarter of 2009 .
Fort Stewart in Georgia has had 10 deaths , six of them occurring over the first five months of the year .
And Schofield Barracks in Hawaii has had seven deaths .
All of the bases Chiarelli mentioned have different populations and deployment levels and reflect different suicide rates and ratios .
Chiarelli stressed his frustration with getting answers to the suicide problem .
" Everywhere I try to cut this and look at it to try to find out what the causal effect is , I get thwarted .
And that 's why we think that we 've got to look in its totality at a whole bunch of different issues , and it 's going to take time , " he said .
For much of the 20th century , this poor area of China was also , paradoxically , one of the most cosmopolitan regions of the country .
It was the point of origin for many Chinese who emigrated overseas and settled in Chinatowns around the world , working in restaurants and on railroad projects .
Huang Tang , the head of the Wong ’s Association in Taishan , which tracks the genealogy of Wong families from the area ( including this reporter ’s ) , estimates that there are 1.3 million Taishanese and their descendants around the world .
Perhaps the most prominent Taishanese descendant in the United States is Gary Locke , the current commerce secretary and former governor of the state of Washington .
“ Taishan is a little bit freakish , from the speech of people here to the way they do things to the way they dress , ” Mr. Cai said , referring to the inescapable mix of East and West .
But Taishan is depopulating , as families continue emigrating overseas to join their relatives or settle in large Chinese cities like Guangzhou .
Taishan now has about 900,000 people , a drop of 10 percent since the 1990s .
So the towers are neglected or , in some cases , being destroyed .
Such was the case in Hehe , a village in Taishan , where a five - story tower at one end was torn down sometime in the last 30 years .
In another village , Changgang , a tower still stands , but its metal shutters are rusted and one wall is defaced with graffiti from the Cultural Revolution : “ Chairman Mao 10,000 years . ”
In Miaobian , a peasant family has moved into a three - story villa built about 80 years ago by a wealthy relative .
Ringed by palm trees , elements of the house could be described as Victorian or Georgian or Edwardian , but not so much Chinese .
It has bay windows , cathedral ceilings and a balustrade along the wide staircase leading to the front door .

How Are Companies Helping Fix the Reef ?
Passions of Paradise
Passions of Paradise , a tourism operator in Cairns , has used this industry shut down to focus on various scientific partnerships .
Besides providing survey data for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority ’s Eye on the Reef program , Passions of Paradise has also become a vital partner in Sydney ’s Coral Nurture Program at the University of Technology .
It also spent the shutdown planting coral at two of its reef sites .
Coral Nurture Program
The Australian and Queensland Government Coral Abundance Challenge funded the project , The Coral Nurture Program , developed by a team of scientists consisting of Dr Emma Camp , Associate Professor Dave Suggett , Wavelength Owner John Edmondson , and PhD student Lorna Howlett .
The team has collaborated with five tour operators in the Cairns and Port Douglas Area : the Quicksilver Group , Sailaway , Passions of Paradise , Ocean Free and Ocean Freedom , and Wavelength Reef Cruises .
Plant Coral Fragments
In June 2019 , the Proof of Concept stage saw these operators , under Professor Sugget and his team ’s guidance and supervision , start out planting coral fragments onto the reef structure at some of their sites on the Great Barrier Reef .
Even if Passions of Paradise had to cease its daily tourism operations since March 22 , 2020 , Alan Walish , the Founder and Managing Director , has donated the vessel to continue the Coral Nurture Program , to plant over 2000 coral fragments across two locations on Hastings Reef , named “ Stepping Stones ” and “ 1770 ” .
Alan says that Hastings Reef provides an excellent opportunity to acquire this program and put an intensive effort in enhancing the reef ’s natural ability to heal itself .
Hastings has encountered many challenges in the last decade , from the Cyclone Yasi in 200 , the Crown - of - Thorns Starfish outbreak of 2012 - 2013 , and the mass bleaching events of 2016 , 2017 , and 2020 .
Initially , what concerned them most was the shutdown effect on the business ; however , one thing that is good about this is the resilience of the reef locations .
During the ten weeks of the shutdown , the crew has used this to plant about 1500 coral fragments .
This has resulted in continual signs of natural improvement every year .
Coral Fragmentation
The Coral Nurture Program has the core in the process of coral fragmentation .
While many people are familiar with budding , the asexual result of individual coral polyps cloning themselves to build colonies , and spawning , the sexual method of reproduction corals use .
Many are unaware that corals have the third method of reproduction called fragmentation .
Russel Hosp , the Environmental Manager and Master Reef Guide of Passions of Paradise , explained the process .
Most of the general public assumes that if the large coral structure is damaged , either by breakage from wildlife , severe weather , or other impacts , the entire coral colony will die .
But this is not the case .
In fact , the coral colony can recover quickly from pieces being broken off because of its remarkable regenerative ability .
For example , if the staghorn coral is broken off , the main colony , currents , tides , and other natural phenomena can carry those fragments across the reef .
Suppose these get stuck in a particular area where it cannot move .
In that case , the corals in the fragments will start to excrete extra calcium carbonate – the building material of hard corals and secure themselves into that location .
They can grow an entirely new colony .
Use of Coral Clip
Russel and his team , including Marine Biologist Kirsty Whitman , have used the shutdown to use the coral clip to affix occurring coral fragments to the reef structure naturally .
This unique process can plant the coral fragments quite quickly .
Since the March 22 shutdown , Passions of Paradise has been able to undertake four coral planting trips , and the crew has been able to so far plant about 1500 coral pieces in total .
This is a great start for the environment at Hastings Reef .
According to Alan , they have always had a strong partnership with different scientific projects and organisations .
They have hosted scientists specialising in corals , invertebrates , and sharks and rays .
They ensure that they are going to continue this program until they can retake the passengers .
Their goal is planting 2000 coral fragments ; if they can achieve that , they will try for more .
Maintaining and Adding Six Coral Nurseries
During the shutdown , the focus work for the crew at Passions is planting corals on the reef itself .
However , another aspect that kept the crew busy is maintaining and adding six coral nurseries , located at 1770 .
Scott Garden , the CEO of Passions of Paradise , believe that these nurseries are the major part of the Coral Nurture Project .
Scott explains that finding coral fragments during a dive can be pretty easy to extremely difficult .
The idea of having nurseries is that they can attach some coral fragments they find to these underwater nurseries .
The nurseries are large aluminium lattice frames , about the size of a household door .
As the program permits , as the corals are grown , they can break the fragments off from their nursery and attach them to the reef structure .
This process is similar to the way a gardener will take plant cuttings , help them mature , and place the new plants in other areas .
The nurseries are not only beneficial to the crew in creating stocks or coral to transplant to the reef but also serve as a piece of exciting information to share with guests .
Introductory and certified divers can dive near the frames and permit the crew to share this with guests .
Russel added that this had been a real shift over the last decade , as visitors to the reef will expect not only a five - star experience but also an authentic encounter with a high standard operator .
This company shows a commitment to the conservation of the reef ecosystem .
They believe that sustainability is not just window dressing , but they want guests to know they walk when it comes to conservation and sustainability .
As the Australian government slowly eases the COVID - 19 restrictions , the company hopes that the day trips continue to succeed while continuing to plant coral fragments and monitor their nurseries .
Alan said that the Great Barrier Reef is many things to many people , most especially to Australians .
Their commitment is to conserve and give mother nature a say in everything they do .
Usually mugshots are only interesting if they ’re of some celebrity or important public figure .

Covering Palin the Right Way
Created : December 23 , 2009 13:39 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
A quick follow - up to my last post :
There is a right way to cover Sarah Palin and her PR strategy .
Greg Sargent , Ben Smith and Matt Gertz double - check Palin ’s claim ( made on Facebook ) that her infamous “ death panel ” post was a “ metaphor ” for how health care would be denied to the old or infirm .
In the original post , it was pretty clear that Palin was talking about end - of - life counseling , not rationing .
And in subsequent statements it was even clearer .
( Yes , I ’m immediately breaking my “ embargo , ” but my point was that reporters should n’t just reprint what Palin ’s press shop puts out . )
After the “ death panel ” post took off and President Obama said it was a lie that the health care bill would “ pull the plug on grandma ” — borrowing a term used by Sen.
Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) — Palin put out a statement clarifying what she meant .
She was talking generally about the eventual goals of Ezekiel Emanuel , the medical ethicist who has been smeared many , many times as a supporter of euthanasia , which he is n’t .
She was talking specifically about end - of - life counseling .
The provision that President Obama refers to is Section 1233 of HR 3200 , entitled “ Advance Care Planning Consultation . ”
With all due respect , it ’s misleading for the President to describe this section as an entirely voluntary provision that simply increases the information offered to Medicare recipients .
The issue is the context in which that information is provided and the coercive effect these consultations will have in that context .
Two days , later , after the Senate stripped Section 1233 , Palin declared a sort of victory .
I join millions of Americans in expressing appreciation for the Senate Finance Committee ’s decision to remove the provision in the pending health care bill that authorizes end - of - life consultations ( Section 1233 of HR 3200 ) .
It ’s gratifying that the voice of the people is getting through to Congress ; however , that provision was not the only disturbing detail in this legislation ; it was just one of the more obvious ones …
Our senior citizens are right to be wary of this health care bill .
Medical care at the end of life accounts for 80 percent of all health care .
When care is rationed , that is naturally where the cuts will be felt first .
The “ end - of - life ” consultations authorized in Section 1233 of HR 3200 were an obvious and heavy handed attempt at pressuring people to reduce the financial burden on the system by minimizing their own care .
Worst still , it actually provided a financial incentive to doctors to initiate these consultations .
People are right to point out that such a provision does n’t sound “ purely voluntary . ”
Finally , on Sept. 8 , Palin submitted testimony to a New York State Senate Panel led by conservative Democrat Ruben Diaz , in which she specifically argued that the “ consultations ” were the infamous “ death panels . ”
A great deal of attention was given to my use of the phrase “ death panel ” in discussing such rationing .
Despite repeated attempts by many in the media to dismiss this phrase as a “ myth ” , its accuracy has been vindicated .
In the face of a nationwide public outcry , the Senate Finance Committee agreed to “ drop end - of - life provisions from consideration entirely because of the way they could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly . ”

Now , a normal politician with a normal give - and - take relationship with the press might not have pulled this off , because he / she would have had to answer questions about the explosive charge at every step of the way .
But Palin was able to post occasional rants about “ death panels , ” get huge media coverage every time , and move on .
It ’s no surprise that she thinks she can paper over the history of this — when ’s the last time she got fact - checked ?
Golf Ball Finding Glasses
The lenses in these golf ball - finding glasses contain a pigment that helps to block out the light reflected by darker background objects , so that lighter - colored golf balls are easy to locate .
Now , I do n’t play much golf , but should n’t the balls be right there on the green ?
I would think that should be pretty easy to find .

After so many years , and so many lists , you might think the task of choosing the 10 Best Books would get easier .
If only .
The sublime story collections alone created agonies of indecision .
So did the superb literary biographies we read — and deeply admired .
But in the end the decisions had to be made .
Not that drawing up the list — or rather , whittling it down — was a wholly painful exercise .
One of the pleasures it afforded was the chance to resample the sometimes surprising chemistry of reviewers and authors , particularly when it came to fiction .
Jonathan Lethem , whose “ Chronic City ” made our list , reviewed Lorrie Moore ’s novel “ A Gate at the Stairs , ” which made it too , while Curtis Sittenfeld , whose novel “ Prep ” was one of the 10 Best in 2005 , reviewed Maile Meloy ’s story collection “ Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It , ” a winner this year .
Any book review editor will attest that persuading fiction writers to assess other people ’s fiction can be a struggle .
These were heartening exceptions to the rule .
May more novelists review for us in 2010 !
This list will appear in print in the Dec. 13 Book Review .

A new study , published in the open access journal BMC Physiology , has shown that rats exposed to fumes from leaded and unleaded gasoline become more aggressive .
Amal Kinawy , from Cairo University , Egypt , examined the emotionally incendiary properties of gasoline in three groups of male rats , each exposed to either leaded - gas fumes , unleaded - gas fumes or clean air .
As well as observing the animals ' behavior , she studied any resulting neurological and physiological changes .
She said , " Millions of people every day are exposed to gasoline fumes while refuelling their cars .
Exposure can also come from exhaust fumes and , particularly in the developing world , deliberate gasoline sniffing as a means of getting high " .
The research demonstrates that rats exposed to either kind of fuel vapor showed increased aggressive behavior , such as more time spent in belligerent postures and increased numbers of actual attacks , in comparison to the clean air group .
Examination of the animals ' brains after the experiment revealed significant differences between all three groups .
According to Kinawy , " Rats exposed to unleaded gasoline showed indications of increased damage caused by free radicals and altered levels of neurotransmitters in the brain cortex region , in comparison with the control or leaded gasoline groups .
Furthermore , inhalation of both fuels induced significant fluctuations in neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus , hippocampus and cerebellum " .
Kinawy concludes , " Heightened aggression may be yet another risk for the human population chronically exposed to urban air polluted by automobile smoke " .

The tiny spectral tarsier , one of the shortest primates in the world , has been filmed hunting at night in the jungle of Sulawesi , Indonesia .
The tarsier stands 13 cm ( five inches ) tall and has massive eyes that enable it to see in the dark .
It belongs to the only group of carnivorous primates .
Tarsiers have evolved little in the past 45 million years and may have separated early from other primates .
A BBC team filmed the tiny tarsier for the natural history series Life .
Tarsiers are completely carnivorous , eating insects and occasionally small bats and birds .
Primitive but social
They have eyeballs that are bigger than their brains , and are believed to have the largest eye to body - size ratio of all mammals .
Their eyes are so big that they cannot move in their sockets , so the tarsier has to move its head to look around .
Unlike many nocturnal animals , a tarsier 's eyes lack a structure called the tapetum lucidum which reflects light shining on it .
Because of that , the animals ' eyes do not light up when a torch is shone upon them , which makes it difficult for researchers to spot tarsiers in the trees .
However , cameraman Justin Maguire managed to film a group of spectral tarsiers foraging around the tree they sleep in .
This tree was actually the aerial roots of a strangler fig .
Tiniest primate Researchers have discovered that spectral tarsiers ( Tarsius tarsier or T. spectrum ) are quite social .
Not only do groups of tarsiers reside in the same " sleeping tree " each night , they also prefer to forage near to one another .
It is not clear why , because their foraging is less successful when other tarsiers are present .
But each tarsier may be able to put its huge eyes and sensitive ears to a use other than hunting : keeping a look - out for predators such as snakes .
At just 13 cm tall , the spectral tarsier is one of the shortest primates in the world .
Hunter on the prowl
An even shorter primate , the pygmy or lesser spectral tarsier ( T. pumilus ) , was thought to be extinct until it was accidently rediscovered by Indonesian scientists in 2000 , who trapped and killed one while catching rats .
In 2008 , scientists from Texas A&M University , US , studied live pygmy tarsiers , which stand just 10 cm ( 4 inches ) tall , for the first time in over 80 years .
The smallest primate of all is thought to be Berthe 's mouse lemur ( Microcebus berthae ) of Madagascar , which averages 9 cm ( 3.6 inches ) long and weighs just over 30g ( 1oz ) .
Lemurs are a separate group of primates from tarsiers , and are also considered to be relatively primitive .
" Tiny tarsiers " is broadcast within the Primates episode of the BBC series Life at 2100GMT on BBC One on Monday 14 December .

Japan vor der Abwärtsspirale Jens Berger
Die Deflation kehrt nach Japan zurück und droht dem angeschlagenen Samurai den Todesstoß zu versetzen
Die Finanz - und Wirtschaftskrise hat weltweit zu Verwerfungen geführt .
Während die Krise die meisten OECD - Staaten in einer
Phase des langanhaltenden Aufschwungs getroffen hat , wurde die zweitgrößte Industrienation der Welt mitten in einer langanhaltenden Schwächephase getroffen .
Japan hatte schon vor der aktuellen Krise immer noch mit den Spätfolgen der Wirtschaftskrise in den 1990 ern zu kämpfen .
Das Land der aufgehenden
Sonne steht heute vor unlösbaren Problemen - die Staatsverschuldung ist atemberaubend , die Wirtschaft lahmt , das Land befindet sich in einer Deflation , die Regierung hat kaum Optionen , entgegenzusteuern , und schon bald könnte die Staatsverschuldungsblase platzen und Japan den wirtschaftlichen Todesstoß versetzen .
Deja vu
Am Ende der 1980er glich Japan einem Tollhaus .
Die Aktien - und Immobilienpreise erreichten Monat für Monat neue Rekordwerte , die Banken gaben freigiebig Kredite an Jedermann , es wurde spekuliert und gezockt , als gäbe es kein Morgen .
In Sushi-Bars im Tokyoter Bankenviertel wurden die maritimen Köstlichkeiten auf nackten Damen angerichtet , Suppen wurden mit Goldflocken verziert , Sportwagen parkten in den Strassen und selbst heruntergekommene Appartments wurden der Hauptstadt zu Preisen gehandelt , die dem Einkommen entsprachen , das ein normaler Angestellter in seinem gesamten Leben verdient .
Das Japan der spätern 1980er gilt heute als Lehrbuchbeispiel einer " Bubble Economy " .
Wie alle Blasen platzte jedoch auch die japanische Blase und hinterließ dem Land ein ganzes Jahrzehnt der Stagnation und der Deflation .
Mit immer höheren Staatsschulden wurden halbherzige Konjunkturprogramme initiiert , während die Leitzinsen Schritt für Schritt auf den Nullpunkt zugingen .
Die 1990er gelten in Japan als das " verlorene Jahrzehnt " .
Wie die meisten Regierungen verstand auch die japanische das Prinzip keynesianischer Konjunkturpolitik nicht wirklich .
Als auch Japan von der boomenden Weltwirtschaft mit dem Jahrtausendwechsel in den Aufschwung getrieben wurde , machten die Japaner weiterhin Schulden , anstatt die alten Verbindlichkeiten , die im Jahr 2000 mit rund 130 Prozent des japanischen Bruttoinlandsproduktes weltweit die höchsten waren , zurückzufahren .
Erst 2005 lenkte man bei einer Staatsschuldenquote von 180 % endlich ein und baute langsam die Schulden ab .
Nur zwei Jahre währte diese kurze Phase der Konsolidierung , doch dann schlug die Wirtschafts - und Finanzkrise unerbittlich zu .
Wie alle anderen Industrieländer musste nun auch Japan mit Staatsausgaben , die auf Pump finanziert werden müssen , gegen die Krise ankämpfen .
Der IWF erwartet , dass Japans Staatsschuldenquote schon in diesem Jahr bei 218 % liegen und im nächsten Jahr 227 % erreichen wird .
Das ist mehr als doppelt so viel wie die USA und fast dreimal so viel wie in Deutschland .
Bis 2014 soll sich dieser
Wert sogar bis auf 246 % steigern .
Wie soll die zweitgrößte Industrienation der Welt diese horrenden Schulden überhaupt zurückzahlen ?
Die japanische Schuldenfalle ist unumkehrbar .
Ich kann nicht erkennen , wie man auf normale Art und Weise da herauskommen sollte .
Die Japaner werden es nicht schaffen , ihr Haushaltsdefizit zu refinanzieren .
Es wird wohl eine Haushaltssperre und ein Einfrieren der Pensionen geben müssen , gefolgt von dem Zusammenbruch einiger Banken , der die Welt erschüttern wird .
Es ist schon fast kriminell fahrlässig , dass die Ratingagenturen hier keinen Alarm auslösen .
Carl Weinberg , Japan - Analyst bei High Frequency Economica
Deflation und Stagnation
Wenn man die " Preissteigerungen " herausrechnet , befindet sich die japanische Volkswirtschaft seit dem letzen Quartal erstmals wieder in der Aufschwungphase - real betrug das Wirtschaftswachstum im Vergleich zum Vorquartal 1,2 % , gegenüber dem Vorjahresquartal ist allerdings immer noch ein Minus von 4,5 % zu verzeichnen .
Japan steckt jedoch - als einziges Industrieland - in einer Deflation .
Der Verbaucherpreisindex lag in den letzten Monaten durchängig bei unter - 2 % .
Die Deflation frißt daher nicht nur den zarten Aufschwung auf , sie verstärkt sogar noch den Abschwung durch die Krise .
Wenn die Deflation auf diesem Niveau bleibt , müsste die japanische Wirtschaft real jedes Jahr um über 2 % wachsen , um nominal auf dem Vorjahresniveau zu bleiben .
Volkswirtschaftlich ist das Realwachstum zwar aussagekräftiger als das Nominalwachstum , aber für die japanische Schuldenproblematik ist ausschließlich das Nominalwachstum von Bedeutung , da die Schulden ja auch nominal zurückgezahlt werden müssen und die Steuereinnahmen bei einer Deflation sinken .
Die Finanz - und Wirtschaftkrise hat dazu geführt , dass die Steuereinnahmen des japanischen Staates nominal um 27 % gesunken sind .
Die Produktion des Industriesektors ist um 19 % gefallen und die Exporte sind um 31 % zurückgegangen , während die Sparquote nahe Null liegt .
All dies hat dazu geführt , dass die japanische Volkswirtschaft im letzten Jahr nominal um 10 % geschrumpft ist .
In der Abwärtsspirale
Japan befindet sich in einer verhängnisvollen Abwärtsspirale .
Die Deflation sorgt dafür , dass die Steuereinnahmen zurückgehen , während die Kosten für die Staatsschulden einen immer größeren Teil des Staatshaushaltes ausmachen .
Will der Staat nicht durch eine Finanzierung auf Pump die Schulden noch weiter in die Höhe treiben - und damit für die Folgeperioden noch höhere Finanzierungskosten aus dem Haushalt decken - muss er unweigerlich die Ausgaben zurückfahren .
Dies wirkt allerdings nicht nur konjunkturhemmend , sondern auch deflationär .
Egal , was der Staat macht , er kann das Land nicht aus dieser Abwärtsspirale führen .
Die neue japanische Regierung sitzt wie ein paralysiertes Kaninchen im Scheinwerferkegel des entgegenkommenden Autos - alles , was sie tun kann , ist zu hoffen , dass das Auto im letzten Moment ausweicht .
Die Deflationsrate ist schockierend .
Die Schuldendynamik ist erschreckend und es besteht das Risiko einer Abwärtsspirale .
Russell Jones , Analyst von RBC Capital Markets
Schulden außer Kontrolle
Die Sparquote der Japaner betrug 1990 noch 15 % , heute beträgt sie gerade einmal 2 % und nähert sich so langsam dem Nullpunkt .
Ein Großteil der japanischen Staatsschulden ist in der Hand des 1,5 Billionen US - Dollar schweren staatlichen Pensionsfonds .
Dieser Premiumkunde für japanische Staatsanleihen droht nun als Käufer auszufallen , da er Monat für Monat netto Staatsanleihen verkaufen muss , um seinen Zahlungsverpflichtungen an die Pensionäre nachzukommen .
Im letzten Jahr haben vermehrt die japanischen Großbanken die Rolle des Staatsfinanzierers übernommen , aber da auch sie marktwirtschaftlichen Gesetzen unterliegen , ist auch hier bald ein Ende der Aufopferungsfähigkeit in Sicht .
Das größte Risiko für die japanische Volkswirtschaft liegt nun darin , dass das Angebot an Staatsanleihen die Nachfrage so weit übersteigt , dass sich die Verzinsung dieser Papiere erhöhen muss .
Wenn der japanische Staat für alle seine ausstehenden Staatsanleihen 3 bis 4 % Zinsen zahlen muss , würde dies die Staatsfinanzen vollends ruinieren .
Da wundert es kaum , dass das japanische Finanzministerium nun kräftig die Werbetrommel rührt und sogar in den Tokyoter Taxis bereits für Staatsanleihen wirbt .
Die japanische Verschuldung ist außer Kontrolle geraten .
Es besteht ein reelles Risiko , dass Japan seinen Zahlungsverpflichtungen nicht wird nachkommen können .
Simon Johnson , ehemaliger Chef - Ökonom des IWF
Platzt die Bondblase ?
Die Märkte sind unerbittlich , wenn sie erkennen , dass ein kapitales Opfer bereits waidwund ist .
Um sich gegen den Ausfall japanischer Staatsanleihen abzusichern , sind bereits Risikoaufschläge von 35 bis 63 Basispunkten nötig - für deutsche und amerikanische Staatsanleihen werden 21 bzw.
22 Basispunkte verlangt .
Problematisch an dieser Dynamik ist , dass sie vom starken
Yen beeinflusst wird , da Kreditversicherungen meist in Dollar gezeichnet werden .
Auf den Märkten gibt es daher bereits die ersten Spekulanten , die im großen Stil gegen Japan wetten .
Einer dieser Spekulanten ist David Einhorn , der in der Branche bekannt wurde , als er als Erster gegen Lehman Brothers wettete und damit stolze Gewinne einfahren konnte .
Einhorn ist davon überzeugt , dass Japan den kritischen Punkt bereits überschritten hat und nicht mehr umkehren kann .
Für ihn steht fest , dass die japanische Bondblase platzen und eine Schuldenkrise auslösen wird .
Sollte es soweit kommen , wird dies die ganze Weltwirtschaft erschüttern .
Der Ausfall der zweitgrößten Industrienation ist ein Szenario , gegen das die Lehman - Pleite eine Petitesse ist .
Auswege aus der Krise ?
Viel kann die japanische Regierung nicht tun , um sich gegen die drohende Abwärtsspirale zu wehren .
Als erster Schritt käme hier der massive Aufkauf von Dollarnoten in Frage .
Nur wenn Japan den
Yen schwächt , kann sich die Situation zum Besseren wenden , da davon nicht nur der Export profitiert , sondern auch die Deflation über steigende Verbraucherpreise in den Griff zu bekommen wäre .
Ein weiterer Ausweg besteht in einem Anwerfen der Geldpresse .
Es gibt in Japan schon Überlegungen , die Neuverschuldung über die Notenbank zu refinanzieren .
Fiskalpolitisch sind den Japanern zumindest die Hände gebunden - seit Ewgikeiten rangiert der Leitzins nahe Null und negative Zinsen wird es auch im Land der letzten Samurai nicht geben .
( Jens Berger )
We diligently await the retorts from Senators Kyl and Hagan on how this is an " unnecessary " piece of transparency - promoting legislation , which will merely attempt to prevent the destruction of the endangered species better known as Americanus Middleclassus .
Merkley , Corker Introduce Legislation to Audit the Fed , Protect Taxpayer Dollars
WASHINGTON , D.C. –
In the wake of the Federal Reserve ’s extraordinary actions last year to stabilize the financial system , U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley ( D - OR ) and Bob Corker ( R - TN ) , members of the Senate Banking Committee , today introduced legislation that will require the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) to conduct an audit of the Fed ’s emergency lending programs .
The Federal Reserve Accountability
Act will monitor and protect taxpayer dollars without intruding upon the Federal Reserve ’s independent monetary policy or its role as lender of last resort .
“ Transparency and accountability are fundamental principles of representative government , ” Merkley said .
“ During this financial crisis , Federal Reserve credit contributed greatly to the stabilization of the system .
In doing so , the Federal Reserve departed significantly from its traditional relationship with markets and took on unprecedented new risks .
Such a significant change in the Federal Reserve ’s traditional activities demands responsible , robust oversight .
The Federal Reserve Accountability
Act strikes the right balance between protecting taxpayer dollars and respecting the central bank ’s responsibility to manage monetary policy . ”
“ The Federal Reserve has provided our financial system with emergency credit during this time of financial hardship , and in the course of doing so , has seen a $ 1.4 trillion increase in its balance sheet .
Despite its independence , these are still taxpayer dollars at risk , and many Americans have called for an audit of the Fed , ” Corker said .
“ This bill is the way to do it .
We give the Government Accountability Office the authority to audit the Fed 's emergency credit facilities without inappropriately compromising the independence of the Fed or politicizing its role in crafting monetary policy . ”
The Federal Reserve Accountability
Act would require the GAO to audit all remaining emergency lending programs not already subject to audit .
To protect against the risk that disclosure of the participation of particular institutions could disrupt markets , the GAO would be required to redact the names of the specific institutions .
Names would , however , be made available one year after each emergency program is no longer used .
In addition , to encourage greater accessibility for the average taxpayer , the Fed would be required to place these GAO audits along with additional audit materials on its website under a new “ Audit ” section .
And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice ; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering ; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened of cynics .
I cannot argue with those who find these men and women – some known , some obscure to all but those they help – to be far more deserving of this honor than I .
And yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated .
In part , this is because I am at the beginning , and not the end , of my labors on the world stage .
Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize – Schweitzer and King ; Marshall and Mandela – my accomplishments are slight .
Your Majesties , Your Royal Highnesses , Distinguished Members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee , citizens of America , and citizens of the world : I receive this honor with deep gratitude and great humility .
It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations – that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world , we are not mere prisoners of fate .
Our actions matter , and can bend history in the direction of justice .
...am the Commander - in - Chief of a nation in the midst of two wars .
One of these wars is winding down .
The other is a conflict that America did not seek ; one in which we are joined by forty three other countries – including Norway – in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks .
Still , we are at war , and I am responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land .
Some will kill .
Some will be killed .
And so I come here with an acute sense of the cost of armed conflict – filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace , and our effort to replace one with the other .
These questions are not new .
War , in one form or another , appeared with the first man .
At the dawn of history , its morality was not questioned ; it was simply a fact , like drought or disease – the manner in which tribes and then civilizations sought power and settled their differences .
Over time , as codes of law sought to control violence within groups , so did philosophers , clerics , and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war .
The concept of a “ just war ” emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when it meets certain preconditions : if it is waged as a last resort or in self - defense ; if the forced used is proportional , and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence .
For most of history , this concept of just war was rarely observed .
The capacity of human beings to think up new ways to kill one another proved inexhaustible , as did our capacity to exempt from mercy those who look different or pray to a different God .
Wars between armies gave way to wars between nations – total wars in which the distinction between combatant and civilian became blurred .
In the span of thirty years , such carnage would twice engulf this continent .
And while it is hard to conceive of a cause more just than the defeat of the Third Reich and the Axis powers , World War II was a conflict in which the total number of civilians who died exceeded the number of soldiers who perished .
In the wake of such destruction , and with the advent of the nuclear age , it became clear to victor and vanquished alike that the world needed institutions to prevent another World War .
And so , a quarter century after the United States Senate rejected the League of Nations – an idea for which Woodrow Wilson received this Prize – America led the world in constructing an architecture to keep the peace : a Marshall Plan and a United Nations , mechanisms to govern the waging of war , treaties to protect human rights , prevent genocide , and restrict the most dangerous weapons .
In many ways , these efforts succeeded .
Yes , terrible wars have been fought , and atrocities committed .
But there has been no Third World War .
The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall .
Commerce has stitched much of the world together .
Billions have been lifted from poverty .
The ideals of liberty , self - determination , equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced .
We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past , and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud .
A decade into a new century , this old architecture is buckling under the weight of new threats .
The world may no longer shudder at the prospect of war between two nuclear superpowers , but proliferation may increase the risk of catastrophe .
Terrorism has long been a tactic , but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale .
Moreover , wars between nations have increasingly given way to wars within nations .
The resurgence of ethnic or sectarian conflicts ; the growth of secessionist movements , insurgencies , and failed states ; have increasingly trapped civilians in unending chaos .
In today ’s wars , many more civilians are killed than soldiers ; the seeds of future conflict are sewn , economies are wrecked , civil societies torn asunder , refugees amassed , and children scarred .
I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war .
What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision , hard work , and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago .
And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace .
We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes .
There will be times when nations – acting individually or in concert – will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified .
I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King said in this same ceremony years ago – “ Violence never brings permanent peace .
It solves no social problem : it merely creates new and more complicated ones . ”
As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King ’s life ’s work , I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence .
I know there is nothing weak –nothing passive – nothing naïve – in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King .
But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation , I can not be guided by ....
.... their examples alone .
I face the world as it is , and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people .
For make no mistake : evil does exist in the world .
A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitler ’s armies .
Negotiations cannot convince Al Qaeda ’s leaders to lay down their arms .
To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism – it is a recognition of history ; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason .
I raise this point because in many countries there is a deep ambivalence about military action today , no matter the cause .
At times , this is joined by a reflexive suspicion of America , the world ’s sole military superpower .
Yet the world must remember that it was not simply international institutions – not just treaties and declarations – that brought stability to a post - World War II world .
Whatever mistakes we have made , the plain fact is this : the United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms .
The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea , and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans .
We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will .
We have done so out of enlightened self - interest – because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren , and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples ’ children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity .
So yes , the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace .
And yet this truth must coexist with another – that no matter how justified , war promises human tragedy .
The soldier ’s courage and sacrifice is full of glory , expressing devotion to country , to cause and to comrades in arms .
But war itself is never glorious , and we must never trumpet it as such .
So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths – that war is sometimes necessary , and war is at some level an expression of human feelings .
Concretely , we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago .
“ Let us focus , ” he said , “ on a more practical , more attainable peace , based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions .
” What might this evolution look like ?
What might these practical steps be ?
To begin with , I believe that all nations – strong and weak alike – must adhere to standards that govern the use of force .
I – like any head of state – reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation .
Nevertheless , I am convinced that adhering to standards strengthens those who do , and isolates – and weakens – those who do n’t .
The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self - defense .
Likewise , the world recognized the need to confront Saddam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait – a consensus that sent a clear message to all about the cost of aggression .
Furthermore , America cannot insist that others follow the rules of the road if we refuse to follow them ourselves .
For when we do n’t , our action can appear arbitrary , and undercut the legitimacy of future intervention – no matter how justified .
This becomes particularly important when the purpose of military action extends beyond self defense or the defense of one nation against an aggressor .
More and more , we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government , or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region .
I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds , as it was in the Balkans , or in other places that have been scarred by war .
Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later .
That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace .
America ’s commitment to global security will never waiver .
But in a world in which threats are more diffuse , and missions more complex , America can not act alone .
This is true in Afghanistan .
This is true in failed states like Somalia , where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering .
And sadly , it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come .
The leaders and soldiers of NATO countries – and other friends and allies – demonstrate this truth through the capacity and courage they have shown in Afghanistan .
But in many countries , there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public .
I understand why war is not popular .
But I also know this : the belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it .
Peace requires responsibility .
Peace entails sacrifice .
That is why NATO continues to be indispensable .
That is why we must strengthen UN and regional peacekeeping , and not leave the task to a few countries .
That is why we honor those who return home from peacekeeping and training abroad to Oslo and Rome ; to Ottawa and Sydney ; to Dhaka and Kigali – we honor them not as makers of war , but as wagers of peace .
Let me make one final point about the use of force .
Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war , we must also think clearly about how we fight it .
The Nobel Committee recognized this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant – the founder of the Red Cross , and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions .
Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct .
And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules , I believe that the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war .
That is what makes us different from those whom we fight .
That is a source of our strength .
That is why I prohibited torture .
That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed .
And that is why I have reaffirmed America ’s commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions .
We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend .
And we honor those ideals by upholding them not just when it is easy , but when it is hard .
I have spoken to the questions that must weigh on our minds and our hearts as we choose to wage war .
But let me turn now to our effort to avoid such tragic choices , and speak of three ways that we can build a just and lasting peace .
First , in dealing with those nations that break rules and laws , I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to change behavior – for if we want a lasting peace , then the words of the international community must mean something .
Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable .
Sanctions must exact a real price .
Intransigence must be met with increased pressure – and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one .
One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and to seek a world without them .
In the middle of the last century , nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear : all will have access to peaceful nuclear power ; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them ; and those with nuclear weapons will work toward disarmament .
I am committed to upholding this treaty .
It is a centerpiece of my foreign policy .
And I am working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russia ’s nuclear stockpiles .
But it is also incumbent upon all of us to insist that nations like Iran and North Korea do not game the system .
Those who claim to respect international law cannot avert their eyes when those laws are flouted .
Those who care for their own security cannot ignore the danger of an arms race in the Middle East or East Asia .
Those who seek peace cannot stand idly by as nations arm themselves for nuclear war .
The same principle applies to those who violate international law by brutalizing their own people .
When there is genocide in Darfur ; systematic rape in Congo ; or repression in Burma – there must be consequences .
And the closer we stand together , the less likely we will be faced with the choice between armed intervention and complicity in oppression .
This brings me to a second point – the nature of the peace that we seek .
For peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict .
Only a just peace based upon the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting .
It was this insight that drove drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after the Second World War .
In the wake of devastation , they recognized that if human rights are not protected , peace is a hollow promise .
And yet all too often , these words are ignored .
In some countries , the failure to uphold human rights is excused by the false suggestion that these are Western principles , foreign to local cultures or stages of a nation ’s development .
And within America , there has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists – a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values .
I reject this choice .
I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please ; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear .
Pent up grievances fester , and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence .
We also know that the opposite is true .
Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace .
America has never fought a war against a democracy , and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens .
No matter how callously defined , neither America ’s interests – nor the world ’s –are served by the denial of human aspirations .
So even as we respect the unique culture and traditions of different countries , America will always be a voice for those aspirations that are universal .
We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers like Aung Sang Suu Kyi ; to the bravery of Zimbabweans who cast their ballots in the face of beatings ; to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently through the streets of Iran .
It is telling that the leaders of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people more than the power of any other nation .
And it is the responsibility of all free people and free nations to make clear to these movements that hope and history are on their sideLet me also say this : the promotion of human rights cannot be about exhortation alone .
At times , it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy .
I know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation .
But I also know that sanctions without outreach – and condemnation without discussion – can carry forward a crippling status quo .
No repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door .
In light of the Cultural Revolution ’s horrors , Nixon ’s meeting with Mao appeared inexcusable – and yet it surely helped set China on a path where millions of its citizens have been lifted from poverty , and connected to open societies .
Pope John Paul ’s engagement with Poland created space not just for the Catholic Church , but for labor leaders like Lech Walesa .
Ronald Reagan ’s efforts on arms control and embrace of perestroika not only improved relations with the Soviet Union , but empowered dissidents throughout Eastern Europe .
There is no simple formula here .
But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement ; pressure and incentives , so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time .
Third , a just peace includes not only civil and political rights – it must encompass economic security and opportunity .
For true peace is not just freedom from fear , but freedom from want .
It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security ; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food , or clean water , or the medicine they need to survive .
It does not exist where children cannot aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family .
The absence of hope can rot a society from within .
And that is why helping farmers feed their own people – or nations educate their children and care for the sick – is not mere charity .
It is also why the world must come together to confront climate change .
There is little scientific dispute that if we do nothing , we will face more drought , famine and mass displacement that will fuel more conflict for decades .
For this reason , it is not merely scientists and activists who call for swift and forceful action – it is military leaders in my country and others who understand that our common security hangs in the balance .
Agreements among nations .
Strong institutions .
Support for human rights .
Investments in development .
All of these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President Kennedy spoke about .
And yet , I do not believe that we will have the will , or the staying power , to complete this work without something more – and that is the continued expansion of our moral imagination ; an insistence that there is something irreducible that we all share .
As the world grows smaller , you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are ; to understand that we all basically want the same things ; that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families .
And yet , given the dizzying pace of globalization , and the cultural leveling of modernity , it should come as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish about their particular identities – their race , their tribe , and perhaps most powerfully their religion .
In some places , this fear has led to conflict .
At times , it even feels like we are moving backwards .
We see it in Middle East , as the conflict between Arabs and Jews seems to harden .
We see it in nations that are torn asunder by tribal lines .
Most dangerously , we see it in the way that religion is used to justify the murder of innocents by those who have distorted and defiled the great religion of Islam , and who attacked my country from Afghanistan .
These extremists are not the first to kill in the name of God ; the cruelties of the Crusades are amply recorded .
But they remind us that no Holy War can ever be a just war .
For if you truly believe that you are carrying out divine will , then there is no need for restraint – no need to spare the pregnant mother , or the medic , or even a person of one ’s own faith .
Such a warped view of religion is not just incompatible with the concept of peace , but the purpose of faith – for the one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us .
Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature .
We are fallible .
We make mistakes , and fall victim to the temptations of pride , and power , and sometimes evil .
Even those of us with the best intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us .
But we do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected .
We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place .
The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance , but the love that they preached – their faith in human progress – must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey .
For if we lose that faith – if we dismiss it as silly or naïve ; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace – then we lose what is best about humanity .
We lose our sense of possibility .
We lose our moral compass .
Like generations have before us , we must reject that future .
As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago , “ I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history .
I refuse to accept the idea that the ‘ isness ’ of man ’s present nature makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal ‘ oughtness ’ that forever confronts him .
” So let us reach for the world that ought to be – that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls .
Somewhere today , in the here and now , a soldier sees he ’s outgunned but stands firm to keep the peace .
Somewhere today , in this world , a young protestor awaits the brutality of her government , but has the courage to march on .
Somewhere today , a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child , who believes that a cruel world still has a place for his dreams .
Let us live by their example .
We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us , and still strive for justice .
We can admit the intractability of depravation , and still strive for dignity .
We can understand that there will be war , and still strive for peace .
We can do that – for that is the story of human progress ; that is the hope of all the world ; and at this moment of challenge , that must be our work here on Earth .

What particularly irritated me was that I was NOT offered the choice of " No Action " !
Nor was I offered the choice of renaming .
I could delete or move to chest .
Plus , I could not take a screen capture which I could before this major upgrade of the beta .
Gadwin Print screen started with a blank box !
And the the Avast alert screen disappeared when I tried to draw a rectangle around it to make a screen shot .
Then Gadwin Print Screen froze .
Then Avast said Gadwin Print Screen was the same trojan that everyone is seeing .
Then Avast announced that Explorer .exe was a trojan !
GEEZ !!!
I had to completely shut down Avast .
I can't believe this happened right after I had been praising Avast 's improvement in the False Positive ratings at AV - Comparatives .
This is a major mess for Avast .
I have Avast 5 beta 2 on a Vista virtual machine that had not been running for four days .
I just booted it and Avast did a MAJOR upgrade ... not just definitions but major upgrade and then announced it had to reboot the computer .
I allowed that and BAM !
I noticed HostsMan was not in the systray .
So , I tried to start it only to get the alert about it being a trojan .

Huawei , Optimus conclude dual carrier tests
New Delhi , Mar 23 : Huawei , a telecommunications network solutions provider , and Optimus , the integrated telecommunications operator of Sonaecom , have announced the successful conclusion of a new HSPA +
Dual Carrier technology tests in Portugal .
The HSPA +
Dual Carrier technology , which , together with the HSPA + technology which has already been implemented in Optimus ' network , allows maximum download speeds of up to 42 Mb/s on wireless Internet access .
The tests , performed 100 pc on the Optimus network , reached maximum download speeds of 41.4 Mb/s , very close to the theoretical limit of this technology , and the average download speed reached 39.7 Mb/s .
Dual Carrier technology is based on the principle of using two carrier waves , both on the transmitter and the receiver , which allows the increase of the transmission rate to double the current maximum value ( 21 Mb/s ) .
Pinto Correia , Optimus Board Member , said : " The success of the HSPA +
Dual Carrier technology tests reinforces the high quality of our network and represents the confirmation of Optimus as the best integrated telecommunications operator in Portugal .
" Optimus was one of the first European operators to develop a technological partnership with Huawei , and that has allowed us to introduce several innovations in the Portuguese market , which represent truly benefits to all our customers " .
This capacity has been placed at the service of its customers through the continuous evolution of the Optimus Kanguru service , a pioneer in wireless Internet access in Portugal .
Xie Xinping , Managing Director of Huawei Portugal , said , " We are working closely with leading operators , such as Optimus since the introduction of 3G technology .
Implemented with dual carrier capabilities , Huawei's HSPA + solution will enhance spectral efficiency and provide capacity gains for operators .
With the widespread adoption of mobile broadband . "
As of January 2010 , Huawei has established 36 HSPA + networks with global operators , among which 20 HSPA + commercial networks and 16 HSPA + network in deployment or in trial .
Huawei , Optimus conclude dual carrier tests

Would you scarf down a pound of baby back ribs and a scoop of Haagen - Dazs ice cream or maybe two Big Macs while watching the latest release at the movies ?
That 's what a new report says you ’re getting in terms of fat and calories with a large tub of movie theater popcorn , and that 's before they pour on the buttery topping .
Just when you thought it was safe to escape the cold and cuddle up with your favorite snacks at the local cineplex , the people at the Center for Science in the Public Interest are popping the lid on movie theater popcorn 's calorie , fat , and salt content .
The report updates the organization 's infamous 1994 movie theater popcorn exposé with new nutritional information on movie snacks offered by America 's three largest movie chains : Regal , AMC , and Cinemark .
Researchers found movie theater popcorn offerings range from 400 to 1,200 calories , with one to three days ' worth of saturated fat and up to 1,500 milligrams of sodium .
Make it a combo and add 300 to 1,110 empty calories worth of candy and another 150 to 500 calories from a sugary soft drink to wash it all down .
" To save you money ( how thoughtful ) , theaters offer combos .
For example , for a mere $ 12 Regal hands you a medium popcorn and a medium soft drink , and AMC dishes up a large popcorn and a large soda , " write CSPI researchers in their report published in the Nutrition Action Healthletter .
" Where else can you be so distracted ( by the movie ) that you do n't realize you 've just swallowed 1,400 to 1,600 calories ? "

VIA [ Engadget ]
Ten years ago , I plunged into parenthood in a state of pie-eyed optimism .
Thinking that my newborn son was a blank slate , I foolishly thought that I would be able to influence his personality and determine his character .
I now realise that I was completely delusional .
That little pink baby , deceptively docile and charming with his masses of dark brown hair and sapphire blue eyes , came into this world with his own agenda .
I thought that by restricting the types of programmes he watched on television , offering him mostly gender - neutral toys that had been designed to be educational and not allowing him to play with toy weapons of any sort , I would be able to instil in him my values of pacifism and gender equality .
I did n't give family and friends any guidelines about what types of toys I wanted him to have .
It seemed too much like a declaration that gifts were expected .
So I decided that any gifts would be gratefully acknowledged and toys that I deemed inappropriate or too overtly boy - oriented would be quietly donated to my favourite charity shop , unless there was a risk that the giver would find out .
Soon , the toy box held as many trucks , trains and tools as it did blocks and educational toys .
What was dismaying to me was that he strongly preferred the " boy " toys over the gender - neutral and educational ones from the word go .
Offer him his Baby Whoozit or his green plastic race car and he would go for the race car every single time .
By the time he started attending day care at 14 months , I 'd given up on gender neutrality in his toys , but I still clung to the belief that I would be able to raise a nonviolent child by banning toy weapons and even cartoon violence in videos .
Picking him up one afternoon , about a month after he started at day care , I was informed that he and his buddy , Zach , had been in trouble that day for inappropriate play .
It seems they 'd been using their thumbs and forefingers as pretend guns , pointing at the girls and yelling , " Bang ! Bang ! " I was gobsmacked .
He 'd never watched anything more violent than Teletubbies .
How on earth did he have any concept of what a gun was or how to emulate one ?
It could n't have been Zach 's influence – Zach 's parents were even more right - on lefty than me .
As he got older , even the most innocuous toys were used as mock weapons .
My protestations about not liking violence were met with exasperated cries of " it 's just pretend , Mum " .
Eventually , I caved on the weapons ban and lightsabres and foam dart guns made their way into the toy box .
Over the past 10 years , I have come to the conclusion that my influence over my son is much more limited than I ever imagined it would be .
I cannot mould my son into the type of person I want him to be , I can only guide and advise and hope that the decisions he makes will be good ones .
He is a wonderful person – curious about the world around him , kind , generous , loving .
He is exactly the sort of child I had hoped for 10 years ago , when I first held him in my arms .
I just wish that I could take more credit for that .
Solar sails can pick up a lot of speed , thanks to the constant pressure from sunlight .
In the future , they might be able to traverse the solar system in the span of just a few years ( Illustration : Rick Sternbach / Planetary Society )
Earlier this week , the Planetary Society , a space advocacy group in Pasadena , California , received an anonymous donation to build and launch a small solar - sail driven spacecraft .
The Society hopes to launch the sail in about a year as part of a three - stage plan to demonstrate the viability of solar sail propulsion , which has never been tested in orbit .
The group says it is the only practical technology that might be used for interstellar travel , since the light generates a small but constant pressure that should accelerate a sail to high speeds over time .
New Scientist caught up with Louis Friedman , the organisation ’s executive director , to find out more about the promise and challenge of solar sailing .
What is a solar sail and how does it work ?
Advertisement
A solar sail is a device that collects sunlight and transfers the energy of the sunlight to the momentum of the spacecraft .
It uses pure light , reflecting off the sail , so you want a large area to collect a lot of photons and you want it highly reflective so you get a high efficiency of them bouncing off .
We use aluminised mylar .
What ’s the history of the idea ?
The pressure of sunlight was noted by the early pioneers who discovered light .
Felix Tisserand and others noted how light pressure affected comet [ tails ] back in the 19th century .
The use of light to propel a spacecraft , that idea was invented by Fridrich Tsander and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky back in the Soviet Union in the 1920s .
But it was n’t until the 1970s that anyone thought about practically doing it .
Solar pressure force has been measured on spacecraft many times and it ’s been used in manoeuvres , but never as the single force to propel your way around in space .
What kind of missions are solar sails good for ?
It ’s spacecraft without fuel , and the real advantage comes when you go really long distances .
The ultimate goal is interstellar travel because this is the only known technology that can be used over those kinds of distances .
You need ambitious missions in the long run , but there ’s a lot more interest in using sails right now for missions that hover between Earth and the sun to monitor solar weather , or that do a pole - sitting above the Earth to monitor the arctic environment on the land and the magnetosphere .
We eventually want to put a solar weather station at the L1 point between Earth and the sun [ Lagrange points are regions of space where the gravitational acceleration from the Earth and sun are exactly equal , letting objects remain there with very little effort ] .
This could give us longer warning times for coronal mass ejections and solar storms that impact the ionosphere and can cause disruptions in the power grid .
What is the plan for the society ’s ‘ Light Sail ’ ?
We have a three - step process : LightSail - 1 will prove solar sailing , LightSail - 2 should be able to use the sail to increase orbital energy , getting away from Earth into higher orbit to do scientific measurements .
LightSail - 3 would then go all the way out to become the first step of the solar - weather monitoring station .
Because we ’re doing it with this very new technology , Nanosats , it becomes affordable .
These are tiny satellites that , if you had to bring them to the launch site , you would n’t check them in your luggage – you ’d just put them in the overhead compartment .
Space agencies do n’t want to invest in a big spacecraft with a whole new technology with large structures and deployable devices without it being proven .
But , of course , the only way to prove it is to do it , so it becomes a catch - 22 .
What we ’re doing now with the Nanosats is finding an affordable way to prove it .
The hardware costs are very minimal .
What are the challenges of flying a solar sail ?
What ’s uncertain , and what becomes difficult to model until we get the craft into space itself , are the dynamics – the fluttering and shaking , how it reacts to micrometeorites , stuff like that .
Even turning it might set up some resonant dynamic motions because it ’s so long and so thin – that ’s a big uncertainty .
That ’s why we build this up step - by - step .
Our first flight is just to show that we can control the vehicle , that we can turn it without any bad things happening .
Based on that experience , we ’ll build it larger and then move on to the second step .
How big is the current craft ?
The sail is 32 square metres when it ’s unfurled , 5.5 m on a side .
The mass of the craft is 4.5 kilograms .
[ For interstellar travel ] , I would estimate you ’d need a sail that ’s half a kilometre by half a kilometre in area and a craft that ’s 1 kilogram in mass .
And instead of a 5 - micron sail like we have , which is very thin , with really advanced technology you might have a 1 - micron sail by the time you do interstellar travel .
This would also need a high - powered laser to keep enough light energy focused on the sail .
One kilogram is n’t much mass – it sounds like humans would be too heavy for interstellar solar sail missions .
Yeah , I do n’t think human interstellar travel ever will be done by sailing .
I already consider myself way - out for talking about interstellar flight for spacecraft , I do n’t know how to talk about human interstellar flight .
So what could be learned by sending probes out of the solar system ?
If you think about the evolution of everything we ’re doing , it ’s all about sending information to places and from places .
The mass of the physical things we send is getting very small and the content of what we ’re learning gets very large .
I envision giant sails doubling their duty as giant antennas , collecting information and beaming it back with incredible algorithms of information compression – and other tricks that have n’t been invented yet – that provide lots of information about other star systems .
I think they will extend our outreach of exploration into the stars .
What got you interested in solar sails ?
That goes back to the 1970s , when I was working at JPL [ NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Lab ] .
Solar sailing was going to be the way that we could do something that we thought could never be done , which is rendezvous with Halley ’s Comet .
The comet comes into the solar system backwards , basically .
To meet up with it , you have to stop the world and get off – you have to cancel out all of your orbital motion around the sun , turn completely around , go the other way and then come in and rendezvous with the comet .
We thought that could never be done , and then we found a solar sail design that could do it .
I got really excited – that ’s what excites me , doing things that have never been done before .
That mission turned out not to be ready in time , but a lot of people wanted to continue with solar sailing , as did I , but I did n’t want to spend time on it unless I had a flight opportunity .
It was n’t until the Russians came to us in 1999 and said [ they could launch ] our Cosmos 1 mission that I got energised again .
And now the Nanosats have made me even more energised because they ’re going to open up the universe .
They ’re going to open us up to all kinds of ways of doing things in space because they ’re affordable .
This is a low - cost project , a couple of million dollars , and at the same time very ambitious .
Was it hard to bounce back after the Society ’s Cosmos 1 solar sail crashed into the sea after launch in 2005 ?
Yes and no .
First of all , I was incredibly uplifted because so many people were so positive .
That ’s what you do in the space business , you have failures and then you bounce back .
You ’re at the edge of it .
So yes , it was relatively easy to bounce back .
At the same time , you know , you do n’t want to keep on doing the same thing .
You learn from a bad experience and you do the next mission even better .
The age of MMA has spawned a new breed of tough guy .
No longer are these douchebags running around claiming to hold blackbelts in Karate .
Instead these Affliction wearing self tanners have armed themselves knowledge gained from watching mixed martial arts matches and believe that they can make you ‘ tap or snap ’!
They now roam the streets looking to take someone ’s arm home with them as a prize .
But what would your fate be if you ever encountered one of these pay - per- view trained assassins ?
If you could get past the smell of the half a can of Axe body spray , would you stand much of a chance , or would you be choked into unconsciousness in the blink of an eye ?
Former UFC fighter Sam Hoger gave us some insight into what we have to fear from someone off the street who is looking to put you into one of these holds .
1 ) Triangle from the bottom
Long a favorite of fighters because not only does it allow you to choke out your opponent , but also the last thing he will know is the smell of your balls in his face .
The pros make it look extremely easy but we ’re told that on a scale of difficulty from 1 - 5 , with 5 being the hardest , this move is actually rated a 5 for the untrained guy .
First and foremost if he is trying this move it means that you are already on top of him , probably trying to punch his face back to its natural color .
Then it requires an understanding of hip movement and angles to lock it in tight , an understanding your opponent is unlikely to have after downing some Jacks and trying to avoid your fists .
2 ) Gogoplata
This submission move works by crushing your opponents windpipe against your shin .
Even though the name sounds like a Japanese monster movie it can seriously wreck an opponent if performed correctly .
Luckily , you probably do n’t ever have to worry about getting slapped with one of these .
As Hoger explained , unless you are “ comfortable putting both of your feet behind your neck then you have no business trying this move . ”
He rates the move a 5 on the difficulty scale .
This is probably even harder to pull off wearing tights jeans and weighed down by gold chains .
3 ) Knee Bar
Famously used by Frank Mir when he defeated the half human , half human growth hormone known as Brock Lesnar , this move has been shown to make even the toughest competitor call it quits or risk breaking a leg .
The move is performed by grabbing an opponent ’s leg and pressing your hips into the knee to bend it in ways it was never meant to bend , kind of like the world ’s most extreme leg hump .
This rates a solid 4 on the scale though because the leg has some of the largest muscles in the human body .
Our resident expert compares trying to perform this move to trying to fight a baby alligator .
Sure , it may look cute , but the fucking thing is going to be all squirmy and shit .
So while your opponent is thinking knee bar , you ’ll probably have time to think of various ways to plant your other foot into his head .
4 ) Guillotine Choke
So if these moves are going to prove too hard for the average street brawler then what can you use when faced with an angry head of hair gel in a snug t- shirt ?
Our trained fighter recommends that you stick to the basics and use the awesomely named guillotine choke .
This is a variation of the old school headlock , except that you are facing your opponent .
The guillotine rates only a 1 for degree of difficulty .
While it is effective , Hoger warns that to really make it work you have to work on the “ side crunching aspect ” and not just try and rip the guy ’s head off .
This will ensure he actually passes out in addition to feeling a lot of pain .
Just make sure you wash the grease off your arms afterward .

Average user spends more than 55 minutes per day on Facebook ( http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics) ( 6.7 billion * 24 hours ) /( 350 million * 55 minutes ) = 500
It 's unclear how they 're measuring time spent on the site , but most of Facebook 's statistics seem to be honest ( they only count active users , etc ) .
While wine snobs have blighted the earth for thousands of years ( you can bet there was at least one guy curling his lip at the vintage of Jesus ’ first and best miracle ) , beer snobbery is a relatively young art , especially in the U.S .
This is because every beer in the country once tasted exactly the same .
Oh sure , there were Bud lovers and MGD aficionados who would swear they could tell the difference , but if you gave them a blind taste test , you ’d soon discover they ’d just keep asking for another “ test taste ” until there was n’t any beer left and they were passed out on your sofa .
Furthermore , beer was considered the balm of the common man , it was not something you swirled in a glass and judged by its “ nose . ”
It was something you swilled from a plastic cup and sometimes shot through your nose .
Then the microbrewery revolution swept the country and soon every abandoned firehouse , bank and shoe factory was outfitted with a vat and turning out every possible form and flavor of beer you could imagine , and some you would rather not .
It was perfectly natural then , with so many different beers to choose from , that a learned cadre of beer experts would appear to explain to the unsophisticated masses what is “ good beer ” and what “ has the nose and character of a harbor - town harlot with a penchant for walking into walls caked with manure . ”
Thus arrived the beer snob .
Beer Vs. Wine Snobbery
Beer snobbery is less dangerous .
While wine snobs have been around long enough to be nearly universally despised and even hunted for sport in certain parts of the South , beer snobs are so new they ’re considered by the general public to be as harmless as those people who carve elaborate sculptures out of Spam — someone to be viewed more with bemusement than with the scope of a high - powered rifle .
The dress is casual .
Wine snobs have a strict dress code involving turtlenecks , glasses designed to sit on the end of one ’s nose and silk scarves , but a beer snob can pretty much dress anyway he likes .
Aside from the snooty expression , a typical beer snob is nearly indistinguishable from your least favorite brother - in - law .
The position does n’t require a sensitive palate .
In fact , a too - sensitive palate just gets in the way .
If a beer snob ’s mind is busy trying to decipher a vast array of signals from his tongue , it becomes very difficult for him to think up a clever way to insult a fellow beer snob ’s tie .
You do n’t need to know what the hell you ’re talking about .
The fact of the matter is , no one really knows how to tell a good beer from a bad one .
The prestigious Beerophile Digest , for example , will declare McChumley ’s Mauled Herring
Ale to be “ a delightful triumph of art and nature right up there with the pulsating shower head ” while the brash Xtreme Brewski Review will assert the same ale to be “ the sort of crap drank by hoity - toities who take lots of showers and stuff . ”
You do n’t have to learn a foreign language .
While a wine snob is expected to speak enough French to enrage a Frenchman , the beer snob only needs to speak enough English to infuriate an Englishman , which only requires slurring , “ Hey you remember when we saved your butts from the Germans back in Dubya Dubya Two ?
Remember that ? ”
The terminology is simple and straightforward .
For example , the guy who pours the beer is a bartender and not some snooty guy whose title looks suspiciously similar to smellier but is actually pronounced like the cry of a gardener pleasantly surprised while trying to explain the holes in your lawn : “ Some mole — yay ! ”
Enthusiasm and relish are more important than experience and research .
When it comes to rating beers , you do n’t need to be able to identify the vintage or know which field the hops were grown in .
This would just confuse you .
Neither do you need to attend mundane festivals , read a bunch of dreary books or even sample a lot of different beers .
All you need is a big helping of enthusiasm and relish , and by that I mean sarcasm and snootiness .
The Wide World of Beers
When you were a teenager you probably thought all beers were just called “ beer ” or maybe “ brewski ” if you were feeling technical .
But as a beer snob you should be aware that there are many subcategories of beers , in the same way that certain dogs are called “ Cocker Spaniels ” and “ Rat Terriers , ” and some large rats are called “ Chihuahuas . ”
ale : some purists will tell you this English brew is not really beer at all , but these are the same type of people who will tell you that drinking a case of beer in the company of your dog is not a “ kick - ass time . ”
bitter : this hoppy English stalwart is a favorite among elderly men who smoke pipes , carry change purses and will insist that Field Marshal Rommel was “ indeed crafty as a fox , but no match for this cunning English bulldog . ”
bock : this German beer is named for the billy goat , because , just like a billy goat , it ’s lively , strong and smells like a billy goat .
doppelbock : German for double billy goat .
You get the idea .
export : this is a type of beer so awful the locals refuse to drink it , so the brewery ships it off to foreigners who do n’t know any better .
fruit : these flavored beers were introduced to appeal to women and certain men who get very defensive when you inform them they are plainly homosexual .
lager : there are those who like to say this light , golden beer is served cold so as to distinguish it from urine , but the truth of the matter is urine also has a much better head .
malt liquor : some will argue this is not beer at all , but let me tell you something : if it tastes like a duck , smells like a duck and makes you walk like a duck , it is probably malt liquor .
porter : this strong beer was named for the rugged laborers who made it popular in Old England and would quite frankly drink billy goat sweat if it got them drunk .
stout : these dark , rich beers are called such because after drinking a dozen of them you will feel stout enough to wrestle all four of the cops by yourself .
trappist : this type of ale is brewed by monks noted for their skill at trapping tourists in their monastery ’s overpriced gift shops .
They changed their name from trapper to trappist in 1816 when they realized they spoke French and thus needed a fancier title .
The Three Prime Rules of Judging a Beer
1. ) Use the proper terminology
Thirty years ago the only terms you needed to express a beer ’s character were “ tastes great ” and “ less filling . ”
The microbrew explosion , however , made it necessary to invent literally hundreds of new adjectives to explain how great or non-filling a beer truly is .
Fortunately , you wo n’t have to memorize most of them because most are fake words that drunk beer experts made up on the spot and probably winced at when they saw them in print later .
What else can explain why grown men are using words like Chlorophenolic , Balling Degrees , Sparge and Kräusening to describe something that can be purchased in the form of a Party Ball ?
Brewmaster : So , what do you think of our delicious new Squashed Sulfur Beetle Stout ?
Drunk Beer Expert : S’at what this is ?
Thought I axidenally drank from the bar ’s fuckin’ soap bucket .
Brewmaster :
What was that ?
Drunk Beer Expert : I said I really dig its barzfookanzope bouquet .
Brewmaster : Oh !
And that ’s a good thing , right ?
Drunk Beer Expert : Kiddin ’ me ?
Barzfookanzope is Upper Bavarian for chlorophenolic !
Brewmaster : Oh !
And that ’s a good thing , right ?
In fact , the only terms you really need to know are nutty , worty , fruity , hoppy , grainy , mouthy , sulpheristical , pine - needley , and bodacious .
What do they mean ?
No one knows for sure .
The important thing it to use as many of them as possible when you rate a beer .
For example , you should never just say , “ This beer is worty . ”
Instead you should say , “ I find the wortiness of this beer fruity yet mouthy , with pine - needley undertones of sulpheristicallity , bodaciousamentally speaking . ”
2. ) Employ all of your senses .
If you taste a beer and think , “ Gee , that tastes good , ” do not say so .
Use every pretentious bone in your body to resist even the slightest sign of enjoyment .
Just because a beer tastes good does not mean it is good .
You must bring into play your other four senses to make a proper judgement .
Sight : Look at the beer ’s label .
If you can see little gold medals , describe the beer as “ a shining avatar lesser beers aspire to . ”
Do you see foreign words ?
If they look European , call the beer a “ traditional , old - country stalwart . ”
If the words look like the symbols used in the funny pages in place of curse words , label the beer “ an exotic wayfarer with delightful stories to tell . ”
If the label has a singing fish , dancing moose or any other sort of animal doing something an animal does not normally do , call it “ a brash upstart with a lot to prove . ”
Sound :
Have you heard anyone else talking about the beer ?
If you have , try to cover your bases by incorporating as many of these opinions into your judgement as possible : “ Yes , it ’s the one in the green bottle , but on the other hand , it goes for six bucks a sixer at the Liquorama up on Fifth Street , right across the street from the Conoco Station with the hot chick working the register . ”
Feel :
Do you feel the brewery rep standing nearby will reward a good rating with free stuff ?
If so , upgrade your evaluation according to how much free stuff you think you might get .
Thus , a merely decent beer may become “ a mind - boggling triumph , ” a bad one transforms into “ a powerful new statement ” and something that could pass as window cleaner ascends to “ a real up and comer . ”
You do n’t have to tell the rep it will be “ up and coming ” the next time you visit the rest room .
Smell :
Does the beer smell foreign , or , in beer expert parlance , skunky ?
Foreigness is a good thing because foreign countries are farther away and the farther away a brewery is the better the beer tastes .
Especially if it says Export on the label , because foreigners do n’t want to embarrass their country and thus only export the really good stuff .
3. ) When in doubt , speak in tongues .
To express an unqualified opinion of a beer is akin to waving a big flag at the enemy , so they know exactly where to shoot .
If you are unsure about the quality of a beer because you ca n’t see the label and are not sure if the rep is going to give you free stuff , you have to deliver an opinion so obtuse onlookers wo n’t know if you ’re complimenting the beer or plan on using it to poison the rats in your cellar .
Instead of saying , “ I guess it ’s sorta okay , ” you should say : “ Seems its pompitude has been finely demastered in a congenial sort of way , yet its essence disambiguates the fustification of its mischarateristics to the degree I wonder about the referentialability of the primal dewortnicity , if I may paraphrase famed beer critic Baron Von Troutenmyer . ”
It ’s hard to disagree with a man you ca n’t understand , though they might try .
If a competing beer snob tries to draw you out from behind your brilliant smokescreen by saying , “ Hate to disagree , but I think the dewortitude terrifically interpolative and fusticating with character , ” glower at him for an instant and say in a very stiff tone , “ Funny , I could have swore I just said that . ”
Another safe tactic is to compare the beer with one that does n’t actually exist .
Because the beer ranks swell every week , even the most knowledgeable of beer experts wo n’t call you out , for fear of appearing “ out of the loop . ”
So instead actually stating an opinion of a beer , say it is “ a lot like The Abandoned Shoe Factory Brewery ’s new Soothsucker Pine Sap Ale , in the sense that they ’re completely different . ”
Types of Beer Snobs
Deciding you want to be a beer snob is not enough .
You also have to decide what sort of beer snob you want to be .
The Beer Fuehrer
This curmudgeonly gentlemen will declare he would rather guzzle urine than drink what he considers “ bad beer . ”
And by bad he means any beer that comes in a can , has commercials on television , or has been heard of by more than fifty people .
He can only pity the poor fools who sit in bars drinking the swill disgorged by the vast corporate vats , when they could be drinking swill produced in much smaller ones .
The Hops Head
The power - crazed Dr. Frankenstein of beer snobs , this wretched soul has descended so deeply into the pit of snobbery he has convinced himself that the vile liquid ( he will call it something akin to Super Duper Black Cherry Berry Power Porter ) he concocted in his basement is not only non-poisonious , but superior to the stuff it took monks 50 generations to perfect .
One caveat : the longer and more grandiose the title of his obscene creation , the more likely it will be good for poisoning the rats in your cellar .
The Beer Geek
The beer world equivalent of a Trekkie , this fan is forever making pilgrimages to far flung festivals and conventions , will belong to any number of beer associations ( and wears the T - shirts to prove it ) and has never had sex with a woman where there was n’t money involved .
Beards are common and they have a powerful fetish for steins .
The Beer Lover
These are the Rex Reeds of the beer snob community .
They have never met a beer that was not “ gorgeously fabulous ” or “ fabulously gorgeous . ”
The closest they ever come to a bad review is when they mistake the glass of water used to clear the palate for beer , and even then they ’ll give it three stars and declare it “ a promising new light lager worth keeping your eye on . ”
Interacting with Other Beer Snobs
While it ’s perfectly fine and extremely pleasurable to rabidly denounce whatever swill your non-beer snob acquaintances are slopping down their gauche gullets , you must carefully weigh each word when amongst your own .
You will probably meet them at a beer club meeting .
Beer snobs are generally very eager to form beer clubs , partly to discuss new beers , but mostly because their regular friends wo n’t drink with them any more .
At these meetings members are expected to present their “ discoveries . ”
A discovery is an exciting new beer you introduce to your fellow beer snobs .
If a fellow beer snob introduces a new beer to you , however , it is not called a discovery .
It is called a travesty .
When judging another fellow ’s travesty , do n’t worry about the taste so much as to where the fellow is situated on the Beer Snob Ladder .
Those above you should be treated with grudging deference .
Those below are to be condescended to in the manner of a weary yet indulgent grown - up patting the head of a simple - minded yet well - meaning mongoloid child eager to show off yet another shiny and utterly worthless object that caught one of his unattractively bulging eyes .
You should save your vast stores of vitriol for those sharing the same rung as you , for you cannot ascend the ladder unless you plant a foot firmly upon their credibility .
When one of your rung mates foolishly encourages you to try one of his new travesties , smile agreeably , take a sip , then act as if a bug just flew into your mouth .
After letting your dismay register with the club , turn your head discreetly and spit into your handkerchief .
Subtlety is key .
Do not behave as if the bug is a giant dung beetle , but rather a common housefly that has spent the day joyfully wallowing in billy goat manure .
Deliver the coup de grace by muttering , “ Well , that was certainly interesting . ”
In the parlance of the beer snob , interesting roughly translates into “ One large step below Satan ’s venereal urine . ”
When it ’s your turn to present a discovery , be keenly aware the act is the beer snob equivalent of wagging your testicles between the bars of the Mongoose Cage at feeding time .
Rivals will do their level best to defame and discredit you , which is why you must immediately distance yourself as far from your discovery as possible .
Act as if it were a hideously deformed orphan you found wandering the streets and , out of the goodness of your heart , are just trying to make a few introductions so he can possibly secure a future position as grave digger or bell ringer .
Make sure you damn it to the degree that any response at all will seem unmitigated praise .
Then , once you get a fingerhold , start suggesting that your orphan might not only be suitable for a grave digger position , but the head grave digger position .
You : “ Do n’t be alarmed .
It may seem a horrid wretch , but given a chance it might just reveal itself as being merely disgusting . ”
Rival Beer Snob : “ Well , you ’re dead on about its horridly disgusting wretchedness , but I once ate a large beetle that tasted only slightly better . ”
You : “ Funny you should say that !
Because noted beer expert Sir Edward Edwardsbottom declared this very beer to have the potential of an especially large and ambitious dung beetle . ”
Rival Beer Snob : “ Dung beetle , yes , that makes sense , I — ”
You : “ Do you really think it that ambitious and promising ?
I must say , there is something rather large and bombastic about it .
Why , you ’ve given me a new appreciation of this bold brew .
Though perhaps not as enthusiastic as you , I think it may be a real up and comer ! ”

I am a millionaire " , a jury has been told .
Wigan Athletic striker Marlon King , 29 , also " sexually touched " the woman , 20 , London 's Southwark Crown Court heard .
The attack in a Soho bar after she had rejected his advances was a piece of " gratuitous " violence , jurors heard .
Mr King , a married father - of - three , denies sexual assault by touching and causing actual bodily harm .
The woman , who cannot be named for legal reasons , was injured by Mr King at the Soho Revue Bar in December , the court was told .
Marlon King took one step backward and smashed her in the face with a clenched fist
Roger Daniells - Smith , prosecuting
On the night of the incident , she had been with a group of " sporty type " friends .
Another footballer and sports journalist were also there , but Mr King was not part of the group .
Describing the alleged touching by the accused , Roger Daniells - Smith , prosecuting , said : " They were complete strangers to each other .
" It was not an accidental brushing or innocent contact that occasionally happens in crowded bars .
This was deliberate and sexual . "
The woman responded by saying : " Do n't do that , it 's not nice .
Do n't touch me . "
Women ' recoiled '
Mr King then turned his attention to other women in the party , the court heard .
Mr Daniells - Smith said : " They , too , recoiled from his touching them and told him very clearly to stop behaving in this manner . "
The prosecution alleges that Mr King simply turned his attention back to the eventual victim .
Describing that exchange , Mr Daniells - Smith said that Mr King began : " Do n't you know who I am ?
I 'm a millionaire . "
The court heard that his alleged victim replied by saying : " I do n't care who you are , take your millionaire self away from our table " .
He was given further warnings but continued to stroke the woman's hair and then allegedly told her that she was not in his league .
After she pushed him in the chest , Mr King responded with the punch , the court was told .
Mr Daniells - Smith said : " At that moment Marlon King took one step backward and smashed her in the face with a clenched fist .
He broke her nose with the blow .
" It was a completely gratuitous piece of violence against a slightly - built female .
" It was unprovoked and could not have been an act of lawful self - defence . "
Mr King , on loan at Hull City at the time , claims he has been mistakenly identified as the assailant .
The trial continues .

How - To Microsoft Releases Free SyncToy 2.1 By
Late yesterday , Microsoft released a new version of its Freeware SyncToy utility – version 2.1 ( build 2.1.0.0 ) for Windows XP , Windows Vista , and Windows 7 .
Both 32 - bit and 64 - bit versions are available for free download .
The latest release includes significant upgrades which should be able to meet all your PC “ sync ” needs .
I downloaded the tool and had it up and running and syncing a few of my folders in just a few minutes .
It looks like I ’ll be needing to re-think my whole Robocopy system backup workflow .
In taking a look at the tool , things are very straightforward .
After install , you will be presented with the option to Create a new Folder Pair .
Although an SYNC can operate in both directions , all one - way syncs will be done LEFT to RIGHT .
Keep this in mind as you create your Folder Pairs .
Once you create your Pair , you will need to decide what type of sync you want to create .
When selected , each of the options Synchronize , Echo , and Contribute will give you a short explanation as shown above , but the Synchronize is a FULL sync between both folders .
Echo will sync all changes from the Left folder to the Right folder ( including renames , new files , and deletes ) and Contribute is the same as Echo .
However , deletes on the Left will not sync to the right .
After you choose a sync type and name your new folder pair , the main menu will return where you can run the sync for the first time or modify additional settings to customize the sync .
Like I said earlier , the new SyncToy interface is simple to use and very intuitive .
I highly recommend this tool to our groovyReaders since it offers several different options for syncing data – both locally and to network shares !
Too bad Microsoft did n’t bundle this with their latest OS Windows 7 …
For existing SyncToy users , here ’s the list of Bug Fixes and Improvements included with SyncToy 2.1
SyncToy2.1 is powered by the latest synchronization engine from Microsoft Sync Framework 2.0 and provides better performance and robustness .
The new features and improvements included in SyncToy 2.1 release are : Better Performance :
The speed of file copy operations is significantly increased across the board .
Improved Robustness : Much more resilient to transient network and file system errors and better error reporting which pin-points which file the sync failed on in case there ’s a fatal error that stops the sync .
Folder pair configuration backup : Folder pair configuration is automatically backed up under %localappdata%microsoftsynctoy2.0 .
User can replace SyncToyDirPairs.bin with the backup copy to resolve last saved configuration .
Bug Fixes : Fixed the data corruption issue when using SyncToy with NAS drives .
Fixed the issue that prevented uploading files to SharePoint when using SyncToy 2.0 .
Fixed the issue that prevented delete changes from being synchronized when the sync option is set to “ Echo ” .
Fixed the UI issue where reported file time were off by the difference between local time and UTC when destination is a FAT volume .
The major new features and improvements included in previous SyncToy 2.0 release are : Dynamic Drive Letter Assignment : Drive letter reassignment will now be detected and updated in the folder pair definition .
True Folder Sync : Folder creates , renames and deletes are now synchronized for all SyncToy actions .
Exclusion Filtering Based on Name : File exclusion based on name with exact or fuzzy matching .
Filtering Based on File Attributes :
The ability to exclude files based on one or more file attributes ( Read - Only , System , Hidden ) .
Unattended Folder Pair Execution : Addressed issues related to running scheduled folder pairs while logged off .
Folder Pairs With Shared Endpoints : Ability for folder pairs associated with the same or different instances of SyncToy to share end - points .
Command line enhancements :
Added the ability to manage folder pairs via the command line interface .
Re-Architect Sync Engine : The SyncToy engine has been rearchitected to provide scalability and the ability to add significant enhancements in future releases .
Sync engine is also more robust insomuch that many single , file level errors are skipped without affecting the entire sync operation .
Sync Encrypted Files : Sync of Encrypted files works when local folder and files are encrypted , which addresses the common scenario involving sync between local , encrypted laptop PC folder and remote , unencrypted desktop PC folder .
64 - Bit Support : SyncToy now has a native 64 - bit build ( x64 only ) for 64 - bit versions of Windows .
Folder pair rename
Sub - folder Exclusion Enhancements : Descendents created under excluded sub - folders are automatically excluded .
Usability improvements for the sub - folder exclusion dialog .
Folder Pair Metadata Moved : Folder pair metadata removed from MyDocuments to resolve any issues with server - based folder pair re-direction setup .
Setup Improvements : Integrated setup with single self - extracting archive file and no extra downloads if you already have .
NET Framework 2.0 installed .
Enabled silent install for the SyncToy Installer file ( see readme. txt file for more information ) .

Here 's a poser : Suppose a public official is accused of recommending his girlfriend for a promotion , though he was the one who first flagged the potential conflict of interest and officials had refused to let him recuse himself from decisions about the woman .
Should he lose his job ?
That 's precisely what happened in 2007 to Paul Wolfowitz , who was run out of the World Bank on the pretext that he had given his girlfriend a raise .
In fact , Mr. Wolfowitz had made bank officials aware that his girlfriend ...

The film dips in and out of the lives of the various residents at Kennedy ’s hotel , and at one point accompanies a couple of his campaign staff on a journey into LSD - land .
Which just goes to show that you should never open a wardrobe just in your underpants – Nixon might be in there …
19 : A Very Brady Sequel ( 1996 )
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins , “ Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom , justice and peace in the world … ”
Just pause for a moment to consider this .
The recognition of everyone ’s dignity .
Everyone has equal rights .
And this , just this , is the “ foundation of freedom , justice , and peace . ”
Sounds simple , right ?
On paper , these words make sense and I ’m sure few would disagree with them .
But look around you , and you ’ll see that plenty of messages abound that fail to recognize the dignity that we all have within us or that fail to give us full rights .
Take , for example , children ’s toys .
A simple walk into a large toy store tells you that boys have the “ right ” to play with certain toys and girls with others .
And it is NOT “ right ” if they play with each other ’s toys .
Even if they want to , someone is bound to tell them it ’s wrong , whether it ’s a peer making fun of the boy with the doll or a grandparent telling a granddaughter that trains are only for boys .
What happens , in these small moments , to the dignity of that boy and girl ?
Slowly , in a split second , it is diminished .
Perhaps only a bit , but it is diminished .
And their rights ?
They too , are narrowed .
That boy has his right to play with dolls called into question .
Similarly , the girl ’s right to play with trains is called into question .
While that may seem minor , it is the underlying message that is troubling .
And these are not just messages sent by misguided friends and relatives .
These are messages that bombard us and our young ones everyday , from every direction .
Messages that do n’t just say “ you ca n’t play with dolls , ” if you ’re a boy , but that say “ you are not a nurturer ; you are not a caretaker . ”
Or “ you are not an engineer ; you cannot create and build . ”
These bigger messages cut away the core of children ’s human rights – the right to have wide - open futures .
The right to explore all areas of life , to develop their own passions , regardless of the social pressures placed upon them .
Returning to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights :
When we deny children these rights of self - expression , exploration , individuality , we deny ourselves and our society freedom , justice , and peace .
When you think of it like that , the simple boxing in of our children or denying them certain avenues in their play sounds profound .
And it is .
And it ’s time that more of us pay heed and think twice before we cut away at freedom , justice , and peace .

BlackBerry users were left without e-mail on their handsets for more than nine hours late Tuesday -- the second time the service has been interrupted in a week -- leading some analysts to question whether customers might begin canceling .
During the interruption , message delivery was delayed or intermittent in North and South America .
But phone and text services were unaffected .
The root cause for why the popular wireless e-mail service went under is “ currently under review , ” according to a statement by Research in Motion , the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry .
The company , known as RIM , believes the issue stemmed from a flaw in two recently released versions of BlackBerry Messenger .
“ RIM has taken corrective action to restore service , ” the company said .
“ RIM has also provided a new version of BlackBerry Messenger ( version 5.0.0.57 ) and is encouraging anyone who downloaded or upgraded BlackBerry Messenger since December 14th to upgrade to this latest version which resolves the issue . “
The company said it is continuing to monitor its systems to maintain normal service levels , and apologized to its customers .
Although RIM promised to keep a close eye on things , it did n't stop BlackBerry users from blasting the company on social networking sites like Twitter .
“ Oh @blackberry how I loathe thee ...
My internet is still not working so ... BOO ! ” read one tweet .
Another suggested a change of service altogether : “ I might just have to switch from a blackberry to iphone .
I hate to say it . ”
This is heresy to many BlackBerry users , said Jeff Kagan , a telecommunications analyst .
RIM has developed a “ cult - like following ” with its customers .
After all , many customers refer to their phones as CrackBerrys .
“ I do n't see customers canceling service yet , but if outages continue that may start to happen , ” Kagan said .
“ Every year or two RIM suffers an outage .
So far it has n’t hurt them too bad .
But each time the company gets a black eye , but it has a chance to heal before the next black eye . "
RIM experienced major outages in April 2007 and February 2008 .
And just last Thursday , BlackBerry customers in North America experienced e-mail delays .
“ This is the second outage in a few weeks , ” Kagan said .
“ Customers listened to reports of the first and put a notch in their mind .
Now there is a second outage and customers put another notch in the mind and pay more attention . ”

TMZ is milking the Carrie Prejean sex tape revelation , releasing a few details at a time .
The latest snippet relates what happened when the Miss California USA lawyers allegedly showed it to her :
" When the video started playing , Carrie 's first reaction was ' that 's disgusting ' … and Carrie denied it was her .
Then , the camera angle changed … and panned up to her face .
She was caught red - handed … so to speak .
Carrie was rendered speechless and immediately began talking with her lawyer .
We 're told it took about 15 seconds for Carrie to drop her $ 1 million dollar demand . "
In Chapter 10 , Declaring Types and Classes , Dr. Meijer teaches us about type declarations , data declarations , arithmetic expressions , etc .
In Haskell , a new name for an existing type can be defined using a
type declaration :
type String = [ Char ]
String is a synonym for the type [ Char ] .
Like function definitions , type declarations can also have parameters .
Type declarations can be nested , but
not recursive .
Nested :
type Pos = ( Int , Int )
type Trans = Pos ->
Pos
Illegal recursion :
type Tree = ( Int , [ Tree ] )
A completely new type can be defined by specifying its values using a data declaration :
data Bool = False | True
Bool is a new type , with two new values False and True .

Wow , the title of this post is a mouthful !
If you can think of an easier name for these cupcakes , just let me know !
These cupcakes were created for November ’s Cupcake Hero challenge ingredient , peanut butter .
I ’ve already entered one cupcake into the competition this month , but I just love peanut butter so there was no way I could only enter just one .
My second entry is a chocolate cupcake with chocolate chips and finely chopped crispy bacon baked inside .
It is frosted with peanut butter frosting , sprinkled with finely chopped toffee and topped off with a square of crispy bacon .
They were so yummy !
People laughed at me when I told them of my plan to make these cupcakes , but I ’m going to laugh right back at them when I tell them how good these are !
Bacon has been a controversial , yet popular , ingredient in cupcakes these days , and I understand why .
Despite the fact that bacon combined with sweets is a little odd , it does make a great pairing of flavors .
Check out my dark chocolate bacon cupcakes , too .
If you ’re interested in these cupcakes , but would like to skip on the bacon , I have a perfect solution .
Omit all the bacon and just roll the tops of the frosted cupcakes in crushed toffee !
Equally yummy !
The only problem I see with this particular cupcake recipe is that the batter is very runny , meaning that a lot of the bacon and chocolate chips will sink to the bottom .
If you make these , I might suggest picking a chocolate cupcake recipe that produces a thicker batter so the mix-ins wo n’t sink as easily .

It barely received any coverage in the news , and the financial wizards in front of the TV cameras are n't even paying attention to it .
The FDIC recently proposed that its 8,000 member banks pay their next three years ' worth of deposit premiums now to help fund the FDIC 's ability to keep shutting down banks in trouble .
This past year , while the number of foreclosures has been higher than experts desire , it 's important to note that this is the lull in the storm .
We already knew two years ago that this would be a lull , when Credit Suisse issued their report on the state of the banking industry , which 60 minutes finally noticed a year later , one month after the “ official ” start of the crisis .
Now , however , the number of foreclosures has started increasing , and it will continue to increase until the end of 2011 , at which point the number of foreclosures , and troubled banks , will reach another peak like they did in 2008 .
Source : 60 Minutes Source : 60 Minutes
This raises a question : if the FDIC raises the money now and spends it to shut down banks currently in trouble , what cash will they use in 2011 , when those funds are all used up , and banks are falling like dominoes ?
Two possibilities exist .
First , they could simply try to raise more advance premiums from the banks .
However , by that time , the balance sheets are going to look a lot worse .
Another large hit in the form of deposit premiums will not be a realistic option .
Second , they could once again turn their eyes to the Federal Reserve to create more cash out of thin air .
That wo n't be realistic either .
The problem is that the Fed have already played that card , and the world trembled .
The card already lies on the table to the tune of trillions of dollars .
The result is that the dollar 's value compared to other fiat currencies has fallen precipitously .
The US Dollar index , a measure of the dollar 's strength against the euro , the Japanese yen , the pound sterling , the Canadian dollar , the Swedish krona , and the Swiss franc , which a year ago measured in the range of 85 to 90 , today is in the mid-70s .
This means that the dollar lost roughly 10 - 15 % of its value compared to the other , very weak fiat currencies of the world over the past year , as a direct result of the Fed 's actions .
The record is even worse when examined over the past eight years , because the dollar has lost almost 40 % of its value compared to foreign fiat money during that time .
If the Fed tries to play another card just like last year 's bailout card , it would likely leave the dollar in tatters , setting the stage for the removal of the dollar as a world reserve currency .
It 's difficult to make clear to Americans how damaging this will be to the American economy .
Once the Chinese the Japanese , the Europeans , the Middle Eastern sheiks , and the other holders of dollars around the world regard the dollar as no longer worthy of its exalted status , they 'll start dumping it .
In fact , there are rumors that they already have started .
All it takes is for all those dollars to start getting spent in the economy , and hyperinflation will fall upon us .
Instead , the Fed , the U.S. Treasury , and the other princes of financial darkness assure us that the economy is recovering and that all will be well eventually .
Even the media seem to buy this line , only fretting about the continuing high levels of unemployment in the 10 % range .
They conclude that the economy will recover , but the recovery will be slow because so many people are out of work .
This disconnect between rhetoric and reality is disconcerting at best and intentionally deceitful at worst .
The FDIC 's proposal to collect three years ' deposit premiums in advance is tantamount to confessing they can't continue to bailout the banks , even after all the newly minted money that 's been lavished on them .
In essence , the banks and the regulators are caught between a rock and a hard place , knowing full well that things are going to grow progressively worse over the next two years .
When the crisis peaks again , this time in 2011 , they will not be able to again bail out the already weakened banking system .
The voters have already made clear that they opposed the recent bailout .
There are no more bailout cards to play .
What will the powers - that - be do when the spam hits the fan ?
I shudder to think about it .

The return of terrorism to the US -- it really does n't matter that the attempt to blow up a DC - bound flight actually failed -- is bringing us very close to the days of the so - called " war on terror " .
Though the term has been banished by the Obama White House ( and thus by extension the mainstream media outside of Fox News ) , tonight the New York Times is actually talking about the US widening the terror war , this time to Yemen , where Al - Qaeda remains strong .
In the midst of two unfinished major wars , the United States has quietly opened a third , largely covert front against Al Qaeda in Yemen .
A year ago , the Central Intelligence Agency sent many field operatives with counterterrorism experience to the country , according a former top agency official .
At the same time , some of the most secretive Special Operations commandos have begun training Yemeni security forces in counterterrorism tactics , senior military officers said .
Immediately after 9/11 , everyone knew that the center of the terror world was Afghanistan , even if it took some time to put the pieces of the world together .
While Afghanistan is a total mess , we 're pretty sure that there are few forces in the country organized to pull off an attack on US soil .
But this time , after the Detroit attack , Yemen was the first country that was identified .
The enemy is scattered and disorgnized in one place , and yet organized and capable of attacking ( kind of ) in another .

The ancient Mayan city of Tikal , located in present - day Guatemala , has structures that date as far back as 400 BCE , though most of the structures were built in the Late Classic Period ( 600 – 900 CE ) .
One of the largest urban centers of the pre-Colombian Mayan civilization , the city was at its peak at around 700 CE .
Tikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and the ruins include five large pyramid temples , a large palace , small pyramids , tombs , and numerous other buildings with a grand total of 3,000 structures .
The University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala have contributed to the restorations done on the site in recent years .
Travelers can find a variety of accommodations in the nearby cities of Flores and Guatemala City .
Fans of the original Star Wars films may know Tikal as the “ Massassi Outpost on the fourth moon of Yavin ” from Episode IV : A New Hope .

MOSCOW , Russia —
Bank robbers have threatened tellers with knives , shot their way into banks and tunnelled up into vaults .
But one woman in southern Russia chose a more peaceful method : Police say Galina Korzhova hypnotised a bank teller into handing over tens of thousands of dollars in what is believed to be just one in a series of daring , if non-violent , bank robberies .
Galina Korzhova was arrested , said Anton Kornoukhov , a spokesman for police in the southern city of Volgograd , on suspicion of hypnotising a bank teller in the nearby town of Volzhky into giving her more than $ 80,000 .
She is suspected of having robbed up to 30 additional banks in what Russian media have called a " grand tour " around the country .
“ She met the woman on the street , saying that she would remove curses and help cure sick relatives , ” said Kornoukhov in a telephone interview .
Korzhova is accused of telling the bank employee , whose name has not been released , to put the money into a plastic bag and meet her outside the state bank Sberbank , on Communist Street in the small town .
There , the case goes , the teller gave Korzhova the money .
The robber took off with 30,000 euros , $ 20,000 and the rest in rubles for a total of 2.6 million rubles or $ 81,000 , police said .
The teller only realised what she had done a couple of hours later and told her bosses at the bank what had happened .
Strangely enough there is a well - known tale of a Sberbank teller being hypnotised on longtime Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ’s orders .
Wolfgang Messing was a German Jew who escaped to the Soviet Union from the Nazi Germany after he predicted Adolf Hitler 's regime would collapse .
Messing was said to be Stalin ’s personal psychic and claimed that he hypnotised a teller to hand over 100,000 rubles as an experiment on Stalin ’s orders .
The Soviet secret police later gave the money back — the teller had a heart attack when he heard how he had been tricked .
Police say that Korzhova is a " tsiganka , " or Roma .
Police , who are often criticized for racial profiling , say this type of crime is most often perpetrated by Roma who are traditionally involved in fortune telling and are often seen begging in Russia .
The Roma , or Gypsies , are nomadic people who live throughout Europe .
Human rights groups say they are severely discriminated against in Russia and that police routinely assume their guilt and harass them .
Russian police say that hypnotism is not widespread but is not uncommon .
It is usually limited to street crimes and does not reach the level of bank robbery .
In 2003 , Yulia Shestakovich , an Olympic synchronised swimmer , said she was hypnotized on the streets of Moscow , after which she took two strange women to her flat and handed over cash and jewelry worth $ 19,000 .
Shestakovich said at the time that she had no memory of what happened — a woman asked her the time and she woke up two hours later .
Another victim said that she was told that if she gave away all her money then a curse would be lifted from her .
“ It happens a lot , ” said Yevgeny Vishenkov , a former police investigator and deputy head of the Agency of Journalistic Investigations , saying he saw hypnotism used when he was working as a policeman in St. Petersburg in the 1980s .
It happened “ not only in Soviet times but before 1917 , ” in Czarist Russia , he said .
One of his colleagues was even hypnotised , recalled Vishenkov , after he arrested a man for possessing hashish .
After leaving his colleague to interrogate the subject , Vishenkov returned to find the suspect leaving after hypnotising the younger policeman , who had given back the hash and let him go .
Vishenkov promptly arrested the man again and found the marijuana in his sock .
“ We at first thought that he had bribed his way out but he had no money and he had hypnotised [ the officer ] by telling stories and singing songs , ” said Vishenkov .
But Vyshenkov said he had one surefire method to keep himself from being hypnotised : “ I tell them to shut their mouth . ”
In 1976 , David Bowie famously told us that " Rock has always been the devil 's music . "
I enjoy hearing about the real or rumored occult influences on rock and roll , and famous musicians ' interests in the " dark arts . "
Gary Lachman 's " Turn Off Your Mind " and Erik Davis 's book on Led Zeppelin IV are fun reads on the subject .
Greg Taylor , who edits the terrific Daily Grail site , wrote his own engaging essay on the roots of " Occult Rock , " from Robert Johnson and the Rolling Stones to Led Zeppelin , Bowie , and Tool .
The piece , titled " Occult Rock , " appeared in the second volume of Greg 's journal of weirdness , Darklore .
From Greg 's essay , now readable online :
There is no doubting … that The Thin White Duke ( Bowie ) was consumed by occult ideas during the '70s .
He was said to have been interested in scrying with crystal balls , and experimented in contacting the Spirit World via an Ouija Board .
He later warned a journalist against ever using one : " Do n 't …
It can mess you up , especially if you 're taking drugs . "
( Peter ) Koenig documents further gossip surrounding Bowie 's alleged descent into occult madness : Rumor has it that Bowie kept his hair and fingernail clippings in the fridge of Michael Lippman 's home where he was living then , so they could not fall into the hands of those he thought wished to put spells on him .
Bowie constructed an altar in the living room and he graced the walls with various magick symbols which he handpainted .
Candles burned around the clock , he regularly performed banishing rituals , and he protected his friends by drawing sigils on their hands .
The seventeen - year - old Cameron Crowe allegedly found a stirred - up Bowie burning black candles against an aborted magical ritual during the LA period .
Eventually Crowe published several narratives in Rolling Stone and Playboy of Bowie drawing black magick symbols , seeing disembodied beings , thinking he was the Messiah , keeping bottles of his urine in the fridge …
Occult themes can also be found in Bowie 's music : his 1971 song " Quicksand " begins with the lines " I 'm closer to the Golden Dawn , Immersed in Crowley 's uniform , of imagery " .
On Station to Station ( 1976 ) he references the Kabbalah in the title track with the line " one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth " , talks of " flashing no colour " ( part of the Eastern occult Tattva system ) , and also makes a sly tip of the hat to Aleister Crowley 's book of pornographic poems White Stains in the very last line of the song .
The album 's art ( at least on the CD version ) also includes a picture of Bowie sketching the Kabbalistic Tree of Life on the floor .

Confirmed : Moleskine notebooks contain PVC or other chlorinated plastics .
Do not laser cut them for your safety and the safety of your laser cutter .
Adam brought his laptop in to etch today .
As we all know , laser cutting PVC is bad and releases chlorine gas ( which is corrosive and bad for you and your machine . )
Adam ’s laptop was made of an unknown polymer , and we wanted to make sure we did n’t damage our new lazzzor .
Luckily , there is an easy way to determine if a plastic is okay to etch .
Watch the video below , and check out this guide to polymer identification for full details .
There is actually a suite of tests you use to determine the type of plastic , but the burning one is the most fun , as well as the one that detects chlorine .

New Year Financial Resolution : Refinance
Image by psd via Flickr
Another year is drawing to a close , and that means it ’s resolution time !
Many people tire of making resolutions that they will not keep , but the good news is that you can actually make at least one financial resolution that is relatively easy to accomplish : Refinance your home .
Even though mortgage rates are starting to creep up a bit , the fact of the matter is that they are lower than they have been for years .
Mortgage rates are still near historic lows , and that can mean that you might be able to refinance to a lower rate — and lower your home mortgage payment .
( The rule of thumb is that you should refinance if rates are at least 1 % lower than you are paying right now . )
This can save you money right now , and it can also save you money in the future , since a lower mortgage rate means you pay less in interest overall .
But you have to be smart about your refinance .
Things to consider when you refinance your home
The problem many people run into when they refinance their homes is that they either lengthen the loan term or they get a “ cash out ” refinance .
Both of these options can be more costly in the long term .
If you plan to refinance your home , consider taking these steps to ensure that you really are improving your financial situation through a refinance :
Do not cash out :
If you are one of the few people left in this country with a significant amount of equity in your home , do not cash out .
Many mortgage lenders will try to get you take out a little cash for vacation or to pay off credit card debt .
This can be tempting if you owe $ 150,000 on your home , but have $ 200,000 in equity .
You can refinance $ 180,000 , and end up with $ 30,000 cash .
But you will have to pay it back .
And if you use it to pay of your credit cards , you ’ve just taken unsecured debt and secured it with your home .
And do you really want to be paying off that vacation ( with interest ) for the next 15 to 30 years ?
Do not extend your loan term :
If you have only 15 or 20 years on your mortgage loan , do n’t extend it out to 30 again when you refinance to a lower interest rate .
Instead , get a 15 or 20 year loan .
You might even find that you get a still - lower interest rate for the shorter term .
Unless you have run into some sort of financial trouble ( like a job loss or some sort of medical catastrophe ) , try to avoid extending your loan term .
Refinancing to a lower term , at a lower rate , will save you more .
Remember the tax advantages :
In some cases , if you pay points when you refinance , you can get tax advantages .
Additionally , you will still get a mortgage interest rate deduction after you refinance .
In the end , refinancing is really about your individual situation .
You should carefully consider your options , and decide how you can best help your situation and improve your finances .
You might even consider consulting with a financial professional ( since I ’m not one ) .
With a new year coming , it is a good time to review your financial situation , and decide whether or not you will be well - served by setting a goal to refinance your home before rates start moving significantly higher .

In 1978 local postman Dave Morris worked alongside London Greenpeace activists in protests against nuclear power .
By 1982 he had started attending the group 's meetings .
London Greenpeace campaigned on a wide range of issues from nuclear power and Third World Debt to anti-traffic actions and the Miners Strike .
In the mid 1980 's the group began a campaign focusing on McDonald 's as a high profile organisation symbolising everything they considered wrong with the prevailing corporate mentality .
In 1985 they launched the International Day of Action Against McDonald 's , which has been held on October 16th ever since .
In 1986 they produced a 6 - sided factsheet called ' What 's Wrong With McDonald's ?
- Everything they do n't want you to know ' .
The leaflet attacked almost all aspects of the corporation 's business , accusing them of exploiting children with advertising , promoting an unhealthy diet , exploiting their staff and being responsible for environmental damage and ill treatment of animals .
But the group also continued with other campaigns , and in 1987 , 21 - year old gardener Helen Steel went along to meetings to get involved with protests in support of Aboriginal land rights at the time of the re-enactment of the First Fleet sailing to Australia .
Meanwhile , McDonald 's were busily suing ( or threatening to sue ) almost everyone who criticised them - from the BBC and The Guardian to student unions and green groups .
They appeared to ignore the London Greenpeace campaign , and instead threatened a food cooperative called ' Veggies ' in Nottingham , who were distributing the same leaflet .
McDonald 's then made an agreement with Veggies , accepting the circulation of the leaflet with some minor amendments to a couple of sections only .
The company did n't even complain about the majority of the leaflet .
Veggies continued distributing the leaflets in bulk .
In 1989 , as the campaign grew and was taken up by more and more groups around the world , McDonald 's produced their own ' McFact cards ' detailing their position on many of the accusations made in the leaflet .
They also decided to take extreme action against London Greenpeace .
McDonald 's hired two firms of private investigators and instructed them to infiltrate the group in order to find out how they operated , who did what and , most importantly , who was responsible for the production and distribution of the leaflet .
Since London Greenpeace was an unincorporated association , if McDonald 's wanted to bring legal action to stop the campaign it would have to be against named individuals - which meant the company needed to find out people 's names and addresses .
Seven spies in total infiltrated the group .
They followed people home , took letters sent to the group , got fully involved in the activities ( including giving out anti-McDonald 's leaflets ) and invented spurious reasons to find out people 's addresses .
One spy ( Michelle Hooker ) even had a 6 - month love affair with one of the activists .
Another , Allan Claire broke into the office of London Greenpeace and took a series of photographs .
At some London Greenpeace meetings there were as many spies as campaigners present and , as McDonald 's did n't tell each agency about the other , the spies were busily spying on each other ( the court later heard how Allan Claire , had noted the behaviour of Brian Bishop , another spy , as ' suspicious ' ) .
Not all the spies were unaffected by the experience : Fran Tiller ' felt very uncomfortable ' doing the job and ' disliked the deception , prying on people and interfering with their lives ' .
She later gave evidence for the defendants in the trial , stating ' I did n't think there was anything wrong with what the group was doing ' and ' I believe people are entitled to their views ' .
In 1990 McDonald 's served libel writs on 5 volunteers in the group over the ' What 's Wrong With McDonald's ? ' leaflet .
They offered a stark choice : retract the allegations made in the leaflet and apologise , or go to court .
There is no Legal Aid ( public money ) for libel cases , but the five did get two hours free legal advice .
Which boiled down to : the legal procedures in libel are extremely complex and weighted against defendants , you 'll incur huge costs , with no money or legal experience you 'll have no chance against McDonald 's legal team , you probably wo n't even get past the legal obstacles before the full trial .
In short : back out and apologise while you 've got the chance .
One of the barristers that they met at this time , Keir Starmer , said that if they decide to fight he will back them up for free .
Three of the five took the advice and reluctantly apologised .
Which left Steel and Morris .
Dave 's partner and his very young son had had a bad accident and he was nursing them single - handed ( he and his partner later split up and Dave became a full - time single father ) .
He said he would go along with whatever Helen decided .
" It just really stuck in the throat to apologise to McDonald's .
I thought it was them that should have been apologising to us - well not us specifically , but to society for the damage they do to society and the environment " - Helen Steel .
Unlike anyone McDonald 's had ever sued for libel before , Helen and Dave decided that they would stand up to the burger giants in court .
They knew each other well from their involvement in community based campaigns in their local North London neighbourhood and felt that although the odds were stacked against them , people would rally round to ensure that McDonald 's would n't succeed in silencing their critics .
Long before you get to trial , there are an enormous number of preliminary hearings and procedures that have to be completed .
First , Helen and Dave had to prepare their Defence - a detailed response to McDonald 's Statement of Claim .
Then there are several rounds of ' Further and Better Particulars of Justification and Fair Comment ' to complete .
Meanwhile , the McLibel Support Campaign was set up to generate solidarity and financial support for Helen and Dave .
Over the next few years they would raise more than £ 35,000 to pay for witness airfares , court costs , expenses and so on - every penny coming from donations from the public .
Helen and Dave would only claim some travel and administration expenses ( photocopying , phone calls to witnesses etc ) - they were determined that they would never take a penny for themselves .
In 1991 the defendants took the British government to the European Court of Human Rights to demand the right to legal aid or the simplification of libel procedures .
Paradoxically , the court ruled that , as the defendants had put up a " tenacious defence " , they could not say they were being denied access to justice .
They lost the application .
Meanwhile , back in the UK High Court , legal battles were raging between the two sides over McDonald 's refusal to disclose all the relevant documents in its possession .
McDonald 's barrister argued that the defence case was very weak , that Helen and Dave would not be able to produce evidence to support it , so large parts of it should be dismissed and therefore there was no need for McDonald 's to hand over the documents .
The Judge overturned normal procedures ( whereby documents are disclosed before exchange of witness statements ) and ruled that the defendants had three weeks to produce witness statements .
To everyone 's surprise , Helen and Dave came back with sixty five statements .
McDonald 's then took the unusual step of bringing in a top lawyer at this pre-trial stage : employing Richard Rampton QC , one of Britain 's top libel lawyers for a reputed fee of £ 2000 a day plus a 6 - figure briefing fee .
Their legal team now comprised Rampton , his junior barrister , solicitor Patti Brinley - Codd , at least five solicitors and assistants from leading city law firm Barlow , Lyde and Gilbert and even someone to carry Rampton 's files .
Helen and Dave were representing themselves , with occasional back - up from Keir Starmer .
At this time Mr Justice Bell , who untimately presided over the full McLibel trial , took over the pre-trial hearings .
Undaunted by events in court , on 16th October 1993 the McLibel Support Campaign organised a National March Against McDonald's .
About 500 protesters marched through Central London in support of the right to criticise multinationals and to demonstrate their anger at McDonald 's activities both in and out of court .
Pickets also took place outside many of McDonald 's stores around the country .
In late 1993 Richard Rampton started to prove why he is paid so much money .
He applied for the trial to be heard by a judge only , arguing that the scientific evidence necessary to examine the links between diet and disease are too complicated for the ordinary people of a jury to understand .
This was despite the obvious fact that the defendants themselves are ordinary people with no scientific training .
The judge ruled in favour of McDonald 's saying that it would be too complex for lay people to adjudicate some of the issues , and it could be tried more ' conveniently ' without a jury .
The trial would now be heard by a single judge : a major blow to the defendants as it is very likely that a jury would be more sympathetic .
They may even have been outraged that the case was ever brought at all .
McDonald 's also applied for an order striking out certain parts of the Defence on the grounds that the witness statements gathered by the defendants did not sufficiently support those areas of the defence .
The judge agreed to strike out the entire rainforest section and many of the pleadings relating to Trade Union disputes in other countries around the world .
Dave Morris and Helen Steel applied unsuccessfully to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords to reinstate the jury .
However , in a landmark legal decision , the Court of Appeal restored all parts of the defence struck out by the Judge , on the basis that the defendants are entitled to rely not only on their own witnesses ' statements , but also those from McDonald 's witnesses , the future discovery of McDonald 's documents and on what they might reasonably expect to discover under cross-examination of the company 's witnesses .
Steel and Morris prepared to prove that the statements in the allegedly libellous leaflet were true or fair comment .
Defendants are required under British libel law to provide ' primary sources ' of evidence to substantiate their case .
This means witness statements and documentary proof rather than press reports , common knowledge or even scientific journals .
Just before the trial proper was due to start , in March 1994 , McDonald 's produced 300,000 copies of a leaflet to distribute to their customers via their burger outlets .
The leaflet stated that " This action is not about freedom of speech ; it is about the right to stop people telling lies . " .
The company also issued press releases in a similar vein .
In a neat legal move , Helen and Dave issued a counter claim against McDonald 's over the accusation that the company 's critics ( including them ) are liars .
This meant that , as well as the defendants having to prove that the criticisms made in the ' What 's Wrong With McDonald 's ' leaflet are true , McDonald 's would now have to prove they are false ( and that the defendants knew they were false ) if they wanted to win the counterclaim .
As it turned out , however , the Judge did not run the trial in this way .
June 28th 1994 and the full libel trial finally started in Court 35 of the Royal Courts of Justice , London .
It was presided over by Mr Justice Bell , a new Judge with almost no experience of libel .
The first witness was Paul Preston , McDonald 's UK President ( " Mr Big Mac , if you like " ) .
Born in Ohio , Preston joined McDonald 's at age 16 .
In 1974 he came to Britain to manage the first UK McDonald 's Burger Bar in Woolwich , south London .
He has often been quoted as saying : " McDonald 's is n't a job , it 's a life " and that " McDonald 's employees have ketchup in their veins . "
The contested allegations made in the leaflet can be divided into seven broad categories : nutrition , rainforests , recycling and waste , employment , food poisoning , animals and publication ( ie did Steel and Morris publish the leaflet ) .
The witnesses did not appear in order of these issues , though , although generally the trial progressed with first the Plaintiffs ' witnesses and then the Defence ones , issue by issue .
( See evidence for detailed analysis of the evidence given in court . )
Meanwhile , questions were being asked in the UK parliament .
Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn sponsored two Early Day Motions called ' McDonald 's and Censorship ' in which he said that " this House opposes the routine use of libel writs as a form of censorship " and that " apologies and damages have been obtained under false pretences after McDonald 's lied about their practices " .
Serious stuff .
The nutrition section of the case got off to a flying start with a contrast between McDonald 's internal company memo :
" We can't really address or defend nutrition .
We do n't sell nutrition and people do n't come to McDonald 's for nutrition . " and one of their public leaflets : " Every time you eat at McDonald 's , you 'll eat good , nutritious food . "
Defence witness Tim Lobstein testifies that McDonald 's concept of a balanced diet is " meaningless " .
" You could eat a roll of sellotape as part of a balanced diet " he says .
Classic Court Moment number 1 came on September 12th 1994 when McDonald 's expert witness on cancer , Dr Sydney Arnott , inadvertently admitted that one of the most contentious statements made in the leaflet is a " very reasonable thing to say " .
Around this time the defendants received a most unexpected message : McDonald 's wanted to meet them to discuss a settlement .
Shelby Yastrow and Dick Starmann , two Senior Vice - Presidents of McDonald 's , fly over from Chicago and meet with Helen and Dave in a solicitor 's office in London .
McDonald 's said they will drop the suit and pay a substantial sum to a third party if the defendants agree never to publicly criticise McDonald 's again .
Helen and Dave said they wanted an undertaking from McDonald 's not to sue anyone for making similar criticisms again and for the company to apologise to those they 've sued in the past .
No deal , so back to court ..
By Autumn 94 the court was listening to evidence on McDonald 's advertising techniques and part of their confidential Operation Manual was read out in court .
" Ronald loves McDonald 's and McDonald 's food .
And so do children , because they love Ronald .
Remember children exert a phenomenal influence when it come to restaurant selection .
This means you should do everything you can to appeal to children 's love for Ronald and McDonald's . "
On day 102 in court - March 13th 1995 - McLibel became the longest ever UK libel trial , beating the previous record of 101 days in the Daily Mail vs The Moonies [ 1982 ] .
The court was hearing evidence on food poisoning and animal welfare .
Around this time an Australian documentary team receives a leaked confidential McDonald 's Australia memo which details their strategy for dealing with media interest in the McLibel case .
It includes such gems as " we could worsen the controversy by adding our opinion " and " we want to keep it at arms length - not become guilty by association "
Meanwhile , McDonald 's shareholders were getting upset .
At the Annual General Meeting in Chicago , Michael Quinlan , Chair and Chief Executive , said the case would be " coming to a wrap soon " .
It actually lasted two more years .
June 28th 1995 and the trial celebrated its first anniversary , with a birthday cake and picket outside the court .
Before the trial started McDonald 's had made an agreement with the Judge and with Helen and Dave to pay for daily transcripts of the court to be made , and to give copies to all parties .
In July of 1995 they said that they were withdrawing this agreement unless the defendants agreed to stop giving quotes to the press .
Helen and Dave considered this to be a crude attempt by McDonald 's to stop the swell of negative publicity based on quotes from the transcripts - especially admissions obtained during their cross examination of McDonald 's witnesses .
McDonald 's said that it was to stop Helen and Dave distorting what their witnesses had said .
The McLibel Support Campaign launched an appeal to raise the £ 35,000 needed to pay for transcripts for the remainder of the trial ( £ 425 per day ) .
America finally woke up to the trial with a front page feature article in the Wall Street Journal headlined ' Activists put McDonald 's on Grill ' , a rash of newspaper and magazine articles and four minutes on prime time CBS National News .
In June 1995 , at McDonald 's request , the two sides meet again for more settlement negotiations .
This time in a pub in Central London .
McDonald 's repeat that they can't possibly agree to never sue anyone again .
Helen and Dave repeat that they can't possibly agree not to criticise McDonald 's any more .
The talks fail and the trial continues .
By October 1995 the court was listening to evidence on McDonald 's employment practices - over 30 ex-employees and trade union officials and activists from around the world would be called .
Media highlights include allegations of racism , cooking in a kitchen flooded with sewage , watering down products , illegal hours worked , underage staff employed , fiddling of time cards and obsessive anti-union practices .
The trial got its first front page tabloid article .
McLibel notched up another one for the record books on December 11th 1995 as it became the longest civil case ( as opposed to criminal ) in British history .
The greatest moment of the whole case , campaign and possibly the history of the planet came on February 16th 1996 when Helen and Dave launch the McSpotlight internet site from a laptop connected to the internet via a mobile phone outside a McDonald 's store in Central London .
The website was accessed more than a million times in its first month , of which 2,700 are from a computer called ' mcdonalds.com ' .
Between February and April of that year the court heard evidence on one of the most controversial allegations in the leaflet : that McDonald 's are responsible for the destruction of rainforest in Central and South America to make way for cattle pasture .
Witness Sue Brandford , appearing for the defence , testified that she visited one of the particular areas in Brazil under contention 20 years ago and that it was rainforest then .
The Judge says that this is the most important evidence heard so far on this issue .
The Defendants were by now completely exhausted , but were refused an adjournment for rest .
Around this time the Judge denied the defendants leave to appeal over his decision to allow McDonald 's to change their Statement of Claim ( original case against Morris and Steel ) regarding the issues of nutrition and animal welfare .
The Court of Appeal also refused them leave to appeal .
After rainforests , came publication .
Did Helen and Dave produce or distribute the factsheet ?
If McDonald 's did not manage to prove this then their whole case would fall apart .
( Yes , it probably would have been more sensible to do this before listening to two years of evidence , but , on McDonald 's application , the judge had decided that it would be heard last ) .
The majority of McDonald 's case on publication relied on the spies who had been paid to infiltrate the London Greenpeace meetings in the ' 80s .
Four of them came to give evidence for McDonald's .
But , in one of the great twists of the trial , another one , Fran Tiller , appeared on behalf of Helen and Dave .
She testified that she " did not think there was anything wrong with what the group was doing " .
Three of the spies admitted distributing the leaflet and so the Defendants claimed McDonald 's had consented to its publication .
In May 1996 McDonald 's UK President Paul Preston was recalled into the witness box for another 4 days cross-examination .
He took the responsibility ( many will say blame ) for bringing the case and faced a sustained challenge over alleged company lies to the court and the public in recent years .
In June the trial celebrated its second anniversary with a Ronald McDonald cake outside court .
The last witness to give evidence in the trial was Helen Steel herself , who was cross-examined by Richard Rampton .
Dave Morris decided not to give evidence , which is a right of defendants .
He argued that McDonald 's had failed to make a case against him - they could not come up with a single incident of him distributing the leaflet .
On July 17th 1996 the court closed with all the evidence completed .
Each side now had just three months to write their closing speeches - analysing 40,000 pages of documentary evidence , 20,000 pages of transcript testimony and dealing with many complex legal arguments and submissions - in order to present their final case .
In fact , Rampton and the Judge agreed that one month of this time should be used for everyone to take a well needed break from the case .
During the summer holidays of 1996 it was Dave Morris 's son's turn to experience McDonald 's marketing techniques first hand .
The corporation donated £ 500 to Charlie 's playcentre and brought Ronald McDonald and twelve officials down to their summer FunDay .
Dave Morris and other parents were furious , saying that the event had been " hijacked for publicity purposes " .
As it turned out , the publicity backfired on McDonald's .
John Vidal ( author of the McLibel book ) was present and wrote a front - page piece for the Guardian and One - Off Productions filmed the event for their hour - long documentary about the trial .
In fact the Corporation was receiving increasingly bad publicity now , and as the trial progressed campaigners were stepping up their protests against McDonald 's worldwide .
In particular , ' What 's Wrong with McDonald's ? ' leaflets were becoming probably the most famous and widely distributed protest leaflets in history .
The two sides returned to court in October to start the closing speeches .
The Judge turned down the defendants ' request for either more time to prepare or for McDonald 's to go first with the closing speeches .
The defendants argued that they were unprepared and could n't hope to analyse even half the testimony in the time available .
They also argued that they had no experience in what should be included and since McDonald 's were represented by experience lawyers they should go first .
The Judge said no and a few weeks later the Court of Appeal refused to give the Defendants leave to appeal against the Judge 's ruling .
Helen and Dave started their closing speeches on October 21st and carried on for a massive 6 weeks .
This surely has to be one of the longest speeches ever made in history , not least because ....
.... two weeks later , on November 1st 1996 ( court day 292 ) , McLibel becomes the longest trial of any kind in English history .
The longest trial before then was the Tichborne personation case which lasted 291 days , ending in 1874 .
The Guinness Book of Records took note .
Richard Rampton QC , for McDonald's , decided to present his Closing Speech in written form and handed his 5 - volume document to the Judge on November 28th 1996 .
All that remained was a few days of legal arguments .
The defendants argued that the UK libel laws are oppressive and unfair , particularly ( in this case ) the denial of Legal Aid and a jury trial and that multinational corporations should no longer be allowed to sue their critics in order to silence them over issues of public interest .
They cited European and US laws which would debar such a case and also recent developments in UK law debarring governmental bodies from suing for libel .
It was further argued that the McLibel case was beyond all precedent , was an abuse of procedure and of public rights , and that there was " an overriding imperative for decisions to be made to protect the public interest " .
December 13th 1996 was the last day of final submissions .
Mr Justice Bell said " I will say now that I propose to reserve my judgment .
It will take me some time to write it .
I do n't mean to be difficult when I say I do n't know when I will deliver it because I do n't know . "
He denied newspaper reports that his ruling would come at the beginning of 1997 or early 1997 , adding " It will take me longer than that . "
The media frenzy continued as the Judge deliberated , with Channel 4 TV news stating that the McLibel case was considered to be ' The biggest Corporate PR disaster in history ' .
In early February Macmillan published their hardback book of the trial ' McLibel - Burger Culture on Trial ' by John Vidal ( part written by the Defendants , whose names were removed from the cover on legal advice ! ) .
On the first anniversary of its launch , on 16th February , McSpotlight doubled in size overnight with the addition of all the official court transcripts .
In May , Channel 4 broadcast ' McLibel ! ' , a 3 1/2 hour (! ) reconstruction of the case .
As far as McDonald 's attempts to suppress debate over the matters raised in the leaflets and the trial , the cat was now so far out of the bag it had disappeared over the horizon .
But things were going well for the Corporation too : in April they announced that " systemwide sales exceeded $ 30 billion for the first time , and net income crossed the $ 1.5 billion threshold " .
Despite the build - up in the proceeding weeks , no - one had any inkling of the scale of the media attention on Judgement Day - 19th June 1997 .
Helen and Dave had three TV crews filming them on the ( packed ) rush - hour tube journey to court and more than 30 waiting outside the courtroom .
By the time the Judge had delivered his verdict , this had grown to well over 50 media teams and over a hundred supporters .
Mr Justice
Bell took two hours to read his summary to a packed court room .
He ruled that Helen and Dave had not proved the allegations against McDonald 's on rainforest destruction , heart disease and cancer , food poisoning , starvation in the Third World and bad working conditions .
But they had proved that McDonald 's " exploit children " with their advertising , falsely advertise their food as nutritious , risk the health of their most regular , long - term customers , are " culpabably responsible " for cruelty to animals , are " strongly antipathetic " to unions and pay their workers low wages .
NB .
' Not proved ' does not mean that the allegations against McDonald 's are not true , just that the Judge felt that Helen and Dave did not bring sufficient evidence to prove the meanings he had attributed to the leaflet .
The Judge ruled that Helen and Dave had libelled McDonald's , but as they had proved many of the allegations , they would only owe half of the claimed damages : £ 60,000 .
Helen eloquently summarised the defendants ' response , " McDonald 's do n't deserve a penny and in any event we have n't got any money . "
McDonald 's had 4 weeks to decide whether they were going to pursue their costs and the injunction which they had originally set out to obtain back in September 1990 .
Press interest was at a peak around the day of the verdict .
McSpotlight was accessed 2.2 million times and their volunteers started work on a CD - ROM version of the site .
John Vidal set to work preparing the paperback version of the book .
One - Off Productions completed their documentary ready for video distribution and sale to international networks .
The defendants conducted back - to - back media interviews for three days , but declined the offer of a seat on the sofa next to ' Richard and Judy ' ( UK TV show ) .
Two days after the verdict Helen and Dave were leafleting outside McDonald 's again , in defiance of any injunction McDonald 's might serve .
They were n't alone : over 400,000 leaflets were distributed outside 500 of McDonald 's 750 UK stores , and solidarity protests were held in over a dozen countries .
Meanwhile , The Sunday Times ( UK ) reported that Ed Rensi , President of the McDonald 's Corporation , had , along with his staff , been removed as Chief Executive following falling US market share , promotional flops and franchisee discontent .
McDonald 's dropped their claim for costs as well as their intention of getting an injunction ( meaning that if Helen and Dave continued to distribute the leaflets it would be a contempt of court , for which they could be jailed ) .
Although this was a sensible move , PR - wise ( as the defendants had already stated that they would defy any injunction ) it signalled a clear admission of defeat .
The securing of damages and an injunction had the corporation 's two aims in starting proceedings ( as detailed in their Statement of Claim ) .
They are now claiming that they were only interested in establishing the truth ( for example , that they exploit children ) .
Two months after the verdict the defendants '
Appeal was safely lodged .
Helen and Dave argued that the trial was unfair and the libel laws oppressive , that the defence evidence on all of the issues was overwhelming , and that in any case Mr Justice Bell 's findings against the corporation were so damaging to their reputation that the case should have been found in the defendants ' favour overall .
After a short break to recover from the stress of the trial , the defendants would have to start extensive preparations anew ...
Meanwhile the global protests and the distribution of London Greenpeace leaflets continued to grow - including a week of action around Anti-McDonald 's Day in October 1997 .
Pre-appeal hearings - and legal arguments and disputes - took place throughout 1998 in front of three Lord Justices .
The Appeal itself finally started on 12th January 1999 , ending on 31st March 1999 - entailing 24 days of complex legal argument and detailed dissection of the main trial evidence and verdict .
The defendants represented themselves , opposed by the usual McSuspects on the other side of the room - Richard Rampton , Tim Atkinson and Patti Brinley - Codd .
McDonald's , on the other hand , did not appeal against any of the rulings made against them .
In fact , they had conceded in writing on 5th January 1999 that the trial Judge had been ' correct in his conclusions ' .
But the defendants had prepared over 700 pages of legal submissions .
On 31st March 1999 Lord Justices Pill , May and Keane announced their appeal verdict in 309 pages .
The controversy continued as they added to the findings already made against McDonald's .
They ruled that it was true that McDonald 's regular customers faced an increased risk of heart disease and that it was fair comment to say McDonald 's workers worldwide suffer poor pay and conditions .
The McLibel 2 felt that , although the battle with McDonald 's was now largely won , it was important to continue to push for an outright legal victory and for changes in the libel laws .
On 31st July 1999 they had lodged a 43 point petition to the House of Lords for Leave to Appeal further .
This was rejected and so , in September 2000 - 10 years after McDonald 's served the original writs - Helen and Dave launched an action against the British Government at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
So began ' Steel and Morris vs UK '
In 1998 the defendants also sued the Metropolitan Police for giving personal information ( including their names and home addresses ) to McDonald 's agents .
In July 2000 , in order to avoid what they called ' a difficult and lengthy trial ' , the Met agreed to pay � 10,000 to the McLibel 2 , plus their legal costs .
The full McLibel ECHR application ( 173 pages ) was lodged on 2nd April 2001 , followed up by further particulars in 2002 as requested by the Court .
On 12th March 2003 the UK Government responded with its observations , claiming that the laws were fair and just , and did not unnecessarily hinder the public 's freedom of speech .
The defendants were unable to obtain an electronic version .
On 6th July 2003 the McLibel 2 responded with a 53 page document - a point by point reply to the UK government 's views .
The McLibel Support Campaign issued a press release in July 2003 , stating : Whatever happens in Strasbourg , the McLibel campaign has already demonstrated that a determined and widespread campaign of grass roots defiance and non-cooperation can render oppressive laws unworkable .
The continually growing opposition to McDonald 's and all it stands for is a vindication of all the efforts of those around the world who have been exposing and challenging the corporation 's business practices .
In May 2004 , five years after the McLibel 2 last appeared in Court for their appeal , Helen and Dave were notified that the European Court had declared admissable their claim that the McLibel trial breached their Article 6 right to a fair trial and Article 10 right to freedom of expression .
On 18th August 2004 the McLibel 2 completed their Applicant 's Summary / Memorial for the European Court Hearing .
The case was heard in full on 7th September 2004 .
On 15th February 2005 , the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg declared that the mammoth McLibel case was in breach of the right to a fair trial and right to freedom of expression .
The European Court ruled that UK laws had failed to protect the public�s right to criticise massive corporations whose business practices can affect people�s lives , health and the environment .
Read the full verdict .
While all these legal disputes were continuing , opposition to McDonald 's did likewise - during 1999 this included dramatic protests by local residents , French farmers and the first unionisation of a McStore in North America .
On October 16th 1999 there were protests in 345 towns in 23 countries .
Campaigners in China exposed the dangerous and oppressive conditions for workers producing ' Happy Meal ' toys for McDonald 's global use .
March 2002 .
A panel of 8 public relations professionals brought together by UK marketing industry magazine ' PR Week ' declared that the ' McLibel ' case and campaign was 9th out of a Top 20 of the most effective public relations ' consumer facing ' campaigns ( mostly UK based ) of all time .
In October 2002 , for the first time , many McDonald 's workers joined in the Day of Action , inspired by a call from the growing international McDonald 's Workers Resistance network .
Meanwhile McDonald 's was being increasingly targeted for contributing to the growing problems of obsesity in the industrialised world - in the US , some very high profile law suits were lodged against them in 2002 - 3 , receiving global publicity .
To cap it all , the corporation 's profits began to tumble .
At the end of 2002 they announced their first ever loss in their 50 year history and planned to close at least 175 stores ...
By the summer of 2003 McSpotlight had been accessed 184,675,000 times .
McDonald 's UK announced their largest ever drop in profits ( 71 % in 2003 ) .
Profits dropped from a high of � 104.3 million in 2001 , to � 83.8 million in 2002 , and sharply to � 23.6 million �in 2003 .
During 2004 public concern over the growing obesity crisis led to official calls for bans on the marketing of junk food to children .
McDonald 's was identified as the number one culprit .
A US documentary film - ' Supersize Me ' - about the effects of overeating McDonald 's food received enormous publicity and was viewed by tens of millions of people .
In September 2004 the McLibel 2 travelled to Strasbourg to make their application to the European Court of Human Rights - their case was argued in court by Keir Starmer QC .
The UK government defended UK libel laws , claiming the trial was fair .
On 15th February 2005 the European Court declared that the mammoth McLibel case was in breach of the right to a fair trial and right to freedom of expression - mainly due to the unavailability of legal aid for defamation cases .
The McLibel 2 , Helen Steel and Dave Morris , held a victorious press Conference outside McDonald 's in The Strand , Central London .
The Strand was chosen to mark 20 years of growing protests against McDonald 's since the first ever ' Day of Action against McDonald�s ' on Jan 19th 1985 , when London Greenpeace had protested at the site .
This event gained extensive media coverage around the world .
On 15th April 2005 , to mark 50 years to the day since the McDonald 's Corporation it opened its first store ( Des Plaines , Illinois , USA ) , there was a protest outside McDonald 's Euro - HQ in Finchley , North London .
Dave Morris stamped on a McBirthday cake with ' PUBLIC OPINION ' written on his shoe , Helen Steel held a placard saying '50 YEARS OF McJUNK , McJOBS , McLITTER ' alongside campaigners with a banner saying ' CELEBRATE 20 YEARS OF GLOBAL RESISTANCE TO McWORLD '.
The night before McDonald 's 50th Birthday , April 14th , the BBC had finally broadcast Franny Armstrong 's ' McLibel ' documentary , which had been updated and expanded by Spanner Films over the previous 6 months .
In the evening , 100 people attended a McLibel Support Campaign anti-McBirthday party / event .
The event saw the launch of the double - DVD of McLibel with an additional 4 hours footage documenting the long battle .
After a discussion about how the government and corporations were now using a range of new laws to undermine a whole range of protests in the UK it was agreed to call a ' Freedom To Protest ' conference so that all groups affected could support each other and launch a major co-ordinated fightback .
Following a huge response from the public after the broadcast on BBC4 , the BBC finally broadcast the McLibel documentary on their mainstream channel ( available to everyone in the UK ) on June 5th 2005 at 10.30 pm .
The newspapers unanimaously chose the programme as ' Pick of the Day ' .
The Guardian called it " Absolutely unmissable " , the Sunday Times said it was " The sort of film Michael Moore probably thinks he makes " and The Times said " Freedom of speech rarely tasted so satisfying " .
Following the broadcast , McSpotlight hosted a live webchat with Helen , Dave , Franny and various members of the film crew .
The McLibel documentary will be released in the cinema in America on June 10th by Cinema Libre .
Helen and Dave are currently both actively involved in local community groups and campaigns in North London .
They have written a comprehensive summing up of the whole case and campaign ' McLibel : Do It Yourself Justice ' .

By Barbara Crossette September 14 , 2009
It 's a sure bet that women wo n't be high on the agenda , or even listed on the program , when UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon convenes a
Even less likely to be discussed at either event is the potential environmental role of reproductive health .
Family planning is a toxic subject in too many places , best buried as a malingering relative of Malthusian population " control . "
Governments , which dominate these huge confabs , and the people who work independently in the field , down at village level , disagree sharply on the perils of omitting women and their reproductive choices when the future of the earth is at stake .
At the NGO Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Development in Berlin early this month , experts from scores of nongovernmental organizations from around the world asked the governments of developing countries to accept that a " rising population and climate change need to be considered together in an integrated policy , " according to
UN officials are largely on the same page .
Helen Clark , the new administrator of the UN Development Program , said at the Berlin forum that " educating women and families in the developing world on the number of children they actually wish to have , improving the health of women and promoting gender equality , reducing poverty and hunger , and mitigating climate change " form a virtuous circle .
Nevertheless , a warning to keep population off the table was sounded on August 29 by Jairam Ramesh , India 's environment minister , who in a conference in New Delhi pre-emptively charged that there was " a move in Western countries to bring population into climate change .
Influential American think tanks are asking why should we reward profligate reproductive behavior ?
Why should we reward India which is adding 14 million people every year ? "
The official policy of India , influential among developing nations , is important because
India has the power to stymie environmental agreements , alone or using its influence among developing nations , where more than 90 percent of the world 's population growth will take place in this century .
In August , the
" Nearly all of the 80 million people being added to world population each year are born in countries where natural support systems are already deteriorating in the face of excessive population pressure , in the countries least able to support them , "
In Berlin , Leo Bryant of the
Thirty - eight of forty governments identified as their priorities the risk of increased flooding ; thirty - six feared longer or more frequent droughts ; thirty - three named reduced crop yields ; thirty - five fresh water scarcity ; and thirty - seven identified threats to biodiversity -- but only six listed rapid population growth , Bryant told IPS .
That some European and American progressives see family planning as a population control tool to fix climate problems is getting the issue backwards .
Reproductive choice is an end in itself , to make women healthier and happier in their sexual lives .
If that means they choose to have fewer children , or just protected sex , the long - term impact may be positive for the environment as well as the family and community , but that is a side effect of the primary goal .
Women know how much farther they have to walk every year for water or food and how many of their little girls will have to forgo school to help in that life - sustaining work .
Experts are not unaware of the special knowledge of women , though they may have a hard time making inroads into political thinking .
A few weeks ago at the third World Climate Conference in Geneva , technicians and scientists , according to the meeting 's final
They recommended that " gender equality must be mainstreamed into climate science , mechanisms and activities , and in climate institutions . "
At the local level , they said , women should be trained for and involved in monitoring climate and the environment .
In Washington , the Obama administration is on its way to bigger and bigger investments in international family planning and women 's rights , an important issue to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Whether this growing commitment will be promoted by the United States in forthcoming international meetings is not known .
But American officials can go armed with the knowledge that public opinion supports them .
This is not always true in Europe , where official family planning aid is sometimes seen as a cultural intrusion , an attitude that amounts to denying poor women the same choices women in industrial nations have .
In Washington , Michael Khoo , the vice president of communications for Population Action International , tracks numerous polls about American attitudes toward assisting reproductive programs globally .
" The numbers show Americans overwhelmingly support family planning in developing countries , despite how some politicians may try and polarize the issue , " he said .
" The reason why the vast majority of Americans support family planning is because they know it improves the lives of women and families around the world . "
It 's a sure bet that women wo n't be high on the agenda , or even listed on the program , when UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon convenes a climate change summit of world leaders on September 22 .
Women are also likely to be missing at the make - or - break emissions reduction conference in Copenhagen in December .
Governments , which dominate these huge confabs , and the people who work independently in the field , down at village level , disagree sharply on the perils of omitting women and their reproductive choices when the future of the earth is at stake .
At the NGO Forum on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Development in Berlin early this month , experts from scores of nongovernmental organizations from around the world asked the governments of developing countries to accept that a " rising population and climate change need to be considered together in an integrated policy , " according to Inter Press Service .
Reflective of the NGO view was Kulvashi Devi Hurrynag , a women 's rights activist from Mauritius , who said that countries must recognize the " synergies between family planning , sexual education , development and environmental equilibrium .
" UN officials are largely on the same page .
Helen Clark , the new administrator of the UN Development Program , said at the Berlin forum that " educating women and families in the developing world on the number of children they actually wish to have , improving the health of women and promoting gender equality , reducing poverty and hunger , and mitigating climate change " form a virtuous circle .
Nevertheless , a warning to keep population off the table was sounded on August 29 by Jairam Ramesh , India 's environment minister , who in a conference in New Delhi pre-emptively charged that there was " a move in Western countries to bring population into climate change .
Influential American think tanks are asking why should we reward profligate reproductive behavior ?
Why should we reward India which is adding 14 million people every year ?
"
The official policy of India , influential among developing nations , is important because India will overtake China as the world 's most populous country in the next few decades and is already the fifth - largest global polluter .
India , where fossil fuels are and will be for a long time the predominant source of energy , has almost four times the population of the United States on a third of the land area .
It is already short of water and arable soil .
India has the power to stymie environmental agreements , alone or using its influence among developing nations , where more than 90 percent of the world 's population growth will take place in this century .
In August , the Population Reference Bureau in Washington announced that the world 's population will reach 7 billion by 2011 , adding a staggering billion people in only twelve years .
" Nearly all of the 80 million people being added to world population each year are born in countries where natural support systems are already deteriorating in the face of excessive population pressure , in the countries least able to support them , " Lester Brown , president of the Earth Policy Institute writes in " A Civilizational Tipping Point , " from the book Plan B 3.0 : Mobilizing to Save Civilization .
" In these countries , the risk of state failure is growing .
" In Berlin , Leo Bryant of the Marie Stopes International foundation told IPS , a leading news service on the developing world , that while governments pay lip service to population growth , very few make the direct link to climate change and environmental strain .
Bryant , whose foundation provides contraception , abortion , vasectomies and other reproductive services worldwide , has done a survey for the World Health Organization of concerns about climate change submitted by forty of the poorest nations in reports to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change .
Thirty - eight of forty governments identified as their priorities the risk of increased flooding ; thirty - six feared longer or more frequent droughts ; thirty - three named reduced crop yields ; thirty - five fresh water scarcity ; and thirty - seven identified threats to biodiversity -- but only six listed rapid population growth , Bryant told IPS .
That some European and American progressives see family planning as a population control tool to fix climate problems is getting the issue backwards .
Reproductive choice is an end in itself , to make women healthier and happier in their sexual lives .
If that means they choose to have fewer children , or just protected sex , the long - term impact may be positive for the environment as well as the family and community , but that is a side effect of the primary goal .
Women know how much farther they have to walk every year for water or food and how many of their little girls will have to forgo school to help in that life - sustaining work .
Experts are not unaware of the special knowledge of women , though they may have a hard time making inroads into political thinking .
A few weeks ago at the third World Climate Conference in Geneva , technicians and scientists , according to the meeting 's final statement , recognized , " having considered an extensive body of knowledge and expertise in the area of gender and climate variability and change ... that women and men around the globe are distinct carriers , providers and users of climate information , and that mounting evidence shows that drivers and consequences of climate change are not gender neutral .
" They recommended that " gender equality must be mainstreamed into climate science , mechanisms and activities , and in climate institutions . "
At the local level , they said , women should be trained for and involved in monitoring climate and the environment .
In Washington , the Obama administration is on its way to bigger and bigger investments in international family planning and women 's rights , an important issue to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .

Republicans are n't normally associated with the Age of Aquarius , but they may be forgiven if they are singing " Let the Sunshine In . "
The GOP has been flat on its back since the Obama ascendancy in last year 's presidential election , but Republican Bob McDonnell 's blowout victory over Democrat Creigh Deeds in the Virginia governor 's race and Chris Christie 's defeat of Jon Corzine in New Jersey should help dispel the party 's gloom .
Yesterday in advance of the results , White House ...
Major conventions are ditching Chicago over outrageous costs for McCormick Place electricians .
Please consider
High costs drive major trade show out of Chicago .
Chicago ditched .
Tens of thousands of outsiders say it 's too expensive to spend their money here ; $ 52 million would have been pumped into our economy by some 28,000 visitors .
Instead , a major trade show says it 's leaving Chicago behind for good .
This week , CBS 2 reported on outrage over the hundred dollar case of Pepsi .
Exhibitors feeling ripped off .
Threatening not to come back .
Now , it 's happened .
McCormick
Place electricians were the straw that broke the camel 's back for one Chicagoan who says he reluctantly said " no " to bringing his convention back home .
The Tribune reports the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society , which held its annual meeting at McCormick Place for the first time in April , is taking its 2012 show to Las Vegas instead .
Healthcare Information and Management Systems CEO Steve Lieber told CBS2 it 's all because of the electricians .
" Our costs were about $ 200,000 more , " said Lieber .
" So it went from $ 40,000 to $ 240,000 for the electrical work alone . "
The city got the word Wednesday that the huge medical convention would n't return .
They 're also sweating out a decision by an even bigger show .
The International Plastics Showcase has been in Chicago since 1971 , but now a spokesman says : " We are looking at other options . "
Like Orlando .
Though the medical trade group says it 's deeper than union versus non-union towns .
" It was the number of hours and the number of people it took to do the identical job , " Lieber said .
Two months ago , McCormick
Place quietly fired two - thirds of its electricians , promising to bring back only the best , and only when they 're needed ; trying to change the work rules and work ethic that 's already cost Chicago tens of millions of dollars .
Chicago is driving business away and destroying property values by raising sales taxes and property taxes .
It should be reducing taxes and cutting expenses .
The fact that Chicago has the highest taxes in the nation strongly suggests it has the most bloated bureaucracy and overpaid workers in the nation to go along .
Addendum :
My brother used to do conventions at Chicago .
His company had a cardboard display and a demo unit they 'd normally lug around on sales calls .
But they could n't carry the demo unit into the convention hall because that 's union work .
Since it was over some weight limit ( I forget the exact amount , but my brother used to carry it himself ) , it required two union guys to carry .
Since there were two union guys involved the rules said there had to be a third guy to supervise the first two .
The minimum was four hours for all three ( for fifteen minutes worth of work ) .
So , conventions leaving Chicago does n't surprise me in the least .
I wonder why it did n't happen years ago .
Egyptian blogger Abdel Kareem Suleiman ( L ) is escorted by police officers in a court house in Alexandria February 22 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Stringer
CAIRO ( Reuters ) -
An Egyptian court confirmed the four - year jail sentence imposed on an Egyptian student blogger for posting writings critical of Islam and the government , the state news agency MENA said .
Blogger Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman , then 22 , was arrested in 2006 and charged with publishing opinions aimed at disturbing public order , insulting the head of state and defaming Islam .
He was expelled from al - Azhar University , Egypt ’s most prestigious seat of Islamic learning .
Suleiman will spend only one year in jail as he has already spent three years in detention since his arrest .
In April , Egyptian police beat and detained at least 18 members of a protest blogging group , the Sixth of April Youth , which called for a national strike each year on April 6 under the slogan : “ It ’s our right , and we ’ll take it . ”
Suleiman was among several bloggers arrested in 2006 , prompting the rights group Reporters Without Borders to add Egypt to a list of the worst suppressors of freedom of expression on the Internet .
Egypt joined 12 other countries on the list , including Cuba , Myanmar , Iran and Turkmenistan .
The aquatic ecosystems of Antarctica keep turning up surprises for scientists , who have found flourishing ecosystems comprised mostly of microorganisms .
A new paper , published in Science , examined samples drawn from an Antarctic lake and tracked seasonal changes in the viruses that prey on these bacteria .
They found large , diverse populations of viruses , some of which have never been seen underwater before , and some that had previously only been found infecting birds , mammals , or plants .
The Antarctic is a great area if you 're in want of a virtually untouched ecosystem .
Several lakes that are covered with ice for most or all of the year have ecosystems that consist mostly of microorganisms that have adapted to the cold , dark , and nutrient - scarce environment .
These microbial ecosystems are balanced by limiting factors , such as the amount of food and predators .
In the case of Antarctic lake inhabitants , though , the predators are viruses that have likewise adapted to the conditions .
These systems and their viral predators have previously been difficult to study , due to the obstacles involved in getting the viruses ' hosts to grow in lab conditions .
To rectify this , a research team collected water samples from Lake Limnopolar on the Byers Peninsula in Antarctica before and after the warm season .
The samples showed that Lake Limnopolar harbored an unusually high number of viral genotypes — they ran into the thousands , whereas previously studied ecosystems had only a few hundred .
In the post - summer sample , they noticed an increase in the population of larger varieties of viruses ( larger than 50 nanometers ) and a decrease in the smaller ones ( shorter than 30 nanometers ) .
The researchers also noted that most of the viruses were unfamiliar , as the genome sequences were n't found in current databases — less than 3 percent were at all similar to viral genomes previously found in aquatic environments .
The snag in identifying the viruses turned out to be more fundamental than they expected .
Viruses found in aquatic environments usually infect prokaryotes , like bacteria .
However , the viruses found in the Antarctic water included a distinct population of small , single - stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) viruses .
These turned out to be related to known viruses with radically different targets , ones that infect only non-aquatic eukaryotes or larger organisms like mammals , birds , and plants .
In fact , some of the Antarctic water viruses have not been found in aquatic environments ever before .
The researchers suspect that they must be infecting small eukaryotic hosts in Lake Limnopolar .
The researchers were able to assemble 10 circular ssDNA genomes elements that were previously undescribed .
They found these ssDNA viruses dominate during the winter , when there is more ice cover on the lake .
Large - tailed , double - stranded ( dsDNA ) viruses , which typically attack prokaryotes , dominate during the summer , when there are algae blooms ( ironically , a eukaryote ) in the lake .
This indicates that the inhabitants of the lake 's ecosystem wax and wane seasonally , and there are different dominant populations of bacteria depending on the time of year .
These warm - season dsDNA viruses were found to help the microorganisms metabolise carbohydrates and amino acids , as well as respirate and effect stress responses , indicating that they actually helped the bacteria survive the summer .
At the outset of the study , the sheer diversity and number of viruses found to be living in the lake were a surprise to the researchers .
They not only found an ecosystem that adjusts to the time of year , but one that depends on a viral presence that was expected : an undiscovered family of eukaryote viruses that were slumming with bacteria in the dead of winter .
Despite the unexpected findings , the samples put researchers well on their way to understanding the freshwater ecosystems of Antarctica .

Brazil 's disappearing rainforests have been a concern for decades
The rate of deforestation in the Amazon has dropped by 45 % and is the lowest on record since monitoring began 21 years ago , Brazil 's government says .
According to the latest annual figures , just over 7,000 sq km was destroyed between July 2008 and August 2009 .
The drop is welcome news for the government in advance of the Copenhagen summit on climate change .
But Greenpeace says there is still too much deforestation and the government 's targets are not ambitious enough .
According to the Brazilian space agency , which monitors deforestation in the Amazon , the annual rate of destruction fell by 45 % .
Green credentials
Welcoming the news , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva described the drop in the level of deforestation as " extraordinary " .
He said climate change was the most challenging issue the world was facing .
The Brazilian government will undoubtedly view the latest figures as a boost to its green credentials coming just before the Copenhagen summit in December .
At the summit , the Brazilian government seems certain to present its efforts to reduce destruction in the Amazon as a key part of its strategy to combat climate change .
The environment ministry here is said to be proposing that around half of a 40 % cut in Brazil 's carbon emissions would come from reducing deforestation .
The Brazilian government wants to see an 80 % reduction in the deforestation rate by 2020 .
The environmental pressure group , Greenpeace , welcomed the latest drop as important , but said that there was still too much destruction in the rainforest .
In a statement , it said the president would be happy if , in 11 years time , the Amazon was being destroyed at a rate of a little less than three cities the size of Sao Paulo a year .
Some environmentalists believe that the fall in deforestation may be connected to the economic downturn , and that when things improve , the Amazon could face renewed pressure .

The hysteria over the release of the so - called Lockerbie bomber reveals much about the political and media class on both sides of the Atlantic , especially Britain .
From Gordon Brown's " repulsion " to Barack Obama 's " outrage " , the theatre of lies and hypocrisy is dutifully attended by those who call themselves journalists .
" But what if Megrahi lives longer than three months ? " whined a BBC reporter to the Scottish First Minister , Alex Salmond .
" What will you say to your constituents , then ? "
Horror of horrors that a dying man should live longer than prescribed before he " pays " for his " heinous crime " : the description of the Scottish justice minister , Kenny MacAskill , whose " compassion " allowed Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi to go home to Libya to " face justice from a higher power " .
Amen .
The American satirist Larry David once addressed a voluble crony as " a babbling brook of bullshit " .
Such eloquence summarises the circus of Megrahi 's release .
No one in authority has had the guts to state the truth about the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 above the Scottish village of Lockerbie on 21 December 1988 , in which 270 people were killed .
The governments in England and Scotland in effect blackmailed Megrahi into dropping his appeal as a condition of his immediate release .
Of course there were oil and arms deals under way with Libya ; but had Megrahi proceeded with his appeal , some 600 pages of new and deliberately suppressed evidence would have set the seal on his innocence and given us more than a glimpse of how and why he was stitched up for the benefit of " strategic interests " .
“ The endgame came down to damage limitation , " said the former CIA officer Robert Baer , who took part in the original investigation , " because the evidence amassed by [ Megrahi's ] appeal is explosive and extremely damning to the system of justice . "
New witnesses would show that it was impossible for Megrahi to have bought clothes that were found in the wreckage of the Pan Am aircraft - he was convicted on the word of a Maltese shopowner who claimed to have sold him the clothes , then gave a false description of him in 19 separate statements and even failed to recognise him in the courtroom .
The new evidence would have shown that a fragment of a circuit board and bomb timer , " discovered " in the Scottish countryside and said to have been in Megrahi 's suitcase , was probably a plant .
A forensic scientist found no trace of an explosion on it .
The new evidence would demonstrate the impossibility of the bomb beginning its journey in Malta before it was " transferred " through two airports undetected to Flight 103 .
A " key secret witness " at the original trial , who claimed to have seen Megrahi and his co-accused , al - Alim Khalifa Fahimah ( who was acquitted ) , loading the bomb on to the plane at Frankfurt , was bribed by the US authorities holding him as a " protected witness " .
The defence exposed him as a CIA informer who stood to collect , on the Libyans ' conviction , up to $ 4 m as a reward .
Megrahi was convicted by three Scottish judges sitting in a courtroom in " neutral " Holland .
There was no jury .
One of the few reporters to sit through the long and often farcical proceedings was the late Paul Foot , whose landmark investigation in Private Eye exposed it as a cacophony of blunders , deceptions and lies : a whitewash .
The Scottish judges , while admitting a " mass of conflicting evidence " and rejecting the fantasies of the CIA informer , found Megrahi guilty on hearsay and unproven circumstance .
Their 90 - page " opinion " , wrote Foot , " is a remarkable document that claims an honoured place in the history of British miscarriages of justice " .
( His report , Lockerbie - the Flight from Justice , can be downloaded from www.private-eye.co.uk for £ 5 . )
Foot reported that most of the staff of the US embassy in Moscow who had reserved seats on Pan Am flights from Frankfurt cancelled their bookings when they were alerted by US intelligence that a terrorist attack was planned .
He named Margaret Thatcher the " architect " of the cover - up after revealing that she killed the independent inquiry her transport secretary Cecil Parkinson had promised the Lockerbie families ; and in a phone call to President George Bush Sr on 11 January 1990 , she agreed to " low - key " the disaster after their intelligence services had reported " beyond doubt " that the Lockerbie bomb had been placed by a Palestinian group , contracted by Tehran , as a reprisal for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner by a US warship in Iranian territorial waters .
Among the 290 dead were 66 children .
In 1990 , the ship 's captain was awarded the Legion of Merit by Bush Sr " for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer " .
Perversely , when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1991 , Bush needed Iran 's support as he built a " coalition " to expel his wayward client from an American oil colony .
The only country that defied Bush and backed Iraq was Libya .
" Like lazy and overfed fish , " wrote Foot , " the British media jumped to the bait .
In almost unanimous chorus , they engaged in furious vilification and open warmongering against Libya . "
The framing of Libya for the Lockerbie crime was inevitable .
Since then , a US defence intelligence agency report , obtained under Freedom of Information , has confirmed these truths and identified the likely bomber ; it was to be the centrepiece of Megrahi 's defence .
In 2007 , the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission referred Megrahi 's case for appeal .
" The commission is of the view , " said its chairman , Graham Forbes , " based upon our lengthy investigations , the new evidence we have found and other evidence which was not before the trial court , that the applicant may have suffered a miscarriage of justice . "
The words " miscarriage of justice " are entirely missing from the current furore , with Kenny MacAskill reassuring the baying mob that the scapegoat will soon face justice from that " higher power " .
What a disgrace .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday lashed out at former bosses of the giant YUKOS oil company -- including jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky -- accusing them of ordering the murders of opponents .
Speaking to Russians in a televised phone - in , Putin said the oil company ’s former security chief -- who has been convicted of carrying out murders -- was acting on the orders of YUKOS shareholders , of which Khodorkovsky was the biggest .
The battle with Khodorkovsky and the carve - up of the YUKOS empire -- once Russia ’s biggest oil producer -- dominated Putin ’s presidency .
Khodorkovsky , who was sentenced in 2005 to eight years imprisonment in a remote Siberian jail for fraud and tax evasion , is on trial for new charges of money laundering and embezzlement that could keep him in jail for another 22 years .
He denies any guilt and says he was jailed so that corrupt officials could carve up his business empire .
Ghost Yachts , a Dutch based yacht company , has recently introduced the G180 superyacht .
This company worked closely with the Italian based yacht design company named Gloss Design on the project .
The unique collaboration has resulted in the beautiful G180 superyacht .
Ghost Yachts focused on the areas of engineering and basic technology surrounding the overall build of the water vessel .
Gloss Design focused on the exterior and interior style of the luxury yacht .
Here , you will learn about the G180 and what it brings to the yachting industry .
The hull form of the G180 luxury yacht is considered to be a “ fast displacement ” .
It is composed of pure steel while the superstructure itself was created with aluminum and also composites that are fully reinforced .
The total length of the luxury yacht is an amazing one hundred eighty feet total .
This is equivalent to fifty five meters .
The unique waterline of the yacht ranks in at one hundred seventy five feet .
The beam has a max measurement of thirty feet and the draft measures in at nearly ten feet .
The overall displacement of the water vessel is seven hundred ten metric based tons .
The G180 superyacht has a total tonnage of an amazing six hundred sixty nine GT .
When it comes to fuel capacity , it can hold up to twenty nine thousand gallons .
The fresh water level is an amazing capacity of five thousand and two hundred eighty five gallons .
There are two main engines that power this luxury yacht .
The first one is identified as the “ MTU 12V4000 M70 2X168Okw ” and the second is identified as the “ MTU 20V4000 M73L 2X3600 KW ” .
There is also a backup generator in place that is referred to as the “ 2X160 KW ” .
The maximum speed produced by the main engine is estimated to be seventeen knots and the maximum speed of the second engine is said to be twenty three knots .
When it comes to cruising speed , the Ghost 180 luxury yacht ranks in at an amazing fifteen knots with a total range of four thousand total nautical miles .
This very large superyacht is able to successfully accommodate a crew of twelve individuals and the captain of the water vessel .
In addition to this , it is able to support a total of twelve guests as well .
This totals an amount of twenty five individuals .
It is important to understand that all of the specifications of the G180 luxury yacht are considered to be preliminary when it comes to the creation process .
These specifications may change over the course of time in which construction is being performed on the superyacht .

When evaluating the superstructure of the G180 , you will notice that it exhibits a high level of sophistication and innovation as far as the design is concerned .
There are unique angles that play to the actual shapes and contours of the water vessel as a whole .
The surface and even the design are often referred to as “ smooth ” by those that are creating the mega yacht and by those that observe the design plans .
When Ghost Yachts created the design scheme for the luxury yacht , they ensured that it would be ecologically correct .
If you are seeking innovation , style , and clever designs , the Ghost 180 superyacht is likely to be a highly attractive luxury yacht .

Obama Discreetly Lobbying For Public Option In Senate Health Bill
" Despite months of outward ambivalence about creating a government health insurance plan , the Obama White House has launched a behind - the - scenes campaign to get divided Senate Democrats to take up some version of the idea for a final vote in the coming weeks , " The Los Angeles Times reports .
While Obama has said he prefers a public option , he has also been open to health cooperatives and other alternatives .
" In the last week , however , senior administration officials have been holding private meetings almost daily at the Capitol with senior Democratic staff to discuss ways to include a version of the public plan in the healthcare bill that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) plans to bring to the Senate floor this month , according to senior Democratic congressional aides .
Among those regularly in the meetings are Obama 's top healthcare advisor , Nancy - Ann DeParle ; aides to Reid ; and staff from the Senate Finance and Health committees , both of which developed healthcare bills . "
In addition , the President " has also been reaching out personally to rank - and - file Senate Democrats , telephoning more than a dozen in the last week to press for action . "
Two public plan amendments were defeated in the Senate Finance committee last week , which " were viewed by some as the death knell of the public option , but the White House and its congressional allies are under heavy pressure from the Democratic Party 's liberal base to breathe life back into it .
That has Democratic leaders looking for ways to insert some form of the concept into a Senate bill without jeopardizing centrist support . "
The President has met recently with Sen. Olympia Snowe , R - Maine , who has proposed a " trigger " for the public option , Sen. Ben Nelson , D - Neb. , and spoke by phone with Sen. Maria Cantwell , D - Wash .
( Levey and Hook , 9/5 ) .
Meanwhile , " [ a ] s the unemployment rate climbs , President Barack Obama is trying to make the case that his health care overhaul would create jobs by making small business startups more affordable , " The Associated Press reports .
In his weekly radio and internet address on Saturday , the President " linked one of his biggest challenges - joblessness - with passage of far - reaching changes to the nation 's health care system .
If aspiring entrepreneurs believe they can stay insured while switching jobs , Obama said , they will start new businesses and hire workers " ( Babington , 10/4 ) .
A separate AP article reports that " President Barack Obama meets with doctors from across the country for a morning Rose Garden event on health care .
The president will also deliver remarks on the need for health insurance reform " ( 10/5 ) .
The Atlanta Journal Constitution adds that a doctor from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta " is one of more than 50 members of a health care advocacy group called Doctors for America whom Obama has invited to the White House as part of a last - minute effort to put a friendly chorus behind his calls for changes in the system . "
Dr. Jason Schneider of Grady Memorial " said he wants to tell the president not to give up on the idea of a public option .
' Maintaining choice and competition in the system is critical , ' he said , ' but so is taking care of the uninsured , especially for health care systems like Grady . '
Schneider said he also wants to give a voice to the uninsured at Grady and elsewhere , who he said get drowned out by the cacophony of critics " ( Keefe , 9/4 ) .

Bridget Lennon , an interior designer for retail stores , visited the shop last week to buy a copy of “ Hornet ’s Nest ” as a Christmas present for her fiancé .
“ You put down the first one , and you want to read the second ; and you put down the second , and you want to read the third , ” Ms. Lennon , 27 , said .
Although she said the $ 45 price tag was steep , she figured that by the time she , her fiancé , her fiancé ’s sister and his father had all read it , “ between the three or four of us that we know immediately who want to read it , it will pay off eventually . ”

“ The sales on Book 1 and Book 2 are so strong that you would n’t want to add Book 3 to the mix immediately , ” Mr. Bogaards said .
According to Nielsen BookScan , which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales , “ The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ” has sold 764,000 copies in hardcover and paperback in the United States , and “ The Girl Who Played With Fire , ” which came out here in July , has sold 199,000 copies in hardcover .
That book was the first work in translation to go to No. 1 on The New York Times hardcover fiction best - seller list in 25 years .
( The last one was “ The Name of the Rose ” by Umberto Eco . )
The series , with its highly idiosyncratic protagonists and reportorial detail , has garnered critical praise along with a growing fan base .
In a review of “ The Girl Who Played with Fire ” in The New York Times , Michiko Kakutani wrote that the series worked because “ Mr. Larsson ’s two central characters , Salander and Blomkvist , transcend their genre and insinuate themselves in the reader ’s mind through their oddball individuality , their professional competence and , surprisingly , their emotional vulnerability . ”
Knopf ’s announced print run for “ The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet ’s Nest , ” scheduled for a May 25 release , is 500,000 copies .
At year 's end , Main St. has had it tough , but D.C. 's influence industry is still raking it in .
Lobbyists on pace for record year
Main Street has had a tough year , losing jobs and seeing little evidence of the economic revival that experts say has already begun .
But K Street is raking it in .

Washington ’s influence industry is on track to shatter last year ’s record $ 3.3 billion spent to lobby Congress and the rest of the federal government — and that ’s with a down economy and about 1,500 fewer registered lobbyists in town , according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics .
Many lobbying firms have escaped the worst of the corporate belt - tightening , thanks , in large part , to the ambitious agenda set out by President Barack Obama — who , ironically , came to Washington with a pledge to break what he considered the undue influence of special - interest lobbyists .
Plenty of sectors have scaled back their K Street spending , including traditional big spenders like real estate and telecommunications .
But Obama ’s push for legislation on health reform , financial reform and climate change has compensated for the grim economic times .
And that ’s after Obama kicked off the year with a massive economic stimulus package — and every major business sector tried to get a piece of the action .
“ Lobbyists love it ... when you ’ve got an activist agenda like this , and you ’ve got serious problems like this , and people want to do something about it , ” said James Thurber , director of American University ’s Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies .
“ It is the most active time that I have ever seen in the advocacy business — from 1973 on , ” Thurber added .
“ We ’ve never had as good a year , ” said one lobbyist whose shop deals mostly with financial services and health care issues .
“ It ’s been a tremendously busy year , and it ’s going to keep getting that way , ” the lobbyist said , noting that both health care and financial reform will remain active as congressional action moves from drafting legislation to implementation to the inevitable fixes .
The year - end lobbying expenditure figures do n’t come out until late January , but Thurber and others predict that the top line number will exceed the $ 3.3 billion spent in 2008 .
Groups spent $ 2.5 billion during the first three quarters of 2009 , which is a slightly faster quarterly pace than 2008 , according to CRP .
And the fourth quarter has been a particularly busy time on Capitol Hill , with the House passing health care and financial reform bills and the Senate digging in on health care , too .
Health care has provided a particular jolt to the lobbying business , insiders say , since the scope of the legislation outstrips any health efforts in recent history .
“ This was the biggest , most broad attempt at passing legislation that we ’ve seen .
This is even bigger or more broad than ’ 93 , ” said Bill Pierce , senior vice president and health care guru at APCO Worldwide , referring to President Bill Clinton ’s attempt at health care reform .
“ It touches all the various parts of the entire health care environment .
... Everybody has some dog in the fight . ”
And the lobbying expenditure figures do n’t include the heaps of cash interest groups are throwing at advertising , coalition - building , grass - roots and Astroturf outreach — all of which do n’t get reported in the figures .
Advocacy groups have spent almost $ 200 million on ads on the health care issue so far this year , according to Campaign Media Analysis Group .
The legislation ’s reach has drawn in an almost - encyclopedic expanse of interest and corporate groups — from activists on both sides of the abortion debate , to MoveOn.org and FreedomWorks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to health insurance companies .
“ That does n’t happen every day .
When it does happen , you get this great deal of money being pumped into the political system on the lobbying end because all of these folks feel like they need to be a participant , and that if they do n’t participate , they do so at their own peril , ” said Dave Levinthal , a spokesman for CRP , a nonpartisan , nonprofit watchdog group .
Nearly $ 400 million has been spent on health care lobbying during the first nine months of 2009 , according to CRP ’s data .
A closer look at some of the health care lobbying expenditures shows just how high the stakes are .
PhRMA , a top trade group for drug makers , spent as much as it did in all of 2008 — $ 20.2 million — during the first nine months of 2009 .
America ’s Health Insurance Plans is also on pace to outspend its 2008 lobbying budget , spending $ 6.3 million during the first nine months of this year .
The Obama administration ’s determination to revamp the nation ’s financial rules and regulatory structure has fueled a somewhat less broad but no less intense advocacy business .
Lobbyists for the industry describe working nonstop since last August , when the financial system started to crumble , through the fight for the $ 700 billion bailout last fall .
This year , they ’ve battled several attempts by Democrats to pass so - called cramdown legislation allowing bankruptcy judges to modify troubled mortgages and fought — ultimately unsuccessfully — against strict new credit card rules , among other policy battles .
All this while the industry must keep up with the larger financial reform bill , which is moving through Congress .
“ If it were n’t for the crisis , that bill could have easily taken four years , minimum , ” observed one exhausted financial lobbyist of the bill that the House passed Dec. 11 .
The Credit Union National Association has already spent about $ 650,000 more than it did during the same period last year and is on track to spend “ considerably more ” lobbying than it did in 2008 , said John Magill , the trade association ’s senior vice president of legislative affairs .
“ It ’s been such a frantic pace this year .
The Congress has churned out so many things , ” he said , ticking off a list that includes financial reform , credit card legislation , new bank overdraft rules and credit unions ’ ongoing battle to raise the amount they can lend to small businesses .
Magill said that the lobbying expenditures CUNA reports to Congress do n’t take into account its extensive grass - roots efforts , such as the 5,000 members that “ hiked the Hill ” last spring or the approximately 650 who flew into town the week the House debated the financial reform bill on the floor .
Magill credits that grass - roots lobbying for the defeat of a House bill on a cramdown amendment , which came after the House passed a similar measure earlier in the year .
While times may be good for lobbyists , there ’s a more dismal lesson to be learned from the relentless upward trend of lobbying spending that appears undaunted by even a massive recession : Lobbying is seen as an issue of political and economic survival in this town .
“ If lobbying the federal government did not work , people would n’t spend money doing it , ” Levinthal said .
Intel held a press event in downtown San Francisco on Wednesday .
It was another Terascale event — Terascale being the company 's test - bed for many - core technologies , and not an actual product .
But the 48 - core , Single - chip Cloud Computer ( SCC ) that Intel demonstrated is a lot closer to being a viable product than the 80 - core " Polaris " chip that the chipmaker first unveiled in 2007 .
The 45nm SCC has much in common with Polaris , which I described in detail in the article linked above .
Like Polaris , the cores are arranged into 27 " tiles , " but each SCC tile contains two cores , two L2 caches ( one per core ) , and one router that connects the tile to rest of the SCC 's packet - switched mesh network .
Also like Polaris , there is some amount of granularity for doing software - controlled dynamic power management by altering the voltage and frequency of the cores .
With SCC , each two - core tile can have its own frequency , and the voltage of tiles can be scaled in groups of four tiles .
Taken together , these options let Intel scale the power consumption of the chip from 25 W up to 125W .
The individual cores that make up SCC are considerably more substantial than those that made up Polaris .
The Polaris cores contained some floating - point hardware suitable only for DSP - type applications .
The SCC cores , in contrast , are full - blown x86 implementations , albeit incredibly simple ones .
If you divide the SCC 's 1.3 billion transistors by 48 cores , then you get about 27 million transistors per core .
But each core is actually smaller than that , because the 24 tiles contain networking hardware that looks like it takes up roughly 6.5 percent of each tile ; so it 's more like 25 million transistors per core .
This is a little over half the transistor count of Atom ( 47 million ) , and a little more than the transistor count of the AMD K7 ( 22 million ) .
So we 're not talking steller single - threaded performance — but definitely enough to run an OS instance and do plenty of useful work .
In fact , if Intel wanted to commercialize the SCC tomorrow , many datacenters would probably eat it up if the price was right .
We 've covered the physicalization trend extensively here at Ars , and the SCC would be the perfect platform for it .
In fact , it 's likely that the best way to use the SCC would be to run one virtualized OS instance per core , so that you could do dynamic power management by shuffling the VMs from core to core in order to keep hot spots from forming on the chip .
The SCC runs a customized version of Linux , and it's likely that the part of the OS that Intel has most heavily modified is the network stack .
A section of my previous Terascale coverage is worth reproducing in full , because it 's relevant to this point :
[ Intel technology strategist Thom ]
Sawicki said that part of the challenge that Intel sees with massively multicore computing lies in how to handle the IP network stack .
If each core were to have its own IP address , then you would n't necessarily want all those cores to go through the entire network stack every time they want to talk to each other .
" Would it make sense to take a NIC / MAC - type functionality , where for an 80 - core chip ten of those are an integrated NIC / MAC function , or am I better off trying to infuse some of the network functions and logic into each core ? " asked Sawicki .
" Where is the proper and best breakdown of what gets done today in a peripheral device vs. what part of the stack gets done in the CPU ?
We get to play with all these [ options ] , " he said , " and that 's the work under way in the lab .
We 'll start seeing over time what the answers are . "
Because the cores in SCC can each run an OS instance , Intel and its partners can play with different networking arrangements on the software side and see what works best .
Speaking of partners , Intel is building 100 of these SCC prototypes to share with internal groups and external partners to further parallel programming research .
Right now , some academics are making do with FPGA for this sort of research , so having real many - core silicon will be a big step up .

Let 's take the model for just war as presented in the Catechism of the Catholic Church , to which Blair will have committed when he converted to Rome on leaving office .
It could n't be clearer .
" Once all peace efforts have failed " ( so Blair 's war already does n't qualify ) " legitimate defence by military force " may be used if the following criteria apply :
" The damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting , grave and certain " ( there were no WMDs ) ; " all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective " ( chief weapons inspector Hans Blix wanted more time ) ; " there must be a serious prospect of success " ( no planning was made for success ) ; " the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated " .
On that last point , just look at post - invasion Iraq , not to mention Afghanistan , or for that matter July 7 , 2005 in London .
The Wall Street Journal recently published an article by Daniel Henninger critical of scientists who allowed the culture of Climategate to develop in their professions .
Christopher Essex , a leading Canadian applied mathematician and award - winning author , has written to Henninger .
Dear Daniel
My friend Willie Soon passed on an article from your “ Wonder Land ” column .
It ’s very good .
It is an angle that I have anticipated for a very long time .
Wonderland is certainly where I have been trapped for more than twenty years .
But it is not nearly as nice as Alice ’s version .
Thoughts of the inquisition come to mind instead .
Many of we scientists have been ringing the alarm bells from the beginning on this .
We have been telling everyone who would listen about who we were dealing with .
We have known all along .
Climategate is no surprise at all to us .
Evidence for this is in my book with Ross McKitrick from 2002 , Taken by Storm .
It won a $ 10,000 prize , and is now in a second edition .
But few were listening .
If my book had a title like Oh , my God , we are all going to die , I am sure that it would have been on the NYT bestseller list at once .
Even though I understand where you are coming from , I find it rings flat with me to have to face people asking where the scientists were when we were overcoming so many many obstacles to get a rare fair hearing .
The scientists have been tied up and gagged in the back room .
I hate that .
We were there screaming our lungs out all along .
Damn it all , my friends Ross McKitrick and Steve McIntyre had to have a hearing before US congress to get that ridiculous hockey stick broken !
It should have been a simple matter .
The thing could hardly hold together under its own weight .
Ross and I had a whole chapter on the hockey stick in our book , long before that controversy came to light .
We used similar techniques to compute the US GDP with tree rings back to the year 1000 , and we got a lovely hockey stick .
I did not want in on the original hockey stick paper , because of my objections to the merits of the underlying physics , but I did comment on the drafts .
In the second edition , there is an account of how the thing got broken by Ross and Steve .
That science needed to get settled in Congress should have got people ’s attention right there that there was something seriously wrong .
Science is alive and well in the individual scientists who are not caught up in gaming the system for bigger grants .
I call it small science .
Many of them are doing very unfashionable things , and are happy to get no recognition for it .
That is where you can find the real scientists .
That is where the future will be .
A milestone in this mess can be said to be when John Houghton of the IPCC said it was the IPCC ’s job to “ orchestrate ” the views of science .
Everything that has happened flows as an inevitable consequence of that .
Some important research fields have been “ orchestrated ” out of existence .
Even before Climategate , I have been saying that we have set ourselves back a generation by taking the money from governments with so many strings attached .
Governments leaders wanted something where they could absolve themselves of the responsibility for making informed decisions .
They would have to read science stuff otherwise .
They ordered up a kind of unnatural scientist that would tell them precisely what they wanted to hear .
But they gave the puppeteers clubs to deal with those of us who remained true .
And the perps of Climategate are what they got .
All of my colleagues have had to endure these bullies and criminals for a very long time .
You should understand that ( real ) scientists have had to pay the heaviest price for the creation of these monsters for decades .
And they were not created by us .
Best wishes ,
Christopher

It 's pleasing to see , in the storm of commentary over Professor David Nutt 's sacking as the government 's chief drugs adviser , that everyone outside politics now recognises the importance of scientific evidence in devising laws .
But a strange reasoning twitch has appeared , in the arguments of politicians and rightwing commentators .
Science can tell us about the molecules , they say , about their effect on the body and the risks .
But policy is separate : a matter for judgment calls on social and ethical issues .
Only politicians , they say , can determine the correct way to send out a clear message to the public .
It is not a matter for science .
This is wrong .
Alongside research into the risks of drugs , lots of work has also been done on the deterrent impact of different laws , classifications and levels of enforcement .
As every piece of research has its own imperfections ( and nobody has yet conducted a randomised controlled trial on drugs policy ) you can make your own mind up about whether you find the results compelling .
One strategy is to compare different countries .
A World Health Organisation study from 2008 , published in the academic journal PLOS Medicine , compared drug use and enforcement regimes around the world .
It was clear : " Globally , drug use is not distributed evenly and is not simply related to drug policy , since countries with stringent user - level illegal drug policies did not have lower levels of use than countries with liberal ones . "
Alternatively , you can compare drug use between states within one country , if they have very different enforcement regimes , as when parts of the US liberalised their laws a few decades ago .
In 1976 Stuart and colleagues found that cannabis use in Ann Arbor , Michigan , was not affected by reductions in cannabis penalties , when compared with three neighbouring communities which kept penalties the same .
In 1981 Saveland & Bray looked at national drug use surveys from 1972 to 1977 and found cannabis use was higher in " decriminalised " states , before and after changes in the law .
When they looked at rates of change , although cannabis use was increasing everywhere , the most rapid increase was in the states with the most severe penalties .
In the same year , Johnson and colleagues used survey data on high school use and found decriminalisation had no effect on attitudes or beliefs about drugs .
These studies are old , but only because the liberalisations they rely on for data happened a long time ago .
Another line of evidence comes from " before and after " studies , when laws are changed .
Cannabis use in the UK dropped after cannabis was moved from class B to class C. Prohibition of alcohol in the US from 1920 to 1933 is the most famous example : alcohol use fell dramatically when prohibition began , and the price of alcohol rose to 318 % of its previous level .
By 1929 this initial impact had begun to wear off and rapidly : alcohol consumption had risen to 70 % of pre-prohibition levels , and was still rising when prohibition was repealed , and the price had fallen to 171 % of pre-prohibition levels .
This reversion to old patterns of use occurred despite escalating spending on enforcement , up 600 % over the same period .
There are many more examples .
This is not an unresearchable question .
There are other factors at play in all of these studies , and if they are not sufficiently rigorous for the government , or a brief informal dip into the literature is not enough , ( it should n't be ) then they should commission more research : because it is a tenet of evidence - based policy that if you discover a gap , you commission work to fill it .
This work is important for one simple reason .
If you wish to justify a policy that will plainly increase the harms associated with each individual act of drug use , by creating violent criminal gangs as distributors , driving the sale of contaminated black market drugs , blighting the careers of users caught by the police , criminalising three million people , and so on , then people will reasonably expect , as a trade - off , that you will also provide good quality evidence showing that your policy achieves its stated aim of reducing the overall numbers of people using drugs .

1. Consider the trade - story as if it describes two separate trades , where :
In the first trade , the man buys something for $ 60 and sells it again for $ 70 , so he makes a profit of $ 10 .
In the second trade , the man buys something for $ 80 and sells it again for $ 90 , so he makes again a profit of $ 10 .
Conclusion :
The man makes an overall profit of $ 10 + $ 10 = $ 20 .
You can also look at the problem as follows :
The total expenses are $ 60 + $ 80 = $ 140 and the total earnings are $ 70 + $ 90 = $ 160 .
The overall profit is therefore $ 160 - $ 140 = $ 20 .

4 . There are 5 women , 1 man and 14 children .
5 . Here are the answers .
Cubes that have at least two sides painted in different colours are 24 + 8 = 32 .
Cubes that have only one side painted are 24 .
Cubes that have no side painted =
8 . Cubes that have exactly one side not painted =
0 .
6 . There are actually 204 squares on a chessboard .
Surprised !
Here is the explanation .
There are 64 ( 1x1 ) squares .
There are 49 ( 2x2 ) squares .
There are 36 ( 3x3 ) squares .
There are 25 ( 4x4 ) squares .
There are 16 ( 5x5 ) squares .
There are 9 ( 6x6 ) squares .
Then there are 4 ( 7x7 ) squares and 1 big 8x8 square .
So , there are a total of 204 squares on a normal chessboard .
7. One Apple
8. Man 1 will shout first .
If Man1 will not shout then Man 2 surely shouts .
Reason : Man 1 can see the other two criminals ?
hats .
If the hats are same color then he told his hat is opposite color of remaining two hats .
So he shouts first .
If Man 1 does not shout , it means that the hats of Man 2 and Man 3 are of different color .
So Man 2 sees the color of Man 3 hat and he tells that the color of his hat is opposite to the color of Man 3 Hat .
9 . With two people , there is one handshake .
With three people , there are three handshakes .
With four people , there are six handshakes .
In general , with n+1 people , the number of handshakes is the sum of the first n consecutive numbers : 1+2+3+...+n.
Since this sum is n( n+1 ) / 2 , we need to solve the equation n( n+1 ) /2 = 66 .
This is the quadratic equation n2+n - 132 =
0 . Solving for n , we obtain 11 as the answer and deduce that there were 12 people at the party .

Fill the 3 - litre bottle and pour it into the empty 5 - litre bottle .
Fill the 3 - litre bottle again , and pour enough to fill 5 - litre bottle .
This leaves exactly 1 litre in the 3 - litre bottle .
Empty the 5 - litre bottle ; pour the remaining 1 litre from the 3 - litre bottle into the 5 - litre bottle .
Fill the 3 - litre bottle and pour it into the 5 - litre bottle .
The 5 - litre bottle now has exactly 4 litres .
11 . 7 + 2 + 5 = 143542 .
Explanation : a + b + c leads to a 6 - digit number .
The first and second digits are the product of a and b .
The third and fourth digits are the product of a and c .
The fifth and sixth digits are b*( a+c ) with the digits of the solution reversed .
12 . 4 Years .
Explanation :
Let the ages of children be x , ( x + 3 ) , ( x + 6 ) , ( x + 9 ) and ( x + 12 ) years .
Then , x + ( x + 3 ) + ( x + 6 ) + ( x + 9 ) + ( x + 12 ) = 50 i.e. 5 x = 20 and x =
4 .
So , the age of the youngest child ( x ) is 4 years .
13 .
The difference between the two digits of that number is 4 .
Explanation :
Let the ten 's digit be x and unit 's digit be y .
Then , ( 10x+y ) - ( 10y+x ) = 36 i.e. 9 ( x-y ) = 36 and that results to x-y = 4 .

To find the correct switch ( 1 , 2 or 3 ) , turn switch 1 to ON and leave it like that for a few minutes .
After that you turn switch 1 back to OFF , and turn switch 2 to ON .
Now enter the room .
If the light bulb is lit , then you know that switch 2 is connected to it .
If the bulb is not lit , then it has to be switch 1 or 3 .
Now touching the light bulb will give you the answer .
If the bulb is still hot , then switch 1 is connected to the bulb ; if the bulb is cold , then it has to be switch 3 .

Since the water - lily doubles its size every day and the complete pool is covered after 20 days , half of the pool will be covered one day before that , so 19 days .
17. 16 days .
Since the snail moves up 1 meter a day so it will reach 15 meters in 15 days .
next day it will again climb 5 meters upward and reaches the top .
Defense spending : I ’m a hawk , but give me a break
I believe in a strong national defense .
But I do n’t think buying jets , ships , and anti-missile systems is necessarily the best way to improve the nation ’s security right now .
In the long term , one of the best ways to make the country strong is to spend more on national infrastructure and especially education .
Without the GI Bill , my father probably would n’t have gotten to college .
As it happened , he wound up going from growing up poor in rural Wyoming to teaching at Harvard .
I also understand that military operations are expensive .
Got it .
I want to support soldiers , give them what they need .
I am all for building day care centers on military bases and buying good body armor .
I can even live with $ 1.2 billion being given to combat commanders for CERP money ( i.e. , " walking around money " ) .
But there is a whole lot of defense spending that simply stuns me .
Here are a few examples from the current FY 2010 defense appropriations bill :
$ 4.4 billion for two Navy destroyers and one littoral combat ship .
Yow .
Maybe it is time to start buying warships from South Korea , or at least invite competitive bids ?
Folks , this is billions , not millions .
Imagine what $ 4.4 billion could do to rebuild our highways , or send deserving kids to college , or rebuild New Orleans .
$ 2.6 billion for V - 22 aircraft for the Marines and Air Force .
I wish the Marines had just gone with the UH - 60 Black Hawk two decades ago .
Now the Marines have dug a hole that is killing the rest of their aviation .
It makes me wonder whether the Marines , the smallest of the armed forces , should be in the business of technology innovation .
$ 1 billion for Navy F - 18s .
Lots of money for an airplane that is , well , yeeehh .
Better spent on unmanned combat aircraft ?
This list makes me wonder just how out of touch with the country ’s economy our military leaders are .
This makes it more understandable how they could think that that the scandal over triple - dipping generals being paid millions of dollars to " mentor " is no biggie .

Sen .
Lieberman plans to join with Republicans to filibuster any health care bill that contains a public option .
Alone , the Republicans do n't have the votes for a filibuster .
So by joining with them , Lieberman would be tipping the balance of power in order to sink health care reform .
We need to push the leaders of the Democratic caucus to take a tough stand against Lieberman .
Last year , the New York Times quoted an anonymous " member of the Senate Democratic leadership " who said about Lieberman :
" We need every vote .
He 's with us on everything but the war . "
But now Joe Lieberman has announced that he will support the filibuster of any for a health care bill that contains the public option .
He justifies this position by saying that a government - run health insurance option will cost taxpayers and increase the National Debt even though the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) forecasts $ 100 billion in savings thanks to the public option .
He further claims that his position is what is best for his constituents , even though polling in Connecticut shows that among likely voters 68 percent favor a public option , while only 21 percent oppose it .
Now is the time for Senate Democratic leadership -- Senators Reid , Schumer , and Durbin -- to stop making excuses for Joe Lieberman .
Harry Reid has shown great leadership in writing a health care bill that includes the public option .
But Joe Lieberman is not " with us " on everything but the war .
Joe Lieberman 's position is against Senate Democrats , against his constituents in Connecticut and against the will of the American public .
Actions must have consequences .
Any senator who filibusters the public option does not deserve a chairmanship and should be removed from his or her post .
Our pals at CREDO Mobile and Democrats.com are gathering signatures for a petition to remove Lieberman from his chairmanship if he bolts to the Republicans -- as he says he has decided to do -- and filibusters the health care reform bill .
We do n't push too many petitions here but this is one I really recommend you consider signing .
It makes more sense than most , to begin with : Lieberman and his wife have taken millions of dollars in barely disguised bribes from the insurance industry and Medical - Industrial Complex , she as one of Washington 's more notorious K Street Whores , he as a senator always willing to sell his votes to the highest corporate bidder .
There 's no way to know precisely how much money she 's been paid as a lobbyist for these sleazy characters -- it 's widely believed to be in the millions -- but the hypocritical senator from Connecticut has gobbled up $ 1,037,402 from Big Insurance and another $ 2,397,369 directly from the " Health " lobby .
Much more to the liking of Big Insurance and the vested interests Lieberman always sides with against his own constituents is the joke of a " reform " bill Boehner has finally managed to come up with ( he says ) .
The Boehner bill , according to the Wall Street Journal " would n't seek to prevent health - insurance companies from denying sick people insurance . "
This bill , based on a deliberate campaign of Republican lies , distortions and fear - mongering , is the bill Lieberman will feel the most affinity with .
It 's also the bill Mormon Senator Orrin Hatch supports , but for very bizarre reasons .
Hatch fears that the Democratic reforms will be so popular with Americans that no one will ever vote for the GOP again .
He actually told CNSNews.com that the success of health care reform would be a threat to the two - party system .
There 's not much we can do about Hatch ... but please sign the petition to Harry Reid and Dick Durbin in regard to Lieberman .
And then treat yourself to some Drunken Sufis :

" The total number of x86 instructions is well above one thousand " ( !!)
" (!!)
" CPU dispatching ... makes the code bigger , and it is so costly in terms of development time and maintenance costs that it is almost never done in a way that adequately optimizes for all brands of CPUs . "
" the decoding of instructions can be a serious bottleneck , and it becomes worse the more complicated the instruction codes are "
The costs of supporting obsolete instructions is not negligible .
You need large execution units to support a large number of instructions .
This means more silicon space , longer data paths , more power consumption , and slower execution .
Summarized : Intel and AMD 's proprietary x86 additions cost us all money .
How much is hard to calculate , but our CPUs are consuming extra energy and underperform as decoders and execution units are unnecessary complicated .
The software industry is wasting quite a bit of time and effort supporting different extensions .
Should 99 % of market lose money and flexibility because 1 % of the market might get a performance boost ?
Not convinced , still thinking that this only concerns the HPC crowd ?
The virtualization platforms contain up to 8 % more code just to support the incompatible virtualization instructions which are offering almost exactly the same features .
Each VMM is 4 % bigger because of this .
So whether you are running Hyper -V , VMware ESX or Xen , you are wasting valuable RAM space .
It is not dramatic of course , but it unnecessary waste .
Much worse is that this unstandarized x86 extention mess has made it a lot harder for datacenters to make the step towards a really dynamic environment where you can load balance VMs and thus move applications from one server to another on the fly .
It is impossible to move ( vmotion , live migrate ) a VM from Intel to AMD servers , from newer to ( some ) older ones , and you need to fiddle with CPU masks in some situations just to make it work ( and read complex tech documents ) .
The reason why Intel and AMD still continue with this is that some people inside feel that can create a " competitive edge " .
I believe this " competitive edge " is neglible : how many people have bought an Intel " Nehalem " CPU because it has the new SSE 4.2 instructions ?
How much software is supporting yet another x86 instruction addition ?
Agner Fog , a Danish expert in software optimization is making a plea for an open and standarized procedure for x86 instruction set extensions .
Af first sight , this may seem a discussion that does not concern most of us .
After all , the poor souls that have to program the insanely complex x86 compilers will take care of the complete chaos called " the x86 ISA " , right ?
Why should the average the developer , system administrator or hardware enthusiast care ?
Agner goes in great detail why the incompatible SSE - x.x additions and other ISA extensions were and are a pretty bad idea , but let me summarize it in a few quotes :
So I fully support Agner Fog in his quest to a ( slightly ) less chaotic and more standarized x86 instruction set .
Editor 's note : Ed Rollins , a senior political contributor for CNN , is senior presidential fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University .
He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
New York ( CNN ) --
The gate crashers Michaele and Tareq Salahi want to be famous as stars of reality television .
I am all for that .
Give them a reality television series and call it " Trial and Jailtime " in the D.C. criminal justice system .
This despicable , desperate , duplicitous couple disgraced the Secret Service and embarrassed the president in his home .
They totally overshadowed the president 's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , the leader of an important ally .
The incident made the Obamas ' first state dinner , honoring the prime minister and his wife , Gursharan Kaur , fodder for comedians -- and it certainly raises security concerns for other world leaders visiting at later dates .
The gate - crashers need to be held accountable and not glorified .
Unless they have some excuse we have n't heard yet , the Salahis deserve to be charged with criminal trespassing and lying to federal officers for starters .
Yes , they dressed for the occasion , but the Salahis are no different , and should n't be regarded any differently , than a nut case who jumps over the White House fence and tries to run in the front door .
The only difference is that the fence - jumper would be shot ten feet from his entrance point .
I worked in a couple of White Houses and have always had the greatest respect for the Secret Service .
These men and women put their lives on the line daily and often serve in long and tedious tours of duty .
I worked in the White House when President Reagan was shot and I saw the extraordinary bravery of Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy , who was critically wounded when he took a bullet in the stomach after turning and putting his body between the president and the shooter , John Hinckley .
But for all the bravery of its agents , the Secret Service lives in a world that demands zero defects .
So I have to tell you I am appalled at the comments by the Secret Service spokesman who was described as saying it had n't been determined whether party - crashing is technically illegal .
He went on to say he did n't believe the Salahis posed a security risk .
Spin control is not needed now .
Responsibility is the key word .
Trespassing is illegal .
How does the Secret Service know whether the Salahis were a risk or not ?
The service apparently had not done a background check on them -- unlike every other guest and government employee in the tent that night -- because they were n't on the invitation list .
Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan issued a rare apology , saying the service took full responsibility for the episode and was " deeply concerned and embarrassed . "
Not good enough !
He needs to determine who was responsible for letting the Salahis onto the White House grounds and fire whoever it was , before he thinks about offering his own resignation .
Public servants have to be held accountable and now is a good time to start .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has fired some of the top people in the military because they were not performing at the level he expected .
Can Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , whose department oversees the Secret Service , expect any less ?
Can an agency , Homeland Security , that has responsibility for securing our borders be trusted if it cannot even secure the White House ?
We live in a world of reality television in which egotists try to be famous for three minutes and land an appearance on the talk shows .
The bigger question is what example this sets for our kids .
If we glorify the actions of people like the Salahis and do n't hold them accountable , how do we teach our kids what is right and what is wrong ?
The Salahis claim there 's more to the story .
Their lawyer says they were n't crashing the party , but the Secret Service says otherwise .
Based on the facts as we know them so far , there 's a simple way to deal with this case .
Charge them , prosecute them , and if a D.C. jury finds them guilty , jail them .
Make an example out of them .
Then next November when the president is pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey , he can pardon them too .
And after the pardon , as is traditional for the turkeys whose lives are spared , they can go live in Disney World -- a fantasy world that seems to be the perfect place for this pair .

Recently several of us have been making a lot of noise about “ structural set theory , ” also known as “ categorical ” or “ categorial ” set theory .
This phrase refers to a general class of theory akin to Lawvere ’s ETCS , which describes sets from a purely “ structural ” point of view .
A brief way to say this is that we care only about the category of sets , in which isomorphic sets are indistinguishable , rather than the class of sets equipped with a global membership relation ∈ \in .
In structural set theory , which claims to be closer to the way sets are actually used in most mathematics , it does n’t make sense to ask whether ( for instance ) 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 , since 3 3 and 17 17 are elements of the set N N but not sets themselves .
Rather than coming with an intricate set - membership structure , sets in structural set theory are simply the “ raw material ” with which we build mathematical structures such as groups , rings , spaces , manifolds — and even “ set- membership structures ” !
This is sort of a continuation of this post , but it should also stand mostly alone .
I ’ll also summarize some of the things I learned from this previous discussion .
I believe the word structural originally comes from the philosophy of mathematics called “ structuralism , ” according to which
mathematical theories … describe structures .
…
Structures consist of places that stand in structural relations to each other .
One prominent exponent of this philosophy was Paul Benacerraf , who pointed out in his paper “ What numbers could not be ” that set - theoretic foundations such as ZFC do not adequately describe the way we really think about mathematical objects such as numbers .
In ZFC , one has to define the number 3 3 as some particular set , such as the von Neumann ordinal { ∅ , { ∅ } , { ∅ , { ∅ } } } \{\emptyset , \{\emptyset\} , \{\emptyset , \{\emptyset\}\}\} .
But this then allows us to ask questions such as “ is 17 ∈ 3 17 \in 3 ? ” ( which , with this definition , is false ) or “ is 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 ? ” ( which , with this definition , is true ) .
Many mathematicians would regard these questions as meaningless .
If numbers are sets , then they must be particular sets , for each set is some particular set .
But if the number 3 is really one set rather than another , it must be possible to give some cogent reason for thinking so ; for the position that this is an unknowable truth is hardly tenable .
( Benacerraf 1965 )
Benacerraf imagined a student named Ernie who defined the natural numbers as the von Neumann ordinals 0 = ∅ 0 =\emptyset , 1 = { 0 } 1=\{0\} , 2 = { 0 , 1 } 2 = \{0,1\} , 3 = { 0 , 1 , 2 } 3 = \{0,1,2\} , and another named Johnny who defined them as 0 = ∅ 0 =\emptyset , 1 = { 0 } 1=\{0\} , 2 = { 1 } 2=\{1\} , 3 = { 2 } 3 = \ {2\} .
When Ernie and Johnny met , they could not agree on whether 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 or not .
Benacerraf concluded that numbers can not be sets .
So what matters , really , is not any condition on the objects ( that is , on the set ) but rather a condition on the relation under which they form a progression ….
what is important is not the individuality of each element but the structure which they jointly exhibit ….
the question of whether a particular “ object ” — for example , { { { ∅ } } } \{\{\ {\emptyset\}\}\} — would do as a replacement for the number 3 would be pointless in the extreme … the whole system performs the job or nothing does .
( Benacerraf 1965 )
That is ,
To be the number 3 is no more and no less than to be preceded by 2 , 1 , and possibly 0 , and to be followed by 4 , 5 , and so forth .
( Benacerraf 1965 )
Some years earlier , Bourbaki had given an important role to the notion of structure in writing their Elements of Mathematics .
One can argue that when we look around us at mathematics , what we see everywhere are structures .
The natural numbers are just one example .
Another is the real numbers ( are they “ really ” Cauchy sequences or Dedekind cuts ? ) .
Likewise cartesian products ( is an ordered pair ( a , b ) ( a , b ) “ really ” { a , { a , b } } \{a , \{a , b\}\} ? ) .
Everywhere what we see are structures like groups , rings , fields , topological spaces , manifolds , etc. defined by equipping one or more sets with functions and relations , and which we only care about determining up to structure - respecting isomorphism .
The study of structure can be “ coded ” within a set theory such as ZFC , but it remains a “ coding ” — as Benacerraf pointed out , there is extraneous information in any ZFC - set which must be forgotten about in order to study structure .
In Bourbaki ’s Theory of Sets they defined a general notion of “ structure ” : one or more sets together with an element of some set obtained from these by iterating products and power sets , satisfying suitable axioms .
For example , a toplogical space would be specified by a single set X X and an element of P ( P ( X ) ) P ( P ( X ) ) ( the set of open subsets of X X ) .
A group could be specified by a set G G and an element of G × P ( G × G × G ) G\times P( G\times G\times G ) ( the identity together with the graph of the multiplication ) .
In their general theory , Bourbaki specifically restricted the allowable axioms for such structures to those which would be invariant under isomorphisms of the carrier sets .
In other words , they specifically had to say “ now we forget about all those irrelevant bits and remember only what we want . ”
There are even ways to make this “ forgetting ” precise .
One way , which I believe has mostly been pursued by philosophers following Benacerraf , is to introduce “ structure ” as a notion living at a higher level of abstraction than sets .
That is , “ the natural numbers ” are a “ structure , ” not a “ set , ” which is a “ way of talking at once about all sets that might represent the natural numbers . ”
I do n’t know whether this has been made into a formal mathematical theory .
Another way of doing things structurally in a ZF - like theory is to postulate a global choice operator , meaning an operator ε \varepsilon such that if P P is a property where there exists any x x with P ( x ) P( x ) , then ε x .
P ( x ) \varepsilon x. P( x ) is guaranteed to be such an x x .
We can then define , for instance , “ the ” natural numbers to be ε x .
P ( x ) \varepsilon x. P( x ) where P ( x ) P( x ) is essentially “ x x is a natural numbers object in Set Set ” .
All we have to do then is show that there exists some NNO , which we can do with either of Ernie or Johnny ’s constructions ( or many others , of course ) .
How does this solve the problem ?
Well , since nothing is assumed about ε x .
P ( x ) \varepsilon x. P( x ) or its elements except that P P is true of it , we ca n’t assert any statement like 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 .
However , since ℕ \mathbb{N} is still some particular set , such statements still have a definite truth value ( in any model ) ; we can just never discover what it is .
So this essentially amounts to resolving the dispute between Ernie and Johnny by having a teacher come over and say “ One of you is right and one of you is wrong about whether 3 ∈ 17 3 \ in 17 , but I ’m not going to tell you which is which .
All I ’m going to tell you is that ℕ \mathbb{N} is a set that satisfies a certain list of properties which both of you can prove from your definitions , so those properties are all you ’re ever allowed to use . ”
Bourbaki used such a choice operator , as does Arnold Neumaier ’s proposed foundation FMathL .
Personally , I find this a rather unsatisfying resolution of the issue .
To me it makes much more sense to say that 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 is a meaningless statement than that it has a definite truth value we are merely unable to discover .
This is a philosophical point rather than a mathematical one , but of course the whole issue is a philosophical one , once both types of theory are adequate as foundations .
I believe Arnold has said that his aimed - at computer implementation of FMathL will recognize such statements as undecidable and warn the user about them , but it seems cleaner to me if they are just a syntax error .
A final , and mathematical , point is that assuming a choice operator usually ( and unsurprisingly ) implies the truth of the Axiom of Choice .
Even if you personally have no problem with assuming AC , I think it is unsatisfying for the resolution of a philosophical issue ( how to do mathematics structurally ) to depend on an extremely strong , and a priori unrelated , set - theoretic axiom .
Now , the partisans of structural or categorical set theory contend that it is equivalent in strength to ZFC - like theories ( this much is provable ) and just as adequate as a foundation for mathematics , but it does away with all the extra irrevelant information which always has to be forgotten about anyway .
I believe the first such set theory was Lawvere ’s Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets , which dates to about the same time as Benacerraf .
( I should also mention Todd ’s very nice exposition of ETCS . )
In ETCS , instead of sets with a membership structure ∈ \in as in ZFC , we work with the category of sets , imposing axioms guaranteeing that it has products , exponentials , powersets , and so on .
If we then perform only categorical constructions , the results will automatically be isomorphism - invariant .
For instance , the natural numbers are characterized as a natural numbers object in the category of sets .
The way in which this sort of theory answers Benacerraf ’s objections was put forward eloquently by Colin McLarty in “ Numbers can be just what they have to ” :
… the structuralist program is already fulfilled or obviated , depending on how you look at it , by categorical set theory …
Sets and functions in this theory have only structural properties .
( McLarty 1993 )
McLarty imagines a student named Brittany who has been taught categorical set theory and is quite confused by the difficulties of Ernie and Johnny .
In the following exchange , Ernie is trying to describe the philosophers ’ approach in which “ structure ” lives at a higher level of abstraction than “ sets . ”
… [ Brittany ] asked “ You mean that you define the natural numbers as a certain specific set ? ”
“ Well no , ” he answered , “ The natural numbers are n’t a set , they are a structure .
You see they are n’t uniquely defined . ” …
She asked if it was the same for the real numbers , or the Euclidean plane , and he said it was .
He said all of those are abstract structures , handy ways of talking about sets but not themelves sets and actually not objects at all .
“ So the advantage of your set theory is that mathematicians never work with your sets ! ” she said amazed .
Brittany , of course , can work with sets as objects of the category Set Set , which can only be characterized up to isomorphism .
Thus , for her , nothing can be said about the elements of some NNO other than that they support the structure of an NNO .
The term “ categorical set theory ” is common for theories such as ETCS , but it has the disadvantage that in logic and philosophy , “ categorical ” also has the completely different meaning of “ uniquely determined . ”
This has led some people to use “ categorial set theory ” instead ( note the missing “ c ” ) .
I prefer structural set theory , which among other things stresses the point that such theories do not necessarily depend on category theory .
Of course , ETCS is explicitly about the category of sets ; the first axioms say that “ sets and functions form a category ” .
But there are equivalent theories in which the notion of category is not taken for granted , and in which such facts as the associativity of function composition are proven rather than assumed as axioms .
I ’ve written down one such theory myself as a proof - of - concept , for now called SEAR .
It has the additional advantages of containing “ elements ” of sets as a primitive concept , and not requiring the development of topos theory in order to prove the separation axiom .
In SEAR we are given a collection of sets , together with a collection of elements of each set , and for each pair of sets a collection of ( binary ) relations between those two sets .
One axiom allows us to construct a relation R R from A A to B B by specifying precisely for which pairs of elements a ∈ A a\in A and b ∈ B b\in B it is supposed to hold .
For example , in this way we can define the composite of two relations R : A → B R\colon A \to B and S : B → C S\colon B \to C such that ( S ∘ R ) ( a , c ) ( S\circ R ) ( a , c ) holds just when there exists a b ∈ B b\in B such that R ( a , b ) R( a , b ) and S ( b , c ) S ( b , c ) hold .
Likewise we can define a function to be a relation R : A → B R\colon
A \to B such that for any a ∈
A a\in A there is a unique b ∈ B b\in B with R ( a , b ) R( a , b ) .
And we can prove that sets and functions form a category , in fact that they form a category satisfying the axioms of ETCS .
Conversely , in an ETCS - category we define an “ element ” of a set A A to be a function 1 → A 1 \to A from the terminal object , and a “ relation ” to be a subobject R ↪ A × B R\hookrightarrow A\times B , and we can prove that the basic axioms of SEAR are satisfied .
( SEAR is by default stronger than ETCS , akin to the distinction between ZF and Z ) .
SEAR shows that the distinguishing feature of structural set theories is not that they use category theory , but that they can serve as a foundation for structural mathematics without the need to first forget irrelevant information such as whether 3 ∈ 17 3 \in 17 .
Of course , one cannot get very far in SEAR without defining the category of sets , but one cannot nowadays expect to get very far in most areas of mathematics without defining the category or categories one is working in .
I also believe that SEAR is easier for the non-toposophically - inclined to use as a foundational system than ETCS is , since it includes a “ comprehension axiom ” as basic , rather than having to construct such an axiom out of topos - theoretic structure as in ETCS .
By contrast to structural set theories , I like to refer to ZFC - like set theories as material set theories .
The idea is that in a material set theory , the elements of a set A A are “ material ” and have an existence and identity apart from being an element of A A .
The word “ material ” was suggested by Steve Awodey ; its earliest use that I know of is in his paper “ Structure in mathematics and logic : a categorical perspective ” :
The definition [ of a cartesian product ] provides a uniform , structural characterization of a product of two objects in terms of their relations to other objects and morphisms in a category , in contrast to ‘ material ’ set - theoretic definitions which depend on specific and often irrelevant features of the objects invoved , introducing unwanted additional structure .
Indeed it is just this material aspect of conventional set theory that gives rise to such pseudo - problems as whether the number 1 1 is ‘ really ’ the set { ∅ } \{\emptyset\} , or whether the real numbers are ‘ really ’ cuts in the rationals .
( Awodey 1996 )
Now , the sets in a material set theory are admittedly closer to the natural - language meaning of “ set ” : a set of three sheep can be distinguished from a set of three chairs , and each of the sheep and chairs might also be an element of other sets .
However , the claim is that the sets in a structural set theory are closer to the way sets are used in mathematics .
These “ structural sets ” are also very similar to the types in a type theory ( regarded as the object - theory , as suggested in the previous post ) .
In fact , Toby has convinced me that it ’s difficult to decide exactly where to draw the line between type theory and structural set theory , although there are differences in how the words are most commonly used .
It might be better , terminologically speaking , if mathematicians had used a word such as “ type ” instead of “ set ” all along .
But by now the notion that ( for instance ) a group is a set equipped with an identity and a multiplication is so firmly entrenched in most mathematicians ’ consciousnesses that I think there ’s little point trying to change it .
Anyway , as I mentioned in the previous post , “ set ” and “ type ” and “ class ” are basically fungible words — especially when used structurally .
So what is the relationship between structural and material set theory ?
One direction is easy : the sets in a material set theory will always , by forgetting the superfluous data , form a structural set theory .
In the other direction , one can structurally “ build ” a model of material set theory by constructing “ hereditary membership trees ” and calling them “ sets ” .
See nlab : pure set for a summary ; more detailed versions can be found in chapter VI of Sheaves in Geometry and Logic , or in chapter 9 of Johnstone ’s “ Topos Theory . ”
Thus , the two types of theory are “ equivalent ” in a suitable sense , so at least in principle either one can equally well be used as a foundation .
However , one should not get the impression from this that the way in which structural set theory serves as a foundation is by first using material set theory as a foundation and then interpreting this using membership trees .
The situation is rather the reverse : the way material set theory serves as a foundation for mathematics is by first using structural set theory as a foundation , and then interpreting this in the category of material sets .
The complexity of the construction of membership trees really makes it clear , to me at least , how much superfluous data is carried around when we use material set theory as a foundation for mathematics .
HAMILTON , Ohio , Sept. 12 ( UPI ) -- A 15 - year - old girl in West Chester Township , Ohio , was fatally stabbed while trying to stop a fight involving dozens of teens , neighbors say .
Neighbors said Amber Robinson had been acting as a peacemaker in the clash between as many as 40 young people from West Chester and Hamilton County when she was stabbed once in the back by an assailant , The Cincinnati Enquirer reported Friday .

Dr. Richard Burkhardt , the Butler County coroner , confirmed the single stab wound pierced Robinson 's heart , killing the teen within minutes .
" I asked her , was she OK .
It looked like she took her last breath after that , " local resident Shontonia Brown , 22 , said of Thursday night 's incident .
" There was a whole lot of blood .
A life was taken over ignorance and stupidity .
Her life was taken for nothing . "
The cause of the clash , which followed an afternoon fight in the area , was not reported .
Police charged Khrendon D. Gray , 18 , of Springfield Township with murder and issued an arrest warrant for Rashon Martin , 17 , of Forest Park .
The Enquirer said Gray , who maintains his innocence , was being held on $ 1 million bond .
Health Canada is getting tough with patients who use government - certified medical marijuana , demanding full payment in advance before shipping the weed .
The move , effective Nov. 30 , is designed to halt the rising number of accounts in arrears -- and force more patients to pay off old debts that now total more than $ 1.2 million .
" This change to a purchase - in - advance system will streamline the order and payment process and will prevent further increases to the debt load of the department , " says a recent Health Canada letter issued to users .
More than 4,600 people in Canada are licensed to use medical marijuana to treat a wide range of conditions , including chronic pain , that may not be resolved by standard prescription drugs .
Several court rulings forced a reluctant Health Canada to get into the marijuana business in 2003 so that bona fide patients would not have to rely on the black market for supplies .
Most authorized users grow their own pot or have someone else grow it for them , all under licence , but some 800 are currently buying their medical marijuana from Health Canada .
The government sells dried marijuana for $ 5 a gram -- about half the price of street marijuana -- or 30 seeds for $ 20 , plus GST and provincial taxes .
The marijuana , which has received poor reviews from many users for being harsh and ineffective , has a THC content of about 12.5 per cent .
THC is the main active ingredient of the cannabis plant .
Previously , users could order and pay later .
But hundreds of patients -- who are often seriously ill , unable to work and on welfare or disability pensions -- could not keep up with their Health Canada bills and built up large debts .
Beginning Nov. 30 , Health Canada will require a money order , certified cheque , Visa , Amex or MasterCard before medical marijuana is shipped , normally by courier .
And those customers with accounts currently in arrears must agree to a payment plan with Health Canada before receiving any more product .
Interest accrues on overdue accounts at 3.5 per cent , and Health Canada has sent 31 stale accounts to collections agencies .
Almost 1,100 customers have fallen behind in payments so far , forcing Health Canada to carry some $ 1.2 million in accounts overdue for more than 30 days .
About half of the accounts have been overdue for a year or more .
" This change ( in policy ) does not alter Health Canada 's commitment to providing fair and equitable access to marijuana for medical purposes and . . . will have no impact on the current authorization process , " spokeswoman Christelle Legault said in an email .
" Health Canada is committed to working with persons whose accounts are in arrears , and will work with them through the department 's accounts receivable to establish a payment arrangement plan . "
A few users have their bills picked up by taxpayers .
Last year , Veterans Affairs reversed previous policy and said it will now pay for medical marijuana for any veterans licensed by Health Canada .
At least eight veterans have benefited from the new policy .
Most users , though , cannot recoup the cost of their cannabis from governments because medical marijuana has never been assigned official drug status under the Food and Drug Act and is therefore not covered by any provincial pharmacare programs .
The costs , though , can be deducted as medical expenses when filing annual income - tax forms .
One Health Canada customer in Surrey , B.C. , says he will never be able to pay his $ 4,200 accumulated bill -- and argues he should not have to .
" This is something that 's already paid for by the taxpayer and I should n't be paying it again , " Tim Davison said in an interview .
Davison , 41 , was cut off from Health Canada 's weed about 18 months ago , and now must go to the black market for some of his marijuana , which he uses to control pain and nausea .
" I could incur a smear in my credit report , " he says about his worries over speaking out .
" I could aggravate Health Canada ( and ) they could come at me harder . "
Health Canada has hired Saskatoon - based Prairie Plant Systems to produce and ship the marijuana to authorized users .
For years the company grew the dope in an abandoned underground mine at Flin Flon , Man. , but left the facility in the summer for an undisclosed location .
Department officials have said they will eventually phase out all personal production , forcing patients to order all their dope from the government , perhaps through pharmacy distribution .
A new British independent poll conducted by Ipsos Mori concluded that the people who do the most illegal downloading also buy the most music .
This is in line with many other studies elsewhere and is easy to understand : people who are music superfans do more of everything to do with music : they see more live shows , listen to more radio , buy more CDs , buy more botlegs of live shows , buy more t- shirts , talk about music more , do more downloading — all of it .
And of course , these are the people the music industry 's supergeniuses have set their sights upon for bizarre enforcement regimes like the one that British Business Secretary Peter Mandelson has promised : anyone who lives in a house that generates three or more copyright infringement notices will be barred from Internet access .
" The latest approach from the Government will not help prop up an ailing music industry .
Politicians and music companies need to recognise that the nature of music consumption has changed , and consumers are demanding lower prices and easier access , " said Peter Bradwell , from the think - tank Demos , which commissioned the new poll conducted by Ipsos Mori .
However , music industry figures insist the figures offer a skewed picture .
The poll suggested the Government 's plan to disconnect illegal downloaders if they ignore official warning letters could deter people from internet piracy , with 61 per cent of illegal downloaders surveyed admitting they would be put off downloading music illegally by the threat of having their internet service cut off for a month .
" The people who file - share are the ones who are interested in music , " said Mark Mulligan of Forrester Research .
" They use file - sharing as a discovery mechanism .
We have a generation of young people who do n't have any concept of music as a paid - for commodity , " he continued .
" You need to have it at a price point you wo n't notice . "
Illegal downloaders ' spend the most on music ' , says poll

Fuel cells are highly interesting bits of tech .
Literally moon shot technology brought to earth , they 've been the darling of some green energy types and certain car companies for awhile now .
Mercedes - Benz for instance , arguably the people who invented the automobile , has been making great strides putting fuel cell technology into street cars .
We 've followed Mercedes ' efforts in this arena , from the practical B - Class F - Cell shown above to the the fanciful F - Cell Roadster concept , so we 're excited to hear the Germans say they 're bringing a fuel cell powered B - Class to " select customers " in Europe and America next spring .
The fuel cell drivetrain is going into Mercedes ' B - Class , which could be a German version of the Honda Fit .
It 's a small four - door one - box car perfect for city driving .
The boys from Stuttgart say the B - Class F - Cell , as it's officially called , is the " first electric car fully suited for everyday driving and with the driving dynamics of a two - liter petrol car . "
When it hits the road next year , the hydrogen - hungry B - Class will be the first series - produced fuel cell EV on the road .
Yes , with only 200 planned it is a small - scale production run .
But it is worth noting the cars will be coming to both Europe and America within a few months .
The heart of the F - Cell is an electric drive system without an internal combustion engine as found in something as prosaic as a facile Toyota Prius .
While the fuel cell is generating electrical power on board , it produces little more than pure water and zero emissions .
Naturally , the drivetrain packaging is as unconventional as the power source .
The drive components are sandwiched in the floor , which not only offers more room for people and things but also gives more protection to sensitive and expensive gadgetry .
The B - Class F - Cell offers some advantages over pure EVs , most notably usability .
The B - Class has a range of around 400 kilometers and short refueling times .
Like an EV , it has zero local emissions .
Mercedes says that the performance is comparable to a 2.0 - liter petrol car .
The F - Cell is motivated down the road by a 100 - kilowatt ( 136 horsepower ) electric motor that puts out 213 pound - feet of torque .
The fuel cell is 40 percent smaller than the system used in the 2004 A - Class F - Cell , and Mercedes says it develops 30 percent more power , all the while consuming 30 percent less fuel .
Efficiency - wise , the B - Class F - Cell consumes the equivalent of 3.3 liters of diesel fuel per 100 kilometers in the New European Driving Cycle .
That works out to 85 mpg .
Of course , finding fuel may be a challenge and the it could be decades before hydrogen has any significant impact on gasoline consumption or global warming .
But that 's a whole ' nother story .

Super - short light pulses marks a milestone in optical technology ( Image : Kim Steele / Getty )
A loop of optical fibre spiced with the rare earth metal erbium was used to make the very short pulses of light .
Normal light is sent into one end of the erbium - enriched loop and interacts with the metal atoms to emerge as laser light from the other end .
( Image : University of Konstanz )
A long - elusive goal of physics has been reached – producing a pulse of light so short that it contains just a single oscillation of a light wave .
Advertisement
The flashes are almost as short as a light pulse can be , according to the laws of physics .
The new super - short pulses could used as flashguns to sense very small , very fast events such as a single photon interacting with a single electron , says Alfred Leitenstorfer of the University of Konstanz in Germany .
A single - cycle pulse packs in energy more densely than a pulse containing more wave peaks and troughs .
They could also show the way to boosting data transmission through fibre - optic cables , by shrinking the minimum amount of light needed to encode a single digital 1 or 0 .
Leitenstorfer ’s group shunned the crystalline lasers typically used by physicists looking to make super - short light pulses and used optical - fibre lasers and wavelengths of light like those standard in telecommunications .
Technology milestone
“ Single - cycle pulse generation with an essentially all - fibre system clearly marks a milestone in optical technology , ” says Martin Fermann of laser manufacturer Imra America , who was not involved with the work .
He expects “ the single - cycle regime will become a new standard ” with applications in advanced imaging , sensing and signal processing .
The “ uncertainty principle ” formulated by 20th - century physicist Werner Heisenberg sets a limit on the shortest possible duration of a light pulse of any given wavelength in terms of time or number of cycles .
The research team knew that at the infrared frequencies they were using the uncertainty principle meant they had to get the pulse down to a handful of femtoseconds ( millionths of a billionth of a second ) .
The Konstanz researchers started with pulses from a single fibre laser and split them between two sets of fibres that contained atoms of the rare earth metal erbium to amplify the light waves .
Each fibre then had a second stage that altered the light ’s wavelength , one stretching it by about 40 per cent , the other shrinking it by a similar amount .
The two fibres then converged again , causing the two light beams to interfere with one another in a way that cancelled out most of the waves to leave just a single wave cycle lasting just 4.3 femtoseconds .
Pulses that are even shorter , as short as 3.9 femtoseconds , had been made before using wavelengths nearly 50 per cent shorter .
But the relationship between wavelength and frequency means they were n’t such pure fractions of a light wave , containing between 2 and 1.3 wave cycles .
Fibre key
The key to success , says Leitenstorfer , was using a single source to generate the two light pulses that combined to produce the short pulse .
“ It ’s because it ’s all - fibre technology that we can recombine these two parts , ” he told New Scientist .
“ The biggest challenge in this entire paper was to measure the pulse . ”
A series of the short pulses were compared with each other to verify that they were each only one cycle long .
Further refinements should be possible .
“ We did these experiments in three weeks , ” Leitenstorfer says .
His group say they can remove background noise to make their single cycle stand out more clearly .

New information about lightning - emitted X - rays , gamma rays and high - energy electrons during thunderstorms is prompting scientists to raise concerns about the potential for airline passengers and crews to be exposed to harmful levels of radiation .
Scientists at the Florida Institute of Technology , University of California , Santa Cruz and the University of Florida have estimated that airplane passengers could be exposed to a radiation dose equal to that from 400 chest X - rays if their airplane happens to be near the start of a lightning discharge or related phenomena known as a terrestrial gamma ray flash .
The big unknown : how often -- if ever -- commercial airliners are exposed to these thunderstorm events , because the bursts of radiation occur only over extremely brief periods and extend just a few hundred feet in the clouds .
" We know that commercial airplanes are typically struck by lightning once or twice a year , " said Joe Dwyer , professor of physics and space sciences at Florida Tech .
" What we do n't know is how often planes happen to be in just the right place or right time to receive a high radiation dose .
We believe it is very rare , but more research is needed to answer the question definitively . "
Dwyer is the lead author of a paper about the research set to appear in the Journal for Geophysical Research -- Atmospheres .
Seven researchers from Florida Tech , UC Santa Cruz and UF contributed to the paper .
" Estimation of the fluence of high - energy electron bursts produced by thunderclouds and the resulting radiation doses received in aircraft . "
The authors did not measure high radiation doses directly with airplanes .
Instead , they estimated radiation based on satellite and ground - based observations of X - rays and gamma rays .

The authors " combined observations of lightning - produced X - rays and gamma rays with computer models of the movement of high - energy particles to estimate the amount of radiation that could be produced within , or very near , thunderclouds during lightning storms , " said Hamid Rassoul , a co-author and senior researcher from Florida Tech .
The observations included those made from orbiting satellites of " terrestrial gamma- ray flashes , " or TGFs , mysterious phenomena that appear to originate within thunderstorms at the same altitudes used by jet airliners .
They also included measurements of X - rays and gamma rays from natural lightning on the ground , as well as artificial lightning triggered with wire - trailing rockets fired into storm clouds .
Researchers believe the phenomena are linked , because both produce high levels of gamma rays and X - rays and occur along with the actual lightning flash .
The scientists concluded the radiation in a football field - sized space around these lightning events could reach " biologically significant levels , " up to 10 rem , according to their paper .
" If an aircraft happened to be in or near the high - field region when either a lightning discharge or a TGF event is occurring , then the radiation dose received by passengers and crew members inside the aircraft could potentially approach 10 rem in less than one millisecond , " the paper says .
Ten rem is considered the maximum safe radiation exposure over a person 's lifetime .
It is equal to 400 chest X - rays , three CAT scans or 7,500 hours of flight time in normal conditions .
All airplane passengers are exposed to slightly elevated radiation levels due to cosmic rays .

While the research raises obvious concerns , the scientists stressed that they do n't know how often the high - radiation events occur -- or how often planes are nearby enough to expose passengers and flight crews to potential danger .
David Smith , an associate professor of physics at UC - Santa Cruz , said recent airborne research suggests the incidents are rare .
Flying aboard a National Science Foundation / National Center for Atmospheric Research aircraft this past summer in Florida , Smith and several of the other researchers used a highly sophisticated instrument to measure gamma ray flashes from thunderstorms .
Over the course of several flights , they were only able to detect one such flash , at a safe distance from the plane .
" These observations show that although thunderstorms do occasionally create intense gamma- ray flashes , the chance of accidently being directly hit by one is small , " Smith said .
Martin Uman , another author and a distinguished professor of electrical and computer engineering at UF , noted that airline pilots typically seek to avoid flying through storms .
However , he said , the fact that commercial planes are struck once or twice a year suggests more inquiry is needed .
He said he would recommend to the Federal Aviation Administration that it place detectors aboard planes capable of measuring the storm - related , brief and intense radiation bursts to determine how often they occur .
He also said more research on the phenomena that generates the bursts is clearly needed .
" What we need to do is supply the right kind of detectors to a lot of planes , and see if this ever happens , " he said .
" We also need to spend more time looking at gamma and x-ray radiation from lightning and thunderstorms and trying to understand how it works . "
The paper drew on data from numerous observations and experiments , including experiments involving artificial " triggered " lightning at UF / Florida Tech International Center for Lightning Research and Testing at the Camp Blanding Army National Guard Base near Starke , Florida .
UF and Florida
Tech researchers at the center were the first to identify X - ray emissions from triggered lightning .
Yes , and here they are …keep on reading !

Once you hit that buy button , you 're stuck with it .
We do n't want it .
So they pull into Bethlehem , and Joseph can't even come up with a room at a Motel 6 .
Mary must have felt as if her damned back was breaking , even before she went into labor .
And let 's think about that for a little bit , shall we ?
Mary was a first - time mother .
Her labor would have lasted a long , long time .
I went for 23 hours between my water breaking and the delivery of my eldest child , so I 'm guessing Mary was in labor for 12 hours at least — with no option for an epidural .
Yeah , I suppose God could have given Mary a short and pain - free labor .
After all , she was doing him a pretty damned big favor , being a surrogate mother and all .
But were that the case , I 'm pretty sure that would have been mentioned as one of the miracles of the miraculous birth .
Besides , this is a male God .
He would n't have thought of giving Mary a break .
You know , it 's one of those " wimmin things " .
And speaking of " wimmin things " , who helped deliver Baby Jesus ?
There 's no mention of any women being around .
Did Joseph run for a midwife and , if so , why do n't we know about it ?
We do know that Joseph could n't assist .
For one thing , he did n't know nothing about birthing no babies .
Mary was a first time mother , but Joseph was n't even a first - time father .
Besides , according to the Jewish laws concerning niddah at the point when labor became really , really painful , Mary was a yoledet , a woman giving birth and unclean .
Not Joseph , nor the innkeeper , nor the shepherds , nor any other Jewish man could touch her : she was on her own .
Beyond that , what was Mary using for a bed ?
We know all about the Little Lord Jesus being tucked away in a manger after - the - fact , but what did Mary labor upon ?
I doubt that the innkeeper kept a birthing stool handy , especially not in the barn , so I 'm guessing our poor girl was relegated to a pile of straw .
In a cow barn , full of fodder and cowshit .
Do you think Mary suffered it all in stoic silence ?
If Mary was like most women she likely was cursing the Male who got her in that condition , and that position , especially since
He had it in His power to spare her the entire ordeal .
Jesus was born of a woman , that was the whole idea of God made Man , was n't it ?
And a real woman would have been screaming her head off , cursing Father , Son and Holy Ghost for good measure .
So here we have Mary , who had jogged around the countryside on a donkey , not getting a decent night 's sleep in weeks ; having labored mightily to bring for the Child with no assistance from a knowledgeable woman ; bedded down in stable , lying on poking , scratchy straw amongst the oxen and cows and ducks and sheep and all the effluvia which comes from livestock — the poor girl just needs some rest .
I know that after I gave birth , the last thing I wanted was a parade of visitors ; all I wanted was some goddamned sleep .
But poor Mary — what happened to her ?
Why , a veritable convention broke out !
First there were the animals already in the barn — " the cattle are lowing , the poor Baby wakes " .
Then the shepherds arrived with their flocks — you do n't think they left them out in the pastures unguarded , do you ?
Those sheep were the only wealth they had , they would n't just leave them there .
It was those damned Angels with their trumpets , and their harps of gold , bending near the earth to sing " hark !
Glory to the newborn King ! " ; oh , yeah , the Angels did a great fucking job .
By the time they were finished singing on high , with the mountains echoing the " joyful strains " to " come to Bethlehem and see " , heaven and nature singing and repeating the sounding joy and the song high above the trees with a voice as big as the seas , everyone and their brother — but no sisters to tend to Mary — had been called to traipse through the cow barn and stare at the Baby .
There was no consideration at all of what Mary needed ; they even referred to Jesus as the Son of Man when there was no man involved in the whole process — just a Godhead and a woman .
By the time the Little Drummer Boy arrived , Mary probably grabbed a shepherd 's crook and beat the kid with it , and then broke the fucking drum and waled shit on the shepherds , the wise men , the angels , the sheep and Joseph for good measure .
It would have been the only way she could get a Silent Fucking Night .
No doubt you ’ve heard Icrontic talk about Pandemic Studios ’ upcoming stealth action game The Saboteur , which is set during the 1940s in beautiful Nazi- occupied Paris , France .
You play as professional Irish race car driver Sean Devlin as he joins the French resistance to fight against the Nazi threat from behind enemy lines .
The game is dark and adult in nature , and promises sandbox - style open - ended gameplay .
We got to visit Pandemic Studios and get a first - look sneak peek at The Saboteur , as well as talk one - on - one with art director Christopher Hunt and Executive Producer Tom French .
Our questions focused mainly on Pandemic ’s internally developed Odin engine , which sports an impressive amount of features and looks to be a new powerhouse on the graphics front .
The Saboteur is a story - driven game , focusing more on character development and storytelling rather than run-and - gun action .
Much of the technology used in the presentation of The Saboteur is built around the story - driven nature .
Subsurface scattering , for instance , is used on all of the flesh tones on the in - game characters .
This technology was used to give flesh a warm , realistic look , rather than the typical plastic look that plagues many games .
This helps drive the believability of the characters in a game where their presentation is paramount .
The Odin engine also employs ambient occlusion , which is a technology that has only recently seen the limelight in real - time game engines .
Ambient occlusion gives a very natural look to scenes by putting realistic lighting details in even the smallest of places .
The developers mentioned that one advantage of using this technology is with in - game cinematics ; ambient occlusion allows the developers to use the same environment lighting for both in game instances and cinematic instances , rather than having to create a different lighting pipeline or toolset for cinematics directly .
The use of ambient occlusion came about partly because the art of The Saboteur inspired the engineering .
Art direction plays a critical role in this game .
The artists , using Autodesk Softimage , realized that they could ‘ bake in ’ ambient occlusion , which gives the effect in a form that is n’t real - time .
This allowed the art teams to push their vision of Paris to a new level , which is the kind of collaboration that helped the art teams get what they wanted out of the engine .
What was the motivation for creating such an engine instead of using existing technology ?
In a word , story .
The Saboteur tells a personal story , not a war story .
The protagonist is Irish , and not tied directly to the war by background .
Executive Producer Tom French explained that this was to give Sean a neutral stance to the war .
The story is one of personal motivation .
While the game is not historically accurate , it has been inspired heavily by actual events .
In the early phases , the developers knew that The Saboteur was going to be radically different from their previous titles , such as Mercinaries .
France will not be blown to bits , but rather explored and seen from a close perspective .
The world needed to be lush , complex , and convincing .
New technology was needed to focus on delivering graphics features not just for eye candy , but to help drive the story .
From what we ’ve seen so far , the Odin engine has achieved just that .
Check in later this week as Icrontic gets hands - on time with Pandemic ’s The Saboteur at E3 .
Watch out Sunny Los Angeles ; there is a Saboteur in your midst .
After Google ’s Chrome OS Open Source announcement two weeks ago , it ’s looking like Google is out to change the world again — this time by dominating operating systems .
With Google and its device partners gearing up to drop the first Chrome OS netbooks on us by year ’s end , 2010 may well be called the Year of the Netbook .
What ’s not to like about a $ 300 ( or less ) netbook , lighter than a pound , traveling with me everywhere I go , booting up in 7 seconds and running much faster than my current Windows XP ( or Windows 7 ) laptops or Mac computers ?
Since Chrome OS runs all its software on a cloud I wo n’t need to buy , install or update any software – bye Microsoft !
I do n’t even have to worry about virus protection software or updates for my Chrome OS netbook since that ’s all taken care of on Google ’s side via its stringent security , built into Chrome OS ( Norton / Symantec / MacAfee probably wo n’t be happy ) .
Very likely , Chrome OS netbooks will further shift where we make and spend our income as many industries will be disrupted ( because they wo n’t be needed as much , any longer ) .
And if I lose my netbook ( my data is automatically encrypted – not to worry – it would be hard to crack ) , I simply buy another and log in to Chrome OS and I ’m 100 % backed up .
Since hard disks are not needed ( Chrome OS loads from Flash memory and is considered “ secure ” – it runs in a portion of memory that is not writable and is much harder to corrupt or infect ) upkeep of a Chrome OS netbook is non-existent – and this is sure making computing a service that ’s more or less “ free ” and more or less focused on Google and its datacenters , where the clouds will be run .
While Google does not envision Chrome OS netbooks entirely replacing laptops and desktops ( it ’ll be a companion device , instead ) , that may be possible with the addition of a hard drive ( or similar device ) to store files .
However , Chrome OS will allow you to manage all your netbooks without any additional overhead .
We might soon get to a point soon where the “ disposable ” laptop or netbook , becomes a reality – just like disposable cameras are , today .
Remember two years ago when we talked about the $ 100 laptop ( One Laptop per Child ) that could be used in third - world countries – it ’s just about , here , in ( y ) our country – and yet , it could work anywhere , including underdeveloped countries , as long as the Cloud is accessible ( perhaps “ portable clouds ” will evolve , some even speculate that an Android Phone could fulfill that function – set it up in a village , power it somehow , and voila – you have One Laptop per Child – except , it ’ll be a netbook running Chrome OS in a cloud ) .
But if we ’re worried Google has too much personal information about us already ( i.e. : Google Privacy Dashboard ) , we ’ll be far more concerned about the information they ’ll soon have on us once Chrome OS netbooks become dominant in the marketplace , as every application , and all its data , will be housed at Google .
So is this Chrome OS domination something we ’re really likely to see ?
Well , today , it ’s really hard to run Chrome OS , you need a netbook running Linux OS ; the limited set of hardware and device drivers available today limit the choice of netbook models you can use , though it ’s possible to run Chrome OS on a virtual machine , without a netbook .
We wo n’t know how people will react to the new netbooks coming out late next year running Chrome OS , but it ’s unlikely Microsoft , Apple , or anyone else , will be able to match Google ’s efforts by building their own web operating systems ( based on their own browsers ) .
Robert Scoble thinks Chrome OS has already won because developers will create software on the cloud for Chrome OS rather than Microsoft ’s Silverlight .
One issue that still needs to be addressed is how developers will make money on cloud applications ( web applications ) housed by Google and running on Chrome OS when most of Google ’s applications to date , are free .
I suspect a model similar to the iTunes store will evolve to sell and service more powerful and customized Chrome OS applications that will live in our cloud profiles .
At the end of the day , will Chrome OS do major damage to Microsoft or Apple ?
It well may .
Remember , it succeeded with organic and paid search because it understands what people want – and that ’s the whole pitch for Chrome OS – a different model of computing , lean and mean , running web applications really , really fast and costing next to nothing .
An anonymous customer , unhappy with his in - flight meals on a Virgin Airlines flight , has written a vivid letter of complaint , sending it directly to Virgin CEO and mega- kabillionaire playboy Richard Branson .
Via .
Dear Mr Branson :
REF : Mumbai to Heathrow 7th December 2008
I love the Virgin brand , I really do which is why I continue to use it despite a series of unfortunate incidents over the last few years .
This latest incident takes the biscuit .
Ironically , by the end of the flight I would have gladly paid over a thousand rupees for a single biscuit following the culinary journey of hell I was subjected to at the hands of your corporation .
Look at this Richard .
Just look at it :
I imagine the same questions are racing through your brilliant mind as were racing through mine on that fateful day .
What is this ?
Why have I been given it ?
What have I done to deserve this ?
And , which one is the starter , which one is the desert ?
You do n’t get to a position like yours Richard with anything less than a generous sprinkling of observational power so I KNOW you will have spotted the tomato next to the two yellow shafts of sponge on the left .
Yes , it ’s next to the sponge shaft without the green paste .
That ’s got to be the clue has n’t it .
No sane person would serve a desert with a tomato would they .
Well answer me this Richard , what sort of animal would serve a desert with peas in :
I know it looks like a baaji , but it ’s in custard Richard , custard .
It must be the pudding .
Well you ’ll be fascinated to hear that it was n’t custard .
It was a sour gel with a clear oil on top .
It ’s only redeeming feature was that it managed to be so alien to my palette that it took away the taste of the curry emanating from our miscellaneous central cuboid of beige matter .
Perhaps the meal on the left might be the desert after all .
Anyway , this is all irrelevant at the moment .
I was raised strictly but neatly by my parents and if they knew I had started desert before the main course , a sponge shaft would be the least of my worries .
So lets peel back the tin-foil on the main dish and see what ’s on offer .
I ’ll try and explain how this felt .
Imagine being a twelve year old boy Richard .
Now imagine it ’s Christmas morning and you ’re sat their with your final present to open .
It ’s a big one , and you know what it is .
It ’s that Goodmans stereo you picked out the catalogue and wrote to Santa about .
Only you open the present and it ’s not in there .
It ’s your hamster Richard .
It ’s your hamster in the box and it ’s not breathing .
That ’s how I felt when I peeled back the foil and saw this :
Now I know what you ’re thinking .
You ’re thinking it ’s more of that Baaji custard .
I admit I thought the same too , but no .
It ’s mustard Richard .
MUSTARD .
More mustard than any man could consume in a month .
On the left we have a piece of broccoli and some peppers in a brown glue - like oil and on the right the chef had prepared some mashed potato .
The potato masher had obviously broken and so it was decided the next best thing would be to pass the potatoes through the digestive tract of a bird .
Once it was regurgitated it was clearly then blended and mixed with a bit of mustard .
Everybody likes a bit of mustard Richard .
By now I was actually starting to feel a little hypoglycaemic .
I needed a sugar hit .
Luckily there was a small cookie provided .
It had caught my eye earlier due to it ’s baffling presentation :
It appears to be in an evidence bag from the scene of a crime .
A CRIME AGAINST BLOODY COOKING .
Either that or some sort of back - street underground cookie , purchased off a gun-toting maniac high on his own supply of yeast .
You certainly would n’t want to be caught carrying one of these through customs .
Imagine biting into a piece of brass Richard .
That would be softer on the teeth than the specimen above .
I was exhausted .
All I wanted to do was relax but obviously I had to sit with that mess in front of me for half an hour .
I swear the sponge shafts moved at one point .
Once cleared , I decided to relax with a bit of your world - famous onboard entertainment .
I switched it on :
I apologise for the quality of the photo , it ’s just it was incredibly hard to capture Boris Johnson ’s face through the flickering white lines running up and down the screen .
Perhaps it would be better on another channel :
Is that Ray Liotta ?
A question I found myself asking over and over again throughout the gruelling half - hour I attempted to watch the film like this .
After that I switched off .
I ’d had enough .
I was the hungriest I ’d been in my adult life and I had a splitting headache from squinting at a crackling screen .
My only option was to simply stare at the seat in front and wait for either food , or sleep .
Neither came for an incredibly long time .
But when it did it surpassed my wildest expectations :
Yes !
It ’s another crime - scene cookie .
Only this time you dunk it in the white stuff .
Richard … .
What is that white stuff ?
It looked like it was going to be yoghurt .
It finally dawned on me what it was after staring at it .
It was a mixture between the Baaji custard and the Mustard sauce .
It reminded me of my first week at university .
I had overheard that you could make a drink by mixing vodka and refreshers .
I lied to my new friends and told them I ’d done it loads of times .
When I attempted to make the drink in a big bowl it formed a cheese Richard , a cheese .
That cheese looked a lot like your baaji-mustard .
So that was that Richard .
I did n’t eat a bloody thing .
My only question is : How can you live like this ?
I ca n’t imagine what dinner round your house is like , it must be like something out of a nature documentary .
As I said at the start I love your brand , I really do .
It ’s just a shame such a simple thing could bring it crashing to it ’s knees and begging for sustenance .
Yours Sincererly

Fourteen months later , Clerico and Aberman are living in San Jose , and they 've just raised $ 1.65 million from Menlo Park - based August Capital and a group of angel investors including Eric Dunn , a former chief technology officer at Intuit , the maker of Quicken personal finance software .
( Here 's a recent SEC filing . )
Earlier this month , they moved into their first office space on University Ave. , the main drag in Palo Alto .
The office 's former tenant ?
Another company started by Massachusetts émigrés : Facebook .
So what happened ?
I had coffee with Clerico and Aberman recently to catch up .
They were in Boston over the Thanksgiving holiday , mainly to recruit a few Bostonians to help them build the company .
( They were successful , hiring two Boston - area software developers who 're heading west .
" There 's great talent in Boston , " Aberman said .
" And you 're not competing against as many sexy companies as you are in the Valley . " )
Clerico , who helped start the business plan competition at Boston College , told me that they 'd met with more than a dozen venture capital firms and angel investors around Boston .
" They told us we were too early - stage , mostly , " he said .
" They pointed out that we had n't yet nailed down the cost of customer acquisition , which was true . "
The two applied to various entrepreneurship programs earlier this year , including the new Tech Stars Boston boot camp , and Y Combinator , a program that was once based in Cambridge and Silicon Valley , but now operates year - round in the Valley .
Y Combinator accepted them into its summer program ; Tech Stars did n't .
Last May , they drove west and rented a house in San Jose .
They shared it with three other teams that had been chosen by Y Combinator .
Over the summer , Y Combinator gave them the chance to hear from vaunted Valley entrepreneurs like Max Levchin , a founder of PayPal , and Linked In cofounder Reid Hoffman .
Over the summer , they opened the WePay site to a small number of beta users .
In August , they took part in Y Combinator 's Demo Day , presenting the technology and business plan to investors like Ron Conway ( a prolific angel investor who put early money into Google ) , tech execs like Bradley Horowitz of Google , and representatives of Facebook 's in - house investment fund .
They plan to open the site up to all comers early in 2010 .
There 's a clear cultural difference between Boston and the Valley , Clerico told me over coffee : " It 's accepted as normal to have started a company -- you feel like a normal member of society .
People ask you things like what your pre-money valuation was .
Here , I think they wonder if you 're involved in some kind of pyramid scheme . "
" All of my friends in California are start - up founders , and here [ in Boston ] my friends are investment bankers , accountants , and lawyers , " said Aberman , who himself chose the entrepreneurial path over law school .
Both of them were raised on the east coast : Aberman in Florida , and Clerico in New Jersey .
But what lured the pair out to the Bay area was the acceptance into the Y Combinator program , which is run by a group of now - former Bostonians , including Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston .
( Clerico said that if they 'd been accepted by the Tech Stars program , they 'd still have chosen the more - established Y Combinator . )
And what is keeping them there , much like Facebook before them , is the fact that they found investors willing to put money into a still - nascent idea targeting consumers .
To celebrate the close of their financing deal , Clerico and Aberman went to a Palo Alto wine lounge and split a bottle of vino .
Early next year , they 're looking forward to hosting a group of students from their alma mater , as part of BC 's annual Tech Trek trip to Silicon Valley .
Here 's the video I shot last fall with Clerico and Aberman on the campus of MIT :
When I first met Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman last fall , the two fresh Boston College grads were just starting to talk to local investors about WePay , their online payment start - up .
They had an idea -- helping groups of people make payment easier for collective projects like renting a ski house or throwing a bachelorette party -- and they were working to build a prototype .
Some headmasters allow pregnant pupils to take exams
Two schoolgirls have gone into labour during exams , given birth and then continued to sit their tests in the afternoon , shocking many in Uganda .
The BBC's Joshua Mmali in Uganda says some have been impressed by the determination of the teenage girls .
The first case happened in the rural area of Masindi on Monday and Ugandan papers say the baby girl was named Nambuuzo , meaning " born during exams " .
A boy was born in Kibaale the next day between the maths and science exams .
Both of the young mothers were taking their national primary school leaving exams .
Our correspondent says in principle the government does not condone pregnancies in school .
In rural areas , girls as old as 18 go to junior school , he says .
Like a hellbound Hunter , Left 4 Dead 2 startled and surprised a lot of people at E3 this year .
Many who had just purchased the Steam deal for $ 25 and were just now seeing the series ’ potential were understandably upset .
The gaming media ( who undoubtedly had early access to actually playing the game ) was however quick to pronounce “ Noobs , shut up it ’s Valve .
Spoiled brats . ”
But now I ’m just opening old wounds .
I ’ll sum up the sequel real simply :
It ’s more of a bottle of pills than a full fledged med kit .
But anyone knows how in a tight bind they can make all the difference .
Everything old is new again .
If you ’ve played the demo , you know right away if the game has changed enough for you .
Even if you have n’t played the original in a while , you still notice things .
Zombies are more aggressive and they take more of a beating .
It ’s not easy to just shove them back with the butt of your gun and keep trudging .
If even just a couple are behind you it ’s impossible to proceed forward .
Sure , the first game was “ Spray and pray , ” but I ’d like to think this game is “ Spray , pray , and give thanks amen . ”
Watching zombie limbs fly off and their torsos split in half is a thrill that you do n’t realize until you ’re writing a review .
Then you understand how sick and depraved the game has made you , and you love it .
I ’d just like to appeal to your moral sensibilities for a moment – they were just gonna die anyway .
One of your first treats in the opening chapter of the game is getting to a gun store .
It really is like Christmas .
You ’re going to see two types of automatic shotguns .
Why I have n’t a clue .
I know they make zombies dead almost identically , but who is really going to complain about more stuff in a video game ?
The minute I do , my immunity has been compromised , and I ’ll need to be put down before I succumb to the zombie strain .
The new weapons really have their own individual feel ( except for the auto - shotguns , I do n’t know the difference ! ) .
Incendiary and Explosive ammunition “ spark ” the experience enough to make that extra push possible under dire circumstances .
I ’d also recommend equipping a laser sight whenever possible .
I consider myself pretty accurate , but after seeing Francis , Louis , Bill and Zoey for so long , these new people are n’t exactly in my T - Mobile five .
At least that ’s the excuse I ’m sticking with when I see the friendly fire indicator .
As far as the level design goes , it ’s consistent yet varied .
It really works , none of it sticking out or coming off as “ Oh , they just added that to be cool . ”
I ’ve never been to Louisiana , and God willing I never will ( zombies man ) , but I asked a real live Cajun ( Czartim ) and he says it ’s an accurate portrayal .
You ’ll be seeing residential , industrial and morbidal areas .
The last word is n’t a word btw .
Ideally you ’ll be moving along the levels so quickly you really wo n’t ever notice the detail put into this .
And whenever you do slow down to look for items and find those nice touches , you accidentally stumble upon the horde and get F ’d in the A .
You would think it ’d be in the level designers ’ best interest for more modders to examine their work , as only through making your own changes do you realize what was already there .
Your best chance at seeing anything the developers meant for you to see is written inside of the safe house walls .
The campaign is very solid providing quite a few chills and thrills , but it really could use a bit of story .
It ’s a little more invovled than the first .
You do n’t seem to be going from one random disaster scenario to the next .
There ’s a small amount of continuity , it ’s very vague .
You see that there are men in Hazmat suits that are now infected , with chemical vials of Boomer bile in various areas .
It ’s clear that the government attempted to get involved .
At the end you see that there are dead people .
Dead people who were shot .
It ’s mentioned slightly , but just left as “ one of those things . ”
You would think with the craziness of Resident Evil that they could make a cool down to earth adventure on top of the great mechanics they have in place .
But when Valve closes a script they open a microphone .
The survivor dialogue is as good as ever .
The things that they think up people to say .
“ Hot burning goo is on my face !
Get that thing off of me man !
It ai n’t right to be ridden like that . ”
As Left 4
Bed has taught us , anything in the wrong context is hilarious .
I ’d like to add , that for a five year old engine , Source still manages to look great .
I was impressed with character models in the first game , and there ’s just some subtle lighting effects that look so pronounced when you shine the flashlight on your teammate or an oncoming zombie .
I was never one to complain about the graphics , but I was definitely surprised how well the game manages to handle daylight , and even more convincingly dusk .
I ’m not sure if these were actually changes done to the engine or they just changed a few sliders in the level editor , but they ’re great to look at regardless .
Variety was definitely upped in this title .
There are more modes than you realize at first , which is an improvement from the “ two ” that you had in the original .
Scavenger is now my go to zombie multiplayer fix and Realism will test your endurance and accuracy .
I hope you like gas cans , because you ’ll need to collect a lot of them in Scavenger .
Even more so than the first game , being a Special Infected is the most frustratingly fun challenge you ’ll have this year .
Separating and subduing the Survivors is a game of cunning .
It ’s the unspoken team work that arises from one good Smoker grab and another good Jockey ride .
The Charger can be the most unbalanced enemy type on both ends of the spectrum .
Hard to use , hard to defend against .
One slip up and he can whisk you away or get shot in his crooked ass .
The experience in both co-op and multiplayer can be a bit disjointed .
Every so often the game will glitch or you ’ll be rendered useless .
During the Swamp mission I was hit by a Charger and knocked into the water .
The problem was I was still alive , even able to to shoot from down under the water to save a friend being constricted by a Smoker .
The problem was I could n’t move , and I could n’t die .
Later on one of our team members was stuck getting out of the elevator in Hard Rain .
He just could n’t move .
We had to wait around for a Jockey to spawn and ride him out of the glitch .
It was difficult trying to attract it without getting ridden .
The same thing happened to me playing a match of Scavenger , but luckily a Hunter came along and killed me …
With Achievements still refreshing and not being tracked properly , the experience is both enjoyable and messy , like Boomer and Spitter lovin ’ .
Eww .
As I mentioned before about “ shoot me if I ever complain about getting more , ” I do n’t see a reason to ask why there could n’t have been more content added for a 2010 release .
At roughly 5hrs for the main story , there ’s no arguing that you ’re gonna replay it quite a few times .
But what about maybe taking it into the full fledged campaign zone , not just fight your way through to safe rooms ?
A little non -linear exploration would n’t hurt too much .
They ’re obviously a very capable team , and they were able to make a complete game with more content than the original in twelve months .
You ca n’t argue that a whole lot more could ’ve been added in twenty - four .
I love the first game a lot .
It was something I had n’t experienced before and it got a ridiculous amount of playtime from me despite having a very lacking multiplayer component .
When everyone is using the first game to justify the content of the sequel , I tend to re-evaluate the original .
It ’s a testament to good gameplay overcoming a lack of content , but I do n’t see why with a sequel there could n’t be both .
But I will say this , of all the other games on the market right now , this was the only one that was able to pull me away from Modern Warfare 2 a week after launch .
Hour for hour , I ’ve put more time into this November sequel than the other .
But , it is Black Friday , and if you can find the game for cheap I recommend getting it .
You wo n’t find a better game to play with your friends this holiday , and any glitches and bugs you encounter really just give you more to laugh about .
It ’s better than the first game in every way , but you ’ll have to ask yourself if this is what you wanted from the sequel .
I ’m sure Left 4 Dead 3 will be hitting sometime next year , so you can grab the Steam deal of that and then join the five other remaining boycotters at E3 2010 .
It ’s still great to see Valve has the ability to get good games out in a decent time frame .
In regards to Half Life though …
Hundreds of union members and organizers descended on the streets of downtown Chicago on Monday morning to picket the offices of Goldman Sachs Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co .
The group , which included supporters from community group National People 's Action and the Service Employees International Union , has organized the protests to coincide with the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association .
The group is demanding that " banks end their over - reliance on greed and profits and commit to using their taxpayer bailouts and ...
The office party is in full swing , you 've knocked back a few glasses of bubbly and edged on to the sticky dancefloor where Fred from accounts is looking strangely attractive as he struts out some wild moves .
Nearby , Ian from IT is boogieing like nobody 's watching .
What makes them so confident while your feet are shyly shifting from side to side ?
According to Dr Peter Lovatt , principal lecturer in psychology at the University of Hertfordshire , it 's to do with age , gender and genetic makeup .
Lovatt – who is known around campus as Dr Dance – has just completed a major piece of research into dance , analysing 13,700 people 's responses to an online video of him , a former professional dancer , strutting his stuff .
Lovatt demonstrated various dance movements , then asked respondents to rate them .
He also asked people to imagine they were dancing at a wedding or disco , and say how good they were compared with the average dancer .
Peter Lovatt , aka Dr Dance , struts his stuff to help you discover your dance style University of Hertfordshire
The research was part of his investigation into " dance confidence " ( DC ) – the factor that makes the difference between you sitting glued to the bar seat and actually going for a boogie – and how it changes with age and gender .
" First things first if deep down you think you 're a better dancer than most , you 're not alone , " Lovatt laughs .
" The average DC level was significantly higher than expected , meaning most people thought they were better dancers than the average person of their own age and gender . "
The findings also show a significant difference between how women and men develop DC .
The highest level was recorded in girls under 16 .
" At this stage , dancing is for fun .
They do it on their own , with friends or in formal dance classes , and do so to enjoy it , " explains Lovatt .
But once girls pass their 16th birthday , there is a big drop .
" Teenagers are likely to start dancing publicly in front of members of the opposite sex , and as dance starts to play a part in the sexual selection process for the first time , that may contribute to a significant reduction in dance confidence . "
From then until 35 , however , women 's DC levels increase steadily .
" They are likely to be moving through the mate - selection and reproduction cycle , so they will be more confident in the behaviours which form part of this process , like recreational dancing , " says Lovatt .
But that pattern reverses after 55 .
" From then on , DC drops steadily and significantly .
That 's not surprising if perceptions of dance ability are related to fertility - based courtship displays , because this is a post - menopausal life stage . "
It 's a different story for boys , however .
They did not show the pre-16 peak seen in the female data , instead increasing DC every year until middle age , then flattening before rising sharply at 65 .
" The significant increase in rates for older men could be because in partner situations women 's DC has gone down , so men might be less intimidated by women 's confidence .
Also , separate research findings show that optimistic people are less likely to suffer from life - threatening conditions than pessimistic people .
So it might be the case that our sample of older men includes those optimists who have outlived their pessimistic contemporaries . "
But it 's not just genetics that make your legs itch to hit the dancefloor .
" People dance for social bonding and mate - selection purposes , " Lovatt says .
" It 's also good for your health and fitness , and people dance to enjoy themselves .
Some dance because they are told they have to , and it has been used to show strength and fearlessness , like the traditional Maori haka dance . "
Lovatt says his own experience proves dance can provide confidence that spills into other areas of life .
Suffering from profound reading difficulties at school , he left with no qualifications , and was unable to read until he was 23 .
" I taught myself to read while working as a dancer in theatres , " he says .
" I was surrounded by talent and thought it was ridiculous that I could n't read , so I just sat down and , very slowly , learned . "
Next , Lovatt studied A - levels , then a degree in psychology and English at Roehampton Institute , ultimately gaining a PhD and taking a senior researcher post at Cambridge University .
Now , he combines dancing " nearly every day " with dance research at Hertfordshire University , where he teaches the psychology of performing arts .
There , in his onsite dance laboratory , Lovatt flags up more interesting research .
" Beautiful women of high genetic quality with symmetrical features have been shown to innately select men with equally high - quality genetic features , " he says , " even when they were only shown videos of the men dancing , and could n't see the men 's faces . "
Women of a lower genetic quality who watched the same videos , by contrast , " thought all the men were great " , Lovatt explains .
He says there is good news for everyone from that research : " It means the best way to attract a compatible mate is to relax and just move naturally to the rhythm . "
Lovatt also has some specific findings for men to make women fall at – rather than trip over – their feet this Christmas .
" My research showed women find men who use medium - sized , complex movements to be the most attractive .
If a woman is looking for an attractive and dominant man , she 'll go for one doing very large , complex movements , but if she wants an attractive yet submissive man then she 'll go for one doing smaller , complex movements . "
Simple , small movements are considered unattractive , submissive and feminine , apparently .
But do n't head straight for a dance studio to learn a new routine .
" Dance lessons are a bit like plastic surgery , " says Lovatt .
" They mask the true expression of your genes . "

WASHINGTON , Dec 4 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government racked up a gaping shortfall in the first two months of this fiscal year after posting a record budget deficit last year , congressional analysts said on Friday .
In October and November , the government spent $ 292 billion more than it took in , the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said .
That was even worse than the same period last year , when the government was on its way to posting a record $ 1.4 trillion deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 .
The federal budget has been battered by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s , as tax revenues have plunged and spending on safety - net programs like unemployment insurance have skyrocketed .
The budget deficit was $ 176.4 billion in October , according to Treasury Department records , and the CBO estimated the deficit for November will have come in at $ 115 billion .
The CBO gave its figures in billions of dollars and said numbers may not add up to the totals because of rounding .
Receipts totaled $ 132 billion in November , the CBO estimated , down 9 percent from the same month last year .
That was partly due to new legislation that gives increased tax write - offs to corporations .
Outlays were down $ 23 billion from a year earlier , the CBO estimated , as the government spent less on federal programs to stem the financial crisis .

Banana containing three natural sugars – sucrose , fructose and glucose combined with fiber , a banana gives an instant , sustained and substantial boost of energy .
Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90 - minute workout .
No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world ’s leading athletes .
But energy is n’t the only way a banana can help us keep fit .
It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions , making it a must to add to our daily diet .
Anemia :
High in iron , bananas can stimulate the production of haemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anaemia .
Blood Pressure :
This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt , making it the perfect food for helping to beat blood pressure .
So much so , the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit ’s ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke .
Brain Power : 200 students at an English school were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast , break and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power .
Research has shown that the potassium - packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert .
Constipation :
High in fibre , including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action , helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives .
Depression : According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression , many felt much better after eating a banana .
This is because bananas contain tryptophan , a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin – known to make you relax , improve your mood and generally make you feel happier .
Hangovers :
One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake , sweetened with honey .
The banana calms the stomach and , with the help of the honey , builds up depleted blood sugar levels , while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system .
Heartburn : Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body so if you suffer from heart - burn , try eating a banana for soothing relief .
Morning Sickness : Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness .
Mosquito bites :
Before reaching for the insect bite cream , try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin .
Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation .
Nerves : Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system .
Overweight and at work ?
Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and crisps .
Looking at 5,000 hospital patients , researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high - pressure jobs .
The report concluded that , to avoid panic - induced food cravings , we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods ( such as bananas ) every two hours to keep levels steady .
PMS : Forget the pills – eat a banana .
The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels , which can affect your mood .
Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) : Bananas can help SAD sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer , trypotophan .
Smoking : Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking , as the high levels of Vitamin C , A1 , B6 , B12 they contain , as well as the potassium and magnesium found in them , help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal .
Stress : Potassium is a vital mineral , which helps normalise the heartbeat , sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body ’s water - balance .
When we are stressed , our metabolic rate rises , thereby reducing our potassium levels .
These can be re-balanced with the help of a high - potassium banana snack .
Strokes : According to research in “ The New England Journal of Medicine ” eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40 % !
Temperature control : Many other cultures see bananas as a “ cooling ” fruit that can lower both the physical and emotional temperature of expectant mothers .
In Thailand , for example , pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature .
Ulcers :
The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness .
It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over - chronic ulcer cases .
It also neutralises over - acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach .
Warts :
Those keen on natural alternatives swear that , if you want to kill off a wart , take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart , with the yellow side out .
Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape !

American travellers - traditionally the biggest of spenders while abroad - provided a welcome boost to UK tourism this summer , it was revealed today .
North American residents made 460,000 visits to the UK in August 2009 - a big increase on the August 2008 figure of 376,000 , the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) announced .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The presence of the Americans boosted overseas residents ' spending in the UK which rose from £ 1.90 bn in August 2008 to £ 2.05 bn in August 2009 .
But despite the influx of US and Canadian visitors , overall foreign resident numbers fell from 3.43 million in August 2008 to 3.16 million in August this year .
At 20.38 million , the number of foreign visits to the UK for the first eight months of this year is down 9 per cent compared with the January - August 2008 period .

Figure in Bush propaganda operation remains Pentagon spokesman
In Part I of this series , Raw Story revealed that Bryan Whitman , the current deputy assistant secretary of defense for media operations , was an active senior participant in a Bush administration covert Pentagon program that used retired military analysts to generate positive wartime news coverage .
ADVERTISEMENT
A months - long review of documents and interviews with Pentagon personnel has revealed that the Bush Administration ’s military analyst program — aimed at selling the Iraq war to the American people — operated through a secretive collaboration between the Defense Department ’s press and community relations offices .
Raw Story has also uncovered evidence that directly ties the activities undertaken in the military analyst program to an official US military document ’s definition of psychological operations — propaganda that is only supposed to be directed toward foreign audiences .
The investigation of Pentagon documents and interviews with Defense Department officials and experts in public relations found that the decision to fold the military analyst program into community relations and portray it as “ outreach ” served to obscure the intent of the project as well as that office ’s partnership with the press office .
It also helped shield its senior supervisor , Bryan Whitman , assistant secretary of defense for media operations , whose role was unknown when the original story of the analyst program broke .
In a nearly hour - long phone interview , Whitman asserted that since the program was not run from his office , he was neither involved nor culpable .
Exposure of the collaboration between the Pentagon press and community relations offices on this program , however , as well as an effort to characterize it as a mere community outreach project , belie Whitman ’s claim that he bears no responsibility for the program ’s activities .
These new revelations come in addition to the evidence of Whitman ’s active and extensive participation in the program , as Raw Story documented in part one of this series .
Whitman remains a spokesman for the Pentagon today .

Whitman said he stood by an earlier statement in which he averred “ the intent and purpose of the [ program ] is nothing other than an earnest attempt to inform the American public . ”
In the interview , Whitman sought to portray his role as peripheral , noting that his position naturally demands he speak on a number of subjects in which he is n’t necessarily directly involved .
The record , however , suggests otherwise .
In a January 2005 memorandum to active members of both offices from then - Pentagon press office director , Navy Captain Roxie Merritt , who now leads the community relations office , emphasized the necessary “ synergy of outreach shop and media ops working together ” on the military analyst program . [ p. 18-19 ]
ADVERTISEMENT
Merritt recommended that both the press and community relations offices develop a “ hot list ” of analysts who could dependably “ carry our water ” and provide them with ultra-exclusive access that would compel the networks to “ weed out the less reliably friendly analysts ” on their own .
“ Media ops and outreach can work on a plan to maximize use of the analysts and figure out a system by which we keep our most reliably friendly analysts plugged in on everything from crisis response to future plans , ” Merritt remarked .
“ As evidenced by this analyst trip to Iraq , the synergy of outreach shop and media ops working together on these types of projects is enormous and effective .
Will continue to examine ways to improve processes . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In response , Lawrence Di Rita , then Pentagon public affairs chief , agreed .
He told Merritt and both offices in an email , “ I guess I thought we already were doing a lot of this . ”
Several names on the memo are redacted .
Those who are visible read like a who ’s who of the Pentagon press and community relations offices : Whitman , Merritt , her deputy press office director Gary Keck ( both of whom reported directly to Whitman ) and two Bush political appointees , Dallas Lawrence and Allison Barber , then respectively director and head of community relations .
Merritt became director of the office , and its de facto chief until the appointment of a new deputy assistant secretary of defense , after the departures of Barber and Lawrence , the ostensible leaders of the military analyst program .
She remains at the Defense Department today .

When reached through email , Merritt attempted to explain the function of her office ’s outreach program and what distinguishes it from press office activities .
“ Essentially , ” Merritt summarized , “ we provide another avenue of communications for citizens and organizations wanting to communicate directly with DoD . ”
Asked to clarify , she said that outreach ’s purpose is to educate the public in a one - to - one manner about the Defense Department and military ’s structure , history and operations .
She also noted her office “ does not handle [ the ] news media unless they have a specific question about one of our programs . ”
Merritt eventually admitted that it is not a function of the outreach program to provide either information or talking points to individuals or a group of individuals — such as the retired military analysts — with the intention that those recipients use them to directly engage with traditional news media and influence news coverage .

Asked directly if her office provides talking points for this purpose , she replied , “ No .
The talking points are developed for use by DoD personnel . ”
Experts in public relations and propaganda say Raw Story ’s findings reveal the program itself was “ unwise ” and “ inherently deceptive . ”
One expressed surprise that one of the program ’s senior figures was still speaking for the Pentagon .
“ Running the military analyst program from a community relations office is both surprising and unwise , ” said Nicholas Cull , a professor of public diplomacy at USC ’s Annenberg School and an expert on propaganda .
“ It is surprising because this is not what that office should be doing [ and ] unwise because the element of subterfuge is always a lightening rod for public criticism . ”
Diane Farsetta , a senior researcher at the Center for Media and Democracy , which monitors publics relations and media manipulation , said calling the program “ outreach ” was “ very calculatedly misleading ” and another example of how the project was “ inherently deceptive . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ This has been their talking point in general on the Pentagon pundit program , ” Farsetta explained .
“ You know , ‘ We ’re all just making sure that we ’re sharing information . ’ ”
Farsetta also said that it ’s “ pretty stunning ” that no one , including Whitman , has been willing to take any responsibility for the program and that the Pentagon Inspector General ’s office and Congress have yet to hold anyone accountable .
“ It ’s hard to think of a more blatant example of propaganda than this program , ” Farsetta said .
Cull said the revelations are “ just one more indication that the entire apparatus of the US government ’s strategic communications — civilian and military , at home and abroad — is in dire need of review and repair . ”
A PSYOPS Program Directed at American Public
ADVERTISEMENT
When the military analyst program was first revealed by The New York Times in 2008 , retired US Army Col.
Ken Allard described it as “ PSYOPS on steroids . ”
It turns out this was far from a casual reference .
Raw Story has discovered new evidence that directly exposes this stealth media project and the activities of its participants as matching the US government ’s own definition of psychological operations , or PSYOPS .
The US Army Civil Affairs & Psychological Operations Command fact sheet , which states that PSYOPS should be directed “ to foreign audiences ” only , includes the following description :
“ Used during peacetime , contingencies and declared war , these activities are not forms of force , but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Pentagon public affairs officials referred to the military analysts as “ message force multipliers ” in documented communications .
A prime example is a May 2006 memorandum from then community relations chief Allison Barber in which she proposes sending the military analysts on another trip to Iraq :
“ Based on past trips , I would suggest limiting the group to 10 analysts , those with the greatest ability to serve as message force multipliers . ”
Nicholas Cull , who also directs the public diplomacy master ’s program at USC and has written extensively on propaganda and media history , found the Pentagon public affairs officials ’ use of such terms both incriminating and reckless .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ [ Their ] use of psyop terminology is an ‘ own goal , ’ ” Cull explained in an email , “ as it speaks directly to the American public ’s underlying fear of being brainwashed by its own government . ”
This new evidence provides further perspective on an incident cited by the Times .
Pentagon records show that the day after 14 marines died in Iraq on August 3 , 2005 , James T. Conway , then director of operations for the Joint Chiefs , instructed military analysts during a briefing to work to prevent the incident from weakening public support for the war .
Conway reminded the military analysts assembled , “ The strategic target remains our population . ” [ p. 102 ]
Same Strategy , Different Program
ADVERTISEMENT
Bryan Whitman was also involved in a different Pentagon public affairs project during the lead - up to the war in Iraq : embedding reporters .
The embed and military analyst programs shared the same underlying strategy of “ information dominance , ” the same objective of selling Bush administration war policies by generating favorable news coverage and were directed at the same target — the American public .
Torie Clarke , the first Pentagon public affairs chief , is often credited for conceiving both programs .
But Clarke and Whitman have openly acknowledged his deep involvement in the embed project .
Clarke declined to be interviewed for this article .
Whitman said he was “ heavily involved in the process ” of the embed program ’s development , implementation and supervision .
Before embedding , reporters and media organizations were forced to sign a contract whose ground rules included allowing military officials to review articles for release , traveling with military personnel escorts at all times or remaining in designated areas , only conducting on - the - record interviews , and agreeing that the government may terminate the contract “ at any time and for any reason . ”
In May 2002 , with planning for a possible invasion of Iraq already in progress , Clarke appointed Whitman to head all Pentagon media operations .
Prior to that , he had served since 1995 in the Pentagon press office , both as deputy director for press operations and as a public affairs specialist .
The timing of Whitman ’s appointment coincided with the development stages of the embed and military analyst programs .
He was the ideal candidate for both projects .
Whitman had a military background , having served in combat as a Special Forces commander and as an Army public affairs officer with years of experience in messaging from the Pentagon .
He also had experience in briefing and prepping civilian and military personnel .
Whitman ’s background provided him with a facility and familiarity in navigating military and civilian channels .
With these tools in hand , he was able to create dialogue between the two and expedite action in a sprawling and sometimes contentious bureaucracy .
Buried in an obscure April 2008 online New York Times Q&A with readers , reporter David Barstow disclosed :
“ As Lawrence Di Rita , a former senior Pentagon official told me , they viewed [ the military analyst program ] as the ‘ mirror image ’ of the Pentagon program for embedding reporters with units in the field .
In this case , the military analysts were in effect ‘ embedded ’ with the senior leadership through a steady mix of private briefings , trips and talking points . ”
Di Rita denied the conversation had occurred in a telephone interview .
“ I do n’t doubt that ’s what he heard , but that ’s not what I said , ” Di Rita asserted .
Whitman said he ’d never heard Di Rita make any such comparison between the programs .
Barstow , however , said he stood behind the veracity of the quote and the conversation he attributed to Di Rita .
Di Rita , who succeeded Clarke , also declined to answer any questions related to Whitman ’s involvement in the military analyst program , including whether he had been involved in its creation .
Clarke and Whitman have both discussed information dominance and its role in the embed program .
In her 2006 book Lipstick on a Pig , Clarke revealed that “ most importantly , embedding was a military strategy in addition to a public affairs one ” ( p. 62 ) and that the program ’s strategy was “ simple : information dominance ” ( p. 187 ) .
To achieve it , she explained , there was a need to circumvent the traditional news media “ filter ” where journalists act as “ intermediaries . ”
The goal , just as with the military analyst program , was not to spin a story but to control the narrative altogether .
At the 2003 Military - Media conference in Chicago , Whitman told the audience , “ We wanted to take the offensive to achieve information dominance ” because “ information was going to play a major role in combat operations . ” [ pdf link p. 2 ]
One of the other program ’s objectives , he said , was “ to build and maintain support for U.S. policy . ” [ pdf link , p. 16 – quote sourced in 2005 recap of 2003 mil- media conference ]
At the March 2004 “ Media at War ” conference at UC Berkeley , Lt. Col .
Rick Long , former head of media relations for the US Marine Corps , offered a candid view of the Pentagon ’s engagement in “ information warfare ” during the Bush administration .
“ Our job is to win , quite frankly , ” said Long .
“ The reason why we wanted to embed so many media was we wanted to dominate the information environment .
We wanted to beat any kind of propaganda or disinformation at its own game . ”
“ Overall , ” he told the audience , “ we ’re happy with the outcome . ”
The Appearance of Transparency
On a national radio program just before the invasion of Iraq , Whitman claimed that embedded reporters would have a firsthand perspective of “ the good , the bad and the ugly . ”
But veteran foreign correspondent Reese Erlich told Raw Story that the embed program was “ a stroke of genius by the Bush administration ” because it gave the appearance of transparency while “ in reality , they were manipulating the news . ”
In a phone interview , Erlich , who is currently covering the war in Afghanistan as a “ unilateral ” ( which allows reporters to move around more freely without the restrictions of embed guidelines ) , also pointed out the psychological and practical influence the program has on reporters .
“ You ’re traveling with a particular group of soldiers , ” he explained .
“ Your life literally depends on them .
And you see only the firefights or slog that they ’re involved in .
So you ’re not going to get anything close to balanced reporting . ”
At the August 2003 Military - Media conference in Chicago , Jonathan Landay , who covered the initial stages of the war for Knight Ridder Newspapers , said that being a unilateral “ gave me the flexibility to do my job . ” [ pdf link p. 2 ]
He added , “ Donald Rumsfeld told the American people that what happened in northern Iraq after [ the invasion ] was a little ‘ untidiness . ’
What I saw , and what I reported , was a tsunami of murder , looting , arson and ethnic cleansing . ”
Paul Workman , a journalist with over thirty years at CBC News , including foreign correspondent reporting on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , wrote of the program in April 2003 , “ It is a brilliant , persuasive conspiracy to control the images and the messages coming out of the battlefield and they ’ve succeeded colossally . ”
Erlich said he thought most mainstream US reporters have been unwilling to candidly discuss the program because they “ were n’t interested in losing their jobs by revealing what they really thought about the embed process . ”
Now embedded with troops in Afghanistan for McClatchy , Landay told Raw Story it ’s not that reporters should n’t be embedded with troops at all , but that it should be only one facet of every news outlet ’s war coverage .
Embedding , he said , offers a “ soda - straw view of events . ”
This is n’t necessarily negative “ as long as a news outlet has a number of embeds and unilaterals whose pictures can be combined ” with civilian perspectives available from international TV outlets such as Reuters TV , AP TV , and al Jazeera , he said .
Landay placed more blame on US network news outlets than on the embed program itself for failing to show a more balanced and accurate picture .
But when asked if the Pentagon and the designers of the embed program counted as part of their embedding strategy on the dismal track record of US network news outlets when it came to including international TV footage from civilian perspectives , he replied , “ I will not second guess the Pentagon ’s motives . ”

Fewer cut - price supermarket gimmicks and other measures to help target food waste are central to a new government food security strategy to maintain UK food supplies for the next 40 years .
The strategy is highly critical of bogof - " buy one get one free " - offers and heavily reduced " loss leader " lines that encourage shoppers to buy food they do n't need which eventually ends up in the bin .
And it calculates that reducing food waste has the potential to cut carbon emissions equal to taking a fifth of the country 's traffic off the roads .
It also promotes leaner and healthier diets , along with higher crop yields and a move towards accepting genetically modified crops .
The series of reports called Food 2030 had been expected last month but was delayed by internal disagreement within the Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs and foot - dragging over measures that would potentially be unpopular with voters .
Launching the strategy the environment secretary Hilary Benn said : " Last year the world had a wake - up call with the sudden oil and food price rises , but the full environmental costs and the costs to our health remain significant and hidden .
We need to tackle diet - related ill health that already costs the NHS and the wider economy billions of pounds each year .
" We need everyone in the food system to get involved — from farmers and retailers to the health service , schools and consumers .
Our strategy needs to cover all aspects of our food — production , processing , distribution , retail , consumption and disposal . "
It was welcomed by some food specialists who argue that government must provide a brake to consumer - driven market forces .
But there was criticism that action with real bite , including curbs on the power of supermarkets over suppliers , and carbon emissions from farming , remained too vague .
There was also frustration that the government was still producing policy strategies and consultations a year on from a major report commissioned at the height of global food price rises from the Cabinet Office called Food Matters .
Many felt the new strategy did not include enough substantial changes .
Meredith Alexander , head of food policy at the charity ActionAid UK , said : " The government launched an inquiry into ways supermarkets abuse their market power in May 2006 .
Three years later , they are only now considering whether or not to actually do something about these bullying practices that contribute to poverty wages overseas . "
Professor Tim Lang of City University , a specialist on food policy and member of the Sustainable Development Commission , said : " The issue is how radical or slight will changes for consumers be , and how soft or hard will the policy changes be ?
" It 's good to see Defra at last championing the view that the UK 's food system needs to become very different .
But I predict that some very uncomfortable and unpopular decisions will lie ahead for governments in coming years .
" The dominant policy language of recent years has centred on markets , choice and consumer sovereignty .
These are too simplistic now .
Politics needs to move fast . "
Apart from targeting wasteful supermarket offers the reports also promise further action on reducing " tempting " packaging and encouraging restaurants to highlight calorie counts .
Food waste in the UK is currently running at average of £ 420 - worth per household , rising to £ 610 in families with children .
Benn also said that food producers in Britain would have to adapt to climate change , and perhaps grow crops in different areas where they were previously difficult to grow .
The report warns that the face of the countryside will have to continue to change to guarantee food security , with GM crop experiments part of the strategy .
" We need to think about the way in which we produce our food , the way we use water and fertiliser , " Benn said .
" We will need science and we will need more people to come into farming because it has a bright future . "
He added that global food production had to increase by 70 % to feed a world population of 9bn in 2050 .
The National Farmers ' Union welcomed the strategy 's ' joined - up ' approach , involving all government departments linked to food production , including the Treasury .
NFU president Peter Kendall called for a similar improvement in co-ordinating food research , as well as monitoring GM 's effect on the animal feed market as well as pig and poultry production .
He also appealed for a level playing field on sustainability , with strict measures applying to imports as well as home - grown food .
He said : " It would make no sense to insist that our production was sustainable but increasingly rely on imports that are not . "
Dr Tom MacMillan , executive director of the Food Ethics Council , complimented Defra on " taking a systematic approach to assessing food security " and getting on with the job .
But he questioned whether the department had enough clout to tackle wider issues involved in food waste and poor diet .
" For instance , a big factor in food insecurity is income inequality , and you can't crack that by fiddling about with food prices .
It calls for better social protection in the UK and internationally , " he said .
" Another big question mark is over climate change .
One of government 's most important commitments in Food Matters [ a government report published in July 2008 ] was to push for European climate agreements to take account of methane and nitrous oxide from farming , yet so far all that 's happened is a seminar with the French .
" To achieve its aims , the department needs a stronger mandate from the government . "
David Adam
Hilary Benn yesterday reignited the debate on growing GM crops in Britain when he suggested the controversial plants could contribute to increased food security .
He said : " If GM can make a contribution then we have a choice as a society and as a world about whether to make use of that technology . "
GM : feeding the world with science
No GM crops are grown commercially in Britain , although several varieties are farmed extensively in mainland Europe , the United States and elsewhere .
This is less down to UK government policy than a reluctance among seed companies to apply for the relevant permits , given the high - profile backlash in Britain against GM food a decade or so ago .
Ministers have never ruled out GM in the UK and a series of comments from inside Whitehall in recent years have prompted speculation that a new industry charm - initiative is preparing to sprout .
In 2008 , then environment minister Phil Woolas , said Britain was rethinking its position on GM due to a " growing question " of whether it could help feed the developing world .
Industry bodies have also used the recent food crisis as leverage , though Martin Taylor , head of GM firm Syngenta , told the Guardian last year : " GM wo n't solve the food crisis , at least not in the short term " .

From allotment to table in 50 years
With the appetite for home - grown food growing like , well , bindweed , it is good to see urban balconies and backyards groaning under the weight of courgettes and tomatoes .
But with National Allotment
Week starting today , it is hard to see how the government can meet the demand .
The waiting list in Camden and Islington for an allotment now stands at a staggering 40 and 25 years respectively .
With more than 80,000 people nationwide facing an average three - year wait , this is n't all due to middle - class demand – or the Observer Organic Allotment .
Research released today by home insurance firm LV shows that 56 per cent of allotment users use their plot to save money , while more than a third do so because of concerns about pesticides .
London food czar Rosie Boycott has promised 2012 new plots by ( you guessed it ) 2012 and even the venerable National Trust is promising 1,000 new plots in the next three years to help meet this growing demand to grow your own .
And if you get your name down today in Camden , your first crop will be ready just in time for 2050 .

Positional asphyxia in adults is a rare death .
More common in infants it involves finding yourself in a position where your nose and mouth are covered , your larynx is blocked from the outside , or you ca n’t draw breathe into your lungs .
People have been found dead behind couches , crawlspaces , trapped inside folding beds , in the hollow of trees , under heavy exercise equipment , and trapped behind a wall of other people .
The cause of death is technically being crushed or damage to the body in any way except the person could n’t draw in enough air to live .
1. Upside down is faster
Crucifixion was a prolonged , cruel ritualized death that has been popular on and off with many governments who wanted to appear very , very tough on crime .
The Romans were specialists in not only torturing their victims , but in making them suffer for the maximum amount of time .
Crucifixion was meant not only to kill the condemned , but as a public spectacle of humiliation .
This was n’t really meant to deter crime so much as to keep the whole of the populace under control as the Romans only used this type of execution on conquered peoples .
This type of punishment was almost never carried on Roman citizen who were always granted more dignified deaths .
While it has been theorized that most crucifixion caused death by positional asphyxiation this has been disputed .
Death by crucifixion could take hours or days .
The actual cause of death varied depending on how exactly the executions carried out the method .
If the execution included using a whip on the condemned then death than this along with the spikes being driven into the wrist and feet could cause hypvolemic shock or sepsis , but the most common cause was the eventual dehydration .
For St. Peter through the death might have been faster because of his own choice .
According to Catholic Encyclopedia St. Peter was martyred in Rome after requesting to be crucified upside down since he did n’t feel he deserved to be martyred the same way as Jesus .
His desire to suffer might have backfired as this position when actually have hastened his death by positional suffocation .

2. Permanently Restrained
Positional asphyxia is still a cause of death for people in custody in modern - day police departments only in less dramatic circumstances than during Roman times .
This type of death usually happens when a handcuffed drunk or person similarly incapacitated individual is left in police vehicle or cell alone .
The victim falls or rolls into a spot where the chest or neck is compressed and either can’t free themselves or is too impaired to try .
It ’s something to think about before hitting the bar and insulting that big burly cop with the bright shiny handcuffs .

3. The Ultimate High
A bizarre kid ’s pastime known as the ‘ fainting game ’ involves a strange way to get high .
The young person either tries to manually strangle him or herself or deliberately hanging upside so not only does blood rush to the head , they eventually become dizzy as in this position breathing becomes difficult .
The high they are experiencing is of course near loss of consciousness and for some of them who do n’t or ca n’t pull themselves up in time , there is a loss of consciousness .
If they are found in time then their parents are left to make a tragic and bizarre discovery when they find their child hanging upside down from a bed or in a closet .

4 . Funny it does n’t look sexy
Erotic asphyxiation has claimed quite a few lives .
Usually when police or emergency workers find the victim , they try to hide the strange sexual practice the victim was involved in from their family and friends , but often it just is n’t possible .
Those who practice this sexual behavior strangle themselves or compress their chest or larynx often with restraints made of belts , scarves , or whatever is handy .
Many of those who fail to release themselves are found with tale - tale tells like pornography or erotic art .
Famous people who have died in this manner including most recently the actor David Carradine .

5 . Only the bats can do that
David Blaine the magician and escape artist did it for weeks and doctors are n’t sure how he did .
During a stunt in the fall of 2008 he hung upside down for 2 ½ days .
To prepare for this test of endurance he lost weight , but doctors were still very concerned for the showman since the position put too much weight on the lungs and stress on the cardiovascular system .
It is a death that more than one cave explorer has literally fallen prey to as in the tragic case of John Jones of Stansbury Park , who died this November after becoming stuck in tight and tiny section of rock 150 below the surface in a Utah County cave .
While rescuers rushed to the Nutty Putty cavern , they knew it was a race against time they were more than likely to lose as Jones was stuck in an almost straight up and down position that made breathing near impossible for the 26 year old .
The position might also have caused swelling in the brain as his blood collected there .
The cavern where the young man died has since been closed to the public until further notice .
Becoming trapped as Jones did or falls down steep inclines account for most deaths among those who enjoy exploring caves .
If you ’re claustrophobic then positional asphyxia would not be your preferred method of death and almost all such deaths are strange .
Most of these victims who were not deliberately murdered are found in their bizarre positions with the peace and stillness of death masking the horror of their last moments as struggled for the breath of life .

[ This article is excerpted from chapter five of Why American History Is Not What They Say : An Introduction to Revisionism . ]
In 1932 , according to John T. Flynn , there were no federal " subsidies to farmers , … handouts to the indigent , [ or ] support [ for ] schools . "
The federal government did not " build hospitals [ or ] provide medical care . " [ 1 ]
And though it did undertake national defense , it did so much more cheaply than Americans of today are accustomed to seeing .
" The U.S. had the sixteenth largest army in the world " in 1932 , William Manchester reports , " putting it behind , among others , Czechoslovakia , Turkey , Spain , Romania , and Poland . "
And most of those in uniform " were committed to desk work , patrolling the Mexican border , and protecting U.S. possessions overseas . "
What remained to defend the United States from anyone other than Mexico was " 30,000 troops — fewer than the force King George sent to tame his rebellious American colonies in 1776 . " [ 2 ]
In constant dollars , this army cost about 0.0125 percent of what today 's military costs the US taxpayer .
In 1932 , the federal government was seizing less than 5 percent of our national income , so it had to be a good deal more frugal than the federal government of 2005 , which claims a fraction more than five times that much .
The Great Depression was underway in 1932 , of course — it had been for three and a half years .
Around a quarter of the workforce was out of work , banks were failing , times were hard .
And President Hoover had only made matters worse .
Flynn saw the " Hoover New Deal " as an effort to virtually nationalize the US economy , an effort " to organize every profession , every trade , every craft under [ government ] supervision and to deal directly with such details as the volume of production , the prices , the means and methods of distribution of every conceivable product . " [ 3 ]
Fortunately , however , from the liberal point of view , President Hoover had been voted out of office after a single term in the White House .
The American electorate had repudiated his approach to fighting the depression and had elected the Democratic candidate , Franklin Delano Roosevelt , a man who stood for small government and fiscal responsibility .
This was evident from the platform on which Roosevelt had run — a platform that called for
An immediate and drastic reduction of governmental expenditures by abolishing useless commissions and offices , consolidating departments and bureaus and eliminating extravagance , to accomplish a saving of not less than 25 percent in the cost of Federal government .…
Maintenance of the national credit by a Federal budget annually balanced .…
A sound currency to be maintained at all hazards . [ 4 ]
Nor was this platform meant to be taken as mere empty rhetoric of the sort people today tend to assume is characteristic of virtually all public statements by politicians .
No .
As Garet Garrett of the Saturday Evening Post pointed out in 1938 , " Mr. Roosevelt pledged himself to be bound by this platform as no president had ever before been bound by a party document .
All during the campaign he supported it with words that could not possibly be misunderstood . "
He said , for example ,
I accuse the present Administration of being the greatest spending Administration in peace time in all American history — one which piled bureau on bureau , commission on commission , and has failed to anticipate the dire needs or reduced earning power of the people .
Bureaus and bureaucrats have been retained at the expense of the taxpayer .…
We are spending altogether too much money for government services which are neither practical nor necessary .
In addition to this , we are attempting too many functions and we need a simplification of what the Federal government is giving to the people . [ 5 ]
Roosevelt was particularly adamant on the subject of government borrowing .
Toward the end of the campaign he cried : " Stop the deficits !
Stop the deficits ! "
Then to impress his listeners with his inflexible purpose to deal with this prodigal monster , he said : " Before any man enters my cabinet he must give me a twofold pledge : Absolute loyalty to the Democratic platform and especially to its economy plank .
And complete cooperation with me in looking to economy and reorganization in his department . " [ 6 ]
True , Roosevelt 's political track record was somewhat worrisome , for " as governor he took New York State from the hands of Al Smith with a surplus of $ 15,000,000 and left it with a deficit of $ 90,000,000 . "
Still , " there was nothing revolutionary in " what he was now telling the voters .
It was … actually an old - time Democratic platform based upon fairly well - accepted principles of the traditional Democratic party .
That party had always denounced the tendency to strong central government , the creation of new bureaus .
It had always denounced deficit financing .
Its central principle of action was a minimum of government in business . [ 7 ]
By contrast , since the time of Lincoln , the Republican party had always stood for strong central government , top - heavy bureaucracy , and hefty handouts to big business .
The fact that the voters had evicted a Republican from the White House and elected a Democrat surely meant that American public opinion was leaning in a more liberal direction .
" In 1932 , the federal government was seizing less than 5 percent of our national income , so it had to be a good deal more frugal than the federal government of 2005 , which claims a fraction more than five times that much . "
But of course Franklin Roosevelt dashed all such liberal hopes within the first hundred days of his administration .
In effect , once elected , he tossed the Democratic platform of 1932 into the trashcan and proceeded to show the electorate that he could play the conservative game better than any Republican .
First he took Hoover 's Hamiltonian policies and enormously expanded them ; then , astonishingly , he had the effrontery to describe himself and his stolen program as " liberal . "
John T. Flynn , a journalist and commentator and a noted liberal spokesman since the 1920s , wrote in 1940 that " I see the standard of liberalism that I have followed all my life flying over a group of causes which , as a liberal along with all liberals , I have abhorred all my life . " [ 8 ]
Nor was Flynn alone in this feeling .
A number of prominent liberals , many of them writers and intellectuals , had enthusiastically supported FDR in the 1932 election , believing that he meant to adhere to the classically liberal Democratic party platform for that year .
In addition to Flynn , these included H. L. Mencken , editor of the American Mercury ; Isabel Paterson , iconoclastic editor and columnist at the New York Herald Tribune Sunday " Books " section ; and Garet Garrett , chief editorialist at the Saturday Evening Post .
They were joined in their bitter opposition to the Roosevelt New Deal by other writers and intellectuals who , irrespective of the candidate they had supported in the 1932 election , were also old - fashioned liberals appalled by what FDR was doing under the once - good liberal name .
These included Albert Jay Nock , former editor of the Freeman and regular contributor to the American Mercury , the Atlantic Monthly , and Harper 's ; Rose Wilder Lane , prolific freelance journalist and author ; Henry Hazlitt , Mencken 's successor as editor of the American Mercury and later writer on economic issues for The New York Times and Newsweek ; and Felix Morley , editor of the Washington Post from 1933 to 1940 and winner of a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished editorial writing .
Certain students of American intellectual history — Murray Rothbard is among them , unfortunately — have dubbed this group of writers and intellectuals , along with the handful of politicians who adopted a similar hostility toward New Deal domestic and / or foreign policy during the 1930s and early ' 40s , the " Old Right . "
" The Old Right , " declares Internet pundit Justin Raimondo in his 1993 book Reclaiming the American Right , " was that loose grouping of intellectuals , writers , publicists , and politicians who vocally opposed the New Deal and bitterly resisted US entry into World War II . " [ 9 ]
" The ' Old Right ' was born , " writes Jude Blanchette of the Foundation for Economic Education ,
in protest to Roosevelt and the New Deal .
Its leaders were H.L. Mencken , Albert Jay Nock , Garet Garrett , John T. Flynn , Suzanne La Follette and Felix Morley .
It is notable that what one finds in their writings one can still find in the work of most libertarians today .
In fact , it could be argued that the modern libertarian movement has more in common with conservatives of the 30s and 40s than do contemporary conservatives .
The ideas of the Old Right conservatives ( skepticism of government planning , isolationist foreign policy and a general belief in the free market ) have taken a back seat to the modern conservative emphasis on domestic pragmatism and international interventionism . [ 10 ]
" The intellectual leaders of this old Right of World War II and the immediate aftermath , " Rothbard wrote in 1964 ,
were then and remain today almost unknown among the larger body of American intellectuals : Albert Jay Nock , Rose Wilder Lane , Isabel Paterson , Frank Chodorov , Garet Garrett .
It almost takes a great effort of the will to recall the principles and Objectives of the old Right , so different is the current Right - wing today .
The stress , as we have noted , was on individual liberty in all its aspects as against state power : on freedom of speech and action , on economic liberty , on voluntary relations as opposed to coercion , on a peaceful foreign policy .
The great threat to that liberty was state power , in its invasion of personal freedom and private property and in its burgeoning military despotism .
Philosophically , the major emphasis was on the natural rights of man , arrived at by an investigation through reason of the laws of man 's nature .
Historically , the intellectual heroes of the old Right were such libertarians as John Locke , the Levellers , Jefferson , Paine , Thoreau , Cobden , Spencer , and Bastiat .
" In short , " Rothbard wrote , " this libertarian Right based itself on eighteenth and nineteenth century liberalism , and began systematically to extend that doctrine even further . " [ 11 ]
But if they were extending the doctrine of liberalism even further , they must have been liberals , right ?
They must have been men and women of the Left , not the Right — right ?
John Moser reports of John T. Flynn that " to the end of his life he never referred to himself as anything but a liberal .…
Flynn claimed that it was the American political climate that changed during his lifetime , not he .
Indeed , he believed that the very term liberal had been hijacked . " [ 12 ]
" The very term liberal had been hijacked . "
Flynn was correct .
The writers and intellectuals who made up the most visible contingent of the " Old Right " were in no meaningful sense on the Right at all .
They were on the Left , where they had always been .
They were liberals .
The term liberal had in fact been hijacked .
The " two - party system " in the United States now consisted of two conservative parties and no liberal party .
A great many of the liberals who had been left in the lurch by the Democratic party 's sudden , more or less official adoption of conservatism in liberal clothing made the mistake of joining ( or , at any rate , supporting ) the Republican party — presumably in the belief that the opposition party , whatever its fundamental character , was where they now belonged .
As Rothbard acknowledges , the " Old Right " was a coalition , in which the libertarians and individualists — the true liberals — were not dominant .
Nevertheless , he writes , they
set the tone , since individualist and libertarian rhetoric provided the only general concepts with which New Deal measures could be opposed .
The result , however , was that hack Republican politicians found themselves mouthing libertarian and antistatist slogans that they did not really believe — a condition that set the stage for a later " moderation " and abandonment of their seemingly cherished principles . [ 13 ]
More important , a great many of the liberals who had been driven into the GOP , though " at first properly scornful of their newfound allies , soon began to accept them and even to don cheerfully the formerly despised label of ' conservative . ' " [ 14 ]
And so it was that
the Libertarians , especially in their sense of where they stood in the ideological spectrum , fused with the older conservatives who were forced to adopt libertarian phraseology ( but with no real libertarian content ) in opposing a Roosevelt Administration that had become too collectivistic for them , either in content or in rhetoric .
World War II reinforced and cemented this alliance ; for , in contrast to all the previous American wars of the century , the pro-peace and " isolationist " forces were all identified , by their enemies and subsequently by themselves , as men of the " Right . "
By the end of World War II , it was second nature for libertarians to consider themselves at an " extreme right - wing " pole with the conservatives immediately to the left of them ; and hence the great error of the spectrum that persists to this day .
In particular , the modern libertarians forgot or never realized that opposition to war and militarism had always been a " left - wing " tradition which had included libertarians ; and hence when the historical aberration of the New Deal period corrected itself and the " Right - wing " was once again the great partisan of total war , the Libertarians were unprepared to understand what was happening and tailed along in the wake of their supposed conservative " allies . "
The liberals had completely lost their old ideological markings and guidelines . [ 15 ]
The irony of all this was that the New Deal , the program of the fraudulent " liberals " of the Roosevelt administration , was , at heart , a profoundly conservative program .
" Almost everything done during the Hundred Days , " Robert Higgs reminds us , " relied on the emergency rationale and the wartime analogy .
Many programs employed during World War I were resurrected . "
Moreover , " the administrators of the programs came largely from the ranks of the veterans of the wartime mobilization .
The rhetoric and the symbols harkened back to that glorious occasion of extraordinary national solidarity . " [ 16 ]
In effect , then , the First New Deal , as FDR 's program during 1933 and 1934 is generally called , was merely a rebirth of the policies of Woodrow Wilson — policies which were virtually indistinguishable from the Hamiltonian conservatism of Theodore Roosevelt .
" The ' two - party system ' in the United States now consisted of two conservative parties and no liberal party . "
It is sometimes asserted that the so - called Second New Deal , the package of policies FDR pushed during the period from 1935 to 1938 , shifted the federal government 's emphasis away from legislation aimed at " cartelization and other suppressions of market competition " to benefit big business and big labor and toward legislation aimed at " helping the underdogs and building the welfare state . "
It is further asserted that such welfare - state legislation was opposed by the big- business interests that most benefited from conservative policymaking .
But this view of what happened in the mid to late 1930s is unduly simplistic .
Much of the legislation supposedly designed during the Second New Deal to help " underdogs , " like the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938 , was anticipated by one of the First New Deal 's key creations , the National Recovery Administration ( NRA ) , launched in June of 1933 .
As Higgs notes , the " minimum wages , maximum hours , and working conditions " stipulated by the Fair Labor Standards
Act were " much like those required under the NRA 's codes of fair competition . "
On the whole , laws like the Second New Deal 's Fair Labor Standards
Act should properly be regarded as the " progeny " or " spawn " of the earlier NRA . [ 17 ]
Moreover , the minimum wage , maximum hour , and working conditions provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) , the enabling legislation that created the NRA , were neither intended to benefit the downtrodden , nor imposed on big businessmen against their will .
As Ronald Radosh argued , back when he was a New Left Historian , the provisions in question were actually intended to benefit the big businessmen , who could use them to increase costs for their smaller competitors .
In the minds of these big businessmen , their smaller competitors were competing " unfairly by cutting costs through wage reductions . " [ 18 ]
Radosh approvingly quotes John T. Flynn 's 1934 remark that , when it came to the NRA , " industry wanted not freedom from regulation , but the right to enjoy regulation . "
And in fact , as Arthur Ekirch points out , " it was industry itself that had largely prepared the regulations governing prices and production " enforced by the NRA . [ 19 ]
Taken as a whole , Radosh maintains , " the New Deal was conservative .
Its special form of conservatism was the development of reforms that modernized corporate capitalism and brought corporate law to reflect the system 's changed nature . " [ 20 ]
Or , as Rothbard puts it ,
After a bit of leftish wavering in the middle of the late thirties , the Roosevelt Administration recemented its alliance with big business in the national defense and war contract economy that began in 1940 .
This was an economy and a polity that has been ruling America ever since , embodied in the permanent war economy , the full - fledged State monopoly capitalism and neo-mercantilism , the military - industrial complex of the present era .
The essential features of American society have not changed since it was thoroughly militarized and politicized in World War II — except that the trends intensify , and even in everyday life men have been increasingly moulded into conforming organization men serving the State and its military - industrial complex . [ 21 ]
The libertarian historian Leonard Liggio takes a similar position , arguing that
the pre-war New Deal benefited big business through government privileges and concentration of economic power as much as had Hoover 's policies , of which the New Deal was basically a continuation .
However , the most significant result of the war economy was the increased concentration of economic power which big business derived from government contracts , and the establishment of a close relationship between big business and the military . … [ 22 ]
The New Deal was , as John T. Flynn insisted while it was happening , " a form of conservatism dressed up as liberalism . " [ 23 ]
The " liberals " who pushed it were actually conservatives .
And the members of the " Old Right " who opposed it were actually liberals .
In his brief history of " the ' Old Right ' Jeffersonians , " Sheldon Richman acknowledges this .
" That the movement was placed on the right or called ' conservative ' has to be regarded a quirk of political semantics , " he writes .
In a superficial sense it qualified as right - wing because it seemed to be defending the status quo from the state - sponsored egalitarian change of the New Deal .
But in a deeper sense , the New Deal actually was a defense of the corporativist status quo threatened by the Great Depression .
Thus the Old Right was not truly right - wing , and since that is so , it should not be bothersome that some palpable left - wingers , such as Norman Thomas and Robert La Follette , Jr. , seemed at home in the Old Right . [ 24 ]
Nor was the opposition to the New Deal primarily a Republican phenomenon .
Rothbard notes that Democratic politicians like Representative Samuel Pettingill of Indiana , " Governor Albert Ritchie of Maryland , who was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932 , and Senator James A. Reed from Missouri " were prominent in the movement against the New Deal . [ 25 ]
Ronald Radosh adds the names of Senators " Burton K. Wheeler ( D. Mont . ) … and Hugo Black ( D. Ala . ) . " [ 26 ]
Sheldon Richman suggests " Senators Carter Glass of Virginia , Thomas P. Gore of Oklahoma , and Harry Byrd of Virginia , " as well as such " Cleveland Democrats " as " Bennett Champ Clark of Missouri , Patrick McCarran of Nevada , and David I. Walsh of Massachusetts . " [ 27 ]
In fact , it was members of the Democratic party , not the Republican party , who mounted the first organized offensive against the New Deal , which they regarded as a betrayal of the liberal principles that had long served as their party 's ideological foundation .
The first national organization opposed to the New Deal , the American Liberty League , was founded in 1934 by a group of prominent Democrats .
There was Jouett Shouse , former Democratic congressman from Kansas , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Wilson administration , former chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee , and former president of the predominantly Democratic Association Against the Prohibition Amendment .
There was John J. Raskob , former Democratic National Committee chairman and executive of the Du Pont company and General Motors .
There was John W. Davis , the 1924 Democratic presidential candidate and a J.P. Morgan & Company attorney .
And there was Al Smith , former governor of New York and 1928 Democratic presidential candidate .
Sheldon Richman reports that " Raskob , a good friend and fellow Catholic of Al Smith , did the bulk of the early organizing and thinking about the League . " [ 28 ]
There were serious opponents of the New Deal in the GOP , too , of course .
But , despite Rothbard 's preposterous claim that they were " the soul of the [ Republican ] party , " and represented " majority sentiment in the party , " the fact is far otherwise .
Rothbard seems actually to have believed that the only reason the so - called " Old Right Republicans " perennially " managed to lose the presidential nomination " is that said nomination was " perpetually stolen from them by the Eastern Establishment – Big Banker–Rockefeller wing of the party , " which relied on " media clout , as well as hardball banker threats to call in the delegates ' loans . "
Rothbard seems actually to have believed that " Senator [ Robert A. ]
Taft [ of Ohio ] was robbed of the Republican nomination in 1952 " in precisely this way — " by a Rockefeller - Morgan Eastern banker cabal , using their control of respectable ' Republican ' media . " [ 29 ]
But if the " Eastern Establishment– Big Banker–Rockefeller wing of the party " was so powerful , why was it never able to put its own man , Nelson Rockefeller , in the White House — or even win him the GOP nomination ?
It 's not as though he did n't try for it time and again .
The fact is that , as Clyde Wilson puts it , the " Old Right " members of the Republican party simply " never had sufficient strength " within the party " to nominate a presidential candidate or prevent very many evils . " [ 30 ]
The top 25 employees at each firm had their pay limited in October
The White House " pay czar " has extended limits on the pay of executives at four US firms who were given government bailout money .
Under the restrictions , announced by Kenneth Feinberg , employees will not be able to earn more than $ 500,000 ( £ 307,770 ) per year .
The rule refers to the 26th to 100th highest paid staff .
The top 25 at each firm had their pay limited in October .
The companies involved are Citigroup , AIG , General Motors and GMAC .
The ruling does not apply to Bank of America because it repaid its bailout money this week , and Chrysler and Chrysler Financial were exempted because total pay for their second - tier executives is already under $ 500,000 .
The new rules will not affect what the employees involved have already been paid this year but will affect many workers ' year - end bonuses and stock grants , Mr Feinberg said .
Mr Feinberg is in charge of the executive compensation for the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , which is the US government 's aid programme for banks , financial institutions and other large companies .

When it started , Waterstone 's was a breath of fresh air .
But as it got ever bigger , many say it lost its soul .
What effect has that had on publishing ?
In the Bloomsbury branch of Waterstone 's , I am trying to find a quiet seat to read Tacitus 's account of Seneca 's suicide when I come across something more diverting .
A customer is asking an assistant to explain the baffling price deal on Hilary Mantel 's Booker - winning novel Wolf Hall .
" I 'm confused , " she says .
" It says here that if I spend more than £ 10 I can have the book for £ 8.99 . "
That would be a good deal : the recommended retail price ( RRP ) for the hardback is £ 18.99 .
But there is a problem .
" I only want to buy this book and nothing else .
Does that mean I 'll have to pay the full price , £ 18.99 ? "
" I wish they would n't do that , " the assistant says .
" They should n't have deals that are so confusing it takes more than a minute to explain . "
But Waterstone 's does .
The sticker on Wolf Hall 's dustjacket offers a half - price discount only if you buy something else too .
The assistant explains that if the customer only buys the Mantel today , she would get £ 5 off the recommended price ( ie she would pay £ 13.99 ) .
" But there 's nothing on the book to tell you that . "
" That 's right , " says the assistant , with a disarming I - only - work - here - and - the - bosses - need - shooting tone .
" Oh , " says the customer .
" I do n't know what to do now . "
I tell the customer , a lecturer from London University 's School of Oriental and African Studies , she could have bought Wolf Hall from Amazon or from Waterstone 's website for £ 8.45 .
" Yes , " she replies , " but two words : postal strike .
And even if I had ordered it online , I 'd have had to pay postage and I do n't know how much that is . "
Exasperated , she decides to leave without the book .
Such – or so you might think – is the nature of late capitalism .
It makes buying the most straightforward item such a nightmare that you leave the shop having saved yourself a tenner , but in the process a nice lunchtime excursion has become a frustrating fiasco .
Waterstone's has embraced capitalism 's logic firmly .
Even in this Gower Street branch , with its five miles of bookshelves at the heart of London 's university quarter and in an area denser with literary heritage than perhaps any in the world , discounted piles of Leona Lewis biographies and Frankie Boyle 's My Shit Life So Far sit on the tables with the latest JM Coetzee .
This lunchtime , the three - for - two tables are ringed by shoppers clutching two books and wondering if they can find a freebie worth reading .
Here on the ground floor , the discounting of book prices is so ferocious that if you leave having paid the RRP you feel a right mug .
" They simply treat books as a commodity , " says Nicholas Spice , publisher of the London Review of Books , and one of the chain 's sternest critics .
" There 's no sentiment to it .
If it 's celebrity biographies that are going to sell , then that 's what they 'll focus on .
They 're not looking at it from a cultural perspective . "
Is that a problem ?
After all , I am the one who brings sentiment and culture to the book - buying experience .
Spice 's thought , though , is that Waterstone 's has lost its literary soul in stooping to compete with supermarkets and stationery retailers WH Smith .
" A big retail business will inevitably move to the lowest common denominator position .
Their commitment to book quality has to wane . "
Why ?
" Because once companies get big they draw in business management that does n't have any sensitivity to the product .
That 's certainly the case with Waterstone 's : the books knowledge of the people who run it is relatively small .
Staff are n't paid well , so turnover is high and knowledge of what they 're selling falls . "
" The emphasis given to the few is staggering , " says Mark Le Fanu , general secretary of the Society of Authors .
" It 's our mid-list authors , who may not write the most commercial books but who often write the best , who are suffering .
The big corporate publishers dominate the shelves and squeeze out smaller publishers . "
Hilary Mantel 's agent Bill Hamilton worries that books are being sold like shampoo .
" In retail , if you are selling a new shampoo you would expect to pay Boots , for instance , for a promotion , to make sure your shampoo is more visible than other ones .
That pattern has been copied by Smith 's and Waterstone 's to an extent that has never been seen before in bookselling : you pay for almost any presence in the stores , you pay a huge amount for special promotions in the front of the store , and you go on paying every week even if the books are selling strongly anyway .
" There seems to be a frantic scramble in the book retail world to rush downmarket in order to compete with the challenges of Amazon , the supermarkets and next the ebook .
Publishers have to fight their corner , year after year , against ever more aggressive demands for higher discounts from the chains , but seem at a loss to know how to cope with the underlying problems they face .
They fear speaking out about how their books are being sold . "
Novelist Giles Foden argues : " I get a strong sense that publishers , generally speaking , are angry about the terms on which they do business with retailers .
And they are also worried , in this recessionary period , about extending credit in the shape of stock .
Everyone puts a brave face on it but the relationship between publishers and retailers is under a lot of stress . "
I hear these arguments repeatedly from publishers who would rather cut their throats than go on the record .
It 's understandable : they can't afford to annoy Britain 's biggest book chain .
" One of our novels , which shall remain nameless , sold 60 % of its run through Waterstone 's , " says one publisher .
" So I 'm not going to slag them off even though I hate what they 're doing to bookselling in this country . "
So the argument goes : in going big , Waterstone 's lost its soul .
It gains credence if you consider what is happening in the US .
There , Amazon and Wal - Mart are fighting a discounting war .
If you really must buy Sarah Palin 's Going Rogue , you can get it from Wal - Mart or Amazon.com for 60 % less than list prices , which means the two competitors are probably selling the titles at a loss .
How can they afford that ?
For Wal - Mart and Amazon , books can be loss leaders , luring customers in so that they might then buy other merchandise which does make a profit .
The only sure - fire losers in this war are the booksellers who have no other merchandise .
Bigger US booksellers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble have suffered alarming drops in share prices recently .
Smaller ones face oblivion .
" Waterstone 's has really already done to British bookselling just the kind of things that we 're seeing in the US , " says Spice .
" By competing with supermarkets , they can't afford to care about the quality of what they 're selling . "
It did n't used to be this way .
Waterstone 's used to be good guys in the literary world .
The chain was established in 1982 by Tim Waterstone .
" Then they had amazing shops filled with unusual books , " recalls Spice nostalgically .
Tim Coates , former Waterstone 's MD , says that in that decade the chain was responsible for creating new demand for books in provincial British towns and cities .
" Twenty - five years ago , in many towns where there 's now a Waterstone 's , there would have been just a WH Smith and , probably , a not very good independent .
" Waterstone 's did Britain a huge favour , " agrees Nicholas Clee , author and former editor of the Bookseller .
He argues it still does Britain a huge favour : " The criticism they get , you would think they 're just selling Leona Lewis .
That 's not true : go into any Waterstone 's branch and there 'll be 20,000 - plus titles – more than a lifetime 's reading . "
But soon Waterstone 's became the books retailer that the literati loved to loathe .
Why ?
In 1991 , Waterstone 's became one of the first British booksellers to start discounting book prices .
For 91 years previously , booksellers had adhered to the Net Book Agreement , whereby retailers sold books at prices recommended by publishers .
By 1995 , the NBA collapsed ; two years later it was outlawed .
Supermarkets moved into bookselling , offering titles at unprecedented discounts .
One result was that nearly 500 independent bookshops closed .
Another was that Waterstone 's expanded massively .
But surely the NBA was a constraint on free trade that meant we had to pay artificially inflated prices for books ?
One reason for the NBA 's existence given by the Restrictive Practices Court , when it analysed the agreement in 1962 was that it enabled publishers to subsidise the printing of the works of important but less popular authors by using money from bestsellers .
Today , the worry is that the demise of the NBA has meant there is no new generation of British literary talent to follow the likes of Martin Amis , Julian Barnes and Ian McEwan .
" There 's been a slow bonfire of literary authors in the last 18 months , " says Hamilton .
" Publishers are sending out to pasture established literary novelists because they realise they are n't going to be sold by the chains .
The complaint now from publishers is that most of their quality books hardly get a look in at all .
In the past , sales for many literary novels were never very high , but now publishers are cutting down on their lists in desperation . "
Hamilton cites the example of the crime novelist Ian Rankin : " Rankin was selling nothing at all for the first few novels he wrote , but publishers knew he would take off and so they kept with him .
The opportunity is n't there to do that any more because sales are so low that you lose too much money initially , even if you make money later .
That old , very successful business model does n't make sense any more .
Thanks to the prevailing way in which books are sold there would be no new Rankin . "
But did n't the abolition of the NBA make books available to new audiences ?
Hamilton concedes that book prices in Britain have barely gone up in the last 10 years .
" We have had fantastic price deflation in books because of the end of the NBA and discounts , " he says .
Is n't that great for our literary culture ?
" I do n't think it is about price , " argues Hamilton .
" It 's about shops .
People who love books have fewer and fewer places they can walk into and know they will find things that will suit them .
We have a thriving literary culture and a sophisticated readership , but retail does n't help sustain either . "
The demise of the NBA certainly revolutionised British bookselling .
Its death made American firms look across the Atlantic and see rich pickings .
Borders set up large bookstores with allied coffee shops .
Amazon invaded and offered customers access to an online literary database – undreamed of even in Waterstone 's philosophy .
" Tim Waterstone was out - couraged by Jeff Bezos [ Amazon 's CEO ] , " says Coates .
" Tim had been courageous in having huge stocks of books but then he was faced with Bezos 's idea , which was that any book in print can be got to the customer very quickly . "
Amazon undercut Waterstone 's USP ( its vast stocks of books , unprecedented in Britain ) at a stroke .
Waterstone's had a competitive disadvantage : it had to pay to run shops often in prime sites in British city centres ; Amazon did n't .
" I 'm not inclined to be harsh on Waterstone 's , " says Clee .
" If you run 300 bookshops in the British Isles with very expensive rents , you have to be a mass book retailer .
That 's the only way you can respond to a challenge like Amazon's . "
For Coates this was when the chain lost its way as a cultural institution .
" They decided to take on the supermarkets and Smith 's by discounting prices and celebrity biographies .
It was a strategic error .
What they should have done was take on Amazon by offering something Amazon can't – the lovely , serendipitous experience of being in a really good , big bookshop . "
Where some saw commercial good sense in Waterstone 's development , the literati just saw philistinism .
Last year , for example , staff from Waterstone 's flagship Piccadilly store met writers including biographer Michael Holroyd , poet Wendy Cope and novelist Deborah Moggach .
Why , writers asked , had the biography department been moved from the ground floor and replaced by stationery ?
" The answer was that customers preferred stationery to biography , " recalled Holroyd .
" The blank page was in demand – and it was the job of the bookseller to meet that blank demand . "
Again , it did n't used to be that way .
Booksellers once thought that their job was to create demand for books worth reading .
" Waterstone 's dare n't risk doing do that now , " says Clee .
Waterstone 's failed to understand what a bookshop has to be like to survive in a new era of online retailing , argues Coates .
" They should have realised that they must make their stores pleasant .
Coffee concessions do n't really deliver that .
If I was running Waterstone 's now , I would increase what the marketing people call ' dwell time ' .
I 'd make the shops like old - fashioned reading lounges lined with books , like you used to have in Edwardian times .
They would n't be bookshops with a cafe , but bistros with books .
The arithmetic does n't look immediately obvious , but that 's often the case when you try innovative things . "
He has a point .
I wander five floors of the Bloomsbury Waterstone 's , fruitlessly looking for a corner to sit and read .
There are , though , signs telling you that if you want to visit the Costa Coffee in the basement ( which no sane person would : it 's a dank , scruffy space ) , you can't take your book unless you 've paid for it .
That is understandable : no bookseller wants muffin crumbs in their Tacitus .
But signs establish mood : for all the beauty of the Gower Street store 's Franco - Flemish facade , this is n't a place to dally or have a literary experience .
It 's one where you 're invited to buy as much as possible and then shove off .
In 1998 , Waterstone's was bought by the HMV Media group and , in 2006 , it swallowed up the Ottakar 's chain , consolidating Waterstone 's stranglehold on high - street book retailing .
At the time , Ottakar 's chairman , Philip Dunne , said : " Over the last year , the book market has undergone a significant change with new levels of competition from the supermarkets and online retailers impacting all specialist booksellers and in particular those with insufficient scale to compete on equal terms . "
It was a depressing admission : market logic dictated that bookselling was now a big - scale business .
The little guys were doomed to be impacted which , however you looked at it , did n't sound pleasant .
Some little guys , at least , think otherwise .
The noughties have seen several culturally significant small independent bookshops open , including the six - year - old London Review of Books bookshop , which lies a stone 's throw from the Bloomsbury Waterstone's .
Literary agents Sarah Lutyens and Felicity Rubinstein opened their own shop a few weeks ago in west London .
Is n't it mad to set up shop now ?
Apparently not .
" We have wanted to expand into bookselling for a long time and now the moment seems right , " they say .
" We seem to be entering a golden age of independent bookselling as readers become increasingly disenchanted with the supermarket atmosphere of the chains , and there is a new appetite among book buyers for a more carefully curated experience . "
A carefully curated experience – in Notting Hill , maybe .
But I doubt it is a model that appeals to Waterstone 's accountants .
Instead , Waterstone 's is now intent on cost-cutting .
Earlier this year it introduced a central distribution warehouse in Burton - on - Trent called the Hub .
" [ The ] original goal , " wrote Neill Denny , the Bookseller 's editor , " had been the delivery of shelf - ready parcels of books to each store , removing the need for much of the unpackaging and instore admin , with attendant savings , plus a simplified returns structure through a central point . "
One aim was to free staff to spend more time with customers .
It has n't worked that way .
Instead , Waterstone's is cutting 10 % of its 4,500 - strong workforce .
The Hub confirms for some that Waterstone 's has lost interest in treating books as anything but product to be shifted .
" The philosophy they used to have was very different , " says Le Fanu .
" It allowed each shop to buy from wholesalers and encouraged staff to be individualistic and select books that appeal to local customers .
Perhaps that was n't very efficient , but it showed they cared about the local needs . "
Another problem : staff are reportedly worried that delays in distributing book orders thanks to problems at the Hub are alienating customers .
If this is the cost - cutting logic of capitalism in action , it looks like one that serves customers ill .
Until recently Waterstone's had a good reputation for service , if retailing awards are anything to go by : it won the 2008 the British Book Industry awards ' High Street Retailer of the Year .
In Which ?
Magazine 's customer satisfaction survey this January , Waterstone 's scored high .
The glitch with the Hub – if that is what it is – is a worry in the run-up to another recession - hit Christmas , normally a period in which one fifth of annual books are sold .
Despite repeated emails and phone calls , no one at Waterstone 's is prepared to discuss these issues with me .
These are , no doubt , tough times to sell books .
Books Etc is poised to close .
In June , Waterstone 's MD Gerry Johnson said that he faced a " subdued book market " .
Sales fell by nearly 3 % and profit by almost 40 % in its last financial year .
Perhaps harder times are ahead .
This , if you believe the hype , is going to be the Christmas of the e-reader .
Last month saw the worldwide launch of the Kindle e-reader .
What would that mean for Waterstone's ?
" A financial analyst would say , ' We have to sell e-readers because they make money , " says Spice .
" But they may destroy Waterstone's . "
Why ?
" Remember what happened to Tower Records or Zavvi ?
They were reduced to selling the MP3 players that were destroying their CD business .
And then they closed . "
Perhaps , similarly , Waterstone 's is sowing the seeds of its own destruction by selling e-readers .
Last year , it became the first British bookseller to sell the Sony Reader , a rival to the Kindle .
" If e-books take off it might force Waterstone 's to go into other products more than they already do , " says Spice .
" In five years , Waterstone 's may not be selling books at all .
It may not even exist . "
The report is particularly critical of the policies and tactics pursued by Kurdish authorities who control Nineveh ’s disputed territories through the heavy presence of their security forces and political party offices .
The report describes how the Kurdish government has sought to repress minorities , subsume the identity of Shabaks and Yazidis into that of Kurds and sow rifts within the groups with bribes and patronage while suppressing dissent through violence , torture , arrests and killings .
The United States military has recognized the Arab - Kurdish conflict in northern Iraq as the main driver for continued instability in Iraq .
The disputed territories extend from Sinjar in Nineveh , in northwestern Iraq , to Mandali in Diyala Province , in the east , and include the oil - rich city of Kirkuk .
After a series of bombings in July and August against minorities in Nineveh that killed at least 143 , wounded scores and flattened villages , the American military commander in Iraq , Gen . Ray Odierno , announced plans to deploy United States troops along with members of the Kurdish pesh merga force and the Iraqi Army in the disputed areas to stop groups linked to Al Qaeda from exploiting friction between Arabs and Kurds .
With the exception of occasional joint operations and meetings between pesh merga and Iraqi Army officers that occur because of American insistence , no progress has been made in deploying the joint forces in the disputed areas or getting the Kurds and the central government to cooperate on security in a meaningful way , said Sheik Jaffar Sheik Mustafa , who is the Kurdish region ’s equivalent of minister of defense .
Mr. Mustafa said the combined forces would be based throughout the north and conduct joint raids and patrols and staff checkpoints .
He said the Kurdish authorities had agreed to the idea but opposition was coming from Baghdad and the Arab - led provincial government in Nineveh , which see the arrangement as an infringement on their sovereignty and want Kurdish troops to retreat from the areas they occupy outside their region ’s 1991 border .
At this point I nearly gave up on the melting aspect of the cake .
Bear in mind that while I was carrying out these tests the day of the party was fast approaching and I was already well into the creation of the advance elements of the cake - the bloody eyeballs , the skull , and the garnishes , which I will discuss in more detail later in this narrative .
But I decided to persevere and test one final type of icing - whipped cream icing .
I have never used whipped cream icing before because it is notoriously unstable and the cake , once frosted , has to be frozen or refrigerated .
Surely this intimidating , unreliable icing would be fragile enough to melt off my cake !
I made a few test noses this time , so I could test the icing in the fridge and the freezer as well as on the hot plate .
I also made test noses of a 50 - 50 mix of boiled icing and whipped cream icing , because I was afraid that the whipped cream icing , by itself , would be too unstable .
( I also tried mixing the whipped cream icing with the buttercream icing , but this instantaneous collapsed into a lumpy mess . )
It turned out , however , that the whipped cream icing is actually sturdier and more structural by itself than in conjunction with the boiled icing .
And , to my lasting delight , it turns out that whipped cream icing does , in fact , melt when placed on a hotplate !
With rekindled hope for the melting face , I performed a few additional tests on the whipped cream icing to determine if it can be painted with an airbrush ( It can . ) and to determine if it can be painted with a paintbrush ( It can , but only if it 's thoroughly frozen . ) .
At this point I also hit on the idea of using a heat lamp to melt the cake from above in conjunction with the hotplate melting it from below .
Of course , I did n't have a heat lamp , but I tried a 60 watt bulb and even that melted the test nose , so I went out and bought a heat lamp from the hardware store across the street , as well as a 200 watt bulb .
I would have bought two heat lamps , but they only had one , which , as you 'll see later , was very fortuitous .
And thus ends the saga of my icing experiments , leaving me ready to move on the saga of the actual cake .
So if you thought the icing story was long - winded and melodramatic , you ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
Theory of Psychedelics :
The Combinatorial Evolution of Human Intelligence via
Symbiotic Catalysis with Entheogenic Molecules
by David Glen Kerr
Humans descended from primates .
Charles Darwin enlightened humanity as to where we came from , by proposing that evolution occurred via natural selection .
Humans evolved from primate ancestors , and they from mammals , and mammals from reptiles , and so on .
Plants and other vegetation , which humans symbiotically depend on for nutrition necessary to live , have been on Earth during every step of our descent .
Darwin saw an abstract pattern in nature : immense biological sequences increasing in complexity over time via evolution , feeding and building off each other , leading to organisms with brains that are artistic , creative , and intelligent .
Why have primates evolved into man ?
Our ancestors utilized molecular tools for the mind , and these catalyzed the evolution of their brains .
The greatest divergence between primate and man is the mind , not the body .
The human brain is significantly bigger , better , and more complex than the primate brain .
In the bodies the differences are primarily of degree ; hence , it is our brains that classify our separation from other simians .
The brain is made of specialized segments , which are divided into cells , neurons , axons , synapses , and other parts .
These are all made of molecular structures and chemicals , founded on atoms , protons , neutrons , fermions , bosons , quarks , etc .
It is on the molecular and neuronal level that we are able to turn to today to find answers about our consciousness .
As simian brains increased in spatial volume , they increased in beneficial complexity , by using the additional mass as material with which to transform .
The brain was catalyzed to achieve this end , and it used catalysts found in naturally occurring materials .
These substances have been termed psychoactive drugs : sugar , nicotine , chocolate , caffeine , alcohol , psilocin , cannabanoids , mescaline , morphine , ibogaine , DMT , cocaine , theobromine , LSA , MAOIs , and so on .
The brain ?s neural network uses these chemicals to provide a physical means to modify and create new thoughts , which enhances reasoning and creativity .
It is in the brain of the animal that uses these tools properly , which successfully evolved sentience .
Simians were able to evolve adaptations to an environment where mushrooms and other plants around them were literal food for thought .
A conceptual expression for this theory is :
Humans = Primates + Psychedelics
The psychoactive mushroom ( Amanitas , p. cubensis , et al ) contains psilocybin , which the body purposely converts into psilocin to be used by the synapses in the frontal cortex .
A few hours later the body removes psilocin from the blood by releasing anti-tryptamines .
In this state psilocin has been termed psychedelic , which etymologically translates to ? mind - manifesting ? : psyche , ? mind , ? and delic , ? manifesting ?.
Yet the word has been deeply misused , giving the impression that the mushroom produces psychedelic experiences .
It does not .
The mushroom simply harbors a molecule , which does not do anything interesting per say .
Psilocin is only psychedelic when the brain uses it .
The first higher order simians were born in Africa and were black .
They discovered the mushroom on the ground and ate it as food , perhaps as a part of routine vegetation foraging , or perhaps they were starving since the mushroom is n?t pleasant tasting .
Their synapses began receiving psilocin , causing neurons to light up like fireworks , which made their brain operate so fast that time appeared to slow down .
Intense thoughts occurred , creating beautiful hallucinated visions , overwhelmed by the ecstatic feeling of worldly connection .
These simians would have acted in new and bizarre ways that formed social bonding .
They had thoughts so complex that they were unable to be held in memory .
This behavior created selection pressure on the monkeys , causing evolution of better brains , in order to understand each other ?s actions .
At some point , they realized the mushroom was causing these experiences , and could regulate their dietary intake .
The serotonin ( 5 - HT ) class of synaptic receptors , which accept psilocin and other entheogens , are structures in the frontal cortex that allow us to perform higher cognitive functions .
Natural selection favored production of these structures , because the more that the brain had , the better it could use psilocin .
Thus the smarter it was , sober or intoxicated .
Hangover effects from pure mushroom experiences are soft , especially when compared to hard drugs such as alcohol and cocaine .
This is because the brain has evolved to handle psychedelics .
The pineal gland , sitting in the center of every human brain , may be the producer of endogenous DMT in humans , the most potent psychedelic tryptamine known .
Mushroom and entheogenic plant consumption has gone on throughout the entire of human history , including today .
These plants are not poisonous , but they contain powerful tools , and therefore are dangerous .
Use the right tool for the right job !
If humans eat these psychedelic plants under improper conditions , their experiences will be terrible and therefore damaging to the psyche .
Fortunately , shamans throughout history have provided a proper outlet for these experiences .
Humans who are otherwise ignorant to psychedelics have had a means to constructively experience conscious - expanding states .
The smartest and most successful cultures are the ones consuming the most variety of drugs , and are defined and limited , harnessed and hampered by the drugs they do and how they do them .
How a drug is used is more important than the drug itself .
A society ?s history of drug use contributes to their society today .
Caffeine and nicotine spread all over the world , as did alcohol and the wisdom to ferment it from plant fruit .
The USA has a high array of drug use , including legendary LSD consumption .
All these drugs are used to alter the mind in order to gain additional perspectives , new ways to think .
Without them , humanity would not be as intelligent as we are today .
Drugs are making humanity smarter .
We are already creating new psychedelic tools : MDMA , LSD , 2C - B , 2C - T - 7 , in addition to pain relievers , anti-depressants , and a long list of other pharmaceutical chemicals and medicines .
The true benefits lie in consumption of varieties , not large quantities .
It is in precise and responsible use , and in the realization that every drug has unique effects .
Each drug has a different use and different purpose .
Alcohol enhances socialization , caffeine enhances logic , cannabis enhances abstraction , psilocin enhances creativity , and so on .
At the same time , every drug has downsides and negative effects , which can be minimized or eliminated through careful use .
Psychedelics change the way individuals think , and therefore the way individuals act .
Their actions , words , and attitudes affect those around them .
This process is how psychedelic drugs indirectly affect the minds of those who do not even ingest them or believe in their existence .
Howard Bloom ?s vision of a global brain provides an excellent framework in which to understand this effect .
As one person changes behavior , the people in the social network adjust to adapt .
The influence spirals outwards and decreases over distance .
Terrence McKenna proposed the idea of mushrooms affecting human evolution .
If true , this theory predicts that when apes are fed a proper diet of mushrooms , they will become smarter .
The diet must be considered carefully .
It must not be force fed or given in large doses .
It must be naturally eaten and not injected , and proper set and setting must be given .
Behavioral changes will give rise to increased adaptive intelligence over generations , and will even cause advantage in the first generation .
This kind of research has not been conducted yet .
PS .
The original formula is " Man=Ape + Mushroom " , or " Man=Monkey + Mushroom "

Mexico At War with the Drug Cartels
There are two cartel wars currently raging in Mexico that have combined to produce record levels of violence in 2009 .
The first war is the struggle between the government of Mexico and the drug cartels .
The second , a parallel war , is the fight among the various cartels as they compete for control of lucrative supply routes .
Shortly after his inauguration in December 2006 , President Felipe Calderon launched an all - out effort to target the cartels , which he viewed as a major threat to Mexico ’s security and stability .
Over the past three years , the government ’s effort has weakened and fragmented some of the major cartels ( namely the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels ) , but this government progress has upset the balance of power among the cartels , which has resulted in increased violence .
Former cartel allies have been pitted against each other in bloody battles of attrition as rival cartels have tried to take advantage of their weakened competitors and seize control of smuggling routes .
In this year ’s report on Mexico ’s drug cartels , we assess the most significant developments of the past year and provide an updated description of the country ’s powerful drug - trafficking organizations as well as a forecast for 2010 .
This annual report is a product of the coverage we maintain on a weekly basis through our Mexico Security Memo as well as other analyses we produce throughout the year .
Mexico ’s Drug Trafficking Organizations
La Familia :
This cartel has garnered a great deal of media attention during the past year , especially after being labeled in May “ the most violent criminal organization in Mexico ” by former Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora .
La Familia has grabbed headlines mainly because of its brazen attacks against government forces and its pseudo - ideological roots .
In spite of its public image , the La Familia organization still remains relatively small and geographically isolated compared to the larger and more established cartels .
The La Familia organization ’s headquarters and main area of operation is in the southwestern state of Michoacan , hence the name of the principal group : La Familia Michoacana .
The organization also has regional franchises that operate in the neighboring states of Guerrero , Guanajuato and Mexico , as well as a limited presence in Jalisco and Queretaro states .
The degree to which these groups coordinate with each other and how much autonomy they possess is unclear , though they all reportedly follow the same cult - like ideology .
Without direct access to the U.S. - Mexico border , La Familia is geographically constrained and must pay “ taxes ” to the organizations that control the border corridors through which La Familia ’s product is moved .
Gulf cartel :
At the beginning of Calderon ’s campaign against the cartels , the Gulf cartel was considered the most powerful drug - trafficking organization in Mexico .
After nearly three years of bearing the brunt of Mexican law enforcement and military efforts , however , the Gulf cartel is today only a shell of its former self .
At its height , a great deal of the Gulf cartel ’s power came from its former enforcement arm , Los Zetas .
Today the two are separate entities , with Los Zetas being the dominant organization and controlling much of the Gulf cartel ’s former territory .
The relationship between the two organizations reportedly was somewhat strained over the past year when the Gulf cartel leadership refused to take orders from Los Zetas chief Heriberto “ El Lazca ” Lazcano Lazcano .
Despite this rift , the two organizations continue to work together when their interests align .
Los Zetas :
Over the past year , the group has held firm its position as one of the most powerful cartels operating in Mexico while trying to extend its presence southward into Central America from its core area of operations along Mexico ’s eastern coast and the Yucatan Peninsula .
The organization remains fully under the control of “ El Lazca . ”
There have been rumors that Lazcano Lazcano has tried to consolidate control over what is left of the Gulf cartel over the past year and integrate the remaining personnel into Los Zetas ’ operations , but these reports have not been confirmed .
Los Zetas have a well - documented relationship with Los Kaibiles ( Guatemalan special forces deserters turned criminal muscle ) since at least 2006 , which has helped facilitate Los Zetas ’ expansion into Guatemala .
A Guatemalan joint military and law enforcement operation in March raided a Los Zetas camp and air strip in the border department of Ixcan that were being utilized for the tactical training of Los Zeta recruits as well as a destination for aerial deliveries of cocaine — further indication that Los Zetas have an established presence in Guatemala .
This push southward has given the organization greater control of its overland cocaine supply line into Mexico and enabled it to control much of the human smuggling from Central America into Mexico and the United States .
Los Zetas have also worked with the Beltran - Leyva Organization ( BLO ) throughout 2009 .
The two organizations are currently trying to wrest control away from La Familia in the Michoacan and Guerrero regions to gain access to the lucrative Pacific ports of Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco .
There has also been a concerted effort by the Los Zetas leadership to become stakeholders in the BLO over the past year , but currently their role remains that of hired muscle to supplement the BLO ’s ongoing operations as the organization pursues its own agenda .
Los Zetas have also contracted themselves out to the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization , also known as the Juarez cartel , to serve as advisers and trainers for the organization as they both battle their common rival , the Sinaloa cartel , for control over the Juarez border region .
Beltran - Leyva Organization : After a very active 2008 , the BLO has kept a relatively low profile throughout much of 2009 .
After the BLO secured control of its territory in mid-2008 following its split with the Sinaloa cartel ( the BLO / Sinaloa battle for territory accounted for a significant portion of the violence in Mexico in early 2008 ) , the cartel was able to concentrate on consolidating and streamlining its narcotics smuggling operations .
After the consolidation , the group went on the offensive again in October and November when it teamed up with Los Zetas to target La Familia in Guerrero and Michoacan states .
The BLO remains under the command of Arturo Beltran Leyva , who is supported by a well - established network along Mexico ’s Pacific coast and into northeastern Mexico .
The BLO has been in the narcotics business a long time and has perhaps the most sophisticated intelligence capability of any of the cartels .
Sinaloa cartel :
In spite of losing some of its former allies like the Carrillo Fuentes Organization and the BLO in 2008 , the Sinaloa cartel remains the most formidable and dominant cartel in Mexico today .
Headed by the world ’s most wanted drug lord , Joaquin “ El Chapo ” Guzman Loera , the Sinaloa cartel demonstrated its resiliency in 2009 and remained quite active throughout the year .
Guzman ’s partners , Ismael “ El Mayo ” Zambada Garcia , Ignacio “ El Nacho ” Coronel Villareal and Juan “ El Azul ” Esparragoza Moreno , each have their own respective networks and continue to work together when necessary to traffic narcotics northward from South America .
The conflict in Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua state between the Sinaloa cartel and the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization ( VCF ) , also known as the Juarez cartel , has undoubtedly been the primary focus of the Sinaloa cartel over the past year .
The conflict has essentially resulted in a stalemate between the two organizations as they battle for control over the lucrative Juarez plaza .
The Sinaloa cartel still maintains a significant presence in the territory along the Pacific coast of Mexico and the Sierra Madre Occidental .
While violence has lessened significantly between the Sinaloa cartel and the BLO , their overlapping geography continues to generate some conflict between the two organizations , particularly in the state of Sinaloa .
The Sinaloa cartel has also remained active in Central and South America throughout 2009 as it attempts to exert greater control over the flow of weapons and narcotics from South America to Mexico .
The Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization / Juarez cartel :
The VCF is based out of the northern city of Ciudad Juarez in Chihuahua state .
The cartel is led by Vicente Carrillo Fuentes , who took over after the 1997 death of his brother and cartel founder Amado Carrillo Fuentes .
Throughout 2009 , the Juarez cartel has maintained its long - standing alliance with the BLO , which is helping the VCF in its vicious battle with the Sinaloa cartel for control of Juarez .
The VCF is yet another Mexican drug trafficking organization ( DTO ) that has fallen significantly in the past few years .
The VCF and its enforcement arm , La Linea , have been locked in a battle for nearly two years with their former partners from the Sinaloa cartel for control over the lucrative Juarez plaza .
The prolonged conflict has taken its toll on the VCF and has forced the cartel to resort to other criminal activities to finance its battle for Juarez , primarily kidnapping , human trafficking , prostitution , extortion and the retail sale of drugs to the domestic Mexican market .
In its weakened state , the VCF has been forced to focus almost all of its efforts on fighting the Sinaloa cartel and has not been able to effectively project its influence much farther than the greater Juarez area .
Arellano Felix Organization / Tijuana cartel : The Arellano Felix Organization ( AFO ) — also known as the Tijuana cartel — is based in the far northwestern state of Baja California , across the border from San Diego .
With the arrests of all the Arellano Felix brothers and several other high - ranking members , infighting has caused the once - powerful AFO to be split into two competing factions — one led by Arellano Felix nephew Fernando “ El Ingeniero ” Sanchez Arellano and the other led by Eduardo Teodoro “ El Teo ” Garcia Simental .
Garcia initially sought the support of the rival Sinaloa cartel and it is now thought that the Garcia faction is essentially a Sinaloa proxy in the greater Tijuana area .
The Sanchez faction has remained relatively dormant in 2009 .
The organization has been forced to diversify its operations into other criminal activities , such as kidnapping , human trafficking , prostitution and extortion .
This was due in part to increased scrutiny by Mexican law enforcement after an extraordinary spike in violence in 2008 that saw , at its height , more than 100 executions during one week in the greater Tijuana area .
Much of the violence that has occurred in Tijuana in 2009 has been a result of clashes between these two rival factions .
The overall level of violence in Tijuana has been far lower in 2009 than it was during the height of the conflict in 2008 .
Debate Over the Military ’s Mission
One of the most important facets of the Calderon government ’s campaign against the drug cartels has been the widespread deployment of Mexican military personnel .
While previous presidents have used the military for isolated counternarcotics operations , the level to which Calderon has used Mexico ’s armed forces in that role is unprecedented .
During Calderon ’s term in office , he has deployed more than 35,000 military personnel to a number of regions throughout Mexico to carry out counternarcotics operations .
Because of this , 2009 witnessed a growing debate over the role of the Mexican military in the country ’s war against the cartels .
Domestic and international human rights organizations have expressed concerns over an increase in alleged civil rights abuses by Mexican military personnel , and U.S. - based Human Rights Watch has even gone so far as to call on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not to certify Mexico ’s human rights record , which would effectively freeze a portion of the Merida Initiative funds allocated by the United States to aid Mexico in its counternarcotics campaign .
Even members of Calderon ’s own National Action Party have stated that there needs to be a better balance between the needs of the cartel war and the civil rights of Mexican citizens .
The Calderon administration ’s unprecedented use of the military is due in large part to the seemingly systemic corruption in the ranks of local , state and even federal law enforcement agencies in Mexico .
Less corrupted as an institution , the military has been increasingly called upon to handle tasks that would normally fall under the responsibilities of law enforcement such as conducting security patrols , making traffic stops and manning checkpoints .
As the military has taken over these traditional law enforcement tasks , it has come into closer contact with the Mexican civilian population , which has resulted in human rights - abuse accusations and the current controversy .
Calderon has defended this strategy saying that the military ’s large role in the war against the cartels is only a temporary solution and has tried to minimize the criticism by involving the federal police as much as possible .
But it has been the armed forces that have provided the bulk of the manpower and coordination that federal police agencies — hampered by rampant corruption and a tumultuous reform process — have not been able to muster .
Calderon is aware that it is not ideal to use the military in this capacity , but the fact is that the military remains the most reliable and versatile security tool presently available to the Mexican government .
While Calderon ’s ultimate goal is to professionalize and completely hand over all the traditional law enforcement tasks to the federal police , the military will be needed to help in Mexico ’s war against the cartels for the foreseeable future .
The Mexican government has no other option .
It will be years before the federal police will have the capability and manpower required to take over the missions currently being performed by the military .
Trends in Violence
As noted in last year ’s cartel report , the last three months of 2008 saw an explosion in violence and a dramatic increase in the number of cartel - related deaths across Mexico .
The levels of violence seen at the end of 2008 have persisted into 2009 and have gradually worsened over the course of the year .
Estimates of the current death toll for organized crime - related deaths in Mexico at the time this report was written ranged from 6,900 to more than 7,300 .
The previous yearly record was 5,700 deaths in 2008 .
The geography of the violence in Mexico has remained relatively static from the end of the 2008 through 2009 .
Chihuahua , Sinaloa , Guerrero , Michoacan and Baja California were the five most violent states in 2009 — and all happen to be the top five in terms of violence throughout Calderon ’s term .
Chihuahua state once again sits atop the list as the most violent state , with more than 3,200 deaths so far in 2009 , and more than 2,100 in Juarez alone .
The extraordinary levels of violence seen in Juarez and Chihuahua state can be directly attributed to the ongoing conflict between the Sinaloa cartel , the Juarez cartel and their street - gang proxies .
High levels of violence returned to Michoacan and Guerrero states in 2009 due in large part to the increased activities and expansion of the La Familia organization .
La Familia has launched numerous high - profile attacks against the military and law enforcement personnel operating in Michoacan as well as its rivals in the region .
Federal police and military patrols in the region frequently come under fire and are sometimes ambushed by La Familia gunmen .
The attacks on security personnel are often associated with the capture of a high - ranking La Familia member .
While Mexican security forces have been able to weaken and divide some of the more powerful cartels , this diminution of cartel power has actually spawned even more violence as the organizations scramble to retain control of their territory or to steal turf from other cartels .
Over the past few decades , the only time intercartel violence has diminished has been during periods of stability and equilibrium among the competing cartels , and the Mexican government ’s anti-drug operations will not allow for such stability and equilibrium .
This means we can expect to see the high level of violence continue between the government and the cartels , and among the competing cartels , throughout 2010 .

As health care reform legislation grinds its way through Congress , the list of those opposing it has ballooned , and a week ago former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean was among them .
Now , however , Dean says he has defected from the “ Kill the Bill ” caucus , laughingly telling MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday that “ to see the Republicans up there carrying on the way they are , I basically concluded that maybe we should just pass this thing .
…
If the Republicans hate it , there must be some good in it . ”

A week ago , Dean was not so light - hearted .
“ This is essentially the collapse of health care reform in the United States Senate , ” he told Vermont Public Radio after both the public option and the Medicare buy - in had been stripped from the legislation .
“ Honestly the best thing to do right now is kill the Senate bill , go back to the House , start the reconciliation process , where you only need 51 votes . ”
Dean took a lot of fire for those statements .
Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) called Dean ’s remarks “ nonsense ” and “ irresponsible . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs jabbed that “ ” I do n’t think any rational person would say killing the bill makes a whole lot of sense at this point . ”
Now Dean appears to be looking for reasons to backpedal .
“ The bill was improved , ” he explained to Maddow , citing a few minor changes made to the Senate version over the last week .
“ It also is going to a conference committee with a body that did vote for a public option . ”
He acknowledged , however , that the improvements he might hope to see come out of the conference committee “ may or may not happen . ”
“ If this bill passes , does it actually provide an appropriate foundation for a public option to be introduced as a separate matter ? ”
Maddow asked .
“ Actually , it does , ” Dean replied .
“ Once you ’ve got the exchanges set up … you could modify this at a later date . ”

“ Hamas in talks over releasing Gilad Shalit ”
JONATHAN NACKSTRAND /AFP / Getty Images
Ever since Israeli Cpl. Gilad Shalit was taken prisoner in 2006 , the militant group Hamas has seemed to delight in dangling the prospect of his release before an anxious Israeli public .
Negotiations over Shalit began almost immediately after he was taken .
In October 2006 , one of the factions holding Shalit reported that they had agreed to Israel ’s term and were preparing to release Shalit “ within days . ”
Similar reports of “ progress ” in freeing Shalit have popped up in the Israeli media ever since .
Things seemed particularly promising in March 2009 when Israeli negotiators seemed close to a prisoner exchange deal with Hamas at Egyptian - moderated talks , but those too broke down .
In September 2009 , Israel settled for a video of Shalit in exchange for 20 Palestinian prisoners .
Hamas seems in no hurry to give up its most valuable prisoner any time soon .
“ North Korea to return to negotiating table ”
GREG BAKER / Pool / Getty Images
Since withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1993 , and particularly since the first round of “ six - party talks ” 10 years later , North Korea has excelled at the art of nuclear brinksmanship — withdrawing from international negotiations and provoking its enemies through missile tests and hostile rhetoric — then eventually returning to the table , usually in exchange for concessions and aid .
The sixth round of talks appeared to lead to an agreement in 2007 , but North Korea failed to follow through on delivering a full accounting of its nuclear stockpile .
Since then , Kim Jong
Il has at various points promised to return to the negotiating table .
Most recently , Kim told visiting Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao that he would consider returning to multilateral talks in October .
“ Pakistan finally getting tough with Taliban ”
AMIR QURESHI /AFP / Getty Images
It has long been global conventional wisdom that Pakistan ’s military is far more preoccupied with its security concerns in Kashmir than in routing the country ’s Islamist insurgency .
But dating back to at least the raid on the Lal Masjid mosque in 2007 , U.S. observers have sought out reasons to declare that Pakistan was finally “ getting tough , ” or “ getting serious ” on terror .
President Obama has welcomed Pakistan ’s apparent growing recognition that “ their biggest threat right now comes internally , ” and journalists like the Washington Post ’s David Ignatius have praised Pakistan ’s “ savvy ” offensives in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan .
Trouble is , the insurgency shows no signs of letting up and the Pakistani military is not exactly falling in line with U.S. security goals .
“ Israel preparing military strike against Iran ”
ATTA KENARE / AFP / Getty Images
In December 2005 , then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered his military to prepare for the possibility of a strike on Iran ’s nuclear enrichment facilities , saying , “ We have the ability to deal with this and we ’re making all the necessary preparations to be ready for such a situation . ”
Since then it ’s been regularly reported that Israel was preparing an “ imminent ” military strike against Iranian facilities , along the lines of its 1981 attack against Iraq ’s Osirak nuclear reactor .
Many thought such a strike would occur while Israel still had the “ green light ” from the Bush administration but the Israeli government ’s warnings have disappeared away with Obama in office .
“ Under no circumstances should any option be removed from the table , ” Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned last week .
“ Honduras rivals appear close to deal ”
Win McNamee / Getty Images
This is a newcomer on the list , but seems to have the potential for endless repetition .
Since the ouster of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya , in June , his supporters have been “ close to a deal ” a number of times , according to mediators from the United Nations and Organization of American States .
On Oct. 30 , it was reported that a deal had been reached to allow Zelaya to finish his term , pending a vote from the opposition - controlled congress .
While international mediators and observers were quick to hail the breakthrough , plenty of opportunities for the fragile political peace to break down remain between now and national what are sure to be controversial presidential elections on Nov. 29 .
It remains to be seen whether this latest development was the real thing , or yet another false alarm .
“ Dollar to be replaced as global reserve currency ”
Chung Sung - Jun / Getty Images
The greenback has had a tough couple of years , no doubt about it .
But some seem inordinately fixated on the possibility that the dollar will be replaced as the global reserve currency .
China ’s Central Bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan set off the speculation in March by remarking that it was dangerous for the world to rely on one reserve currency .
Now it seems that every G – 8 , G – 20 , or OPEC meeting is another occasion for speculation about the dollar ’s imminent demise .
Proto - blogger Matt Drudge seems particularly fixated on the story .
Unfortunately for the dollar fatalists , there ’s little evidence to suggest that the dollar will be dumped any time soon and it ’s not even clear that it would be such a bad thing if it did happen .
“ New Russian president proposing liberal reforms ”
DMITRY ASTAKHOV / AFP / Getty Images
Like his predecessor and benefactor Vladimir Putin , Dmitry Medvedev came into office as a mystery .
Reformers in Russia and the West hoped that the easygoing lawyer would prove to be a more moderate leader than Putin , now the prime minister , proved to be .
While few doubt Putin ’s ultimate influence , observers continue to speculate that Medvedev will become “ his own man ” , and thanks to a few speeches declaring the need for liberal reforms and speculating about his own future presidential intentions , Kremlinologists have been quick to declare that the two are not so chummy anymore .
But apart from a few token gestures — meeting with friends of murdered human rights activists instead of dismissing them — there ’s little evidence to date that Medvedev ’s liberal program is anything but cheap talk .
“ Fidel Castro is dying ”
ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP / Getty Images
Sooner or later , retired Cuban dictator Fidel Castro will die .
But the leader who has outlived the terms of 11 U.S. presidents also seems to constantly overcome predictions of his imminent death .
The aging leader was first rushed to a hospital in July 2006 with internal bleeding and missed some time at the office but eventually returned ( rumors that the leader was on death ’s door had Cuban Americans dancing in the streets in Miami ’s Little Havana ) .
Since he stepped down in 2008 , rumors about Fidel ’s health have continued to circulate , but the regime still regularly releases photos of the perpetually tracksuit – clad leader meeting visiting dignitaries and looking — if a bit worn out — very much alive .
“ Momentum on Doha Round ”
JORGE UZON / AFP / Getty Images
In 2001 , WTO countries committed to a series of measures to open up their agricultural markets to international trade .
Since then , however , progress on implementing the Doha reforms has been hard to find .
Dating back to 2003 , talks have fallen apart or stalled every year due to the unwillingness of developing countries to cut their tariffs and the reluctance of rich countries to cut their subsidies .
Nonetheless , efforts to salvage the Doha dream continue .
At nearly every major international summit , world leaders pledge to make the necessary concessions soon .
Most recently , U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk predicted “ significant breakthroughs in the next few weeks and months . ”
Believe it when you see it .
“ Israel and Palestinians reach peace deal ”
AHMED JADALLAH / AFP / Getty Images
Perhaps the greatest and saddest of all Groundhog Day headlines .
In 1994 Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat were jointly awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the Oslo peace accords and courageously shaking hands on the White House lawn .
Since then , thousands have died on both sides in Israeli military strikes and Palestinian bombings and rocket attacks .
Countless summits have taken place during this period , notably the Camp David Summit and the Annapolis Conference .
Each time , both sides made bold claims and negotiators — typically from the United States — made optimistic predictions .
But with the Israelis and Palestinians as far apart as ever , the conflict seems destined to grind on .
The Line :
The Quote :
Former Bulls coach Scott Skiles : “ We got physically dominated by Deng tonight .
We just could n’t do anything with him .
There was no pressure on him .
Then we froze when they pressured us defensively .
When they took the lead , and we were making as many mistakes as we did , it ’s hard to come back .
I thought we defended fairly well all night .
We just could n’t control Deng . ”

The U.S. government has abandoned science , too
( Natural News )
The cancer industry has blatantly abandoned science these past two weeks by insisting women under 50 should receive annual mammograms even though the industry 's own scientific task force concluded that such screenings result in too many false positives .
Essentially , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force took a good , hard look at the science and concluded that mammograms harm far more women than they help ( for women under 50 , anyway ) .
But when they announced the new recommendations that women under 50 should avoid mammograms -- and women over 50 should only get them every other year -- the cancer industry cried foul .
Radiologists , oncologists , Big Pharma pill - pushers and cancer industry non-profits all banded together to declare , " We are abandoning the science !
We want more mammograms for more women , science be damned !
" Of course , they all stillto be " scientific , " but what they really do is selectively cherry - pick which bits and pieces of the scientific evidence they choose to adhere to .
And when it comes to these new mammogram recommendations , they 've decided to simply abandon the science and keep pushing more radiation imaging tests for women ( mammography ) .
What you are witnessing here , folks , is .
Their technologies do not save lives , their drugs do not cure cancer , and their " science " does n't add up . , and now its fraudulent nature is finally becoming apparent to everyone .
It even has the mainstream media ( USA Today ) describing the failures of mammography in articles like the one you 'll see here :
http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-11-...
Here 's something else you need to know :
The cancer industry has n't merely abandoned science in terms of mammography ; it has also abandoned all science with the pushing of chemotherapy .
Did you know
That evidence does n't exist .
The whole " treatment " scam is based entirely on fiction .
Chemotherapy only works at all against three rare types of cancer , and breast cancer is n't one of them .
In defending the new mammography guidelines , Dr. Timothy Wilt , a member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , said that the task force recommendations " were based on the most rigorous peer review of up - to - date , accurate information about the evidence about the harms and benefits of treatment .
"
He repeated that women under 50 should never receive mammograms , and women 50 or over should only receive a mammogram every two years .
The American Cancer Society , quite predictably , has a real problem with that recommendation .
Its entire success ( and power ) depends on , and one of the best ways to make sure that happens is to keep pushing for more mammograms .
In opposing the new mammography recommendations , the ACS has now abandoned science , too .
And they lie thousands of times a day , deceptively recruiting women into modern medicine 's version of a .
A cure for cancer would destroy the industry .
It would wipe out billions of dollars in profits that drug companies , radiologists and oncologists are counting on right now .
This is precisely why the cancer industry dares not tell women the truth about vitamin D , for example , which prevents 77 % ofcancers , including breast cancer .
If every woman in America were given vitamin D supplements , cancer rates would plummet by up to 77 % in a single year , and the cancer industry would virtually collapse .
That can not be allowed to happen , of course , which is precisely why the industry has a complete blackout on vitamin D information while pushing hard for annual mammograms that continue to cause cancer ( and generate repeat business ) .
Kathleen Sebelius , Secretary of Health and Human Services , has told women to ignore the new mammography advice by the U.S. government task force .
But .
She , like everyone else pushing mammograms , is engaged in pure quackery .
I find this particularly fascinating , given that the cancer industry claims people who are offering cancer cures are " quacks . "
Such cures are n't based on rock - solid science , they claim !
But when the rock - solid science says mammograms are dangerous for women , That 's why they are Here 's a simple prediction :
In twenty years , mammograms will have been long since abandoned .
Doctors of that era will look back at 2009 and wonder how this so - called " modern " medical industry could have been so deeply invested in such a dangerous , cancer - causing technology called mammography .
They will scratch their heads and ask , " Why did n't they heed the science that said mammography is dangerous ? "
They 'll write about " how medically illiterate the people were in 2009 " because they voluntarily inserted their body parts into irradiation machines .
The fact is that people of every era are suckers for apparent medical authority .
Patients tend to believe doctors because they mistakenly think doctors know what they 're talking about .
But conventional doctors are , not healers .
They understand the detailed of , but they have no clue how to activate the body 's innate healing potential .
Doctors tend to be very intelligent individuals , but even they cannot understand things they 've never been taught , and medical school is focused almost entirely on a drugs - and - surgery approach to medicine ( slash and burn ) .
Doctors may be smart , but they 're ignorant about healing .
And for the most part , they 're nutritionally illiterate , which is why cancer doctors still do n't recommend vitamin D. ( Astonishing , but true .
)
So why , then , would patients who are interested in healing their bodies go see medical professionals who are experts in the administration of poison ?
It makes no sense .
But that 's what insurance covers , so they keep doing it .
And they keep dying of cancer , an almost entirely preventable disease with cures that exist right nowbecause too much profit depends on keeping people sick .
Mammograms are the insurance of the cancer industry .
As long as mammogram machines keep running , there will always be more cancer to diagnose -- because the machines
So our President Incarnate , his hands dripping ( metaphorically  Im sure he washes them regularly ) with the blood of Pakistani and Afghan children , along with shredded bits of the principles of Nuremberg , jets off to Norway to accept a prize that is supposed to be awarded only to those who have worked for  the abolition or reduction of standing armies . 
There , having given Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King a patronisingly dismissive pat on the head , he adds :  But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation [ Note : clearly he must have taken some secret version of the oath of office , because that s not what the public one says ] , I can not be guided by their examples alone .
And then he has the effrontery to propound a bizarro version of history in which , for more than six decades ,  the united states has brought stability ,  helped underwrite global security ,  enabled democracy to take hold ,  and promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea . 
( I suppose this would be an example of the u.s. promoting peace and prosperity in Korea . )
And as if all that werent audacity enough , he has the nerve to tell an audience of Scandinavians that a non-violent movement could not have halted Hitlers armies . 
That s right : the president of the country that turned away Jews who were attempting to escape the Holocaust belittles the accomplishments of the people who actually saved their Jews from Hitlers goons through the use of nonviolent resistance .
As Bryan Caplan reminds us :
Danish , Norwegian , and Dutch resistance to Nazism from 1940 to 1945 was pronounced and fairly successful .
In Norway , for example , teachers refused to promote fascism in the schools .
For this , the Nazis imprisoned a thousand teachers .
But , the remaining teachers stood firm , giving anti-fascist instruction to children and teaching in their homes .
This policy made the pro-fascist Quisling government so unpopular that it eventually released all of the imprisoned teachers and dropped its attempt to dominate the schools .
…
In Copenhagen , Danes used a general strike to liberalize martial law . …
But , surely the most amazing but widely neglected case of nonviolent resistance against Nazi Germany was the protection of Jews and other persecuted minorities from deportation , imprisonment , and murder .
…
Gene Sharp shows how the nations which nonviolently resisted National Socialist racial persecutions saved almost all of their Jews , while Jews in other Nazi - controlled nations were vastly more likely to be placed in concentration camps and killed .
The effort to arrest Norway ’s seventeen hundred Jews sparked internal resistance and protest resignations ; most of the Norwegian Jews fled to Sweden . …
When Himmler tried to crack down on Danish Jews , the Danes thwarted his efforts .
Not only did the Danish government and people resist  through bureaucratic slowdowns and noncooperation  but , surprisingly , the German commander in Denmark also refused to help organize Jewish deportations .
This prompted Himmler to import special troops to arrest Jews .
But , in the end almost all Danish Jews escaped unharmed . …
The omnipresent pattern … is that totalitarian governments are not omnipotent .
They need the cooperation of the ruled to exert their will .
If a people denies cooperation , even a government as vicious as Hitlers , bound by few moral constraints , might be unable to get what it wants .

Then after collecting his prize and insulting the givers , Obama jets away again , snubbing the traditional ceremonies .
Note to Scandinavia : dont give our president any more prizes .
Really .
You dont need to stay in this abusive relationship .
Outspoken Minnesota Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann likes to make herself out to be a bastion of American conservatism , standing true as a bulwark against alleged socialism .
But that image is about to come crashing down around her .
Bachmann and her family were the recipients of over a quarter of a million dollars in “ corrupt ” farm subsidies in the nine years leading up to 2006 , according to a new report by Yasha Levine , writing for Truth Dig .

Even for a woman who once warned that President Obama was “ reaching down the throat and ripping the guts out of freedom , ” that ’s a lot of dough .
In fact , it ’s almost exactly how much her stake in the family farm is worth .
“ Bachmann ’s financial disclosure forms indicate her stake in the Wisconsin farm is worth up to $ 250,000 , ” noted Politico ’s Glenn Thrush .
“ Her income from the farm has grown from $ 2,000 a year a few years back to as much as $ 50,000 for 2008 . ”
According to figures produced by the Environmental Working Group , farm subsidies are being dolled out with almost no care as to who gets them .
Over just the last 11 years , the federal government paid out over $ 178 billion to farmer in the U.S. , whether they were truly farming or not .
Also mentioned by Levine , Senator Chuck Grassley , one of the Senate ’s most fierce opponents to public health care , has seen his family rake in over $ 1 million in taxpayer funds over 11 years .
While his son has gotten the lion ’s share of the socialized funds , with a total at $ 699,248 , Grassley himself has done well , taking in some $ 238,974 .
“ Even Grassley ’s grandson is learning to ride through life on training wheels , snagging $ 5,964 in 2005 and $ 2,363 in 2006 .
In the Grassley family they learn early how to enjoy other people ’s money , ” Levine wrote .

Sen .
Sam Brownback is among the recipients as well , netting $ 500,000 over 11 years .
And it ’s not just Republicans taking on taxpayer dollars while fighting tooth and nail to block socialized medicine .
Democrats Max Baucus ’ and Blanche Lincoln ’s families pocketed $ 250,000 and $ 715,000 respectively .
Among the congressional districts that received farm subsidies , four of the top five are represented by Republicans .
Four hundred thousand years ago , give or take , our earliest ancestors domesticated fire , making it possible for future generations to enjoy all the benefits of cooked food , heated homes and multi- burner propane grills .
Since then , we ’ve been so enamored by fire that it was n’t until relatively recently that anyone got around to thinking much about ice .
And so Quest for Fire became a story for the ages , while Ice Run might only describe a typical Saturday night .
But when it comes to the world of mixology , ice beats fire cold .
“ Ice is really the cornerstone of the American bar , ” says Chad Solomon , a New York - based cocktail consultant with Liquid Relations , and co-founder of Cuff & Buttons cocktail catering .
Solomon is one of the growing number of bartenders across the country who are taking a fresh look at ice as not just a cocktail accessory , but an integral component of a well - made drink .
Solomon credits Frederic Tudor — known as Boston ’s “ Ice King ” — for creating both the supply and the demand for commercially distributed ice in early America .
In the first half of the 19th century , Tudor approached hotel bars and fine drinking establishments with the idea of chilling their juleps , cobblers and punches ; the result was a total transformation of the country ’s drinking culture .
“ It was a quantum leap in terms of the enjoyment of mixed drinks by patrons , ” Solomon says .
“ People were hooked almost immediately to the colder , more refreshing kinds of drinks . ”
While less than 200 years separate Tudor ’s icehouses from the rattle and crash of modern ice machines , much has happened to ice along the way — and for many contemporary bartenders , this has n’t been entirely a good thing .
The conditions under which early commercial ice was formed and harvested meant that bartenders often worked with ice that was firm and frigid , with little of the dissolved air or impurities that shorten ice ’s life span ; as a result , insulated blocks of this pond ice could last through the summer .
Much of today ’s machine - made ice , by contrast , is lighter and relatively warmer ; it melts quickly , rendering drinks watery and insipid .
But thanks to the work of dedicated bartenders , patrons once again are experiencing the quantum leap in quality that good ice can bring to a drink .
Thad Vogler , the barman behind Bar Agricole in San Francisco , compares using good ice in cocktails to upgrading your kitchen stove .
“ Say you ’re working on a two - burner electric range , and all of a sudden someone gives you a six - burner industrial Wolf gas range .
What you ’d be able to do with heat is entirely different from what you ’d ever imagined , ” Vogler says .
“ It ’s sort of what happens when you use good ice : Your job is to make things cold , and all of a sudden you have this tool that works so much better .
It immediately raises a drink a couple of points on a scale of 1 to 10 when you use good ice . ”
By freezing purified water in large blocks or custom molds , and by using ice from high - end machines , these bartenders are making drinks colder and with precisely the desired amount of dilution .
And while the art of shaking or stirring drinks with custom ice is a field unto itself , perhaps nowhere is ice ’s impact more evident than in the drinks that are served with ice as a component .
From simple pours of whiskey on the rocks to elaborately swizzled punches , bartenders are acknowledging that ice is as important an ingredient to these drinks as any spirit or mixer .
Once typically viewed as a simple filler in the glass , ice has become cool .
Short and Long
While wandering through Osaka one night in late 2006 , Buffy Charlet and her friends decided to stop for a drink .
They sat down at a tiny bar that served only whisky , placed their order , and were astounded by what was placed in front of them .
“ When the glasses came out , we thought it was just phenomenal , ” says Charlet , a bartender at Ford ’s Filling Station in Los Angeles .
“ The ice was in these big , perfect cubes ; it was absolutely beautiful . ”
Charlet and her friends cajoled the bartender into showing them the preparation : A large block of ice was brought out from a back room , and with a few precise maneuvers with a sword , he sliced flawless two - inch cubes from the block .
“ It fit perfectly in the glass , and they did that for each glass of whisky , ” Charlet says .
“ I ’ve never encountered anything like that since — and I ’m a bartender . ”
While swordplay is still blissfully rare behind American bars , several bartenders are taking their own stabs at crafting large , dense cubes for drinks served on the rocks .
The aesthetics are certainly impressive , as Charlet would attest , but the reasons go beyond simple appearances .
“ Anything on the rocks — be it a simple whiskey or an Old Fashioned or something like a sour — you want to set that down in front of a guest at its absolute coldest , with a nice , large piece of ice that ’s going to preserve the drink in its ideal balance of strong and weak , ” Solomon says .
“ As the clock ticks , it ’s going to be a totally different drink based on the size and density of the ice . ”
Most cocktails are served “ up , ” without ice , and are meant to be consumed quickly , before they become unpleasantly tepid .
Drinks served on the rocks , however , provide a chance to slow down .
Perhaps the quintessential and most venerable rocks drink is the Old Fashioned , a mixture of bourbon or rye , sugar and bitters ; excellent variations include versions made with aged rum or genever , a malty gin from the Netherlands , as well as the Oaxaca Old Fashioned , a tequila - and - mezcal approach served at Death & Company in New York .
Other classics — such as the bitter , garnet - hued Negroni , the classic New Orleans Vieux Carré and the Whiskey Sour — are often served on ice , as are contemporary drinks such as Beretta ’s simply named Cachaça Aperitif .
When served on the rocks , a drink can be lingered over and enjoyed as it develops in the glass .
When the ice is of low quality , however , what often develops is a watery mess .
Solomon estimates that , by using a single large piece of very cold , dense ice , a drink ’s life expectancy — the time when it ’s at peak quality — can be more than doubled .
Vogler agrees .
“ A large piece of ice retains a lower temperature longer , and it ’ll keep a drink colder longer , without turning it to water , ” he says .
To reach cocktail perfection , bartenders are turning to the past , and to the best of modern technology .
Solomon says that several years ago , while tending bar at New York ’s Milk & Honey , he and owner Sasha Petraske , along with other bartenders , began experimenting with freezing large blocks of ice in industrial freezers , then custom - carving large chunks for individual drinks .
While the process eventually proved burdensome and inefficient to do for every drink , some bars continue the practice for at least some drinks on their bar menus , such as the Whiskey Cocktail served at Slanted Door in San Francisco .
Solomon and other New York bartenders have found satisfaction in special molds that produce perfect 2 - inch cubes .
For quality ice on a larger scale , ice machines from Kold - Draft — ones that produce dense , frigid , 1 1/4 - inch cubes — have become standard equipment at some bars .
Skeptics may discount the role that larger , colder cubes of ice play in a drink , but when Charlet and her friends were served their whisky in Osaka in glasses with bespoke cubes , the effect was memorable .
“ The ice was what caught your eye , and you started to notice more the color of the whisky and the smell , ” she says .
“ It was stripped down to basics , and it really focused you on the drink . ”
Classic tall drinks , such as the tequila - based Paloma or the whiskey - based Presbyterian , along with the familiar Gin and Tonic , also need care in the ice department to prevent the delicate balance of flavors from collapsing into a diluted mess .
Some bartenders address the issue with stacks of Kold - Draft cubes ; this is the approach Vogler takes with his Agricole Mule , and that is used in drinks such as the Company Buck at Death & Company .
Other bars , such as Little Branch in New York , use long spears of ice that are shaped to the size of the glass .
The spears can be carved from large blocks , but an easier and more efficient way to make them is to use customized molds .
“ The idea is that once the drink goes over ice in the glass , you just want one giant , solid piece of ice that touches the bottom of the glass , ” Solomon says .
“ The fact that it ’s solid instead of cubes means that the drink cannot attack the surface areas of the ice and make it break down .
That single , solid spear is far more durable . ”
Crushed
But bigger is not always better .
A rock or spear of ice can minimize dilution while providing a chilling base , but some drinks have flavors so strong or concentrated that they need additional dilution .
These drinks call for a supremely icy chill , both to make the drink more refreshing but also to pace the rate of dilution , extending the life span of the drink .
Some of the first drinks to be iced were powerfully flavored slow - sippers , and bartenders used finely crushed or shaved ice to create the desired effect .
The practice applies to long drinks , such as juleps , as well as to short drinks , such as smashes ( basically a smaller julep ) and brambles , including Vogler ’s own Rangoon Gin Bramble .
“ You can sip a drink like a julep really slowly over time , ” Vogler says .
“ It ’s intense and concentrated and strong , and at the end of the drink it ’s still palatable , but it ’s softer because of the gradual dilution . ”
One of the best examples of the benefits of crushed ice is the category of drinks known as swizzles .
Typically served in tall chimney glasses that have been packed with crushed ice and gently agitated with a bar spoon or , more properly , a multi- branched lele twig from Martinique — the original swizzle stick — swizzles are intensely cold and richly flavored , not to mention a spectacular sight .
“ You get a cool effect where it chills down the glass and the whole thing freezes , with a strong frost standing out on the glass , ” Vogler says .
“ The ice just wo n’t melt — it ’s so packed in there that you have a critical coldness , and it melts very , very slowly . ”
Usually made with robust rums and lime juice , and often employing flavorful bitters , syrups or liqueurs , swizzles are a product of the Caribbean .
Perhaps the epitome of swizzledom is the Queen ’s Park Swizzle , a fragrant , minty drink that originated at the Queen ’s Park Hotel in Trinidad ; in 1946 , Victor “ Trader Vic ” Bergeron wrote that this drink was “ the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today . ”
Many of today ’s swizzles are descendants of the Queen ’s Park , such as the Twenty Seventy Swizzle served at Forbidden Island in Alameda , Calif .
Bar owner Martin Cate explains that the powerful flavors of a swizzle ’s ingredients mean the gradual dilution from crushed ice is a necessary component .
“ If you were to just stir these drinks with ice and strain into a cocktail glass , it ’d be really rich , and just too much , ” Cate says .
“ But swizzle it , and let it sit and look at it for five minutes , and it gets better and better .
It has a long curve before it tastes watery . ”
Tiki pioneers , such as Donn Beach and Trader Vic , were masters at applying the swizzle concept to a range of exotic drinks , and Cate uses their techniques in drinks served at his bar .
Beach , for example , advocated flash - blending drinks — such as the Port - au - Prince and the Pearl Diver ’s Punch — with crushed ice for a few seconds using a stand drink mixer ( the type used to make milkshakes and blended coffee drinks ) , which resulted in a resolute coldness , a gentle and long - lasting dilution and a pebbly texture far removed from the slushy goop disgorged from industrial drink - mixing machines today .
Cate replicates this technique using a drink mixer and small cubes of standard restaurant ice —
“ You put a Kold - Draft cube in a drink mixer , it ’s like listening to a car accident , ” he says — and says that the result is a cold drink that maintains its flavorful integrity without turning into a watery slurry .
For shaken drinks , such as a Mai Tai or Zombie , Cate uses a tip he learned while tending bar at Trader Vic’s :
He combines both large cubes and crushed ice with the drink ingredients in a shaker .
“ It actually changes the texture of the drink to use different types of ice , ” he explains .
“ The cubes give it more agitation and froth , and the crushed dilutes faster and chills , so you get that nice , icy frost on the outside of the glass . ”
Professional bartenders have an arsenal of implements and machines that help them create the perfect ice for each drink , but similar feats can be accomplished at home ( see sidebar on this page ) .
While a few special tools may need to be purchased , the results will make the investment worthwhile .
“ The two things with ice in drinks is reduction in temperature and dilution .
It depends on how much you want to invest to do those things well , ” Vogler says .
“ Once you ’ve used good ice , it ’s really hard to go back . ”
A former teenage hacker who once served prison time for an online stock - trading scheme pleaded guilty last week to new charges of cracking a New York - based currency exchange service and gifting himself more than $ 100,000 .
Van T. Dinh leaves a federal courthouse in Philadelphia in 2003 , when , as a 19 - year - old Drexel University student , he was charged with a hacking scheme the SEC called unusually complex .
AP Photo / Mark Stehle
On Sept. 29 , Van T. Dinh , now 25 , confessed to computer fraud and identity theft in federal court in Manhattan .
Dinh , who lives in Pennsylvania , gained notoriety in 2003 , when , as a 19 - year - old stock trader , he found a novel way to unload a bad investment in thousands of worthless stock derivatives :
He hacked into another trader 's account , and bought the options from his own account .
The gambit made Dinh the first person charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with a fraud involving both computer hacking and identity theft .
He was sentenced in 2004 to 13 months in prison , followed by three years of supervised release .
The punishment evidently did little to suppress Dinh 's appetite for high - risk ventures .
Last Dec. 30 , according to an FBI affidavit ( .pdf ) , Dinh set up a legitimate account with an online currency exchange service based in New York .
Two weeks later , he logged in using an administrative password and added $ 55,000 to his account .
The bureau says he added another $ 55,000 two days after that .
At the same time , Dinh used his access to make currency trades on two other customer accounts , and then gave one of them $ 140,326.75 , according to an affidavit by FBI agent Frank Manzi .
The FBI traced the hacking to an IP address assigned to the home Dinh shares with his mother in Phoenixville , Pennsylvania , near Philadelphia .
Dinh was arrested March 16 on an earlier version of the federal complaint .
He 's being held without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York as a " danger to the community by hacking activities , " among other reasons .
The victim company is n't identified in court documents , and it appears that the scam was uncovered before any money left the company 's coffers .
But the FBI says the hack cost the company more than $ 5,000 in restoration and recovery costs .
Dinh did not respond to a letter sent to him in jail following his arrest .
A phone call to his house was not returned .
The hacker 's early legal trouble also involved online trading accounts .
In 2003 , Dinh found himself the unhappy owner of $ 90,000 of Cisco
" put " options that were on the verge of expiring without a payoff .
Instead of absorbing the losses , the young trader used a Trojan horse program disguised as a stock charting tool to take control of an innocent victim 's online stock account .
He then had the victim 's account purchase $ 37,000 worth of his options , shaving his losses .
At his sentencing hearing on that earlier case , prosecutors read from an electronic diary found on Dinh 's computer .
" I am so proud of myself for my ' hacking business ' — I will never regret what I did , " Dinh wrote .
" I am the best of the best Trickster .
I laugh often when Mom says she worries ...
Even if I go to jail — big deal -— I will learn something there .
Hahaha . "
Behavior Change : Skins Tees at MNF
Chatting at 11:30 .
Submit questions here .
" I think the relentless negative coverage in The Washington Post is a real difference from previous years , " Redskins general counsel David Donovan said , in a quote I 'm likely to recycle 7,000 times in the next week or so .
" But in terms of the way our actual fans are behaving , we do n't see any difference . "
Look , there were 80,000 people at FedEx Field last night .
No way I personally saw any sizable portion of that mass of humanity .
But I did n't have to look particularly hard to find people wearing shirts that were crying out in rage .
White people and black people , men and women , old people and young people , professional people and working - class people .
Do eight pictures make the case for actual fans behaving in actual different ways ?
No , of course not .
It 's all anecdotal .
But when several tons of greasy anecdotes are dumped over your head , you have to have some pretty heavy - duty coating not to notice it at all .
Keep reading .
I 'm going to be beating this drum all day , but the number of people either kicked out Monday night , or threatened with ejection for showing signs of dissent really makes me want to give up on sports entirely .
You 're going to end dissent through the closest thing a stadium has to real force ?
That 's going to make people happier ?
By kicking them out for chanting " Danny Stinks ? "
By ripping up their signs asking for Ovechkin to call plays ?
Or , as in the case of the two men pictured above , by forcing them to turn their shirts inside - out under threat of removal ?
What about these guys ?
Explosive , right ?
I mean , these guys scream out " threat to the system . "
Well , they also had a sign on their tailgate that said it was the Official Dan Snyder [ Stinks ] Tailgate .
Three security guys said if the VP of Operations saw the banner , they would lose their season tickets and parking pass for the rest of the year .
" We called them on their bluff , " said Steven Ellis , 23 , of Centreville .
" He 's got better things to do .
We figured we were speaking for the voice of a lot of Redskins fans .
No big deal . "
( There were at least two different models of Snyder [ Stinks ] shirts , and I have images of both , but I 'm not allowed to use that word anymore .
Sorry . )
Do you care why these people were wearing these shirts ?
I mean , I could write down the quotes without even asking the questions , I 've heard the answers so many times , from so many people , in so many places .
" Snyder needs to leave , " said Katie Hogan of Gambrills , who had the above shirt custom - made .
" Then I think we'd have a chance at winning . "
" We just want on flash , five seconds [ of protest ] on Monday Night Football , " said Steve Sinnott of Baltimore , who printed up 150 shirts bearing a variety of critical messages and had no problem giving them away .
I 've said this before and I 'll say it again : you do n't have to interview people to hear the invective .
Literally , just walking around with my ears open , I heard fans discussing the policy of suing delinquent season ticket holders .
I heard fans making jokes about how they could n't give their Skins memorabilia away .
I heard the name of the owner coming out of one mouth after another .
What does it all mean ?
Well , it does n't mean the world is changing .
It 's still just a silly football team , and our silly love for sports .
But I 'm telling you , Redskins officials , in terms of the way your actual fans are behaving , things are a little bit different right now .
Maybe you 're still collecting on tickets and parking , and maybe you 're still getting boffo TV ratings , and maybe if you win six out of eight everything goes back to normal .
But right now ?
This very day ?
The behavior has changed .
Admitting that might be a step in the right direction .
SEOUL --
New reports emerged Tuesday of protests and deadly violence in North Korea as the country 's authoritarian regime over the past week seized most of its citizens ' money and savings via a new - currency issue .
Open Radio for North Korea , a Seoul - based shortwave radio station that broadcasts news to the North , said police killed two men in Pyongsong , a market center outside of Pyongyang , on Friday after they divided their savings among a large group of people and urged them to exchange the money for them , attempting to ...
One of Britain 's leading ethical travel operators has launched a scathing attack on the carbon offset industry and has decided to stop offering offsets to its customers as a way of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions .
Justin Francis , the founder of responsibletravel.com , said he had decided to abandon offsets because he believes they have become a " medieval pardon that allows people to continue polluting " .
In 2002 his company became one of the first British travel operators to begin offering customers the opportunity to buy into an offsetting scheme .
By paying money to a third party operator that ran carbon - reducing projects in the developing world , holidaymakers could jump on board flights supposedly happy in the knowledge that any carbon dioxide released during their journey would eventually be reduced by the equivalent amount somewhere else .
Supporters of the scheme , which has now become a multibillion pound industry , say it is a vital way of quickly reducing the world 's carbon emissions and combating climate change .
But a growing number of critics say it is simply a way for people and businesses in the developed world to buy their way out of a problem without actually committing themselves to reductions in their own emissions .
After years of falling into the former camp , Mr Francis has now joined the growing number of offset critics .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" Carbon offsetting is an ingenious way to avoid genuinely reducing your carbon emissions , " he said yesterday .
" It 's a very attractive idea – that you can go on living exactly as you did before when there 's a magic pill or medieval pardon out there that allows people to continue polluting . "
As some of the top polluters , the aviation and travel industries have been keen to promote carbon offsetting to their customers .
Until a fortnight ago responsibletravel.com used Climate Care , a major offsetting company which was recently acquired by the investment bank JP Morgan .
But Mr Francis said he became increasingly uneasy about the way the travel industry was using carbon offsets and pulled his company out of the scheme .
He added : " It was not an easy decision .
It would have been much easier for me to go on blithely offering offsets , keeping my head below the parapet .
But ultimately we need to reduce our carbon emissions .
We can do this by flying less – travelling by train or taking holidays closer to home for example , and by making carbon reductions in other areas of our lifestyles too . "
His decision , however , has been criticised by carbon offset companies who are adamant that buying carbon credits does lead to a tangible reduction in greenhouse gases .
Climate Care did not comment yesterday but James Ramsay , the commercial director of another offsetting firm , Carbon Clear , said : " If you are going to take the view that offsets do n't work then presumably you just stop there .
But the trajectory that we 've got to achieve for climate change does n't give us the luxury of time .
Waiting for , say , the aviation or travel industry to reduce its emissions leaves us way behind the trajectory of achieving 80 percent cuts in global carbon emissions by 2050 . "
Carbon offsetting is something that has always divided the environmental movement .
It was quickly transformed from a minor experimental idea into a multimillion - pound carbon market .
Europe 's carbon market alone is now worth £ 81bn and is expected to account for at least half of the European Union 's carbon reductions to 2020 .
Responsibletravel.com say they will now attach " carbon warnings " to their holiday packages detailing the damage done to the environment by a flight , just as cigarette packets warn of the hazards of smoking .
" What we have to do is offer holidays that are the most beneficial to the environment , " Mr Francis said .
" What we have to tell people is : ' Fly less and when you do fly , make it count ' . "
A multibillion - pound industry :
The cost of a clear conscience
What do some of the major offset companies charge for offsetting a return flight from London to Sydney for two people ?
* Climate Care : 11.23 tonnes of CO2 which costs £ 98.03 to offset .
* Carbon Clear : 2.82 tonnes of CO2 which costs £ 21.15 to offset
* The Carbon Neutral Company : 6.1 tonnes of CO2 which costs between £ 52 and £ 122 to offset depending on which project you choose
* Offset Carbon : 8 tonnes of CO2 at £ 76
* What do you get ?
Carbon Neutral Company offers a number of options to offset a return flight to Sydney .
The cheapest , costing £ 51.85 , goes towards capturing methane gas from a landfill in China , the most expensive ( £ 122 ) invests in a dam in India .
Why Barack Obama 's private pilgrimage to the Great Wall of China was not as solitary as the spin doctors make out

Solitary : President Obama walks alone down the Badaling section of The Great Wall of China in Beijing
It is a powerful image reproduced all over the world : the President of the United States striding alone last week along the Great Wall of China on his diplomatic tour of South East Asia .
Yet , as our main picture shows , Barack Obama ’s personal pilgrimage to the popular Badaling section of the Wall outside Beijing was not quite as solitary as his spin doctors would have us believe .
Chinese police officers guard the sentry tower and CIA agents are scattered throughout the crowd .
The group also includes some of the 300 highly trained Secret Service bodyguards who escorted Mr Obama throughout the week - long visit , which also took him to Japan , Singapore and South Korea .
All the bodyguards are armed with pistols and equipped with two - way radios .
They keep in touch with a central command post via a microphone attached to the watch on their left wrists , with each agent checking in every few minutes .
Keeping a low profile is a senior military officer from the Pentagon , carrying a black leather briefcase , who stays within 100 ft of the President at all times .
Inside the case there is a metallic Zero Halliburton briefcase that contains the codes needed to launch a nuclear attack .
Included in the entourage is a doctor , nurse and medical technician carrying emergency supplies , including bags of Mr Obama ’s own blood in case he needs a transfusion .
The last man behind the President , wearing a green wool hat , is Reggie Love , a 6ft 5in , 18 - stone muscle - packed former American football player who is the President ’s ‘ bodyman ’ .
He acts as valet , secretary , bodyguard and general factotum .
Or , as Reggie says , he is the White House Chief of Stuff .
Who 's who :
A whole host of people accompanied the President , including 300 trained bodyguards
In the pockets of his thick winter coat will be the President ’s BlackBerry and mobile phone , a pen and notepad , and a packet of Mr Obama ’s favourite chewing gum , Dentyne Ice .
Over the last couple of weeks I ’ve met some prospective customers from the Telecom domain here in India .
While they ’re all keyed about mobile learning , they have serious reservations about how they ( as telecom service providers ) can leverage their own networks .
I often point to some simple facts .
Each of their employees carries a cell phone and is connected to the network 24 hours a day .
These employees are scattered all over the Indian geography .
This presents a unique challenge and opportunity .
The challenge obviously is the delivery of any sort of training intervention using mobile phones .
The limitations imposed by screen size and capability , plus in the Indian context having to support a wide variety of languages and scripts .
The opportunity is clearly in the ubiquity of the devices amongst the employee base and ownership of the network and the technology for content delivery .
An easy solution to propose is the use of installable applications or browser based content access ; however it does n’t account for the largest singular reason such solution fail in India – 90 % + phones do not support GPRS data connectivity or lack a HTML standard compliant browser .
While this may seem strange to someone from the west , it ’s well known in India that the bulk of the phones are cheap and basic –phones such as these an do not features operating systems capable of handling installable , or a fully featured browser .
These are the phones that are selling in millions and are the ones that provide most of the voice and SMS traffic on the network .
However there is a technology that has existed for more than a decade , that provides a perfect fit for these innumerable basic phones – it ’s WAP Wireless Application Protocol .
There are three primary reasons :
U.S. citizens will soon be able to log in to government websites using their Google account , or the URL of their Yahoo profile .
It 's a significant embrace of the open and emerging tech standards the Obama administration promised .
The U.S. government pilot program will allow people to interact with various government websites using an OpenID or an Information Card , the nation 's information technology officer will announce Wednesday .
These are two of the most popular emerging technologies that let web users manage their identities across multiple websites .
Under the new program , which will go into effect in the coming weeks , people will be able to sign in , request information , participate in forums and build user profiles on the government 's websites without having to set up a new user account .
Anyone will be able to interact with the government sites using credentials provided to them by Yahoo , Google , AOL , VeriSign or PayPal , among others .
The pilot is scheduled to be announced by the U.S. government CIO Vivek Kundra at the Gov 2.0 Summit in Washington , D.C. , Wednesday morning .
The win here for the user is twofold .
First , you 'll have fewer logins and passwords to manage — your OpenID is a skeleton key that gets you in to every site .
It eliminates the scenario where you 'll have to create one user account to interact with Homeland Security , another to access housing records , and another to ask a question about healthcare .
Second , OpenID and the other technologies that support it afford you a high level of control over exactly how much information about you gets shared with the site you 're logging in to .
Those who only want to pass along the minimum can do so , and those who want to build a fullblown user profile can do so , as well .
This initiative is a major step toward opening government services and making public data accessible on the web , according to Chris Messina , an OpenID board member and the CEO of Citizen Agency .
" The U.S. government taking real steps to adopt open technologies has the potential to enhance and simplify citizen engagement , " Messina said .
Because it has blessing of the administration 's top techie , he stressed , " This is n't just some little skunkworks project off to the side . "
It also comes at a time when public discourse over issues like health care reform , global warming and education are reaching a fever pitch and many citizens are itching to have their questions answered or their grievances heard .
The government agencies participating in this program are the Center for Information Technology ( CIT ) , National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) .
All of their websites will begin accepting OpenID and InfoCard credentials within the coming weeks .
That 's only a handful of government agencies , but the OpenID Foundation , the nonprofit governing body that oversees the growth of the open source technology , hopes Wednesday 's announcement will kick off a domino effect across Washington , according to board member David Recordon , who now works at Facebook .
" For us , this is a helpful way of saying , ' Hey all of you other government agencies , if you 've been wondering what you have to do to adopt these technologies and increase public participation , here 's a stake in the ground you can point to that will help you get up to speed more rapidly , ' " Recordon said .
OpenID is a digital identity standard that lets people use a single ID , like a Google username or an AOL profile , to log in to multiple websites .
Several major companies are already OpenID providers , including Yahoo , Google , AOL , MySpace , and Microsoft .
Facebook is expected to become a provider soon .
InfoCard is a similar standard , championed by Microsoft and Equifax , to help users manage their digital identities .
However , the new pilot program wo n't allow users to log in using credentials from just any ID provider .
People will only be able to use OpenID or InfoCard credentials provided by the ten companies in the pilot program : Google , Yahoo , PayPal , AOL , VeriSign , Acxiom , CitiGroup , Privo , Equifax and Wave Systems .
These companies have undergone a certification process — designed by the Information Card Foundation , the OpenID Foundation and the federal government — that guarantees certain privacy safeguards .
For instance , the sites have to use SSL to handle logins , and they have to provide psuedonymous identifying information so the government can't correlate user identities ( and track a single user 's behavior ) across multiple agency websites .
This trust framework is there to reassure to the public , says Recordon .
" You should n't have to sacrifice security and privacy to participate in open government , " he says .
Messina contrasted OpenId to Facebook Connect , the popular social network 's way of letting users log in to other sites such as news sites using their Facebook ID .
Comments on that site can then be shared on a user 's Facebook page .
" Facebook Connect spews user data all over the net , but when it comes to the government , that 's the last thing you want , " Messina said .
" Using OpenID , if you do n't want to reveal any information about who you are , you are completely pseudonymous . "
The feds plan to start small .
One plan is to let users of the National Institute of Health website – which is full of detailed medical information – to save their research by bookmarking articles , without the government having any idea who actually controls a given account .
While that may not seem like a huge step , Messina says federal agencies are good at adopting what works at other agencies .
" Once we get a few successes going , this will happen very quickly , " Messina said .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Poland and the United States signed a deal on Friday that paves the way for the stationing of U.S. troops on the territory of its east European NATO ally .
Poland 's Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski ( L ) and Minister of Defence Bogdan Klich arrive for a news conference at the Ministry of Defence in Warsaw , December 2 , 2009 .

The “ status of forces ” accord ( SOFA ) , a technical document tentatively approved in November after 15 months of talks , also makes possible deployments of a U.S. Patriot missile battery in Poland next year as part of plans to upgrade its air defences .
“ This agreement is a good basis for cooperation between the U.S. and Polish armed forces in the future , ” Polish Defense Minister Bogdan Klich told reporters at the signing ceremony .
“ For Poland , this signifies a strengthening of our national security . ”
Poland , perturbed by Russia ’s more assertive foreign policy , has long complained that it hosts no U.S. troops or major military installations 10 years after it joined NATO and despite a strong track record of sending troops to help in U.S. - led missions in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski noted that the SOFA deal was concluded just a week after Poland agreed to send 600 more troops to join its 2,000 - strong contingent in Afghanistan after President Barack Obama ’s appeal to NATO allies for more help .
“ This ( deal ) is a kind of symbol because in the past there were forces which were not welcome , stationed on Polish soil without our invitation .
I ’m talking about Germans or Russians , ” military analyst Roman Kuzniar told Reuters Television , referring to World War Two and postwar Soviet domination .
Ellen Tauscher , U.S. under - secretary of state for arms control and international security , said Washington hoped to send U.S. forces to Poland as soon as it could , but gave no date .
The Patriot deal struck last year between Warsaw and the previous Bush administration and now backed by Obama envisages an armed Patriot battery being sent to Poland from Germany several times each year until 2012 .
Polish officials say a battery would be permanently based in Poland from 2012 and that Warsaw would also aim to buy its own anti-missile systems .
Pathological gambling can be successfully treated with medications that decrease urges and increase inhibitions , according to researchers at the annual meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology ( ACNP ) .
Researchers found positive outcomes in gamblers treated with medications often used for substance addictions .
People with pathological gambling disorder will continue their gambling behavior in the face of damaging consequences to themselves and their families .
Dr. Jon Grant and his team at the University of Minnesota used tasks that measure cognition to identify what motivates this extreme type of gambling behavior .
They enrolled men and women with a primary diagnosis of pathological gambling in one of three medication studies .
Study sites varied in size from 70 to 100 participants .
Researchers sought to understand how gamblers decide whether or not to bet by focusing on two brain processes : urge and inhibition .
In order to group individuals into categories that address differences in their biology , Grant separated pathological gamblers into two major subtypes : gamblers who are driven by urge ( i.e. , individuals who report gambling when the desire becomes too strong to control ) , and those who do not show normal inhibition of impulsive behaviors ( i.e. , individuals who report being unable to restrict behaviors even when urges are minimal or virtually non-existent ) .
In the first subtype , gamblers who are driven by urge responded well to treatment with medications that block the brain opioid system ( e.g. , naltrexone ) or certain receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate ( e.g. , memantine ) .
Grant also found that family history plays an important role in refining this group even further .
People with a family history of addiction responded even better to the opioid blocker , which has been shown in other studies to decrease the urge to use substances such as alcohol .
The second subtype , gamblers who have difficulty inhibiting their behaviors and react to the smallest desires , respond well to medications that act on a specific enzyme , catechol - O- methyl - transferase ( COMT ) , which plays a major role in the function of the prefrontal cortex .
Researchers found that decreasing the function of COMT can increase one 's ability to inhibit their desire to gamble .
" By understanding these different subtypes , we are able to target the core biology of the illness with individualized treatment , " said Jon Grant , MD , JD , MPH , Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota and ACNP member .
" When we look at pathological gambling as an addiction and try to understand the sense of urges and inhibitions , we are able to target the treatment with medication more effectively . "
Grant cautioned that while these results are exciting and a majority of people respond to these medications , there are still some for whom these medications do not work .
Additional research is needed to further refine the subtypes .
Pathological gambling affects approximately one to two percent of the population .
Currently available treatments are associated with extremely high relapse rates .
Turning Point ?
Rutland Herald , You Have No Point
A November 12 editorial appearing in Vermont ’s Rutland Herald titled “ A Turning Point ” reveals in fineness the blind cult of statism ; the idea that government , by using its power of violent coercion , is somehow capable of exercising a kind of noble compassion .
In lambasting “ conservatives ” ( always the manner in which dogmatic leftists paint with a broad brush anyone who may even question the notion of government being anything but mankind ’s greatest invention ) , the piece states :
“ For 30 years or more , they have seen history going in their direction , even if the conservative revolution , as it has been styled , never achieved completion .
This has been a span of history dominated by the idea that government was an impediment to progress and an enemy of freedom . ”
Had any of this actually been the case – to wit , that “ conservatives ” had truly embraced the aforestated concept , likely government today would either be skeletal , or entirely non-existent .
The government - worshippers would ’ve all been discredited and discarded generations ago .
The editorial continues : “ And yet the decades prior to the Reagan revolution were shaped by another view – that government had a vital role to play in guaranteeing security from attack by our enemies abroad and from economic catastrophe at home . ”
Note immediately the ignorance and arrogance expressed by this collectivistic buffoon .
Sorry , the U.S. government ’s enemies are not necessarily my enemies , so do n’t try dragging me under that umbrella with you , Mr. Statist .
If the government you love like a religion had n’t spent over the last 100 years meddling violently ( and government only exists by use of violence ) with people in foreign lands , Americans would have little to fear in terms of war or terrorism .
And as for economic catastrophe ?
Explain to me how governmental interventionism , distortion of markets , baseless debt - driven fiat currency issued by the Federal Reserve , and heavy - handed taxation have helped anyone except politicians and others who produce nothing – much less anything of actual value .
It gets even better : “ Roosevelt [ Franklin D. , not Teddy ] saw both his great programs as essential in protecting freedom – his program to attack the Depression and his program to win World War II .
It was his insight that no one can be free who lacks a job , a meal , a house , or good health . ”
I could pull this apart in a thousand different ways while standing on my head , but let ’s keep it simple : The Depression happened because the Federal Reserve wanted it to .
When certain independent banks – yes , there were still some in those days – balked at becoming part of the Fed ’s sinister system , they brought the walls down as a little punitive incentive to get all dissenters in line .
As for WW2 , it was only after FDR deliberately started a stell - trade war with the Japanese and insisted on shipping American arms to England at taxpayer expense that America got involved .
Had he not been such a provocateur , no Americans would have died in or been forced to pay for that war .
American ships and lives would ’ve never been attacked .
And further , how was “ freedom ” ever “ protected ” by a military draft , wage withholding ( introduced in 1943 as a “ voluntary ” – and supposedly temporary — wage tax ) , rationing , etc . ?
And , I further fail to understand the logic behind the idea that forcing others at gunpoint to subsidize someone ’s meals , house , and health is “ essential in protecting freedom . ”
It sounds like one of the best ways , rather , to rationalize taking any and all freedom away .
More of the same irrational bunk appears later in the piece : “ Some of Roosevelt ’s greatest accomplishments had to do with protecting Americans from the ravages of unchecked capitalism .
He brought the nation ’s banks under greater regulation .
He established a system to protect farm income .
He created Social Security for the elderly . ”
Capitalism evil .
The “ nation ’s ” banks under tighter rules than the Fed .
Farm subsidies .
The SS Ponzi scheme first developed in Otto von Bismarck ’s Prussia .
Yeah , just great stuff .
This continues : “ Social Security requires a government bureaucracy – ‘ big government ’ – but few would argue that establishing a basic level of economic security for the elderly does not secure freedom for them and their families . ”
I guess I ’m one of those few , pal .
What this scam fosters is dependency on one end , and slavery on the other .
There is no “ freedom ” being secured .
That ’s an illusion all in your Marxist mind , Mr. Statist .
The piece continues in the same collectivist vein – that housing , education ( read “ indoctrination ” ) , food , health care , and a job are all somehow “ rights ” that must be payed for by others .
This dimwit actually hails federal food stamps and housing ( some of the worst slums around , by the way ) , Medicare and Medicaid as huge successes of government , when in truth they have all been miserably bureaucratized failures that have only succeeded in destroying individual liberty .
Towards the end , the author invokes a quote from FDR , the socialist : “ In our personal ambitions we are individualists .
But in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation , we all go up , or else we all go down , as one people . ”
If FDR can hear me , I ’m an individualist all the way , 100 %
And the only way you can drag me down with your deluded notion of there being a “ nation ” or “ one people ” – both fictitious mental concepts at best – is at gunpoint .
And that kind of a system has nothing at all to do with freedom .
Thus , neither does anything government does .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - A Venezuelan man who had been declared dead woke up in the morgue in excruciating pain after medical examiners began their autopsy .
Carlos Camejo , 33 , was declared dead after a highway accident and taken to the morgue , where examiners began an autopsy only to realize something was amiss when he started bleeding .
They quickly sought to stitch up the incision on his face .
“ I woke up because the pain was unbearable , ” Camejo said , according to a report on Friday in leading local newspaper El Universal .
His grieving wife turned up at the morgue to identify her husband ’s body only to find him moved into a corridor -- and alive .
Reuters could not immediately reach hospital officials to confirm the events .
But Camejo showed the newspaper his facial scar and a document ordering the autopsy .
Rehman Malik is one of thousands who benefited from the amnesty A judge in Karachi has summoned the Interior Minister , Rehman Malik to appear before an anti-corruption court .
It follows a court ruling this week which ruled out an immunity granted to the minister and thousands of other Pakistani officials .
Mr Malik is one of around 250 officials whose corruption and criminal cases have been re-opened .
On Thursday Defence Minister Ahmed Mukhtar was barred from going to China after he was stopped at the airport .
Mr Mukhtar said immigration officials prevented him from boarding the plane for an official visit .
The latest developments after the supreme court ruled on Wednesday that an amnesty protecting senior members of government was unconstitutional .
Only recently has it been revealed that more than 8,000 politicians and officials benefited from the legislation .
Those under investigation are barred from leaving Pakistan but the others have so far not been named .
Presidential immunity
The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Islamabad says that the ruling has thrown Pakistan 's political administration into turmoil .
Many ministers may now have their movements curtailed Our correspondent says that calls are growing for the president and the entire government to step down - something presidential aides have said will not happen .
The controversial amnesty was brought in by the previous president , Pervez Musharraf , and its removal opens the way to possible prosecution for allies of the current President , Asif Zardari .
Mr Zardari himself faces several pending court cases against him in Pakistan but is protected by presidential immunity .
Before taking office , he spent years in jail after being indicted for corruption , charges he says were politically motivated .
Pakistan 's main opposition , the Pakistan Muslim League - N of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , has called on the president to resign .
Exit list Mr Mukhtar told local television that his name was on the " exit list " restricting travel and that the federal investigation authorities had said he could not leave the country .
He told Geo TV that he had been planning to visit China for three days on an official visit in connection with the delivery of a warship .
" It was in connection with a corruption case but there is no corruption case against me - it is only an inquiry which is pending against me for the past 12 years . "
He said he would " strongly defend " himself in court .
The amnesty was introduced by Mr Musharraf in order to allow Mr Zardari 's late wife , Benazir Bhutto , to return to the country and stand for office , with the aim of a possible power - sharing deal with Mr Musharraf .
She returned to Pakistan from abroad after the so - called National Reconciliation Ordinance was signed into law , but was assassinated soon after .

I am Daryl Katz .
I 'm a whale hunter .
Since purchasing the Oilers , my reign has been characterized by hunting down the biggest of the big whales in the NHL .
Marian Hossa , Jaromir Jagr , Dany Heatley , Nikolai Khabibulin - all names that light up the marquee , all names that sparkled in my eye .
If my OIlers should miss the playoffs again this year , I 'll be put in a very precarious position - the fanbase will start to turn on my President and General Manager , and eventually , they 'll turn on me .
I will have nothing to offer them but the promise of hope , but Kevin Lowe and Steve Tambellini wo n't be able to deliver for me .
I 'll need to find someone else to run this team .
I do n't try to hire anyone without first hiring the most famous name I can find .
I 'll need a whale of enormous proportions .
Someone that the fanbase would consider a hero , a hockey hero .
Someone that can once again deliver the promise of hope to the people of Alberta .
A whale that can bring the hope of the past glories back to the Oilers .
Someone that can guarantee fan interest wo n't soon decline .
I 'm Mark Messier .
In the sports world , I 'm a whale .
In the hockey world , I 'm one of the biggest whales , especially since my good friend Wayne went off track in Phoenix .
I 'm Edmonton - bred , born and raised , and I am Alberta 's greatest hockey hero .
I won six stanley cups in my time in the NHL and became known as the game 's greatest captain .
I once called my shot that I would deliver a Stanley Cup and I delivered a Stanley Cup .
When I was playing , I was bold and brash and had the game to back it up .
I was the biggest thing in hockey on the biggest stage in the world .
I 'm beloved everywhere in North America , except Vancouver and Calgary .
I was a take - no - prisoners masher and I will be again .
My relationship with the Oilers has been good and the fans continue to love me .
I 'd love to go back there , but given that my old buddy Kevin Lowe is already in charge of the entire franchise , I know that there 's not enough room in Rexall Place for the both of us .
The only way that I 'll ever make it back to Edmonton is if the Oilers were to let Kevin go , but he 's got a job for life .
After basking in the glow of my great career that spanned three decades and cup wins in both Edmonton and New York , this year I decided that I wanted to enter hockey management .
I needed someone to give me an in so that I could join the closed ranks of NHL management , so I turned to an old friend , Glen Sather .
Glen gave me a job as a special assistant to the general manager .
I expect that Glen will show me the ropes in the NHL , give me the ins and outs of managing the business , hook me up with the secrets that he uses to run the Rangers and set me on my way .
I expect that one year in this role will give me the management resume I need to land a General Manager 's job in the NHL ..
To make sure that everyone is aware I 'm available , I decided to take the job as General Manager of Team Canada 's 2010 World Championship team .
Raising my profile with this job , combined with my job with the Rangers and my history of winning all but guarantees a job offer in the summer of 2010 I 'll show that I 'm able to work with talent and evaluate players for the team and I 'll do some elbow - rubbing with those involved with Hockey Canada .
My name will light up news ledes and shine brightly on the marquee once again .
I only hope that it will shine brightly enough to attract the attention of a team or two .
I only need one interview to impress an owner , especially an owner that will be impressed by my celebrity .
Someone that would love to hire a whale .

Thank You !
Since " O " has been in office I have thought " we " finally have a President to represent the average person even though he was a member of the DLC while a senator !
The corporate military industrial complex must have put a note under his pillow the first night he spent in the White house reminding him of JFK and RFK !
The party crashers at the white house may have been another warning to him on how easy it is to put some one right next to him and his family !
Other than sheer greed what reasons for " O " 's decisions and policies on all of the issues we elected him for could there be ???
This is just another of his unbelievable insane decisions he and his administration have made !
Maybe we are all just whistling in the dark when we assume we live in a real democracy where we the people have a say ?
All my life the corporate military industrial complex have been calling all of the shots .
Can we save ourselves from ourselves before it's to late ???

Doug Jones , while considered a " good guy " by many , did n't blow the whistle on any of the Diebold flaws found in about five minutes by 50 - year - old ladies , a gun nut , a Finnish guy .
" Mr. Jones served on the Iowa Board of Examiners for Voting Machines and Electronic Voting Systems for 10 years , where he helped examine and approve voting systems before they were sold to the state 's county governments .
That 's right .
He was the examiner for the Diebold ( then called Global Election Systems ) stuff from the mid 1990s on .
Yet you did n't read about the problems until Black Box Voting exposed them .
All these experts are tainted by their unwillingness to voice unpopular truths to the public .
And I do n't buy hiding behind a nondisclosure agreement as any excuse whatsoever .

To be fair , on this point at least , the decision to appoint Smith was the EAC commissioners .
Currently there are 2 Rs ( one of them the chair ) and 1 D on the commission .
Obama has yet to appoint the second D to fill the vacant spot .
Even with 2
Ds and 2 Rs , however , the EAC has proven itself over and over again to be a miserable failure .
In every respect .
Here in Nevada elected politicians and activists I have known for over 30 years just do not listen to any criticism of the dean heller sequoia gambling system we have turned over our entire election process to !
Please go out and buy Mark Crispin Miller 's " Loser Take All " and get it to everyone in NV !
In it , Michael Richardson , John Gideon and myself have an investigative expose on the illegal way in which Dean Heller " certified " those Sequoia machines in your state , blatantly lying to the public and blatantly violating the law .
Nobody has done a damned thing about it , despite our nearly 6 months of investigation for that report , showing all of the above in no uncertain terms .
Heller should be arrested .
That said , Obama and the Dems looked the other way as one Sequoia machine after another failed in the early voting lead up to the '09 election in NV .
The BRAD BLOG documented that exclusively right here .

As good as your election / e- voting coverage is - the fairness of vote tabulations DOES NOT MATTER is the elections are dominated by 2 sham candidates .
" Yes we can " was clearly a sham .
The " change " that obama ran on was a lie .
Many examples of this have been posted here ( and elsewhere ) , but the white house pressuring reid to accomodate joe LIE - berman 's demand to gut even the lame senate healthcare bill should be the last " proof " any reasonable person needs .
And do n't kid yourself - the link I posted may say " rahm " in the title , but the buck stop with obama .

This is the kind of thing we can all do something about - we can send emails to Michael Moore , Rachel Maddow & Greg Palast to alert them to speak out .
We can coss-post to aggregate news sites like OpEdNews ( a very worthwhile site that 's my ' other ' news feed ; though its traffic seems low , the range of articles is vast & the quality excellent ) , post our comments on HuffPost & DailyKos .
This is OUR job people !
Brad can't do it all himself .
It 's up to us to Digg these articles too .
Did you know that we could create our own Digg community , thus increasing articles ' relevance ?
Anyone wanna help me start this ?
( I 'm just learning about Digg after Mr. Canfield suggested Digging his amazing article on Afghanistan & the war machine . )
If I hear a yea , I 'll post an email addy to the list to get it going .
It 's our country , and I want it BACK !
Also , what activist organizations do you belong to - let them know that publicly funded elections & hand - counted paper ballots WILL remove the corporate deathgrip from our necks .
In addition , as I 've mentioned before : get your money out of the Banksters ' hands .
If you switch your accounts to local banks that invest sustainably , the those robber barons CAN 'T use your money against you !

Thanks , Brad .
It 's not unbelievable at all if you assume that Obama is the true " black job " President , which I 've been trying hard not to say outright at my site due to wanting to " give him another chance " as they say in the " forgiveness " blogs .
This is my final straw .
The only reason for this to happen is that those who make the decisions ( way up above us in the clouds of glory , I guess ) have decided that they do n't care whether or not the public knows that from now on we will live and die according to Sequoia / Diebold vote counts .
As if we have n't already .

it can only be his insurance company masters ... and the fbi isnt interested ... just like they are not interested in the the pay offs the rep nevada senator made to his mistresses family or the clearly illegal lobbying he set up for his former aid the mistresses husband .... i could go on and on but what i would like to know is why we all can not seem to band together to collectively challenge these " foxes " ( i do think vr's dif campaigns r worthwhile but how do we get them any real msm attention ? ) when the ny 23 numbers came out i went out on a limb and spent a couple days on bbv trying bring attention to hayes research that showed 9 - 12 % of the ballots were not counted on the machines ( in several precincts ) , i got 3 or 4 of the regs to comment but past that nothing , and the original data hayes refered to was nevr posted so the discussion just stopped , , , , but back to your original question , the neo cons must think the insiders being in charge of the hen house ( fed reserve ) is the most important because after comacst bought nbc , the morning meeting was taken off the air ( at least in bloomington ) and now that it is back it has been cut to an hour and dylan ( who really railed against the bankers and wall street ) is doing a lot more " entertainment " news ... this appointment will nevr even hit the airwaves ( msm ) thank you brad for your excellant reporting

Obama is not responsible for this decision directly .
HAD he appointed a reasonable Democrat to the Commission , it 's not even clear whether it would be a 2 - 2 vote , ( or whether the current Democrat on EAC would vote with the R's ) , and how that would be broken if it WERE a 2 - 2 .
However , it would be easy for Obama to make a public speech and CALL OUT THE ASSHOLE and ruin his life .
If the President of the United States were to claim that you were totally unqualified for a position you had been given and that the Republicans who placed you there were nearly treasonous in their actions , it would make it hard for him to serve .
Whoops , sorry , I lost my mind for moment and fell into DREAMLAND , where Obama was n't ruled by Rahm Emmanuel , but rather by an interest in preserving the Constitution .
--- NEVER MIND .
Perhaps Obama can just END this Commission somehow ?
I think the " powers that be " are realizing that with peer to peer and social networking and blogs , we might be close to the population actually FIGURING IT OUT and realizing how they are being screwed , and getting ready to vote out a lot of DINO 's , centrists and Rethuglicans in favor of some liberal and progressive candidates , and that no amount of corporate - controlled media and spin could stop that drive .
And , realizing that , they see that they must have total control over the ballot counting , as they will definitely NOT have control over the ballot voting .
And , I 'm sad to say , I think they are there .

Couple of years ago I went to see my rep Barney Frank to try to light a fire under his ass about the urgency of election reform .
First thing I noticed was his lack of social skills .
Had to wonder how someone that rude and dismissive could get as far as he has as a " servant of the people " .
And he 's one of those really smart people ( and he IS really smart , I 'll give him that ) who's so smart he even knows more than you ( a concerned citizen who 's been obsessing about and studying election integrity issues for years ) about stuff he does n't know shit about , like election integrity issues .
I tried to direct him to Maxine Waters hoping they were tight and believing her to be better informed .
He said he would talk to her though I see no indication that he ever did .
One of several maddeningly stupid things he said during this visit was in response to my complaint that the EAC was terrible and should be done away with .
He said no , we should n't cuz soon we 'll be in charge and then we 'll get to put our people in .

Suntech Power , China ’s largest solar panel manufacturer , plans to open its first American plant near Phoenix , the company announced on Monday .
It would be the first time a Chinese solar company has built a manufacturing plant in the United States , experts said .
The plant will begin production in the third quarter of 2010 and will build panels from solar cells shipped from China .
Those cells , in turn , contain substantial amounts of a substance called polysilicon manufactured at a factory in Texas .
Roger Efird , a managing director of Suntech , said in a telephone interview that shipping costs were an important factor in the decision to put a factory in the growing American market .
Solar panels , with substantial amounts of glass and aluminum , are heavy , he said .
“ As the price of solar panels has reduced dramatically in the last 12 months , the shipping costs have become a larger and larger portion of the overall cost of getting these projects to market , ” Mr. Efird added .
The battles are unfailingly barbaric , and almost always fought to the death .
In a rare glimpse of a reality that wildlife photography rarely shows , this stark series of images illustrates how brutal life can be for the animals we might only see in a zoo .
From the ferocity of Siberian tigers grappling in the snow , to the disturbing sight of a hippo falling victim to a pride of lions , these are kind of confrontations that animals face daily in the wild .
Taken by famed wildlife photographer Steve Bloom , the images also demonstrate what happens when members of the same species engage in a battle for supremacy .
Among the incredible images in his ' Conflit ' series , two Bald Eagles fight for airspace above Alaska , elephants in Botswana clash tusks in the dust , and snarling polar bears fight for dominance .
Bloom , 56 , who is most famous for his images of swimming elephants and stallions crashing through the surf , concedes that the images in the portfolio lay bare the reality of life in the animals ' natural habitat .
' People often have a sentimental view of wildlife and they have this idealistic view , but animals are experiencing the same sort of stresses that we experience , but in a different way , ' he said .
' They are constantly trying to deal with killing and finding food and avoiding being killed and eaten .
That is the overriding preoccupation along with reproducing and trying to stay alive .
' There is a huge amount of conflict and a huge amount of stress . '
He admitted that being a spectator to that could be both thrilling and distressing , and that he often struggled with the dilemma of whether to intervene , or to simply stand back and let nature take its course .
In any case , it seems , the law of the jungle will prevail .
There are 3,200 Italian personnel already serving in Afghanistan Italy is to send about 1,000 extra troops to Afghanistan , say reports .
The move comes two days after US President Barack Obama announced that America was sending 30,000 more forces to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban .
Mr Obama has asked Nato allies to increase their deployments in Afghanistan , but several European nations are reluctant to do so .
The alliance 's foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels for two days of talks set to focus on the US request .
In an interview published on Thursday , Italy 's Defence Minister , Ignazio La Russa , confirmed reports that Rome would send about 1,000 extra soldiers to the country .
Mr La Russa told the Corriere della Sera newspaper suggestions in the media that 1,500 soldiers could be sent were " just a hypothesis " .
He said the figure was " a maximum quota which we would never reach " , reported Reuters news agency .
Italy currently has 3,200 soldiers serving in Afghanistan .
On Tuesday , Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said the conflict was a test of Nato's " credibility " and that it was " clear that Italy must finish the job started with Nato " .
Sceptical America has asked for 10,000 more forces from Nato allies to help win a war that has in recent months turned increasingly bloody .
Failure in Afghanistan would mean a Taliban takeover of much , if not most , of the country and likely a renewed civil war

Pakistan press concern US doubts and hopes Nato pledges 5,000 Afghan troops Afghan concern over pullout date Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said other Nato countries will provide at least 5,000 extra personnel , and " probably a few thousand on top of that " .
But the full extent of additional resources coming from Nato allies remains unclear .
As well as Italy , Britain , Georgia , Poland and Slovakia have all pledged more soldiers but other nations such as France , Germany and Denmark are being more cautious .
It is expected that further countries will declare their intentions over the next two days but just how many is still not clear , reports BBC defence and security correspondent Nick Childs from Brussels .
Many Nato governments face publics even more sceptical about the mission than those of the US and Britain .
A senior US official has said this is a process that is going to take days and weeks .
But Nato officials believe that , at the end of it , some 20 countries will end up pledging extra resources , our correspondent says .
' No guarantees '
The 30,000 additional service personnel will take the US military presence in Afghanistan to over 100,000 .
MARDELL'S AMERICA Mr Obama 's top team have been on Capitol Hill trying to convince the serious and senior elected politicians that this is the right strategy
Read Mark Mardell 's thoughts in full Top White House officials spent much of Wednesday bolstering domestic support for the surge .
Joint Chiefs of Staff head Adm Mike Mullen , Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton all addressed congressional committees on the issue .
" This is a huge commitment .
It 's the right commitment .
And it gives us the forces to turn this thing around , " Adm Mullen said .
He said that while there were no guarantees , he expected to " make significant headway in the next 18 - 24 months " .
Mr Gates warned that failure to act " would mean a Taliban takeover of much , if not most , of the country " and the creation of a sanctuary for al - Qaeda militants .
But senior Republican John McCain warned that although the strategy would succeed , US and UK troop casualties would rise in the short term , and he criticised Mr Obama 's target date for withdrawal .
" We need to make it clear to the enemy that we 're going to succeed and we are going to stay as long as necessary to succeed , " he said .
It is also emerging that some of those 5,000 extra non-US troops will not be entirely new - they will be forces that were sent out temporarily to support the Afghan elections that will now be staying on .

manufacturers have been selling 802.11n products for many years
The next - generation of wi-fi technology has finally been approved for use , despite being on sale in laptops and other equipment for several years .
The 802.11n technology , as it is known , was ratified by the IEEE , a body that oversees all wi-fi standards .
It was conceived seven years ago and offers speeds at least six times faster than current approved technology .
Electronics firms have sold PCs and routers using the standard for many years , labelled " 802.11n draft " .
But without the IEEE 's approval , there were no guarantees that future networking equipment would be compatible with the devices .
The IEEE 's rubber stamp has changed that .
All existing draft 802.11n wi-fi products will work with the final standard , according to the Wi-Fi Alliance , a group that tests wireless products to ensure compliance .
" This was an extraordinarily wide - ranging technical challenge , " said Bruce Kraemer of the IEEE .
" When we started in 2002 , many of the technologies addressed in 802.11n were university research topics and had not been implemented . "
Under ideal conditions , 802.11n technology can offer speeds of 300 megabits per second ( Mbps ) and above , many times higher than the previous 802.11g , which operates at speeds of up to 54 Mbps .
It is also able to transfer data over distances of 90 m ( 300 ft ) indoors , double that of previous technologies .
It 's somewhat shocking to discover from a Google Doodle that Sesame Street is 40 years old .
The educational show created by the Children 's Television Workshop certainly has legs , as they say , and Google has chosen to highlight the ones belonging to Big Bird rather than exploit Kermit , Bert and Ernie , Elmo or other likely candidates …
Well , that 's true for the US and Canada , though your local version of Google may vary .
There are different logos and different characters in different countries , as The Next Web has pointed out .
And in the UK , where Sesame Street ( as distinct from The Muppets ) has not had the same cultural impact , Google has gone with Wallace and Gromit 's 20th birthday instead .
Google 's Sesame Street celebration is slightly early -- it should be on 10 November , when there will be an anniversary show featuring First Lady Michelle Obama , with or without Hula Hoop .
There will also be a couple of books : Sesame Street : A Celebration of Forty Years of Life on the Street , and Street Gang : The Complete History of Sesame Street .
When I was growing up in Canada in the early 1970s * , I almost never missed Sesame Street , and while Big Bird was never the best character , I enjoyed his jousts with Mr Hooper Hooper .
In the UK , however , the series was considered too fast - paced and people frowned on its use of advertising techniques .
Of course , a series made for disadvantaged inner-city kids also had lots of elements unfamiliar in suburban Surrey , or even Islington .
And even the most brilliant of those early episodes would not pass through the Political Correctness barrier today .
* Technically , I was doing an MA at UBC at the time , but I also did some toddler - sitting with some of Sesame Street 's biggest fans .
The number of cases related to breast cancer is on the rise across the world and hence early detection can prove to be very useful .
Mammography has always been used for detecting breast cancer .
A new technique called thermography is used to screen women for breast cancer .
In this technique , the patient has to hold up her arms and the technician then takes infrared photos .
Then , halfway through the patient puts her hands in cold water for 60 seconds and again photos are clicked .
The photos are looked for increased blood flow where cancer cells may be growing .
This method is FDA approved and leads to very early detection .

War is a Racket by Smedley D. Butler
Via : ABC News :
As he justified sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan at a cost of $ 30 billion a year , President Barack Obama ’s description Tuesday of the al Qaeda “ cancer ” in that country left out one key fact : U.S. intelligence officials have concluded there are only about 100 al Qaeda fighters in the entire country .
A senior U.S. intelligence official told ABCNews.com the approximate estimate of 100 al Qaeda members left in Afghanistan reflects the conclusion of American intelligence agencies and the Defense Department .
The relatively small number was part of the intelligence passed on to the White House as President Obama conducted his deliberations .
President Obama made only a vague reference to the size of the al Qaeda presence in his speech at West Point , when he said , “ al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same number as before 9/11 , but they retain their safe havens along the border . ”
A spokesperson at the White House ’s National Security Council , Chris Hensman , said he could not comment on intelligence matters .
People who live in nice houses like this have pretty tulips -- and the clout to get out of paying their fair share of taxes
Congress is under extreme pressure to act by the end of the year .
If it does nothing , current law will make the estate tax disappear on Jan. 1 , only to return in 2011 at higher rates and lower exemptions ...
Democratic leaders [ K Street toadies Steny Hoyer and Rahm Emanuel ] want to move a permanent extension of the 2009 structure of the estate tax , which features a $ 3.5 million per-person exemption and a top rate of 45 percent .
Liberals are upset that such an extension -- which would cost $ 233.6 billion over 10 years and benefit the country ’s wealthiest families -- would not be offset , even as they have to scrape up every dollar they can to offset health care legislation .
Meanwhile , a moderate faction led by Shelley Berkley , D - Nev. , has offered a proposal that would be more favorable to estates .
It would gradually bring the top rate down to 35 percent , and push the exemption up to $ 5 million and index it for inflation .
Berkley ’s legislation mirrors a plan supported by a bipartisan group of senators during the budget debate earlier this year .
The amendment -- offered by Blanche Lincoln , D - Ark. , and Jon Kyl , R - Ariz .-- was adopted by a 51 - 48 vote , signaling that Republicans and moderate Democrats had the clout to get a better deal for estates than the 2009 rates .
That move would spare Democrats from endorsing a tax cut for the wealthiest few families during a time of double - digit unemployment .
But Rangel , D - N.Y. , and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer , D - Md. , have been seeking a permanent extension of current law , which would cost $ 233.6 billion over 10 years but would not have to be offset under the budget framework backed by Democrats .
An estate tax bill is expected to reach the floor after the Thanksgiving recess .
Under current law , the tax includes a top rate of 45 percent and a per-person exemption of $ 3.5 million .
If Congress does nothing , the tax disappears Jan. 1 and then returns , with a $ 1 million exemption and a 55 percent top rate , in 2011 .
Rangel said that no final decisions had been made and that committee Democrats would meet again later Wednesday .
But Larson and Neal said the direction Democrats were heading was clear .
A one - year extension would make the estate tax levels expire at the same time as many other provisions in the tax code , potentially giving members an opportunity for a broader rewrite of the revenue structure .
It was unclear whether the estate tax measure would include specific language that would somehow trigger a broader tax measure .
A one - year bill could face some difficulty , however .
A leading Ways and Means moderate , Earl Pomeroy , D - N.D. , warned that the push for a one - year extension might falter in the broader Democratic caucus .
“ It ’s not about that room , ” he said , gesturing toward Rangel ’s off - the - floor office , where Democrats met Wednesday morning .
He threatened to vote against the rule that would bring such a bill to the floor and said other members of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Caucus might do the same .
A rush of tax evaders applied before the program 's Oct. 15 deadline -- nearly double the IRS preliminary tally -- taking advantage of guarantees that they would n't face criminal prosecution if they paid taxes , interest and reduced civil penalties ...
The leniency offer accompanied the IRS ' legal battle with UBS , which in February agreed to a $ 780 million settlement of criminal charges that it had secretly sent bankers into the U.S. to help American clients evade taxes .
The bank later turned over data for up to 250 Americans whose accounts had alleged signs of tax evasion .
Under the federal civil settlement , Swiss authorities have until August to disclose accounts for 4,450 American clients of UBS .
Federal officials said the first 500 would be identified by month 's end .
The targeted UBS accounts include those that held more than 1 million Swiss francs -- roughly $ 985,000 -- any time between 2001 and 2008 for which " tax fraud or the like " is suspected .
The battle over the Estate Tax is heating up again .
The simplistic way to look at it is that the defenders of wealthy elites -- the Republican Party and DLC and Blue Dog Democrats ( particularly Blanche Lincoln ) -- are opposing real Democrats , who want to reform a system that the Bush Regime re-jiggered to save a handful of billionaires immense amounts of money ( which is , at least in part , what put the deficit out of whack ) .
That story line works , but it does n't tell the whole story .
It really is n't just the obvious villains who are currying favor with the richest 1 percent of Americans .
Tuesdaycarried a report that the House was likely to delay consideration if any kind of estate tax .
Recall that when Blanche Lincoln and Jon Kyl tried tothe rate on estates worth more than $ 7 million ( under which the rate is ; they pay nothing ) , their efforts ( in her case on behalf of the Walton family which owns so much of WalMart ) met some success Wednesday 's followed - up with the story of a revolt from the Democratic congressional ranks .
Real Democrats are telling Hoyer and House Ways and Means Committee Chair -- and notorious crook -- Charlie Rangel that they 're not going along with this proposal that puts an unfair tax burden of the middle class to clean up the mess that corporate America made on behalf of the very wealthiest families .
John Larson ( D - CT ) and Richard Neal ( D - MA ) led the revolt that ended in a Ways and Means Committee vote that backs a one - year extension and ties it to a broader overhaul of the tax code next year .
Before you listen to Parker Griffith ( Blue Dog - AL ) , who is both a multimillionaire and the single most reactionary Democrat in Congress , please remember that assets left to spouses ( or charities ) are exempt from estate taxes , as are family farms .
The idea behind an estate tax is to ameliorate the accumulation of tax free wealth in the hands of a small number of families .
Estate taxes in America are far too low and have already led in the dangerous direction of perpetuating the nation 's wealth in the hands of a few powerful families .
Even conservative icon Winston Churchill famously argued that estate taxes are argued that estate taxes are “ a certain corrective against the development of a race of idle rich , " and argument entirely embraced by two of America 's wealthiest men , Bill Gates and Warren Buffett .
As Buffett pointed out in 2006 , in regard to predators like Griffith : “ There ’s class warfare , all right , but it ’s my class , the rich class , that ’s making war , and we ’re winning . ”
That same year he also said " I would hate to see the estate tax gutted .
It 's a very equitable tax .
It 's in keeping with the idea of equality of opportunity in this country , not giving incredible head starts to certain people who were very selective about the womb from which they emerged .
" Now please listen to this neo-Confederate Blue Dog scumbag reading Republican Party talking points , all distortions , about the estate tax :
And speaking of slimy , greed - obsessed and selfish rich people like Parker Griffith , the IRS announced this week that their crackdown on off shore banking cheats will produce billions of dollars .
Almost 15,000 Americans who were cheating have come forward in time for the leniency window .
And a bonus -- is reporting that the IRS will be looking for patterns that point to specific financial advisors and companies that were steering their clients into cheating on their taxes .
I sure hope there 's no amnesty or leniency for them .

William R. Polk writes in a guest editorial for IC , which he wishes someone would pass on to President Obama , quickly :
In its war in Afghanistan , the United States has come to a crossroads .
President Obama will be forced to choose one of four ways ahead .
The choices are cruel , expensive and dangerous for our country ; so we must be sure that he chooses the least painful , least expensive and safest of the possible choices .
The first possible choice is to keep on doing what we are now doing .
That is , fighting the insurgency with about 60,000 American troops and 68,197 mercenaries at a cost of roughly $ 2,000 a day per person .
That is , we now actually have a total complement of over 120,000 people on the public payroll at an overall cost , of roughly $ 100 billion a year .
We can project a loss of a few hundred American soldiers a year and several thousand wounded .
Our senior commander in the Central Command , General David Petraeus , tells us that we cannot win that war .
The second possible road ahead would involve adding substantial numbers of new troops .
In General Petraeus ’s counterinsurgency doctrine , the accepted ratio of soldiers to natives is 20 to 25 per thousand natives .
1 Afghanistan today is a country of about 33 million .
Even if we discount the population to the target group of Pashtuns , we will must deal with 15 or so million people .
So when he and General Stanley McChrystal ask for 40,000 , it can only be a first installment .
Soon — as the generals did in Vietnam – they will have to ask for another increment and then another , moving toward the supposedly winning number of 600,000 to 1.3 million .
That is just the soldiers .
Each soldier is now matched by a supporter , rather like medieval armies had flocks of camp followers , so those numbers will roughly double .
Thus , over ten years , a figure often cited , or 40 years , which some of the leading neoconservatives have suggested , would pretty soon , as they say in Congress , involve “ talking about real money . ”
In addition to the Congressionally - allocated outlay , the overall cost to our economy has not yet been summed up , but by analogy to the Iraq war , it will probably amount to upwards of $ 6 trillion .
Then there are the casualties : we have so far lost about a thousand — or a quarter as many as in Iraq .
Casualties we can count , but the number of seriously wounded keeps growing because many of the effects of exposure to modern weapons do not show up until later .
We have no reliable figures yet on Afghanistan .
In Iraq at least 100,000 of the one and a half million soldiers who served there suffered severe psychological damage and about 300,000 have reported post - traumatic stress disorder and a similar number have suffered brain injuries .
Crassly put , these “ walking wounded ” will not only be unable fully to contribute to American society but will be a burden on it for many years to come .
It has been estimated that dealing with a brain - injured soldier over his remaining life will cost about $ 5 million .
Cancer , from exposure to depleted uranium is , only now coming into full effect .
All in all , it is sobering to calculate that 40 percent of the soldiers who served in the 1991 Gulf war – which lasted only a hundred hours – are receiving disability payments .
Inevitably , more “ boots on the ground ” will lead to more beds in hospitals .
General McChrystal has told us that we must have large numbers of additional troops to hold the territory we “ clear . ”
He echoes what the Russian commanders told the Politburo : in a report on November 13 , 1986 , Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev commented that the Russians attempted the same strategy but admitted that it failed .
“ There is no piece of land in Afghanistan , ” he said , “ that has not been occupied by one of or soldiers at some time or another .
Nevertheless , much of the territory stays in the hands of the terrorists .
We control the provincial centers , but we cannot maintain political control over the territory we seize . . .
Without a lot more men , this war will continue for a very , very long time . ”
The Russian army fought a bloody , brutal campaign , using every trick or tool of counterinsurgency ever identified .
The Russians killed a million Afghanis and turned about 5 million into refugees , but after a decade during which they lost 15,000 soldiers and virtually bankrupted the Soviet Union , they gave up and left .
General McChrystal says it may take him a decade or more to “ win . ”
But what “ winning ” means is unclear .
Third , we could marginally increase our troop strength .
That is , adding only between 10,000 and 30,000 troops and a comparable number of mercenaries .
Not the full complement that General McChrystal has now demanded .
This road , according to Petraeus , McChrystal and their acolytes would lead to “ mission failure . ”
Not meeting the generals ’ demands also brings forward the danger to the Obama administration of being charged with putting our soldiers at risk “ with one hand tied behind their backs , ” a phrase from the acrimonious aftermath of the Vietnam war which even General James Jones , President Obama ’s director of the National Security Council , has recently repeated .
The potential ugly campaign , against which even Henry Kissinger has warned us , 2 could pose risks to our political culture and even to our legal structure : some military men are already talking about their restiveness in obeying civilian government .
“ You kind of get used to it after years of service ” one Army general said at a convention in Washington last month .
Forgetting the constitution , he continued , “ We tend to live with it . ”
Maybe they will or maybe anger will be channeled into a further extension of the military into politics , intelligence and diplomacy .
For the first time that I know of in recent American history , the uniformed military have created what amounts to a pressure group of their own .
Generals Petraeus and McChrystal are the leaders but , by influencing or controlling promotions panels , they have fostered the advancement of middle grade and junior officers who agree with them .
Some have been brought into a group called “ the Colonels ’ council . ”
And numbers of retired senior officers have joined not only in what President Eisenhower called the “ military - industrial complex ” but have become the opinion - makers on foreign policy in the media .
Private soldiers and non-commissioned officers have , at the same time , become a major component of the private armies of such groups as Xe ( formerly Blackwater ) and form an active part of the constituency of the right wing of the Republican Party .
In the dangerous months and years ahead , if this road is taken , we are apt to hear echoes – particularly in the next presidential election –of the post Vietnam rhetoric that the civilians sold out the military .
In short , while this option sounds moderate and “ business - like ” I believe that it is the worst option for President Obama and , more importantly , for the nation .
Or , fourth , we could Get out .
* * *
Since obviously getting out is my preference , I will now describe how it could be done .
In doing this , I want to emphasize that I learned as an official policy planner that a plan is of little value unless it incorporates elements that would make it
* attractive or at least politically feasible for a president ;
* foresees a specified allocation of funds to effect it ;
* provides a timetable ;
* makes clear both benefits and dangers ; and
* can be shown to be better than other options .
I begin with the reasons why the President should adopt it :
* Other things being equal , reversing decisions and public statements is not an attractive option for a sitting president .
But other things are not equal .
I have asserted that the other three options endanger the country and could cost President Obama his job .
* Even if he accepts this evaluation , the president must weigh any potential move in the scale of public opinion : what do the people think ?
Polls indicate a steady deterioration of support for the war .
But , as any politician knows , the public is fickle and substantial numbers of dedicated and influential people are still strongly in favor of “ staying the course ” or even getting in deeper .
This , of course , is , particularly true of the self - proclaimed military - political strategists ( and above all the neoconservatives who are active in virtually all of the “ think tanks ” and write influential columns in most of the press not to speak of Fox News ) .
They speak to the sentiment of the far right of the Republican Party .
The President , who after all is a Democrat , would be unlikely to be able to win over the Republican far right by any sort of compromise .
He must hope that the general public will reach the conclusion that “ staying the course ” is costly , does not work and is pointless .
But , if waits until a course of action is completely evident to everyone , it will be probably be too late to implement easily , cleanly and in command of our principal objectives .
Thus , a large part of a president ’s responsibility is educating the public .
If we have a first lady and even a first dog , he must be our “ first teacher . ”
He must , in short , work to create an environment in which reasonable policies will be understood and accepted .
* Consequently , the president must choose the timing of his action with great care and in doing so he would be wise to recognize and be prepared to deal with his Republican foes and Democratic rivals .
The best way he can do this is to do the job quickly and get it over with well before the next election .
* Timing will be influenced not only by the pace of domestic politics but also by foreign opportunity .
Fortunately for him , the President now has been presented with an opportunity .
Although at terrible cost to Pakistan ’s society , its army has undertaken a campaign against the Taliban in the Pashtun areas of Swat and both Waziristans .
Why is this an opportunity or rather how could it be an opportunity ?
At first sight the answer seems paradoxical : it is that the campaign is unlikely to be completely successful : the Taliban are unlikely to be so stupid as to stand and fight .
The proper tactic of the guerrilla is to hit and run .
So , recognizing that they cannot win , the Pakistani military will soon offer a cease fire and the Taliban will accommodate .
The Pakistanis have a long history with the Taliban , know them intimately , have subsidized them and have sought in the Taliban a barrier against Indian infiltration of their backyard , Afghanistan .
That long - term interest remains despite the current conflict .
And , at base , the Pakistanis share with the Afghanis , religion , a population of nearly 30 million Pashtuns and the desire to preserve their neighborhood from foreign control .
Thus , I believe that in the coming months , they will do what neither the Russians nor we have been able to do — bring the Taliban to the negotiating table .
This move would offer a wise American president an opening to begin the process of turning over the war to our ally Pakistan .
To enable such a course of action to become effective and to encompass Afghanistan , we must set a date for ending our part of the war .
Before such a date is announced , negotiations are unlikely .
But it is important to be clear :
It is the setting of the date rather than actually withdrawing that will enable the process to begin .
* * *
Once the date is set , let us say in late 2010 or early 2011 , the villages and tribes , particularly in the southern part of Afghanistan but also soon in the center and north , will begin to jockey for position vis -à - vis one another and with whatever larger authority they think likely to affect their lives .
This will almost certainly take the form of their holding village assemblies – known in the south as jirgas and in the north as shuras or among the Hazaras as ulus– to sort out local issues .
Little known or appreciated outside of Afghanistan , neither by the Russians in their time nor by us today , the jirga is the quintessential Afghan means of political action .
We need to understand it because , whether we like it or not , it will play a major role in the way the war is brought to a close .
I must dilate briefly on it .
The jirga is a very old and common Asian way of settling disputes and legitimating ruling authorities .
Among the Mongols and Turks , it was known as a quriltai and similar assemblies were held by the Iranians .
Probably few Americans realize that a native American people , the Iroquois , had a similar way of dealing with military and diplomatic affairs .
Is this just a historian ’s indulgence in dredging up the obscure and the antique ?
Fortunately , not .
Jirgas are active at the village level all over Afghanistan today .
They are called into being either when village headmen , known as maliks , or respected religious figures cannot resolve a dispute or when a new event calls for change of course .
The jirga is thus a transient event , not a standing institution .
Its procedure is set by custom .
And it does not aim to mandate or to impose penalties ; rather it is a process that aims to ventilate grievances , to debate alternatives , to dissipate angers and to affect accommodations until , at the end a consensus is reached .
Voting is not a part of the process .
But when a consensus is reached , it is considered absolutely binding and further opposition is regarded as treason .
To oppose the consensus could result in expulsion from the community which , in a tribal society , amounts often to a death sentence .
Since many of the problems of each village depend on actions beyond its locale , the village elders will press for and participate in tribal meetings .
In turn these participants will be drawn into regional meetings .
At the end of the process will be a grand national assembly which is known as a loya jirga .
Such meetings have been called on great issues of state for centuries .
Three were called in the 1920s to approve fundamental laws , establish the Afghan Muslim orthodoxy and legimate the change of rulers .
Another was called in 1949 to void existing treaties and establish the frontier with Pakistan .
In 1955 , a loya jirga composed of some 360 notables from all over Afghanistan assembled to declare support of an independent “ Pashtunistan . ”
Then in 1964 , one was assembled to ratify the constitution .
Notably , the constitution proclaimed that the loya jirga is Afghanistan ’s ultimate authority , being empowered “ “ to decide on issues related to independence , national sovereignty , territorial integrity as well as supreme national interests ” and designated the loya jirga to be “ the highest manifestation of the will of the people of Afghanistan . ”
3
The Russians were , obviously , opposed to the very concept of the loya jirga and managed to by - pass or suppress it .
They did so , however , at great cost because without such a legitimating authority , they could not find an Afghan counterpart with which to negotiate an end to their occupation .
The puppet government they set up lacked the imprimatur of the loya jirga and was not regarded by the people as legitimate .
So the Russians left with their tail between their legs .
As the current Russian ambassador and long - time KBG expert on Afghan affairs , Zamir N. Kabulov , has commented , there is no mistake the Russians made that has not been copied by the Americans .
He was right about the way we approached the jirga .
In 2002 , nearly 2/3rds of the delegates to a loya jirga signed a petition to make the exiled king , Zahir Shah , president of an interim government to give time for the Afghanis to work out their future .
An interim government might have avoided the worst of the problems we have faced in the last seven years .
But we had already decided that Hamid Kara was “ our man in Kabul ” and did not want the Afghanis to interfere with our choice .
So , as Thomas Johnson and Chris Mason reported , 4 “ massive US interference behind the scenes in the form of bribes , secret deals , and arm twisting got the US - backed candidate for the job , Hamid Kara , installed instead .
[ They ] then rode shotgun over a constitutional process that eliminated the monarchy entirely .
This was the Afghan equivalent to the 1964 Diem Coup in Vietnam ; afterward , there was no possibility of creating a stable secular government . ”
While an Afghan king could have conferred legitimacy on an elected leader in Afghanistan ; without one , as they put it , “ an elected president is a on a one - legged stool . ”
Then , as Selig Harrison wrote in the New York Times , 5 our proconsul , Zalmay Khalilzad , “ had a bitter 40 - minute showdown with the king , who then withdrew his candidacy . ”
Among the lamentable results of this policy was that outside of the major cities , few Afghanis think of the government as legitimate .
Most regard it as a foreign tyranny .
Not understanding or being willing to deal with the concept of a loya jirga , we have sought to legitimate the men we chose to rule Afghanistan by an election .
Doing so has produced a great embarrassment to our government .
It is n’t only that the recent presidential election was blatantly fraudulent although that is what the press has focused on .
Nor was the trumped up competition between Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah important .
As a Tajik , there was no way that Abdullah Abdullah could have been a credible candidate .
He was just a straw man , put up to make it look like the election was a choice .
But even that was not the fundamental flaw : it was simply that elections – the American way of choosing and legitimating a government – is not the Afghan way .
The Afghan way is a loya jirga .
It is my belief that the holding of a loya jirga is the means that offers the best hope to create a reasonably peaceful , reasonably acceptable and reasonably decent Afghan government .
* * *
So the question is how to convene it .
The answer to that question is simple : the Afghans have a traditional way to do so .
The central authority , in this case the Parliament , can call for a loya jirga .
Will they do it ?
Probably not so long as America is willing to pay them off and protect them .
So to get them to act , America must set a timetable for withdrawing .
Faced with that deadline and the need to protect themselves , the current members of the Parliament will have an interest in espousing what they will see as the national cause , and they will scramble to call for a loya jirga .
Participation is traditional .
It is made up by the upward thrust of recognized leaders from the village level to the provincial level to the national level .
We will have little or no influence on this process and it would not be wise for us to attempt to exercise any .
But , realistically , we must anticipate that a vast majority of the delegates , particularly in the Pashtun area , will be at least passive supporters of the Taliban .
I do not see any way that this can be avoided .
Indeed , even today while we are in occupation , qualified observers uniformly point out that , except when a large contingent of our soldiers is physically present , the insurgents are in control .
At any given time , they control about 70 % of the country .
That , as I have pointed out , was also the Russian experience .
* * *
So what are the disadvantages and what are the benefits of the policy I recommend ?
Let me highlight the potential criticisms :
The first criticism is that the Taliban will emerge from the war as the strongest organization in what at best is a coalition .
I do not see any way that this outcome can be avoided – indeed , whether it happens soon or not , it is virtually inevitable in the long run .
The longer we delay the process and the harder we try to prevent it , the more certain it is that the Taliban will dominate .
This has been uniformly true of insurgencies for the last two centuries all over the world : those who fought hardest against the foreigners took control .
A really free loya jirga and one held soon is the best hope to create a more balanced national government .
This is partly because in the run-up to the national loya jirga , local groups will put forward and struggle to enhance or protect local interests .
That will constitute a natural brake on the Taliban which will find itself impelled to compromise .
And we should remember that despite all the hype about their early victories , much of the Taliban ’s success was the result of negotiation .
Today , they enjoy the aura of national defenders against us ; once we are no longer a target , that aura will fade .
The second criticism : suppose I am wrong .
Suppose the Taliban overawes all the village communities and emerges as the sole arbiter of Afghanistan .
What will be the danger to the United States ?
Recall that our invasion came about because the Taliban was providing a base – the meaning of the word al - qaida – for Usama bin Ladin and his acolytes .
Will they come back ?
Will Afghanistan be a base for terrorism ?
I do n’t think so , or at least not in the same way .
The terrorists who attacked New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 were partly trained in the United States and were based mainly in Europe .
Propaganda emanated from Afghanistan , but the real work was done elsewhere .
Terrorists can operate anywhere .
As we , the Taliban and Bin Ladin have discovered , Afghanistan is not a suitable base .
It is land - locked , has poor communications , little money to give or lend outsiders and has learned how costly it is to give a free rein to terrorists .
True , Usama bin Ladin has been given sanctuary by the Pashtun people and / or by the Taliban .
For this , they have paid a heavy price .
They will not wish to continue to pay such a price .
And , more important , there are ways acceptable within the cultural code of the Pashtun people , the Pashtunwali ’s imperative of melmastia ( protection or refuge ) that Bin Ladin and his band can be protected but disabled .
A protected guest cannot be turned over to his enemies but he need not be allowed to endanger his hosts .
Pakistan , rather than we , should and can take the lead in bringing about this restraint .
Pakistan can , indeed , make it a condition for the ceasefire I have mentioned and the ultimate peace it will find to its interest to achieve .
The third criticism that can be directed at this program is that , focused as it must be on the Pashtun community which is Afghanistan ’s largest group , it could split the country with the northern Tajik , Uzbek and Hazara areas withdrawing .
The fact is that those areas are already effectively separated from the Pashtun south .
They are under the domination of independent warlords whom we were instrumental in installing and maintaining .
So the calling of a national assembly will not break up the country ; it already is split .
But if the jirga process begins , I think it is likely to end with a federation which the tribal structure of Afghanistan has always favored .
Even if a sustainable arrangement is not accomplished in the near term , the danger to American interests would be minimal .
Indeed , Afghanistan ’s neighbors ( Pakistan , China , Russia and Iran and perhaps India ) would ( or could be induced to ) take a hand to push toward a modus vivendi as Henry Kissinger among others has pointed out .
6
* * *
If we adopt this policy and allow the process to begin , how can we facilitate it ?
What will it cost ?
What will it save ?
How likely is it to enable us to leave Afghanistan as a viable society ?
What will be the impact on the danger of terrorism ?
And , what should we avoid while carrying it out ?
The first step , as I have argued , is to set a date for withdrawal .
Once this is done , a notable transformation will begin in the psychology of the Afghans .
Today , even the non-lethal and beneficial efforts our government and non-governmental organizations make are regarded with suspicion or are rejected .
General Petraeus perhaps unwittingly explained why :
In describing his counterinsurgency program , he proclaimed that “ Money is my most important ammunition in this war . ”
7
The Afghanis of course realize this .
As Andrew Wilder and his team found in some 400 interviews , “ Afghan perceptions of aid and aid actors are overwhelmingly negative . ” 8
And , since they regard all the civic action programs as the “ weapons ” in the war – as indeed they learned years ago from the Russians who similarly mounted large - scale “ beneficial ” or civic action programs in Afghanistan9 — they have often destroyed schools , roads , bridges and even clinics .
But , when the withdrawal pattern is set , the Afghans will have no reason to continue to do so .
At that point , aid programs , preferably administered at least in part by other countries or by international agencies will become acceptable and will help smooth the reconciliation process and encourage participation by the local loya jirgas , who after all are concerned with their neighborhoods ’ prosperity and health .
They will then eagerly seek what they now dramatically destroy .
Their needs are evident and urgent .
Afghanistan is a poor , land - locked , dry country with few resources .
Its people have suffered through virtually continuous war for 30 years .
Many are wounded or sick .
Their normal passage through schools into jobs and secure lives have been disrupted or derailed .
They hurt and are tired .
They need help .
It will be hard for them to employ outside help beneficially , much can be done to pick up where a reforming government left off in the 1970s .
We can and should be a part of this process .
If we are wise , we will do so subtly rather than , as we often manage our aid efforts , with great fanfare .
Through the United Nations family of organizations , the World Bank or a coalition of Afghanistan ’s neighbors , we can provide money for reconstruction projects .
Such ventures as the building of farm - to - market roads , the opening of clinics , a program of disease prevention , subsidy for food - grain crops , electrification , purification of water , disposal of waste , etc. will be perceived by the village loya jirgas as unthreatening and beneficial once it is clear that they are not weapons in a counterinsurgency .
What will this cost ?
If we participate , as we should in our own interest as well as for moral reasons , in these activities , we might consider offering ( hopefully with matching funds from others ) , say , $ 5 billion dollars a year for the period the military and their hawkish civilian advisers propose , ten years .
That would amount to roughly $ 50 billion over a decade .
So what will spending that amount of money save us ?
At our current level of activity – before the introduction of more troops – we are “ burning ” as venture capitalists say , about $ 60 billion a year .
Next year , our direct costs will probably rise to at least $ 100 billion .
And even that figure will surely rise in the years to come .
So the Congressionally allocated funds in the coming few years under even the most modest form of “ staying the course ” would amount to a minimum of $ 600 billion and more likely to much more .
On top of that , we are otherwise harming our economy so that over a 5 to 10 year period of our current policy the real costs we would incur would probably amount to between $ 3 to $ 6 trillion .
This is money we do n’t have and will have to borrow from overseas .
Those who have opposed expanding health care because of the costs should note that the venture in Afghanistan will be more expensive with no compensating benefit .
The degradation of our currency is one effect of such an outlay : during the period of the Iraq war , the dollar vis -à - vis the Euro has fallen from 80 ¢ to $ 1.50 .
And currency traders are betting on a further fall .
The fall so far means that sovereign funds ( notably Japan and China ) that have lent us money have lost heavily ; a further fall calls into question our ability to borrow at all .
Some funds ( led by Kuwait ) are considering transferring from the dollar to a basket of currencies while others ( including South Korea ) have stopped buying Treasury notes .
If we attempt to make up our shortfall by printing money , inflation is inevitable and will saddle our grandchildren with our debts .
In short , by getting out , our saving would be immense , indeed perhaps , truly vital .
I have argued that if we get out soon and with held for the transition , the Afghans will find their way back to their traditional way of governing themselves .
This will not be exactly our way , of course , but they will recreate a viable society .
If we look at what has happened in Vietnam in recent years , we have reason to believe in political evolution .
Once the horrors of war receed in memory , the joys of peace become powerful forces .
And , in any event , at some point , whether now or years from now , the Afghans will face this challenge ; my judgment is that the sooner it happens the more likely and the quicker is achievement of an acceptable degree of success .
What about terrorism ?
As I have pointed out , terrorists can operate anywhere ; they do not need Afghanistan .
But they do need the support of people wherever they are .
So the more we are seen to be enemies of their religion , opponents of self - determination and supporters of oppressive governments , the greater the danger we face .
We cannot completely overcome these charges , but we can blunt or avoid the most blatant and the most unpopular .
Three stand out : first , we need to work hard to implement the call President Obama has made for us to recognize that we live in a multicultural world where we must respect the right of others to live their own way ; second , we need to repudiate the neoconservative - inspired U.S. National Defense Doctrine that asserted our “ right ” to preëmptively attack any country anywhere at our sole discretion ; and , third , we must stop the dangerous and unproductive “ James Bond ” games of subversion which we have played for years .
Otherwise , there will be a continuing incentive for the weak and angry to find means to attack us .
This is not to say that we must let down our guard : there are and will continue to be dangerous , deranged and determined malfactors in other countries – just as there are in ours – so we will need to employ a variety of police measures to protect ourselves .
But once we are no longer generally seen to be “ the enemy , ” such pyschopaths will be far less dangerous because no longer popular .
Finally , we should avoid moves to create an overwhelming military and police force in Afghanistan .
That is what we are being told is necessary .
I think that would be a very dangerous and self - defeating move .
Every time we provide weapons , as independent observers constantly tell us , the newly empowered force uses them against the public to extort money or goods or to kidnap people or rape their wives and children .
It is highly unlikely that such forces can be disciplined by the existing government ( or by us ) for years to come .
And even if they were disciplined , they contribute little or nothing to the Afghan economy or society .
And , of course , they ultimately pose the danger of a military dictatorship since balancing civil institutions are still and will for years will remain weak .
What we should do is to put our emphasis on the creation of a quasi-military force like our Corps of Engineers which could , under proper supervision and with proper funding , make a real contribution to the country .
It would also help alleviate the chronic problem of unemployment .
The police force should be kept small , only lightly armed , and subject to some supervision by village and tribal jirgas .
* * *
What follows ?
We are indeed at a cross-roads in our history .
The step the President takes on Afghanistan is a step on a road that could lead either to catastrophe or to a new period of our prosperity , freedom and security .
In one direction , we will move in the direction signposted by the Australian armchair warrior David Kilcullen , the key adviser and ghost writer for Generals Petraeus and McChrystal , and enthusiastically approved by the neoconservatives .
They and Petraeus ’s and McChrystal ’s new acolytes among junior officers – saw Iraq and see Afghanistan as the first steps in America ’s crusade , what they have named the “ Long War . ”
The Long war would truly be a march out into the wild blue yonder .
The neoconservatives and the new military leaders believe it will last generations .
Fifty years is already under plan at the Pentagon .
The cost , even in economic terms , cannot be predicted – numbers lose meaning beyond 15 or 20 trillion dollars .
But the ultimate cost will be the end of America ’s position as the world ’s leading power .
Our standard of living will fall ; our sources of borrowing will dry up ; and we will stand in danger of the kind of economic implosion that destroyed what in the 1920s was arguably Europe ’s leading democracy , the Weimar Republic .
While the monetary and general economic costs are the most obvious , my real worry is about the fundamental beliefs and institutions of our country .
I confess that I am very emotional about this : I have inherited through my family both a military and a civic tradition that I see being undermined in the name of patriotism .
Patriotism is a blunt instrument and can be wielded by dictators – as Herman Göring observed during his trial at Nurenburg — as often as by democrats .
I do n’t want to lose the America in which I was born , have served and believe in .
So I determined to do what I can to protect and preserve our heritage of freedom , decency and mutual respect .
These are the key elements in the social contract you and I share and which we share with our government .
To lose that social contact is to descend into chaos .
Of course , “ it ca n’t happen here , ” but let us not forget the fate of the Weimar Republic .
To the contrary , getting out of Afghanistan , could lead us toward a reassertion of the principles and purposes that have made our country not just respected for its wealth and power but beloved throughout the world .
If we make a sincere effort to live up to the message in President Obama ’s address in Cairo – that we are willing to live in a multicultural world – much of the fear and danger we perceive today will become a bad memory .
Then we can truly turn toward the serious business of educating our children , providing our citizens with adequate health care and again becoming for the world ’s peoples “ a city on the hill . ”

Vertreter der Filmindustrie haben sich in den Reigen der Befürworter von Web - Sperren eingereiht .
Die " Gatekeeper " in Gestalt der Provider sollten den Zugang zu umstrittenen Webangeboten mit Links zu Videostreams aktueller Kinofilme wie Kino .
to blockieren , forderte Max Wiedemann , Produzent der deutschen Komödie " Männerherzen " , auf dem Forum zu " Prävention und Aufklärung " der Gesellschaft zur Verfolgung von Urheberrechtsverletzungen ( GVU ) in Berlin am heutigen Dienstag .
Dies sei " technisch kein Problem " , betonte der Erfolgsunternehmer unter großem Beifall der versammelten Branchenvertreter .
Die einzige Möglichkeit , der Download - Plage
Herr zu werden , sei es , " nicht die Konsumenten zu bestrafen , sondern die Hehler " .
Der Internetindustrie und ihrer Abwehrhaltung bei Zugangsblockaden warf Wiedemann vor , " Nebelkerzen " zu werfen , um " wirksame Mittel " gegen Urheberrechtsverstöße im Internet zu vermeiden .
Die Nutzer dürften " gar nicht erst in Versuchung " geführt werden , sich illegal kopierte und nicht zur Verbreitung freigegebene Filme übers Internet anzuschauen .
Auch den Widerstand der Zugangsanbieter sowie zahlreicher Nutzer und Datenschützer gegen die verdachtsunabhängige Vorratsdatenspeicherung verstand der Produzent nicht .
Es rege sich schließlich auch niemand mehr darüber auf , " dass Autos Nummernschilder haben " .
Eine dynamische IP - Adresse entspreche in diesem Bild einem Mietwagen , bei dessen Anbieter auch noch im Interesse der Strafverfolgung wochen - und monatelang zu ermitteln sei , wem das Fahrzeug zu einem gewissen Zeitpunkt zur Verfügung gestellt wurde .
Auch Klaus Jansen vom Bund Deutscher Kriminalbeamter ( BDK ) sah " mutige Provider gefragt " .
Diese müssten den " Arsch in der Hose haben , das Richtige zu machen " .
Er gehe mit der Idee aus der Veranstaltung , " selbst Zugangsanbieter zu werden " und so Pionierarbeit zu leisten .
Den Bürger über müsse kommuniziert werden , dass sie den Cyberspace derzeit " auf eigene Gefahr betreten " .
Denn eine Strafverfolgung finde im Internet derzeit " nicht wirklich statt " .
Dies liege unter anderem an der " Flatrate - Misere " , durch die vielfach keine Verbindungsdaten mehr gespeichert würden und der " Tatort " im Netz dadurch nicht mehr zu rekonstruieren sei .
Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung bezeichnete Jansen daher als " einzige Chance " , um den Opfern im virtuellen Bereich noch irgendwie zu helfen : " Wir müssen zu Lösungen finden , mit denen wir regulierend eingreifen können . "
Oliver Süme vom Verband der deutschen Internetwirtschaft eco wehrte sich dagegen , " einen ganzen Industriezweig als Wurzel des Übels darzustellen " .
Das Internet sei keineswegs ein rechtsfreier Raum .
So gebe es zum einen auf der strafrechtlichen Ebene " Mittel und Weg zur Rechtsdurchsetzung " .
Zum anderen sei für zivilrechtliche Verfahren ein eigener Auskunftsanspruch geschaffen worden .
Gegen illegale Inhalte bei Host - Providern gebe es ferner mit Notice - und - Takedown - Verfahren ein effektives Mittel .
Der Großteil der Anbieter entferne entsprechende Inhalte , da sie nach Kenntnisnahme in der Haftung seien .
Eine Sperrung würde dagegen " überhaupt nichts bringen " und sei " immer mit großen rechtlichen Problemen verbunden " .
Es handle sich dabei um einen " grundlegenden Eingriff " in die technische Infrastruktur , für den es keinen Rechtsrahmen gebe .
Dem Polizeivertreter erwiderte der Providervertreter , dass sich die Ermittler offenbar " ihres eigentlichen hoheitlichen Aufgabenfelds " im Internet entledigen wollten .
Sinnvoller wäre es , die Strafverfolger " mit geschultem Personal und Technik auszurüsten " .
Der Vergleich mit dem Straßenverkehr hinke zudem völlig , da in diesem Bereich auch nicht die Privatwirtschaft etwa über die Zulassung von Autos bestimme .
Ferner werde dort auch nicht für ein halbes
Jahr gespeichert , " wer wann von wo nach wo fährt " .
Die Netze würden zudem zu 99 Prozent legal genutzt und der Breitbandausbau sorge seit Jahren für einen allgemeinen Wirtschaftsaufschwung .
Der GVU - Vorstandsvorsitzende Christian Sommer schätzte indes den Anteil des illegalen Traffic am gesamten Internetverkehr auf etwa 50 Prozent .
In Schweden sei der P2P - Verkehr nach Inkrafttreten eines neuen Copyright - Gesetzes mit einer Art Auskunftsanspruch stark eingebrochen .
Sorgen bereitete Sommer die weitere Dezentralisierung von Filesharing - Netzen etwa mit OpenBitTorrent oder webbasierten Datei-Hostdiensten .
Auch das Streaming illegaler Kopien weiche von etablierten großen Plattformen auf kleine Spezialangebote aus , die schwieriger zu verfolgen seien .
Generell sprach sich Sommer für eine verstärkte " Kooperation " mit Providern aus , in deren Rahmen Nutzern nach Rechtsverstößen deutliche Warnhinweise zugestellt werden sollten . ( jk )
If you ’re looking for a legal and inexpensive way to catch up on some classic “ Doctor Who ” , we ’ve got good news for you .
The BBC has recently released four stories from the original run of the show on YouTube .
The stories are :
The Edge of Destruction ( William Hartnell )
The Krotons ( Patrick Troughton )
Carnival of Monsters ( Jon Pertwee )
The Caves of Androzani ( Peter Davison )
Interestingly , three of the four stories are from the pen of Robert Holmes , who is widely regarded as the best script - writer in the history of “ Doctor Who . ”
( And yes , that includes the new series … . )
“ Caves of Androzani ” recently came out as the top ranked story of all - time in ‘ Doctor Who Magazine ’s ” poll to grade and rate every “ Doctor Who ” story ever made .
The episodes are commercial supported and , therefore , not available to viewers in the U.K .
But the BBC does have a site that offers U.K. users a selection of classic “ Doctor Who ” stories for viewing .
Apacheのバージョン2.2.12以降では、SNI（Server Name Indication）という、SSLプロトコルに対する拡張機能がサポートされているため、名前ベースのHTTPサイトを設定する場合と同じように名前ベースのHTTPSサイトを設定することが可能になっている。本記事では、Apacheのこの機能について紹介する。
Apache Webサーバがバージョンアップし、成熟していくに伴い、新機能の追加やバグの修正が行われてきている。そして、バージョン2.2.12で追加された機能のうち、最も重要なものはおそらく、単一IPアドレス上で複数のSSLサイトを運用できるようにするという、長らく持ち望まれていた機能だろう。
これまでは、特定 のIPアドレスに対してSSL対応のWebサイトを割り当てた場合、そのサイト1つしかSSL対応のWebサイトを運用することができなかった。つまり、IPアドレスが2つあるのであれば、運用できるSSL対応Webサイトの数も2つまでとなるわけである。このことは今までに多くの嘆きとイライラを引き起こしてきていた。
IPアドレスが2つある場合、通常のHTTPサイトであれば双方の、あるいは一方のIPアドレスに複数のサイトを割り当てることができるものの、HTTPSサイトはそれぞれのIPアドレスに1つずつしか割り当てることができない。さらに苛立たしいことに、www.example1.comとwww.example2.comを同一のIPアドレスに割り当てた場合、example1.comにHTTPSサイトが存在していると、https://www.example2.com/にアクセスしてもhttps://www.example1.com/にアクセスしたことになってしまう。つまり、混乱を生み出すことなくHTTPSサイトを運用したいという場合、単一のIPアドレスにはサイト（HTTPサイトかHTTPSサイトかにかかわらず）を1つしか割り当てられなかったわけである。
しかし 、Apacheのバージョン2.2.12以降ではSNIという、SSLプロトコルに対する拡張機能がサポートされるようになったため、その状況は一変した。これによって名前ベースのHTTPサイトを設定する場合と同じように、名前ベースのHTTPSサイトを設定できるようになったのである。つまり、5つのSSLサイトを運用する必要があっても、用意するIPアドレスは1つだけでよくなるというわけだ（もちろん、Apacheのバージョン2.2.12以降を使用するという条件はある）。
とは言うものの、以下の条件を満たしている必要がある。
当然のことであるが 、Apacheのバージョンは2.2.12以降でなければならない。
また、OpenSSLのバージョンは0.9.8f以降でなければならず、TLS拡張オプションを指定した状態でビルドされていなければならない。
さらに 、ApacheはOpenSSLの上記のバージョンを用いてビルドされていなければならない。ApacheはOpenSSLの適切なバージョン（TLS拡張サポートを含んだバージョンのOpenSSL）を検出すると、SNIのサポートを有効化するようになっている。
ただし、SNIはすべてのブラウザがサポートしているわけではない。とは言うものの、現在一般的になっているほとんどのブラウザはサポートしている。また、かなり以前からサポートしているブラウザもある。例を挙げると、Firefox 2.0以降やOpera 8.0 以 降 、Internet Explorer 7.0以降（残念なことに、Vistaで動作するもののみである）、Google Chrome 、Safari 3.2.1（残念なことに、Mac OS X 10.5.6以降で動作するもののみである）がある。
Heather Ellis ’ story tells us why the justice system is broken
After a peculiar incident nearly three years ago , Heather Ellis is on the verge of becoming another African - American statistic in the criminal justice system .
The confusion is over a trip to Wal - Mart and a simple misunderstanding .
Heather ’s story is a bit shocking and reflective of broader issues in our society .
Heather was shopping at a Wal - Mart in Kennett , MO with her cousin .
The two were searching for the shortest line , so they split up .
When Heather ’s cousin found the shorter line , she joined him .
That ’s when things got strange .
Heather was accused by a Wal - Mart employee of cutting the line , and an argument ensued .
This led to the manager and security guard being called , and ultimately police intervention .
Somehow Heather , an honors student who has only gotten two traffic tickets her entire life , ended up being charged with disturbing the peace , trespassing and two counts of assaulting a police officer .
After Heather rejected his plea deal , prosecutor Stephen Sokoloff became set on pushing for a felony trial against her next month .
The young college student faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted , in spite of the fact that she has a clean criminal record and a good reputation in the community .
Her family believes that the plea deal ( a small misdemeanor count ) was offered to keep them from suing the police department for arresting her without just cause or for police brutality .
( Her father says that Heather ’s knees and head were severely hurt from being slammed by the police officers . )
With the pending felonies on her record , Heather is having a difficult time finding work and was not able to get into medical school .
She has been scouring the country trying to bring attention to her situation , and says she did n’t take the plea deal because she did nothing wrong .
The Ku Klux Klan tried to intimidate Heather and her family when a rally was arranged to show support .
Family and friends accuse the police department of witness and attorney intimidation .
( All of the attorneys ran and hid after speaking with the prosecutor , who is apparently very powerful in this small town . )
And Heather ’s father told me that Wal - Mart refuses to release the surveillance tapes of the incident .
He also argues that the prosecutor , Sokoloff , has told the family that they should have taken the plea offer because they “ can never win in this town . ”
Heather has found some help and support for her case .
Thousands of people have signed the petition at SaveHeatherEllis.com and people are coming to her defense .
But her case is only a symptom of a larger , equally problematic issue .
I ’ve spoken with people from Kennett , and while Heather ’s case is certainly shocking ; the truth is that it was n’t the worst story I was told by local residents .
There is a consistent opinion among many African - American residents of Kennett that the prosecutor ’s office has a habit of imposing disproportionately painful sentences on black people .
People of the town have filed complaints to the U.S. Justice Department about prosecutorial misconduct , and many residents do not feel safe when dealing with police .
I am not accusing the prosecutor of any wrongdoing .
But the questions that should be asked are quite clear .
These are questions that can be asked in many communities across America , for these concerns are not unique :
1 ) What is the grievance procedure for citizens who feel that the prosecutor ’s office and police department are working together in a corrupt manner ?
My father is a police officer , so I respect law enforcement .
But the truth is that officers and prosecutors sometimes become tempted to protect one another at the expense of the general public .
2 ) What is the diversity on the police department in the town ?
Should n’t the percentage of African - Americans on the police force match the percentage of African - American residents in the community ?
3 ) What about diversity of the prosecutor ’s office ?
The same diversity of the police department should be represented by the prosecutor ’s office as well .
4 ) How can African - American residents feel confident in a justice system that neither gives them a jury of their peers nor guarantees that their attorneys will be able to rise above pressure from the prosecutor ’s office ?
A fundamental tenet of the American justice system is that every citizen is entitled to adequate representation .
We all know that this does n’t happen in poor and minority communities .
I am asking Chris Koster , the Attorney General for the State of Missouri , to thoroughly investigate this case , this town and this prosecutor .
I am also asking the same from the Attorney General of the United States , Eric Holder .
While this case may appear to be yet another version of the Jena 6 , we have to realize that for every six injustices we see , there are 60,000 that we do n’t .
The entire United States Criminal Justice system needs an overhaul .
It is killing the futures of black children in outrageous proportions .
After the president finishes dealing with health care , he might turn to prisons and courtrooms as a way to save more lives .
The Human Life Alliance college ad campaign tells victims of rape and incest that carrying their attacker 's / abuser 's baby will " help them heal . "
Few women have suffered like people who are victimized by sexual predators .
Be it stranger rape , acquaintance rape , date rape or incest , the person who has been sexually assaulted must deal not only with the physical effects of the attack , but the long - term emotional effects , as well .
And for those girls and women who have not only been victimized but also impregnated by their attackers , the trauma of the attack goes well beyond its initial occurrence .
The Human Life Alliance dedicates a section of its ICARE advertising supplement into shaming women who are impregnated by their attackers into giving birth .
“ As traumatic as rape is , ” the supplement advises , “ abortion does not un -rape the mother .
In fact , studies show that most women who become pregnant through rape do n’t want an abortion . ”

The section then quotes a 1979 article that states that 85 percent of women who become pregnant via rape do not chose abortion , a statistic quoted widely in anti-abortion literature and websites .
However , the actual study was conducted on a mere 37 pregnant women who sought counseling from the study ’s author .
Of those 37 women , 4 did not finish the study , 28 decided to continue the pregnancy and 5 decided to abort , resulting in the “ 85 percent of all women ” statistic .
Although widely used in suggesting women who are raped should carry the child , it is by no means a scientific study .
The supplement goes even further to shame the victims of incest .
Joan Kemp , a rape crisis center counselor , said , “ ‘ I am familiar with no case of incest - related abortion that did not make matters worse . ' ”
No case .
Not one .
Ever .
The section then continues :
Studies also show that incest victims rarely ever voluntarily agree to abortion .
Instead of viewing the pregnancy as unwanted , the incest victim is more likely to see the pregnancy as a way out of the incestuous relationship because the birth of her child will expose the sexual activity .
Yes , according to the Human Life Alliance , victims of incest ( usually minors ) should have babies if impregnated as a way to stop their own abuse .
Although the attribution is sloppy , the “ studies ” cited above appear to be based on a book written by David Reardon , a man who is known as the “ Moses ” of the post abortion movement .
Based on the 200 women interviewed for his book , Reardon was able to ascertain that :
“ Abortion only adds to and accentuates the traumatic feelings associated with sexual assault , ” and that “ Pregnancy resulting from sexual assault is actually a contraindication for abortion . ”
According to Human Life Alliance , all of the “ research ” and “ studies ” in their rape and incest section ( one self - selected 33 woman study from 1979 , one book by a “ post- abortion Moses ” and one study done by the bastion of reliability , The Family Research Council ) prove that “ both the mother and child are helped by preserving life , not by perpetuating violence . ”
Their emphasis on mother , and of course , “ child ” attempts to strong arm females in need of honest support and healing into a place with no choices but the one HLA approves of : coerced birth .

Al - Kurd has lived all her life in the home her family moved into in 1956 .
The pomegranate tree standing in the garden was planted by her father when she was still an infant nearly half a century ago .
But that hardly reassured her yesterday when she heard the Jewish settlers break into the next - door extension building her brother Nabil built to house his family in 2001 .
" I heard the door opened by force , " she said .
" And then I heard one of them say : ' This furniture belongs to whom ? ' "
Later she saw " with my own eyes " a settler breaking a television set .
Outside , a refrigerator , cushions and household furniture , apparently removed by the intruders , stood for several hours in the pouring rain .
Inside , broken glass could be seen above a stove .
What Ms Kurd , of the inner-city East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah , was hearing at about 10.30 am yesterday was the latest in an accelerating series of highly charged and organised moves by settlers into the city 's Arab sector .
Armed with a court order saying they own the property , the settlers – about 40 , according to Ms Kurd – decided to break in just four days after Hillary Clinton , the US Secretary of State , dismayed Palestinian and other Arab leaders by praising the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's " unprecedented " promise of " a restraint " in illegal settlement activity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mrs Clinton sought on Monday to " clarify " her remarks by acknowledging that Mr Netanyahu 's proposals fell well short of the settlement freeze the US had earlier called for .
And , while Mr Netanyahu has offered temporarily to halt authorisations of new settlement building in the West Bank , he has resolutely set his face against any slowdown in East Jerusalem .
The UN says that 194 people were forcibly displaced from their homes in East Jerusalem by evictions and demolitions between January and July of this year .
Israel insists it annexed the Arab sector of Jerusalem after the Six - Day War in 1967 , but this is rejected by most of the international community who endorse Palestinian aspirations for it to be the capital of a future state .
In Amman , the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband expressed " concern " over events at the Kurd house and added : " The current situation is obviously particularly tense in respect of Jerusalem . "
Since a 2001 court order the rooms invaded by the settlers have been closed and used only to store furniture .
But for Ms Kurd , whose property is one of at least 24 that settlers are hoping to acquire in this sensitive neighbourhood , their sudden arrival only intensified her fear of losing her home .
" We are all worried for the future , " she said , " not just in Sheikh Jarrah but in all East Jerusalem . "
Only last week about a hundred Israeli security personnel arrived to remove a nearby protest tent that the Palestinian Ghawi family had been sleeping in since being evicted in August .
That move came 24 hours after bulldozers levelled the homes of six families across East Jerusalem on the grounds they did not have the proper permit .
Human rights activists say it is exponentially harder for Palestinians than Israelis to obtain permits .
Another elderly member of Ms Kurd 's extended family , Mohammed al- Kurd , died after being evicted last August from his home and moving into a similar tent to the Ghawi family 's .
Like other of his relatives , he had refused to pay rent to the post - 1967 Jewish owners , partly , some diplomats say , because they still dispute the historic right of ownership .
Maysaa al - Khurd said that her " life and blood " was in the house .
Asked about the settlers ' argument that they have a right to the land because Yemenite Jews lived there before 1948 , she added that her own family were 1948 refugees from what was now Israel .
" My family are all from Haifa .
Can I go there and say I own the house and I have the key ?
Can I tell the people there that is my house ?
They will kill me . "
Police stood guard outside the Sheikh Jarrah house while settlers occupied the adjacent building but eventually left on police advice .
However two security guards employed by them were still there at the end of the day .
Although the house and its land was allotted to the Palestinian family in 1956 by the UN Relief and Works Agency and Jordan – then in control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem – the Israeli authorities expropriated numbers of properties in the area as state land after 1967 .
In some cases – apparently including this one – the land was later transferred or sold to companies or organisations representing settlers .
None of the departing settlers would speak to reporters , but Adnan Husseini , the Palestinian Authority governor of Jerusalem , said : " The changing position of the American administration led to this . "
Nabil al - Kurd , a father of four children , was summoned from work by his family when the settlers arrived .
He was later told by police the settlers would be ordered to stay away pending 10 days in which Mr Kurd could lodge an appeal .

According to Peter , humanity has probably been in overshoot of the Earth 's carrying capacity since it abandoned hunter gathering in favor of crop cultivation ( ~ 8,000 BCE ) .
The problem is that soil needs tightly woven natural ecosystems to properly recycle nutrients and prevent soil erosion .
Earth 's inhabitants have devised a whole series of approaches to increase the amount of food that can produced , starting first with hand - cultivation and culminating in the last century with the widespread use of fossil fuels .
These approaches strip the soil of its nutrients and cause soil erosion .
Even Permaculture cannot be expected to overcome these problems .
According to the paper , eventually , to reach sustainability , the world will need to reduce its population to that of the hunter - gathers , and go back to living on the resources the natural ecosystems can produce .
Part 1 : Life Before Agriculture
The major departure for humans as just another member of the global animal species assemblage came when fire was first used about 400,000 years ago by Homo erectus ( Price 1995 ) .
The dynamic cyclical stability of complex systems has been shown for most animal populations , except top predators , to depend on predation to dampen overshoot and runaway consumption dynamics of prey species ( Rooney et al. 2006 ) .
The ability to control and use fire removed the influence of wild animal predators as moderators of human numbers .
The use of fire made possible the colonization of cold lands at high latitudes where fuel for heating shelters was available in some form such as animal oil , dried dung and wood .
Even though their shelters became more complex and elaborate , they were , for the most part , temporary encampments whose main structural components could be transported across the landscape so as to benefit from variable food availability as the seasons changed .
The bulk of human history has been that of a culture of hunter gathers or foragers .
They did not plant crops or modify ecosystem dynamics in any significant manner as they were passively dependent on what the local environment had to offer .
They did however domesticate dogs as early as 100,000 BCE ( Vila et al. 1997 ) ; these animals were useful as hunting aids , guardians , and occasionally as food during times of scarcity .
Hunter gatherers maintained social organization and interdependence , and prevented the loss of food to spoilage by sharing the harvest among community members .
These people lived in harmony with their supporting ecosystems and their ability to unsustainably stress and damage their environment was limited by the fact that if their numbers exceeded the carrying capacity of the complex , self - managing , species diverse , resilient terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems from which they gained their sustenance , then hunger and lower fertility exercised negative feedback controls on further expansion .
They used culturally mediated behavior like extended suckling , abortifacients and infanticide to keep their numbers far below carrying capacity , and to avoid Malthusian constraints like starvation ( Read and LeBlanc 2003 ) .
Warfare between groups competing for the same resources , before the evolution of states , also appears have been a significant constraint on the growth of human numbers ( Keeley 1996 ) .
Part 2 : The Evolution of Agriculture
The development of agriculture is of great interest to us because it produces most of our food and it was a prerequisite for the tremendous growth of human numbers , and also for the various complex societies that have evolved since this new culture began ( Diamond 2002 ) .
After the advent of agriculture , mortality rates , caused by conflict , decreased somewhat as local raiding by chiefdoms evolved into long - distance territorial conquest by states ( Spencer 2003 ) .
These cultural and conflict behaviors that limited human population growth served to maintain balance between humans and other species during most of the historical record .
Read and Leblanc ( 2003 ) suggest that humans , in areas of low resource density , tend to maintain generally stable populations , while high resource density , such as that produced by agriculture , decreases the spacing of births more rapidly than the increase in resource density , which results in repeating cycles of carrying capacity overshoot and population collapse .
Nomads and Pastoralists
The earliest movement from strict hunter gathering toward agriculture came when people noticed the changes in ecosystems that they burned to move game animals to places where they could be more easily killed ; sometimes the post - fire vegetation consisted of an increase in the numbers of plants used as food , such as berries and bulbs and also vegetation assemblages , like the sparse oak parkland of the U.S. Pacific Northwest that produced acorns for both human food and for the deer that they hunted ( Angier 1974 ; Oregon State University 2003 ) , while in other areas grasslands were periodically burned to encourage the growth of tender vegetation that was attractive to game animals .
Even though some hunter gatherer / foragers did modify the vegetation or successional state of vegetation assemblages in specific areas with fire , these areas seldom were productive enough to support year round occupancy .
Thus began the first steps of humans as a ‘ patch - disturbance ‘ species ( Rees 2002 ) , whose expansion would ultimately extend to and modify almost all of the ecosystems on the planet .
Movement toward actual cultivation agriculture began with the domestication of cereal grains at a time when postglacial climate warming was interrupted by climate reversal , even before the beginning of the consistently warm conditions of the Holocene ( Hillman et al. 2001 ) .
Diamond ( 2002 ) shows that plant and animal domestication first occurred in areas where the most valuable and easiest species to cultivate were native .
These species were later moved to new and more productive areas by the migratory expansion of their cultivators who overran resident hunter gatherers .
As people worked with and cultured wild species , the process of genetic selection began to produce more easily managed individuals with modified behavior .
Diamond ( 1997 ; 2002 ) outlines characteristics of wild animals dealing with diet , growth rate , captive breeding , disposition , and social structure that make individual species either candidates for domestication or that make domestication very difficult .
Nomads , inhabiting grassland / prairie ecosystems , who had relied on hunting herds of herbivores , learned enough about the habits of these species to begin the process of controlling some of them .
The resulting pastoral herding culture of such animals as camels , goats , sheep , cattle , yaks , alpacas and reindeer made locating meat much less chancy , and allowed the further developing use of secondary products from living animals such as blood and milk .
This very early form of species domestication without cultivation provides considerable independence in the face of environmental fluctuations because herds are moved to different areas as the seasons change and during periods of drought .
These people developed a culture that moved to adapt to the environment as opposed to forcing changes on the environment to accommodate a particular food production culture , even though they did burn land to rejuvenate pasture and prevent forest growth from encroaching onto grasslands .
Pastoralists , like hunter - gatherers maintained close social organization and interdependence , and they prevented the loss of food to spoilage by sharing the harvest among community members .
Hunter gathering , foraging and pastoral lifestyles are often thought of as precarious and requiring very hard work , while both archaeological evidence and the health of the few groups that have not yet been displaced by farming suggests that they lived quite long and much easier lives with better health and diets than the first people who practiced cultivation agriculture in the same localities ( Diamond 1987 ) .
Pastoralists were subject to the same constraints as hunter gatherers ; their ability to unsustainably stress and damage their environment was limited by the fact that if their numbers exceeded the carrying capacity of the complex , self - managing , species diverse , resilient terrestrial ecosystems from which they gained their sustenance , then hunger and lower fertility exercised negative feedback controls on further expansion .
There have only been a few groups that have been able to maintain the hunter gatherer life style even as they have been displaced and forced onto marginal land by agriculturalists .
Pastoralists may continue to thrive into the modern era because the semi-arid lands they utilize are usually inappropriate for cultivation agriculture .
Of interest is the move back to nomadic pastoralism in some of the Central Asian republics that has followed the demise of the money economy after the collapse of the Soviet Union during the 1990s .
Modern grass - fed cattle and sheep ranching , although not a subsistence culture , has a lot of similarities to pastoralism except that it is carried on in a grander scale to produce commodities for markets .
Beginnings of Cultivation Agriculture
The evolution of agriculture appears to have been an accidental , ‘ hit - and - miss ’ development that almost certainly sprang , not from necessity ( Diamond 2002 ) , but from the propensity of humans to experiment .
Selective harvest and replanting of specific races of food plants took place at an accelerating pace as the hostile and unpredictable climate at the end of the Pleistocene gave way to warmer and more predictable conditions ( Richerson et al. 2001 ) .
Although some authors suggest that the growth of human populations during the last 10,000 years has resulted in pressure to produce more food to feed them ( Boserup 2005 ) , most see the increased food production by cultivation agriculture as the driver of population growth ( Abernethy 2002 ; Hopfenberg and Pimentel 2001 ; Hopfenberg 2008 ) .
Cultivation agriculture usually began with shifting or ‘ slash and burn ’ techniques that utilized the accumulated nutrients , built up under native forest or grassland , and also those nutrients in the ash resulting from burning native vegetation .
Reasonable productivity for cultivated plants lasts for only a few years on upland soils under shifting cultivation .
Permanent agricultural cultivation appears to have been possible in river valleys that were fertilized annually by new soil carried by floodwaters .
When soil nutrients are depleted on upland soils , it is necessary to move to a new patch of native vegetation cover and repeat the ' slash and burn ' process .
After the abandonment of temporary fields , a considerable period of native vegetation regrowth is necessary before soil nutrient levels are again built up to the point where another short cycle of cropping and nutrient depletion is profitable .
On better soils in tropical climates the period of early successional woody vegetation growth may only need to be a few years before the next cultivation cycle , because temperature - driven soil weathering rates are very high in these areas .
Shifting cultivation is usually labor - intensive and the small plots involved do not produce enough to support humans and horses , oxen or other draft animals that could assist with tillage .
Year round multi-cropping in tropical climates on erosion prone slopes such as areas of the Philippines sometimes involved as many as 40 different crop species on the same field so that there was always enough plant cover to break the force of the rain and minimize erosion .
Shifting cultivation is only viable if the population remains low enough that the next cycle of temporary cultivation is not required until native forest or grassland regeneration on abandoned fields has rebuilt the supply of nitrogen ( by biological fixation ) and levels of plant available phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium and micronutrients ( by soil weathering ) .
At the time of European contact in eastern North America , from mid continent and southward , much of the low altitude land had already been submitted to enough Amerindian shifting agriculture that the settlers discovered a landscape mosaic of cleared gardens , abandoned clearings returning to forest vegetation and maturing forest that was ready for yet another cycle of clearing , burning and temporary cultivation ( Williams , 2006 ) .
European settlers , whose rapidly moving diseases had already decimated the Amerindians , were able to start farming on cleared land that had been prepared by the former residents .
Amerindians did utilize the nitrogen fixation capabilities of leguminous beans in mixtures with squash , corn and various other crops , and they did augment depleting soil nutrients with the placement of fish in planting spots .
However at the time of European contact , Amerindian population dynamics were probably already on the same ‘ increase and collapse ’ trajectory as those of other populations , whose numbers increase to exceed carrying capacity as food production is increased by the adoption of cultivation agriculture ( Costanza et al. 2005 ) .
Rees ( 2002 -03 ) states , as did Malthus ( 1826 ) , that unless there are constraints on animal ( including human ) expansion , all populations grow to the point that they destroy some critical resource and then they collapse .
Intensive cultivation agriculture provides adequate food to allow the growth of large scale , populous societies living in settlements with permanent dwellings that are near enough to the food growing areas to facilitate their management and that allow for the storage of food from season to season .
The transition from the passive dependence on existing complex self - managing ecosystems by mobile hunter gatherers gave way to the greater control of food sources provided by cultivation agriculture on land in specific localities with radically altered ecology .
Its practitioners were tied to the land , and they were vulnerable to environmental vagaries that could produce local crop failures .
Diamond ( 1997 ) suggests that the development of plant cultivation agriculture was a ‘ trap ’ that precipitated massive changes in the way we feed ourselves and in the social organization that is a natural product of land ownership and control of stored foodstuffs .
The thinking with regard to this ‘ trap ’ is that , as populations rise to utilize the increased food supplied by cultivation agriculture , it is very difficult to revert to less productive food producing systems without incurring hardship and starvation .
The egalitarian food - sharing social organization systems of hunter - gatherers , pastoralists and shifting agriculturists , based on kinship , gave way to the class stratification of societies that rely on intensive cultivation agriculture .
The stratum of society that controls the means of food production , and the land required for it , develops a hierarchy of property owners and leaders who are rich enough to thrive during periods of severe food shortages , while the less powerful , who are employed by them , suffer famine much more directly .
Eventually this social stratification and evolution of complex labor division proceeds to the point where merchants , craftsmen , military , clergy , bureaucrats , politicians and royalty occupy urban areas where food from the countryside is used , but not produced .
A rich and politically powerful stratum develops absolute property rights that are accumulated as wealth and transferred to its descendants ; this stratum , often doing very little labor , becomes more numerous and difficult to support as the ratio of elites to producers increases ( Costanza et al 2005 ) .
As economic class distinctions developed , the social changes usually included a decline in the status of women who were more equal partners in subsistence societies .
While close to 100 % of the people in foraging and hunter gatherer societies were involved directly in producing food , less than 60 % of the population in non industrial agricultural societies may participate directly .
In contrast , industrial , modern , mechanized agriculture that depends on non renewable fossil - fuelled machinery usually employs less than 5 % of the population directly in food production .
The migration of foragers and hunter gathers to colder northern climates , the shift to more intensive food production systems that included increased densities of people living in the confines of enclosed permanent structures , the further migration of people into Asia , and the modern evolution of urban living conditions have all been accompanied by genetic changes in humans .
The most well known of these changes are the adaptive development of resistance to " crowd diseases " spread from domesticated animals ( Diamond 2002 ) , food tolerances , the various blood groups we see in human populations , as well as the selection for lighter skin colors that has allowed people living in northern climates to use limited sunlight to accomplish the metabolic transformations of chemical precursors into Vitamin D ( D’ Adamo and Whitney 1996 ) .
The transition to large - scale intensive cultivation agriculture in permanent fields often involved complex water management ( irrigated rice ) and the use of large animals such as horses , water buffalo and oxen to pull plows which turn up buried soil nutrients into the planting layer and aid in controlling weeds .
Even though intensive cultivation agriculture did produce more food than subsistence food production on a specific area , severe local food shortages were not eliminated by the development of these techniques .
Famine was caused by cyclic drought , climate cooling episodes and the natural propensity of humans to increase population numbers to meet then surpass any elevation of carrying capacity during benign conditions ( Hopfenberg 2003 ) .
Societies grew and prospered until soils were exhausted or as long as there was new land to cultivate , but they declined when they ran out of fertile soil options ( Montgomery 2007 ) .
Temporary overshoot of carrying capacity has caused human numbers to fall back precipitously with some regularity throughout history ( Stanton 2003 ) , while less regular complete collapses of societies have been the norm since the advent of agriculture ( Costanza et al. 2005 ) .
Cultivation agriculture has resulted in a tremendous depletion of both soil mass by erosion ( Montgomery 2007 ; Sundquist 2007 ) and plant nutrients in soil ( Williams 2006 ; Salonius 2007 ) .
Plant nutrients are lost because of bare soil cultivation and the lack of the very efficient recycling that is a characteristic of diverse , deep rooted , nutrient - conservative forest and grassland / prairie ecosystems .
Nutrient replacement with fertilizers is the process that allowed intensive cultivation agriculture to continue after all of the arable soils on the planet had been occupied .
The Agricultural Revolution and Beyond
The Agricultural Revolution was the first of several food production improvements that took place after 1700 .
Soils , whose plant nutrients would normally be depleted after a period of cultivation , were augmented in the earliest stages of intensive agricultural development by forest leaves , animal manures , wood ash , fish , seaweed , mud from tidal zones , and pulverized bones .
As a complex transportation industry began to develop based on coal and then petroleum for railways and ocean going ships , long distance transport of guano , Chilean nitrate , limestone , potash salts and rock phosphate allowed depleted soils to produce enough crops for domestic use and export .
The absolute necessity for including legume crops in crop rotations was circumvented after the Haber - Bosch process began producing ammonia using methane and atmospheric nitrogen 1913 ( Vance 2001 ) .
Science - based management of soil nutrients and fertilizer materials became necessary as crop fertilization had to become increasingly efficient .
The guiding principle for crop fertilization was Liebig ’s Law of the Minimum that states that only by increasing the supply of the scarcest or most limiting soil nutrient would crop growth be improved .
Later the emphasis shifted from crop fertilization to nutrient management planning which attempted to assess soil nutrients that would be released into solution during growth , the acidity of the soil as it effects plant nutrient availability , the nutrients contributed by manure applications and nitrogen fixing plants , and the possibility of environmental ( especially to water ) damage by nutrients that are not used by the existing crop or that are not held in the soil until the next crop begins to grow .
The next major increase in food production occurred as the Industrial Revolution began .
Energy for manufacturing farm implements was first obtained from falling water .
With the invention of the steam engine , energy from burning wood supplied power for the manufacture of farm machinery such as plows , mowers , diggers and threshers .
The motive power to operate this machinery was provided by draft animals .
Later these machines were pulled and operated by power obtained from internal combustion engines that slowly reduced reliance on draft animals such as oxen and horses , whose feed formerly came from the same arable land that grows food crops for people .
Thus the Fossil Fuel Revolution began .
Since 1750 human society has increasingly augmented the solar energy that it relied on exclusively for most of its history with a progression of temporary supplies of non-renewable geological energy sources ( coal , petroleum , natural gas and fissionable uranium ) .
The profligate consumption of these energy subsidies has allowed tremendous increases in agricultural production and the global trading that removes the necessity for food to be produced in the region where it is to be consumed .
Thomas Malthus ( 1826 ) predicted that agricultural production increases would not be able to meet the requirements of a steadily growing human population .
However he was not aware that the depletion of soils by the agriculture , that was feeding less than one billion humans in the 1700s , was already unsustainable in the long term .
Malthus could not have conceived of the temporary increase of carrying capacity and food production that would be made possible by the use of non-renewable fossil and nuclear fuels during period after his death .
The abandonment of the effective controls on human birth rates , exercised by pre-agricultural societies , and the decrease in mortality by warfare that followed the evolution of states have allowed the exponential expansion of human numbers to be fuelled by increased availability of food .
Human populations had grown very slowly until the advent of agriculture .
Population grew rapidly in the context of both increased food security and the wealth that agricultural productivity created until the middle 1800s .
During the latter part of this period , as soil productivity became seriously diminished by cultivation agriculture , and a scarcity of forest land that could be cleared for farming developed , migration to new lands such as North America and Australia was used to decrease the pressure on existing land .
These new areas presented migrants with fertile land so that soil - depleting agriculture could continue ( Manning 2004 ; Williams 2006 ) .
This migration and exploitation of new lands continued the accelerating population expansion that increased agricultural food production makes possible .
The historically unprecedented rapid exponential population explosion after 1800 was driven by the increased productivity that was made possible by the labor saving machinery of the Industrial Revolution in concert with the increasing access to cheap and abundant geological energy that characterized the Fossil Fuel Revolution .
Part 3 : Our Current Agricultural Situation
The Green Revolution produced the last major improvement in food production during the latter decades of the twentieth century as new crop varieties were created by plant breeders .
These new varieties depended on large inputs of fossil - fuel dependent fertilizers , irrigation , insecticides and herbicides .
William Paddock ( 1970 ) warned , at the time of the beginning of the Green Revolution , that the increased agricultural productivity would simply produce more malnourished poor people if curbs were not applied to the increase in human numbers that would result from increased food availability .
Global population growth since the beginning of the Green Revolution has borne out the futility of increasing food availability in the absence of measures to control human fertility ( Diamond 2002 ) .
Some forms of modern industrial agriculture , combined with the transportation necessary to ship food produced , use more than 10 calories of fossil fuel to deliver one calorie of food to the market ( Younquist 1997 ) .
Montgomery ( 2007 ) states that before 1950 , most increases in food production were the result of increased land under cultivation and better husbandry , but recently most of the increases have been the result of mechanization and escalating fertilizer use .
Albert Bartlett ( 1978 ) has said , “ Modern agriculture is the use of land to convert petroleum into food . "
Salonius ( 2005 ) summarized evidence for the necessity that modern civilization must face the prospect of decreasing access to the cheap and abundant exhaustible geological energy that has served agriculture so effectively during the recent past .
The cost of this energy is poised to increase and that eventually fossil fuel and fissionable nuclear energy will become economically unavailable .
The looming scarcity of fossil fuel resources will create great difficulty in continuing to supply fertilizer nitrogen for agriculture by the Haber - Bosch process .
Inexpensive rock phosphate supplies are forecast to become depleted in as little as 60 years ( Vance 2001 ) .
Dery and Anderson ( 2007 ) demonstrate peaking phosphorus production from several sources including the United States that follow the same trajectory as the Hubbert Peak for petroleum ; these authors suggest that world rock phosphate production is already in decline and that future agricultural production will depend upon diligent phosphorus recycling .
North America has the largest reserves of potassium in the world that can be manufactured into fertilizer materials .
Concerns about the stability of limited supplies as well as the increasing costs of transport , that are driven by petroleum scarcity , produced rapid escalation in the price of potassium fertilizer during the early years of the twenty - first century .
As fertilizer supplies and long distance transport are expected to dwindle in concert with fossil - fuel depletion during the twenty - first century , organic agricultural techniques are expected to replace the industrial agriculture that has been powered by fossil fuels and nourished by chemical fertilizers .
The International Fertilizer Industry suggests that organic agriculture is only capable of producing one quarter of the protein produced when large amounts of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers are employed ( www.fertilizer.org/ifa/sustainability.asp); however , Pimentel et al. ( 2005 ) have shown that weathering rates appear to be able to meet plant demand for nutrients when organic agriculture relies on nitrogen fixing by legumes on some soils .
Sustainability issues are becoming increasingly apparent to systems analysts who have begun to understand the dilemma faced by human populations that have overshot the carrying capacity of the ecosystems they rely on for the production of food and fiber .
This understanding usually encompasses the looming current depletion of non-renewable fossil and nuclear energy subsidies , however more basic depletions are becoming recognized as having been sidestepped for the last 10,000 years .
The global human family has become dependent upon the enhanced food production made possible by temporary supplies of non-renewable geologically stored fossil and nuclear energy .
The energy market , upon which present affluence levels are based , is a global one , and the availability of geological energy supplies cannot be maintained .
As access to the energy upon which complex industrial societies are dependent becomes more expensive and less available during the twenty - first century , human population numbers will have to be brought into balance with the sustainable productivity levels of the local ecosystems upon which they rely for their sustenance .
The ecological deficits , that humans have sidestepped by migration to new lands , mining soil mass ( erosion ) and soil nutrients ( leaching ) , and access to one - time supplies of exhaustible energy , will have to be squarely faced as the level of affluence diminishes .
Food production per capita must fall as horses and oxen must again be fed from crop land and as access to fossil fuel dependent fertilizers diminishes .
Part 4 : Intensive Crop Cultures Are Unsustainable
A growing number of commentators , such as Alan Weisman ( 2007 ) , have begun to suggest that a world with fewer people would be far better placed to deal with climate change and the exhaustion of the dirty fuels of the industrial past .
Many appear to think that high technologies such as nuclear energy and yet another agricultural revolution , this one supplying Genetically Modified crops , in combination with curbs on population growth , would begin to dampen the environmental disruption caused by human society that is becoming increasingly obvious .
However the problem is even more serious than that visualized by these thoughtful individuals who are convinced that the neoclassical economic model of open - ended expansion and so - called ‘ sustainable growth ’ is a recipe for disaster .
William Rees ( 1992 ) originated the idea of the Ecological Footprint to measure the amount of land that people with different lifestyles both occupied and drew on for their sustenance .
Wackernagel and Rees ( 1997 ) further developed this concept , calculating how many Earths would be required if all of the people on the planet lived at particular levels of consumption ; they appear to believe that the human family overshot global carrying capacity sometime in the twentieth century .
Regardless of the timing , we know we are in serious overshoot and that the total human footprint ( whatever enormity it is ) must get smaller .
As we run up against all of the renewable and nonrenewable resource depletions ( oil , soil , phosphorus , minerals etc. ) that will characterize the foreseeable future , we require an entire rethink as to how we do business , because the human enterprise has been living on borrowed time and resources for millennia .
It is quite conceivable that most intensive crop culture is unsustainable and that it has been unsustainable since cultivation agriculture began .
It is reasonable to suggest that we begin unsustainable resource depletion ( overshoot ) as soon as we use ( and become dependent upon ) the first unit of any non-renewable resource or renewable resource used unsustainably whose further use becomes essential to the functioning of society .
Each of the following has facilitated an increase in food availability and thus an increase in the human numbers that must continue to be fed whether the resources become depleted or not : the first tonne of coal , the first litre of oil , the first kilogram of fissionable uranium , the first barrel of fossil water for irrigation that exceeds the recharge rate of the aquifer being tapped , and the first hectare of formerly nutrient conservative native forest or grassland / prairie plowed .
The last item in the list , plowing of virgin ecosystems for cultivation agriculture , sets in motion unsustainable renewable resource depletion ( excessive erosion and leaching / export of plant nutrients from arable soils , and more recently the excessive leaching and nutrient depletion that is associated with harvesting of nutrient - rich forest biomass ) that has been looming over us , unseen , for 10,000 years ( Salonius 2007 ) .
Some estimates suggest that nearly one - third of the arable soils on Earth have already been lost to erosion since cultivation began and recent moves to rely on agricultural crops as a source of biofuels ( ethanol ) are seen by some as trading a system based on mining oil for one based on mining soil ( Montgomery 2007 ) .
We can expect that the unsustainable exploitation of soil will become increasingly apparent as the depletion of petroleum begins to affect the production of foodstuffs by unsustainable farming , and the production of fiber produced by unsustainable forestry upon which most of us are dependent .
Humanity has probably been in overshoot of the Earth 's carrying capacity since it abandoned hunter gathering in favor of crop cultivation ( ~ 8,000 BCE ) and it has been running up its ecological debt since that time .
Part 5 : The Future of Food Production
In the context of depleting reserves of the fossil fuels that have supplied modern agriculture with motive power , machinery , fertilizers , insecticides and herbicides , it is expected that the way food is produced will have to change as the twenty - first century unfolds .
' Permaculture ’ ( Mollison and Holmgren 1979 ) , and other modifications of agricultural practice that seek self sufficiency , such as those put forward by proponents like the Post Carbon Institute ’s Relocalization program ( www.postcarbon.org) include local food and biofuel systems , revitalization of local industry , and community cooperation .
These are good first steps that recognize global trade will wane as fossil fuel depletion gains momentum .
They are also an attempt to wean people off the industrial food production that treats soil as a medium for fertilizer - dependent hydroponic agriculture , and simply a substrate to stand plants up in .
These people are interested in popularizing organic agriculture , minimum tillage or no-till methods , solar powered tractors etc. that will make local economies less reliant on imported materials .
However these alterations follow the cultivation agriculture model as a food production system , as they must in the short term .
All cultivation agriculture depends on the replacement of complex , species diverse , self - managing , nutrient conservative , deep rooted , natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems with monocultures or ' near monocultures ' of food crop plants that rely on intensive management .
The simple shallow rooting habit of food crops and the requirement for bare soil cultivation produces soil erosion and plant nutrient loss far above the levels that can be replaced by microbial nitrogen fixation , and the weathering of minerals ( rocks and course fragments ) into active soils and plant - available nutrients such as potassium , phosphorus , calcium , and magnesium on most of the soils on the planet .
Under natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems , erosion rates of soil mass are minimal , and the diverse and deep structure of the below - ground rooting community , with its microbial associates , makes the escape of plant nutrients entrained in downward - moving drainage ( leaching ) water to the ocean very difficult .
Our ultimate goal , as we attempt to achieve a sustainable human culture on Earth , must be to move toward the sustainable exploitation of natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems at rates that do not cause the loss of physical soil mass or plant nutrient capital any faster than they can be replaced by biological and weathering processes .
Obviously , as we move back toward a solar - energy dependent economy based on self - managing natural ecosystems , we will no longer be able to run the massive ecological deficits that temporary fossil and nuclear fuel availability have allowed .
Just as obviously the solar - energy dependent economy will not support the human numbers that have been able to exponentially increase slowly as a result of agricultural mining of soil mass and nutrient stores since ~ 8,000 BCE , and rapidly because of the availability of non renewable fossil and nuclear energy subsidies since 1750 .
In order to lower the human population to levels supportable by sustainable exploitation of natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems we must begin to allow these ecosystems to reestablish on lands that have historically been devoted to intensive cultivation during our 10,000 year agricultural past .
The best suggestion so far to produce Rapid Population Decline ( RPD ) is for the collective global human family to adopt a One Child Per Family ( OCPF ) ' modus operandi/philosophy ' .
Even with general acceptance of RPD and OCPF , the human population decrease that is necessary to achieve a sustainable solar energy - dependent culture , will take several centuries .
Governments , as they become convinced that RPD is necessary , may choose monetary incentives , tax breaks and / or penalties to achieve general acceptance of OCPF or some other RPD program .
Part 6 : Moving Beyond ( Back From ) Cultivation Agriculture
There are areas of the planet with such low rainfall as to preclude the growth of forest vegetation where a return to pastoral herding , with low stocking levels , will allow the reinvasion of native prairie vegetation .
As we move toward the abandonment of unsustainable agricultural practices , it would be advisable to shift away from the cultivation of grains and forages that require bare ground cultivation on these lands .
As human numbers are contracting / shrinking under a OCPF / RPD or some other numbers reduction methodology , the extant population will insist on being properly nourished .
The only way enough food can be produced for them is by cultivation agriculture that will further deplete most of the arable soils on the planet .
During the centuries of transition , as we move toward a solar - dependent culture that again sustainably exploits natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems , we should be exercising as responsible agriculture as is possible on the shrinking arable land base where it is still practiced .
During this transition , the growing amount of land that is abandoned will revert toward natural grassland / prairie and forest ecosystems very rapidly after we cease cultivating it ( Weisman 2007 ) .
Balancing of human numbers with the productivity of their supporting local ecosystems may be accomplished by planed attrition , much lower birth rates and the economic dislocations and hardships that a retreat from classical economic growth will incur , or the balancing of human numbers may be accomplished by a catastrophic collapse imposed by natural resource scarcity .
The species with the large brain must make the choice between economic hardship and catastrophic collapse .
Cultivation agriculture must be relied upon for the bulk of the food required to support global humanity until we have reduced our numbers to a level that can be sustained by regulated exploitation / harvesting activities that fall within the
( now better understood ) capacity of ecosystems to maintain diversity , to form soil and to replace soluble plant nutrients lost by harvesting or leaching .
The attractive aspect of moving toward sustainable co-existence with self - managing ecosystems is that the hit - and - miss process of evolution has already established how to make them work .
Our responsibility ( after our numbers have fallen to sustainable levels ) will be to learn to live within the regeneration capacity of these restored ecosystems .
The penalty for exceeding their regeneration capacity will be hunger and privation , as it was for our hunter gatherer , forager and pastoral ancestors .

( Half of this post my response to Tomanbay ’s criticisms , the other half is the answer to the above question .
If you want the second part , just skip to bolded part that starts with “ Which brings us to the part . . ” )
Time to give my 2 cents …
I had very conflicted feelings towards Tomanbay ’s post about me to tell you the truth .
One part of me ( the reactionary part ) immediately saw it as an unprovoked and largely unexpected attack on me and wanted to respond in kind , one part was immediately flattered by the time and effort he took to convey a point he wanted me to realize , and another part was kind of mad because with his post he ruined what I hoped to achieve by writing my post on Paradise Now , or at least shifted the debate to a direction I did n’t want it to take , as I will explain .
But I would like to thank him for writing it anyway because it also brought my attention to something I was n’t aware of : a lot of people who read me do n’t really get or understand what I stand for and hope to achieve by writing this blog , so I am going to address his points and my critics in a way that hopefully will help shed more light on my reasoning and motivations - since a lot of people seem to be confused about that .
If there is one thing that I agreed with Tomanbay on though , it ’s that I am an extremist myself , and as extreme as some of the Wahabbi extremists , and you will see why I am this way , and why you should thank me for it , by the end of this post .
Ok ?
All right , but first things first , and my post on that movie will come first , or actually what I hoped to achieve with it , will come first .
Here we go :
Ok Tomanbay , here is a question I wanted to ask you :
How stupid do you think I am ?
Really ?
Have you not seen me present arguments before ?
Do n’t you think that I am smart enough to present such an argument as the one I presented here with such a huge chink on my argument armor , as repeating twice that I did n’t see that movie , but will criticize it anyway ?
Did n’t that strike you as weird at all ?
Just a little strange ?
Did n’t you think for a second that it was presented that way , because it was supposed to push people ’s buttons ?
Man , I wrote this post with 2 goals in mind : 1 ) To mock all the people in our media who keep praising the movie and talking about “ how the Jews are fighting it because it shows who they really are ” without actually seeing the damn movie .
I mean , you would think from the amount of support this movie was getting from all of those people who did n’t see it but were excited about it anyway that it would just make the rest of the world suddenly be ok with palestinains blowing themselves up , or understand how evil the Joooz really are .
They were defending and praising a movie they did n’t see , just on the principle of “ if the Jews are opposing it it must be good ” mind you , and nobody had a problem with that at all .
That , my friend , pissed the shit out of me and I was just trying to give people a taste of what that ’s like when it ’s reversed .
Just being an asshole as usual .
But that ’s not the main reason why I wrote it .
The second reason - or goal - was to provoke a reaction out of my readers , especially the Palestinians amongst them .
I fully expected the Palestinians who read this blog to take an issue with me on this post , since - as we all know - the movie does n’t really support suicide - bombing .
You see , part of the sandmonkey experiences is provoking people ; to put them on the defensive and to get them to explain themselves and what they stand for .
Writing this post in such a way will force every Palestinian out there that reads it to mention the positive message of the movie , decry suicide - bombing and the stereotyping of arabs .
I did it fully realizing that not everyone will think this way , and some might even cuss me for it , but that ’s ok , because it was n’t really about me this time .
Not really .
Think about it Tomanbay , who reads my comments section ?
Do n’t people always call my commenters “ right - wing nutjobs ” ?
Well , what will those “ right - wing nutjobs ” read in such a comments section then , other than Palestinians decrying suicide - bombing and violence , and criticizing stereotyping and ignorance ?
Can you imagine the effect of that ?
Do you think that ’s the view they usually get of palestinains , thanks to the asshole elements of the likes of Hamas ?
Of Course not .
And it was working too .
It was starting a dialogue until you wrote your piece and changed the debate from the movie and the image of palestinains to the " Sandmonkey is a bad extremist ” love - fest you had on there , which of course ruined the whole thing .
Oh well .
Such is life .
But besides what I intended to do , let me make something clear : I do have an issue with that movie , especially after what I heard of it , for the reason everyone states in its defense :
It does n’t condemn or condone suicide - bombing and that it leaves the viewer free to make their own conclusions .
For me , in the times we are living in , and with the debates being the way they are , and with the deadly trifecta elements of ignorance , poverty and oppression feeding the fire of extremism in Islamic youth , I am not sure leaving them to make their own conclusion , after what I am assuming to be an emotionally charged movie , to be a very wise thing .
I mean , does n’t it disturb you that every movie we have on the topic glorifies the act of suicide bombing as a heroic form of self sacrifice and never the opposite ?
I mean , most of our people will go to such a movie with their schooling and their films telling them that blowing themselves up in order to kill your enemy is ok , so , like , what kind of a conclusion do you think they will come out with ?
I mean , would it be bad for once to show a movie that says , that maybe , just maybe , that suicide - bombing is wrong and that it kills innocent people ?
Would it have killed the director to make that the message of the movie instead of being neutral on the subject ?
Is that really too much to ask ?
I mean , I get it that it shows that innocent people will die ( the scene with the little girl on the bus in the end and all ) and therefore the suicide - bombing is bad , but that ’s for people who will think about the movie and its message later on , and I do n’t know if a lot of people - from our side of the fence at least - will do that .
I mean , after all that ’s been happening lately , I am starting to doubt that our people think at all with their brains , and instead just follow their emotions .
I do n’t think I need to explain to you how dangerous that is ; I mean , anyone who has been watching the news lately can see that for themselves .
And then you have the idiots , like this lady that left this comment on your blog :
Thank you for this post .
It was right on !
I can't believe SM had the audacity to attack Pradise Now without watching it and REFUSING the simple idea of humanizing the suicide bomber .
Suicide bombers are not animals they are , surprise , surprise , humans !
Yes !
You have no idea what it takes to be willing to end your life like that .
Ok , I will say it slowly and hopefully you will get it : I do n’t think suicde - bombers are animals Sonia , because I respect animals .
I think suicde - bombers are monsters .
I think they are mass - murdering idiots and do n’t deserve an ounce of sympathy from me .
I do n’t know why that is :
Maybe it ’s because I was at the Hotel in Ras Shaitan in october of 2004 when one of them blew himself up not 400 meters away from where I was , and I saw the dead bodies , blood and carnage he committed in his efforts to kill - get this - tourists .
Not Israeli army officers , not the evil American occupiers of Iraq , but rather your simple innocent by - standing tourists , who I am sure had it coming because , ehh , why is that again ?
Can you tell me ?
I would like to know .
You see my friend , that ’s why I think they are monsters .
It ’s because I know they do n't give a damn or care or differentiate between their victims .
Those are the kinds of people who blow up school children buses , slaughtering 32 children , to kill one US soldier in Iraq .
They are murderous nutbags , plain and simple , and even if they would like to differentiate between their victims , their bombs would n't , and that 's the sad truth .
So here I am , an arab muslim egyptian male , and I am well aware of all the history and the injustices and all the other excuses we all know and are ready to spout on a second 's notice , and yet I can't seem to care about those people anymore .
For me , as far as I am concerned , they want me dead .
Not me personally , but if I die for being in the wrong place on the wrong time , they would n't really care .
And you know something ?
I am not really ready to die .
I do n't wanna die .
I want to live .
I have places to see , parties to go to , girls to sleep with and children to screw up raising .
And if it 's between me - or you for that matter - and 100 of those Koran thumbing allahu akbar shouting misogynistic racist jihadist assholes , it is no contest : I choose us .
They 've got to go .
It really is that simple .
Hope I made myself clear on that front , and now back to you Tomanbay , and your criticisms of me .
The first one , the port deals one , is stupid , because if you read the IMAO parody , you would understand that it was making fun of the people who were against the deal .
It was logically refuting every argument people were raising against the UAE taking over the ports , while making fun of the critics misconceptions of arabs as being “ all terrorists who want to kill them all ” .
In my opinion it did it brilliantly , which is why I was surpised to know that this is when you started “ questioning my motives ” .
I was like , come on Tomanbay , you are smarter than that .
You are the guy who would get this .
And then the second point you raise is about my praising of Deeyah and my ridicule of Samy Yusef .
First of all , I do n’t think the comparison is valid , mainly because I do n’t think Deeyah is exploiting Islam as some people claimed she was to gain fame and success .
That argument is so stupid that I can't believe some of the people who I know to be smart spouted it .
Yes , I am sure she did that , because the teen pop-music listening anti-islamic crowd is so huge and her albums would reach platinum easy , right ?
Not to mention , she would have the most sold - out concerts , cause I am sure her fans would n’t be afraid of some nutbag trying to blow himself up and kill her .
And I am sure she just does n’t care about the death threats she gets , or the fact that she has to surround herself with bodyguards all the time , because she must be making a ton of money from the anti-Islamic feminist pop-music crowd .
Yeah .
Sure .
Are you kidding me ?
No one , unless a true believer in the cause she is championing , would do what she is doing , because , let ’s face it , they do n’t want to die , not even for the supposed money she would get out of this ( How will she get this money again ?
Can you tell me ? ) .
Exploiting Islam to sell pop-music albums .
Yeah , that ’s the ticket .
That 's the untaped market .
The Islamic Defamation Foundation ( IDF , hehe ) must be supporting her as well , and it ’s all bankrolled by the Jews who want to destroy Islam .
And women in muslim countries are n’t oppressed at all .
Yeah , ok !
As for Samy Yusef , hey , I reserve the right to make fun of whomever I want , and let ’s face it , anything Islamic these days in our countries is commercially successful and people are noticing it ( Check the new Islamic songs of WAMA and Mostafa Kamar if you want an example ) .
So am I saying he is doing it for the money ?
Who knows ?
Maybe .
I am sure the money does n’t hurt .
And good for him for finding his niche .
I ai n’t hating on him for that .
I just did n’t like that song he made , especially with its hidden messages , and I chose to make fun of that one .
I mean , come on , him singing a song for veiled girls explaining to them what they should say about how the veil most of them are pressured and forced to wear makes them feel like ?
How can I not make fun of that ?
And let me be honest with you , I might respect him the day he starts singing against Islamic terrorism or even the subjugation of women , or any of the other real issues and problems we have in our culture .
He is n’t .
He does n’t even talk about it and brushes them off , like all of them do , and pretends that the real problem lies in the west not understanding Islamic culture .
No man , they do understand it , and they are starting to see the festering problems that we are ignoring .
The cracks in our wall .
That ’s our real problem .
Deeyah is addressing that problem , and therefore is not commercially successful and has death threats up the ass , while Samy is n’t at all , and that ’s why he is making money .
To me the dude is like the singer version of Amr Khaled :
He talks about the positives and ignores the problems that need addressing .
Fine , it ’s his right to do that .
It ’s my right not to like it .
This brings us to the part where we talk about my extremism .
And if you are still reading then you are a champ , so I am not going to disappoint you .
I will admit it .
I am as extremist in my beliefs as “ the radical , extremist , fanatical jihadiys ” .
In that you are right , but you also got to understand , it ’s not by my choice , I am forced to be this way , and I am doing it for YOUR own good .
Let me elaborate .
There is an ideological war going on in regards to Islam and in our societies I believe , and the Jihadis are winning .
There are 3 reasons why they are winning :
1 ) The reluctance of the moderates amongst us to admit there are problems that need addressing , thanks to our stupid belief that “ we should n’t air our dirty laundry ” ;
2 ) Because in any debate between the moderates and the extremists , if there is to be a compromise , it will always be in the extremists favor ; and 3 ) Because the extremists , if they face defeat , they will just threaten their ideological enemies , if not issue a takfir Fatwa on them , which will lead to a moron attempting to - if not succeeding in - killing them .
And because of those 3 reasons I am the extremist that I am today .
You see , we ca n’t fix our problems without addressing them , so I therefore make sure to point out the negatives all the time , because I believe that it is our duty to fix them , and that if we do fix them , then no one will be able to criticize or attack us .
And that , in the eyes of many , makes me an extremist and a self - hater .
Fine , whatever .
But someone has to do it , and since very few are stepping up to the plate , I guess it has to be me .
And that ’s the first reason why I am an extremist .
The second reason I am an extremist is the reaction to reason 2 of why they are winning :
The scales are n’t balanced .
You see , any consensus achieved between the moderates and the extremists will only mean one thing : they reached a compromise .
This would naturally mean that the extremists agreed to move closer to the moderates , but it also means that the moderates have to also move closer to the side of the extremists , and that ’s what ’s happening now in our societies .
And this is not what we want , or what we should strive for .
We want the society to remain moderate , but without extremists on the other side to balance the Islamic extremists , the society will always tilt in their favor .
What we need are secular extremists who will not give an inch to counter the Islamic extremists in order to balance the society and move everyone more towards the middle .
To make it a place where we all can live and co-exist .
But we do n’t have any Tomanbay , and that ’s why the moderates are losing ground .
Knowing the stakes , I stepped up , because as always , no one else is willing to do it .
I am not enough by a long shot , but I am a start , and hopefully more will join me and will help balancing the scales of our society .
That ’s why I am an extremist , and why I will not budge on certain issues .
The third and final reason lies in the nature of this ideological war , and how it unfairly favors the islamists , simply because they will not allow themselves to be defeated .
You see , they view themselves to be absolutely in the right ; the agents of God on earth so to speak .
So any dialogue with them will not be fair , because in their minds they are the right muslims and their oppositions are the ones who are misguided and who have to prove themselves .
Not to mention , if you manage to beat them in a debate - which is easy - they will not just concede defeat and accept your points .
They will view you as a threat to “ God ’s will ” and subsequently they will view it as their duty to get rid of your infidel Kafir Islam - hating ass .
This is why people are afraid of debating them or attacking them ; they fear for their lives and they do n’t want to get killed .
I say screw that .
I say fuck them .
I say if they have no problems killing those who oppose them or their ideology ( i.e. Us ) , then we have every right in the world to kill them back .
Hell , it would be self - defense .
And that ’s why I am an extremist ; because I would rather kill those who have no problem killing or threatening people ( i.e. YOU ) who do n’t conform to their views .
I value my and your life over those who preach death , and since I want to live and want you to live , I have no problem with the death preachers dying .
I say let ’s see how this debate will go when their Death Fatwa heads start getting killed back .
I say until they stop and abandon the method of killing those who oppose them , we should n’t have any moral qualms at all about killing them as well .
It ’s self - evident , yet hard to swallow , and probably too Manichean to the average person , but someone has to do it for all of our sake .
I get that , and that ’s why I am an extremist .
Now , do you think I like it ?
Do you think I like being this extremist ?
Do you think any of the people , who suddenly found themselves part of this war and reacted the same way I did , like this stupid " Clash of Civilizations " either ?
Man , I am 25 .
I come from a well - off family , I have a sweet job with a big pay and lots of friends .
I could be enjoying life like the rest of the useless idiots in my social class , talking about who got engaged to who , whose driving what car and who got photographed in what socialite magazine .
But the world is going to shit Tomanbay , and very few people are doing something about it , and I ca n’t just stand still and watch it slide to oblivion .
I ca n’t do that .
I do what I do because it needs to be done .
I am what I am because someone has to be .
This is not fun , man .
But I ca n’t just not do something .
I have to do what I do , because I am compelled to do it , and no one else will take the job .
This is why I will talk about the rights of Christians in Egypt when no one talked about it .
This is why I called the boycott thing retarded and started to remedy the situation even before anyone else said it .
This is why I was one of the people who tried to start anti-terrorism protest in Egypt after the Sharm - bombing , while the rest of the country debated how much of a discount they can probably get if they went to Sharm now .
I am waging an almost solitary battle to make the world understand that we are not all the crazy extremists violent assholes the extremists make us to be .
And I always have to be in the forefront of it all , because none of you so - called moderates will ever take the first step .
I always have to take it for you .
Do you understand how much that sucks ?
And do I even get a thank you from you guys ?
No .
I get criticized and attacked , and called an extremist .
Fine .
Thanks a lot .
Whatever .
I am not going to be bitter about it Tomanbay , or even get angry over it , because , honestly , I am so used to this reaction that I have come to expect it by now .
Not to mention , I made that choice to fight this battle , and as weary as I am , I wo n’t quit before I am 100 % sure that it ’s a lost battle , regardless of criticisms and attacks .
For the simple reason that someone has to do it , and nobody else will .
Because I value my life and yours , and the freedoms that we are all entitled to .
That ’s why I am called an extremist .
And if that ’s what an extremist is , then I am proud to be one .
