One of the more overlooked features of the new iPhone 3.0 is support for a new open standard for live video streaming over HTTP , which promises to open up standards - based video broadcasting to a wide audience while giving mobile users an optimized picture as they roam between WiFi and mobile networks .
At the March unveiling of iPhone 3.0 , Apple only dropped a subtle hint about new streaming video features in the new operating system ( literally limited to writing " streaming video " on the slide of other features , below ) , leaving out any details about how it would work and not even mentioning the feature in any detail in the presentation .
For the last decade , Apple has been selling QuickTime Streaming Server , which uses an RTSP ( Real - Time Streaming Protocol ) server to stream live or rebroadcast video feeds to viewers .
Apple uses this technology to stream some of its own live events .
However , despite offering royalty free streaming and also delivering it as an open source project , QuickTime 's RTSP streaming server has n't gained the traction it was once expected to achieve .
A large part of this is due to the fact that RTSP traffic is blocked by many firewalls , making it difficult to deliver streams reliably .
The audio and video conferencing used by iChat also relies on RTSP , causing some users frustrating problems for the same reason .
Getting RTSP video streaming to work on the iPhone would be even more difficult , as it routinely moves between mobile and WiFi networks .
Apple attempted to solve the RTSP problem long ago in QuickTime Streaming Server by creating an option to bundle up RTSP streaming video traffic into HTTP packets , which appear identical to standard web traffic and therefore are permitted through most firewalls .
This involves a extra layer of overhead however , resulting in a greater demand for bandwidth .
For the iPhone , Apple decided to pursue a different strategy , which it calls HTTP Live Streaming .
HTTP Live Streaming
The technology behind HTTP Live Streaming leaked into public knowledge in May when Apple submitted it to the Internet Engineering Task Force ( IETF ) as a draft standard on track to become an RFC ( or Request For Comments , the memorandum used by the Internet Society to define how technologies work in order to foster cooperation and compatibility between the vendors implementing them ) .
Apple 's HTTP Live Streaming proposed draft looks a lot like a method Microsoft began selling last year , called Smooth Streaming .
The difference is that Apple 's proposed IETF standard can use anybody 's encoder and broadcast server , and will work with any client software designed to receive the stream .
In contrast , Microsoft 's Smooth Streaming is of course designed to exclusively use Microsoft Expression Encoder , Microsoft Internet Information Server with a Smooth Streaming extension , and requires Microsoft 's Silverlight 2 on the client .
Essentially , Apple wants a standard for streaming video that anyone can use so that it can continue selling hardware without being either shut out of the market by proprietary software , or held captive by it ; Microsoft , as a software vendor , wants to create another captive market where it has the power to shut out competitors at its whim .
In parallel to Microsoft 's Silverlight Smooth Streaming , Adobe also offers an equivalent Flash - based streaming server of its own .
If this is all beginning to sound familiar , it 's because video streaming has followed much of the same historical trajectory as multimedia playback , making the history of streaming another chapter in the history of QuickTime .
The advent of streaming
Back in the mid 90s , Apple 's pioneering advancement of software - based desktop video authoring and playback gave the company a strong lead in multimedia computing .
With the arrival of the Internet however , there seemed to be a huge potential for sending efficient streams of video to users ( primarily over dial - up ) instead of relying on CD - ROMs for distribution of large video files or expecting users to directly download huge videos over dial - up connections .
Internet media streaming was popularized by Progressive Networks in 1995 with its proprietary RealAudio streaming format .
In 1997 , the company was renamed RealNetworks and launched a RealVideo service as part of RealPlayer 4.0 .
It also partnered with Netscape to develop what would become the RTSP standard for streaming .
Real had been founded by Microsoft millionaire Rob Glaser .
Microsoft owned ten percent of the company and licensed Real 's streaming formats in NetShow , its product aimed at killing Netscape 's streaming server .
Microsoft 's NetShow incorporated Real 's streaming formats for compatibility with existing content , but hoped to eventually shift Internet streaming to its own new ActiveX Streaming Format ( ASF ) .
Despite its interests in Real , Microsoft 's growing ambitions resulted in the company pitting itself against RealPlayer with its own Windows Media Player in 1998 , a phoenix that rose from the ashes of 1996's Active Movie / DirectShow player , which themselves were rebranded versions of the company 's ill fated QuickTime competitor originally named Video For Windows .
Just as QuickTime suddenly failed to work properly under Windows 98 and Internet Explorer , Windows Media Player suddenly stopped playing Real 's streaming formats , as Glaser testified in the Microsoft Monopoly trial .
Real executive David Richards also testified that Microsoft was pressuring AOL to drop support for Real and use Microsoft 's own streaming software instead , citing an email on the subject from AOL 's CEO to Glaser which warned , " They want to kill you guys so badly , it is ugly . "
Microsoft hoped to own the future of streaming and digital playback both , so it took on Real and Apple at once , pushing the idea of streaming ASF ( the Real killer ) via MMS ( Microsoft Media Server , the new name for NetShow and not to be confused with the mobile messaging protocol ) and establishing ActiveX Authoring Format ( AAF ) as its QuickTime killer .
In 1998 AAF was rejected by the ISO in favor of QuickTime as the basis for the new MPEG - 4 media container format .
By 2003 MMS , which used its own proprietary system for streaming media , had been deprecated by Microsoft in favor of its own new RTSP server , Windows Media Server 9 .
After the ActiveX brand was sufficiently tainted by widespread security flaws , the A in ASF and AAF was changed to stand for " Advanced . "
Most recently , Microsoft was forced to drop its ASF and adopt the MPEG - 4 container to support Smooth Streaming .
During its streaming battle with Microsoft , and without any other revenue streams to fall back on , Real turned itself into an adware vendor that attempted to leverage its existing value in RealPlayer to inundate users with marketing partners ' messages and attempts to sell them subscription music .
It also filed suit against Microsoft and won an antitrust settlement of $ 460 million in 2005 .
Apple jumps on streaming bandwagon
While still recovering from its mid 90s brush with death , Apple , unlike Real , did have other real business to keep it going .
It released QuickTime 3 in 1998 with a sort of fake streaming called HTTP Progressive Download .
Rather than actually streaming video in real time , it only allowed users to begin downloading a file and start watching the portion the was available .
The next year however , at NAB 1999 , Apple released QuickTime 4 with QuickTime Streaming Server , which supplied real standards - based RTSP streaming .
Rather than imposing a per user royalty fee for streams , Apple allowed unlimited streaming use , hoping this would enable it to catch up in the streaming business dominated by Real and demanded by Microsoft .
Apple also released the software as open source as the Darwin Streaming Server .
In a press release , Steve Jobs , still acting as interim CEO , stated , " Finally , streaming live video and audio over the Internet no longer requires proprietary software and expensive servers .
By including streaming as part of Mac OS X Server and introducing Darwin Streaming Server , Apple is significantly lowering the cost of streaming digital video and audio and the result should be a deluge of high quality streamed content . "
Apple remained in third place in the streaming market however , and the deluge of streaming content did n't materialize as expected .
Internet radio based on streaming MP3 files did begin to take off however , using the SHOUTcast protocol developed by Nullsoft .
Along with the GPL Icecast server , QuickTime Streaming Server also adopted SHOUTcast audio streaming server support as a feature , and Apple also added radio streaming client support to iTunes .
Streaming stymied by technology , licensing
In 2002 , Apple launched QuickTime 6 with the new QuickTime Broadcaster , which enabled users to capture live video and stream it , either unicast to another user or multicast over a local network where multiple users could view it .
Multicast transmission of video is efficient , but is n't allowed over the Internet because ISPs can't decide how to bill users for the traffic , which rather than being unicast point to point like a telephone call , is instead spread out for multiple users to receive more like a television broadcast .
QuickTime Broadcaster can also send a video stream to QuickTime Streaming Server , which will then reflect the single stream to a variety of other unicast clients , or relay the signal to other servers for load balancing .
A remaining problem is the RTSP firewall issue ; getting around this requires a network of servers that encapsulate streams as HTTP packets and then rebroadcast them to local users inside the firewall , a solution that does n't work outside of large corporate installations .
Another factor holding back streaming was MPEG - 4 licensing .
In its press release , Apple noted , " QuickTime Broadcaster supports the broadcast of MPEG - 4 , but as with QuickTime 6 , the distribution of QuickTime Broadcaster is being delayed until MPEG - 4 video licensing terms are improved .
The MPEG - 4 licensing terms proposed by MPEG - LA ( the largest group of MPEG - 4 patent holders ) includes royalty payments from companies , like Apple , who ship MPEG - 4 codecs , as well as royalties from content providers who use MPEG - 4 to stream video .
Apple agrees with paying a reasonable royalty for including MPEG - 4 codecs in QuickTime , but does not believe that MPEG - 4 can be successful in the marketplace if content owners must also pay royalties in order to deliver their content using MPEG - 4 . "
The iPod 's end run around streaming
One of the main purposes of streaming was to get around the issue of limited Internet bandwidth in the late 90s .
At a time when most users only had dial - up , streaming audio or video could make more sense than waiting for a download to finish .
By 2003 , with broadband nearly ubiquitous , Apple followed up the launch of the iPod with the new iTunes Store , which in addition to streaming Internet radio now offered a library of music for progressive download .
Apple also happened upon a new demand brewed by the iPod itself : podcasting .
Using an RSS feed , content creators could publish their broadcasts as progressive download files rather than streaming them in real time .
With this new technology , the emphasis on streaming reverted back to the CD - ROM and Walkman climate of the early 90s , where users obtained high quality prerecorded content in advance of listening to it rather than trying to stream content in real time and having to put up with lower quality streams and needing some cost effective way to tune into these streams .
Microsoft continued following Real 's efforts to market music subscriptions ; in contrast , Apple quickly established itself at the top of this new business of both selling prerecorded content and delivering podcasts .
iTunes served as a library for listing the podcasts of conventional broadcasters , and Apple also encouraged universities to publish their content as free podcasts in iTunes U. Podcast Producer , part of Mac OS X Server , enables organizations to create workflows that capture video from remote clients , perform automated editing to add opening videos and titles and end credits , and then produce output files ready for iTunes distribution as podcasts or streams for QuickTime Streaming Server .
i Phone 3.0 introduces mobile streaming
While iTunes users can listen to radio streams from their broadband PC , there was n't a practical way to take streamed content with them on their iPods .
That is , until the iPhone appeared with a hefty mobile data plan in tow .
Suddenly , the landscape changed again , with a new demand for streaming to take advantage of the bandwidth customers had already paid for when buying the iPhone .
Among the first apps for iPhone 2.0 was AOL Radio , followed by a series of others that delivered audio or video streams proprietary to their provider : BBC , TV.com , and even users ' own video with SlingPlayer .
AT&T cried foul , asking that its mobile network not be used to capacity by apps on the device when other providers were making a killing selling their users little audio and video clips .
Apple did n't build RTSP support into the iPhone , leaving vendors to work out their own delivery mechanism .
Navigating the problems of firewalls and roaming between networks would likely make video streaming over RTSP little more than frustrating , with a constant rebuffering of the stream to annoy users .
Instead , Apple has now adopted this emerging alternative it calls HTTP Live Streaming .
Unlike progressive downloads , HTTP Live Streaming actually does stream content in real time , although there can be a latency of as much as 30 seconds .
It works much simpler than RTSP ; essentially , the content to be broadcast is encoded into an MPEG transport stream and chopped into segments that are around ten seconds long .
Rather than getting a continuous stream of new data over RTSP , the new protocol simply asks for the first couple clips , then asks for additional clips as needed .
This works great through firewalls , and does n't require any special servers because any standard web server can deliver the chopped up video segments .
Where HTTP Live Streaming shines
The real benefit to HTTP Live Streaming is that the server can maintain multiple versions of the clips in different formats .
This allows an iPhone user with a WiFi connection to negotiate a higher quality version of the video than if only EDGE were available .
Even better , the phone can renegotiate a higher or lower quality dynamically if it improves or loses signal .
This enables the watcher to experience the best video quality possible at the current bandwidth available , continually optimized as new segments are requested .
Unlike Microsoft's Smooth Streaming trojan horse for Silverlight , HTTP Live Streaming works with any playback client on any platform and does not involve a layer of DRM , although it does support encryption , allowing broadcasters to limit access to their content .
Because support is built directly into the iPhone 's embedded QuickTime player , users do n't even need to download apps for every broadcaster or channel ; content creators can simply publish their feeds within a standard website , and iPhone can access them just like a desktop client .
Other phones can similarly support the same interoperable standard , providing a leg up for mobile platforms with less commercial attraction or no ability to run real applications , like the Palm Pre .
The embedded support for HTTP Live Streaming in the iPhone also provides a route around AT&T's App Store limitations , enabling vendors to deliver their content , unrestricted , to iPhone users at optimal quality using published standards over the web , even directly from their iPhone apps .
It also standardizes video playback , allowing publishers to simply hand the iPhone content rather than having to build their own player .
As Apple adds features to QuickTime , those apps will simply benefit from those enhancements , and will all look and work consistently .
The simple video streaming outlined in HTTP Live Streaming is similar to SHOUTcast in that it uses a regular HTTP server and posts content data using and extended version of the M3P ( MP3 Playlist ) format that supports video as well .
That will make it easy for homebrew broadcasters to set up Internet TV broadcasts following the same pattern as Internet radio .
What 's next ?
The obvious followup is to add support for HTTP Live Streaming in Apple TV , allowing for HD streams direct from broadcasters , facilitating the ability to only pay for channels you want to watch , skipping around the local cable monopoly while gaining access to content they do n't carry .
The same content would also be accessible on the iPhone , a desktop PC , or any other device with the capacity to play modern video codecs .
And that 's why Apple is not supporting Mozilla 's efforts to use the obsolete Ogg Theora on the web , which lacks silicon support for hardware acceleration on mobiles and appliances .
The whole saga is worth reading , but just to let you know : here ’s the latest .
Wanting to offer an alternative to PayPal , we set up a Google Checkout account for people to buy our ebook .
The last email we received about our Google Checkout account was “ Helpful tips regarding your first Google Checkout orders ” on February 9th .
But a few days ago , I logged in , and this is what greeted me :
And if you click that link , “ I had pending payouts for charged orders .
Will I receive these payouts ? ” , you ’ll see that the answer is “ Nope , you ’re screwed . ”
So , to sum up our experience with Google Checkout :
they did not try to contact us to resolve any issue
there ’s no way to find out why they closed our account , due to “ security reasons ”
there was no notice ( we found out by accident , when we tried to pay for something with Google Checkout )
they kept over $ 200 of our money
there is no appeal
there is no one we can contact
we cannot open a new account
our money is gone , even though people have received their products
And I do n’t know if you noticed , but that agreement section does n’t actually have anything to do with this situation .
It ’s clearly just there to cause a sense of despair & make readers believe they have no legal recourse .
Crime Does Pay
This is on top , of course , of their theft of over $ 2,000 for Adsense revenues for the web site for script.aculo.us , which happened in similar circumstances ( no warning , no appeal , no replies , etc. , etc. ) .
So , despite any number of ads I ’ve clicked in my life using Google search , they ’ve also made a cool $ 2300 at least from us by stealing our cash outright .
Translation : Google is even worse than PayPal .
Do not use Google Checkout for your business .
PayPal , as a company with financial services that have caught the eye of the government , is subject to a lot more regulations … and , surprisingly , acts better .
‘ Do n’t be evil ’ my ass .
Now that the Democrats have regained complete control of the government , many conservatives are looking to the Republicans in Congress to save us from the socialism and fascism of the Democrats .
As we saw when Clinton was president , many Republicans have started talking , and some have started acting , like the conservative advocates of liberty and less government they claim to be .
Will the Republicans save us ?
Do n’t count on it .
So why am I so pessimistic ?
Because I actually check how the Republicans in Congress vote instead of just listening to their free - market , limited government , and anti-Democratic rhetoric , that ’s why .
The New American magazine ’s “ Freedom Index ” for the new 111th Congress has just been released .
The higher the number on this index , the stronger a congressman ’s “ adherence to constitutional principles of limited government , fiscal responsibility , national sovereignty , and a traditional foreign policy of avoiding foreign entanglements . ”
Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) scored a perfect 100 on the House version of the index , as he consistently does .
This time , however , two other Republicans in the House ( John Duncan of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona ) also scored a 100 .
The high scorer in the Senate was Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , with a 100 .
The composition of the 111th Congress in the House is 256 Democrats and 178 Republicans ( there is one vacancy ) .
In the Senate , there are 58 Democrats , 2 Independents , and 40 Republicans .
The ten issues that members of the 111th Congress in the House are being rated on this time are TARP funding , reauthorization of the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) , economic stimulus spending , national service , federal funding of more police , the $ 3.56 trillion federal budget , hate crimes legislation , supplemental appropriations for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , TSA use of body imaging screening , and the “ cash for clunkers ” program .
In the Senate , the issues are TARP funding , the Mexico City Policy on abortion funding , SCHIP reauthorization , economic stimulus spending , District of Columbia congressional voting rights , the Fairness Doctrine , national service , the federal budget , funding for the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and supplemental appropriations .
The average House score on the “ Freedom Index ” is 38 ; the average Senate score is 34 .
The average Republican score in the House is 71 ; the average Republican score in the Senate is 76 .
( The Republican average in the Senate should actually be less since Arlen Specter [ D - PA ] was a Republican for the first seven of the ten Senate votes tracked by the “ Freedom Index . ” )
Obviously , the Democratic averages are less than the overall averages .
Okay , so the Republicans do n’t look too bad — if we compare them with the Democrats .
And that ’s the problem .
When the Republicans look good , it is usually because they are being compared with the Democrats .
Even when they look bad , they end up looking good because they are said to be the lesser of two evils .
But judged by the standards of liberty and the Constitution , the Republicans in the House only get a C — , while those in the Senate get a C .
This is not good for a party whose members take an oath to uphold the Constitution and profess to believe in free markets and limited government .
Who praises their kids for having a C average on their report card ?
Another reason I am not excited about these Republican scores is that their numbers in previous editions of the “ Freedom Index ” are much , much lower .
For example , the last “ Freedom Index ” gave the cumulative scores for forty key votes in the 110th Congress .
The Republican average in the Senate was a pathetic 47 .
But should n’t we still be happy about the higher scores for the Republicans in the 111th Congress ?
Yes and no .
I rejoice that many Republicans have started acting like the defenders of liberty and less government they claim to be .
But I am not dumb enough to think that they are doing it for any other reason than they are opposing the Democrats .
Almost half of the Republicans in the House and over two - thirds of the Republicans in the Senate voted for the bailout bill ( H.R. 1424 ) last year .
What a difference a Democratic president makes .
Am I being too hard on the Republicans ?
I think not .
When we dig a little deeper into the legislation tracked by the “ Freedom Index ” we see that it ’s not just a few bad grapes that are corrupting the Republican vine .
The Republicans show themselves to be against liberty and limited government on certain key issues .
On the issue of national service , 70 Republicans in the House and 22 in the Senate voted for The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act ( H.R. 1388 ) .
On the supplemental appropriations bill ( H.R. 2346 ) that funneled another $ 84.5 billion to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and authorized another $ 10 billion in foreign aid , only 9 Republicans in the House and 1 in the Senate voted no .
A House vote authorizing the federal government to spend $ 1.8 billion a year to hire local law - enforcement officers through the Community Oriented Policing Services ( COPS ) program ( H.R. 1139 ) was supported by 94 Republicans .
There were 59 House Republicans that voted for the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act ( H.R. 2751 ) , known as the “ cash for clunkers ” program .
This authorizes the federal government to give consumers rebates of up to $ 4,500 for trading in their old cars for more fuel - efficient ones .
I am still trying to find authorization for that one in the Constitution .
I applaud the Republicans for overwhelmingly rejecting Obama ’s economic stimulus ( The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act [ H.R. 1 ] ) and bloated federal budget .
But where were these born - again fiscal conservatives during the Bush years ?
Is there any doubt that a McCain stimulus and a McCain budget would be strongly supported by most of the Republicans in Congress ?
How can anyone look at the Republican track record and think otherwise ?
The Revolution that Wa ... Laurence M. Vance Best Price : null Buy New $ 5.95 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
So , can we look to the Republicans to save us ?
Obviously not .
So many of them violate the Constitution without even blinking , the vast majority of them still support billions more in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and so few of them are even close to being Ron Paul Republicans .
As I have said on several occasions , I rarely bother to write about the evils of the Democratic Party .
The socialist and statist policies of the Democratic Party are well known and expected .
The Democrats do n’t masquerade as advocates of more liberty and less government .
They openly preach the redistribution of wealth , draconian environmental laws , the nanny state , and massive increases in government intervention in the economy and society .
The only thing surprising about the Democrats turning this country into a socialist / fascist paradise is the speed in which they are going about it .
We can count on the Republicans to oppose some of the socialism and fascism of the Democrats , grudgingly go along with some of it in exchange for something they want , wholeheartedly support some of it , and then , as we saw in the Bush years , enact some of their own once they get in power .
This means that if we ’re looking to the Republicans save us , we ’re doomed .
The Best of Laurence M. Vance

In recent years , the Greek root meta has perhaps become overused .
Originally , it was just a lowly preposition meaning “ after ” , “ beyond ” , or simply “ with ” – but especially since the writings of Douglas Hofstadter it has taken on the meaning of a higher level of abstraction , especially a self - referential abstraction .
That ’s the sense in which it is used in the term metaprogramming – modifying programs programmatically , or modifying the programming language itself .
As with many terms that describe programming , metaprogramming admits of many different incarnations , shades of meaning , and degrees of support .
In the broadest sense , the simple act of creating generalized functions or classes represents an extension and abstraction of the “ language ” used for programming – but the term “ metaprogramming ” is usually reserved for more radical modifications .
Languages that provide features for those types of operations are often called dynamic languages .
Generative programming
One use of the term “ metaprogramming ” refers to programs that generate or manipulate their own code .
Languages that provide the best support for this are those that easily overcome the distinction between code and data .
In more than fifty years since the introduction of Lisp , no other language has devised a more radical yet natural representation of that interchangeability .
Code and data are both represented in Lisp as lists , so any list can easily be treated as either code or data .
It ’s simple , therefore , to manipulate code as data , and then execute it – either via EVAL or by returning it as the result of a macro expansion .
By comparison , COBOL ’s single contribution to metaprogramming , the odious ALTER statement , seems laughable .
If GOTO is deemed harmful , then ALTER was pure evil .
It allowed you to change the destination of a GOTO statement at runtime , producing stealth spaghetti .
It had all the pitfalls of metaprogramming and none of the benefits , since it reduced readability without improving abstraction .
Some versions of the early line - numbered BASIC language allowed you to “ include ” code from a file at runtime .
You could , therefore , write the code from your program and then include it in order to generate and execute code at runtime .
At the machine level , code is of course a form of data , so it ’s always been possible to modify code at runtime in assembly languages .
I ’ve seen that used intentionally and unintentionally , to impressive and devastating effect , respectively .
Buffer overrun vulnerabilities represent a malicious form of this type of metaprogramming , when code is overwritten by data that exceeds the bounds of an unchecked buffer .
The Bourne shell and its descendants , ( including languages such as Perl , Ruby , Python , PHP , and JavaScript ) borrowed the verb “ eval ” from Lisp — but because they require its argument to be a string , the code must go through a text phase before being processed by the language ’s interpreter .
That text - to - code translation opens the door to vulnerabilities as well — if any of that text comes from a user , then it must be fully sanitized before it is evaluated .
Some languages that support reflection also allow for dynamic code generation .
For instance , the Microsoft .NET Framework includes the System .
Reflection .
Emit namespace that can be used to generate types and methods at runtime .
But it seems intentionally engineered to be difficult to use .
Reflection
Reflection constitutes another domain of metaprogramming .
It ’s the ability of a language to inspect its own code – most commonly , to determine what members a given class provides .
It can therefore be used to extend the programming language beyond its usual capabilities .
For instance , it ’s possible to implement a form of duck typing in C# by using reflection to look for a desired member function in an object ’s type , regardless of its inheritance hierarchy – and then execute it dynamically .
Altering language behavior
Perhaps the most radical form of metaprogramming involves changing what a given statement means .
Traditional object - oriented languages allow a limited form of verb redefinition by overriding virtual methods on derived classes – but more dynamic languages provide access to basic components of the language itself .
In Ruby and Python , for instance , a script can modify any class , even the core classes of the language , to add or replace functionality as desired .
This is sometimes called monkey patching or duck punching .
While its indiscriminate use can cause rampant confusion , when applied thoughtfully it can be exceptionally powerful .
Extending the language
Languages that provide a mechanism for macro expansion allow programmers to extend the syntax of the language .
In C , C++ , and Synergy / DE this is limited to parameterized replacement of identifiers at compile - time , but it can still be a powerful tool for adding domain - specific syntax .
Lisp macros , however , take this capability to a far greater level – because they are essentially generative : compile - time code can use the full power of the Lisp language itself to determine what runtime code gets generated .
That ’s perhaps the main reason why new Lispers find Lisp macros so hard to decipher : the compile - time macro code is in the same language as the run-time code it generates , rather than using a completely different syntax for text replacement like C’s #define .
In The Art of the Metaobject Protocol , Gregor Kiczales at al. describe modifications to the Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) to allow Lisp developers to alter and extend the behavior of the class mechanism itself .
For instance , when porting applications to CLOS from a different object system , it might be useful to override CLOS ’s class precedence ordering for multiple inheritance .
The Metaobject protocol provides acces to the class that represents classes themselves ( standard_class ) , as well as other classes that correspond to other components of the object system .
A developer can therefore extend one of these metaobject classes with a derived class that implements the behavior they desire , tweaking the rules of object - orientation itself without affecting the behavior of the default cases .
Domain - specific languages
Why do you need to be able to modify or extend a general purpose programming language ?
When working in a specific problem domain , the ability to write programs in a language that provides the same terminology and abstractions that domain experts use to describe the problem can improve both productivity and the quality of the end product .
But rather than creating a whole new language from scratch and writing a compiler or interpreter for it , why not extend an existing language ?
Much of the syntax that a DSL will require is general in nature – why reinvent that part ?
Dynamic programming languages allow you to add the syntax and features you need while still being able to take advantage of the generalized syntax and capabilities they already provide .
This post is part six of a series on the history of programming languages .

Online journalist of the year and Pulitzer prize winning author Chris Hedges spoke about his new book , Empire of Illusion , at the Berkeley Hillside Club July 21st , 2009 , at a benefit for KPFA .
Here are some of the things he said .
The tantalizing illusions offered by our consumer culture are vanishing as we barrel towards collapse .
The ability of the corporate state to pacify the country by extending credit and providing cheap manufactured goods to the masses is gone .
The pernicious idea that democracy lies in the choice between competing brands and the freedom to accumulate vast sums of personal wealth at the expense of others has collapsed .
The conflation of freedom with the free market has been exposed as a sham .
The travails of the poor are rapidly becoming the travails of the middle class , especially as the unemployment insurance runs out and people get a taste of Bill Clinton 's draconian welfare reform .
And class warfare , once buried under the happy illusion that we were all going to enter an age of prosperity through unfettered capitalism , is returning with a vengeance .
Our economic crisis , despite the corporate media circus surrounding the death of Michael Jackson or the marital infidelity of Governor Mark Sanford , barrels forward .
And this crisis will lead to a period of profound political turmoil and change .
Those who care about the plight of the working class and the poor must begin to mobilize quickly to abandon the two - party system , to build a viable socialism , or we will lose our last opportunity to save our embattled democracy .
Unfettered capitalism , as Ralph Nader told me the other day , is destroying the very socialism that is trying to save it .
We must wrest the organs of communication from the corporations that use mass media to demonize movements of social change and empower proto - fascist movements such as the Christian Right .
Multifaceted , multi-ethnic American culture was systematically destroyed in the 20th century by corporations .
These corporations used mass communication as well as an understanding of human psychology to turn consumption into an inner compulsion .
Old values of thrift , regional identity that had its own iconography , aesthetic expression and history , diverse and rich immigrant traditions , self sufficiency , a press that was decentralized to provide citizens with a voice in their own communities , were all destroyed to create mass corporate culture .
New desires and habits were implanted by corporate advertisers to replace the old .
Individual frustrations and discontent could be solved , corporate culture assured us , through the wonders of consumerism and cultural homogenization .
American culture , or cultures , was replaced with junk culture and junk politics .
Junk politics does not demand justice or the reparation of rights .
Junk politics personalizes and moralizes issues rather than clarifying them .
It is impatient with articulated conflict , enthusiastic about America 's optimism and moral character , and heavily dependent on " feel your pain " language and gesture -- as Benjamin DeMott noted in his book , Junk Politics : the Trashing of the American Mind ( http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-533910.html).
The result of junk politics is that nothing changes , meaning zero interruptions in the processes and practices that strengthen existing interlocking systems of socioeconomic advantage .
Junk Politics miniaturizes large complex problems at home while maximizing threats from abroad .
It is also given to abrupt unexplained reversals of its own public stances , often spectacularly bloating problems previously miniaturized .
And finally it seeks at every turn to obliterate voters ' consciousness of socioeconomic and other differences in their midst .
And now , standing on the ash heap , we survey the ruins .
The very slogans of advertising and mass culture have become the idiom of common expression , robbing us of the language to make sense of the destruction .
We confuse the manufactured commodity culture with American culture .
How will we cope with our decline ?
Will we cling to the absurd dreams of a superpower and the fantasies of a glorious tomorrow , or will we responsibly face our stark new limitations ?
Will we heed those who are sober and rational , those who speak of a new simplicity and humility , or will we follow the demagogues and charlatans who rise up in moments of crisis and panic to offer fantastic visions of revenge and moral renewal ?
Will we radically transform our system into one that protects the ordinary citizen and fosters the common good , that defies the corporate state , that dismantles empire , or will we employ the brutality and technology of our internal security and surveillance apparatus to crush all dissent and drive us into a new dark age ?

Computing Thoughts
Why ?
Language Archaeology ... and Metaprogramming
by Bruce Eckel
June 16 , 2009
I had no intention of committing to the time , money and travel necessary to meet three times a year , for a week each time , but the organizational meeting was in Washington DC and I was living in Pennsylvania at the time so I thought " what the heck , I 'll drive a few hours and check it out . "
Note :
My keynote at the upcoming EuroPython conference , June 30 - July 2 in Birmingham , UK will be on language archaeology .
I 'll also be giving a talk on Metaprogramming , sitting on a panel , and generally participating for the whole 3 days .
If you 're there , feel free to draft me for an open - spaces discussion , or start a hallway conversation -- I 'm going there because I want to talk about Python .
What I found at the C++ committee meeting were most of the smartest people in the C++ community , gathered together in one place , available to answer my questions .
I quickly realized this was far better than I could ever find in any graduate school program .
And if you factor in the opportunity costs of graduate school , a far better deal financially as well .
I was hooked , and kept attending for about 8 years .
The committee continued after I wandered away ; the standard had n't been completed yet but Java had appeared by that time and some others were also drifting off ( It 's the problem with being a technological stimulus junkie -- I do delve deep , but I 'm always looking for more productivity leverage so it's not too hard to distract me with promising language features ) .
Each time we met , I would show up with a list of the thorniest C++ questions that had accumulated for me in the interim .
I would usually have them all clarified within a couple of days .
That , and being exposed to upcoming features early , was the most valuable short - term benefit of being on the committee .
In the long term , watching the addition of language features into the C++ puzzle was deep learning .
It 's easy now to monday - morning quarterback and say that C++ sucks and was badly designed , and many people do so without any understanding of the constraints under which it was designed .
Whether or not it was entirely legitimate , Stroustrup 's constraint was that a C program should compile with either trivial or ( preferably ) no changes under C++.
This provided an easy evolution path for C programmers , but it was a big limitation and accounts for virtually every difficult feature that people complain about .
But because those features are hard to understand , many people jump to the conclusion that C++ was badly designed , which is far from the truth .
Java fed this perception with its cavalier attitude about language design .
I 've written about this in Thinking in Java and in many weblogs , so longtime followers already know that Java tweaked me the wrong way from the start , because of the dismissive attitude of Gosling and the language designers .
To be honest , my first " encounter " with Gosling left a bad taste in my mouth -- it was many years before , when I first began using Unix at one of the first companies I worked ( Fluke , which makes electronic test equipment ; I was doing embedded systems programming ) .
One of the other software engineers was coaching me and had guided me towards emacs .
But the only tool available in the company at that time was the commercial ( Unipress ) version of Gosling Emacs .
And if you did something wrong , the program would insult you by calling you a turkey and filling the screen with garbage .
This , in a commercial product for which the company had paid fair amounts of cash .
Needless to say , as soon as Gnu emacs became stable the company switched over to that ( I 've met Richard Stallman .
He 's crazy , sure .
But he 's wicked smart , and smart enough to know that when you are in trouble , you need help , lots of it , and not insults ) .
I have no idea how much this formative experience with Gosling influenced my later feelings about his work , but the fact that the attitude about C++ was " we looked at it and it sucked so we decided to whip out a language of our own " did n't help .
Especially when I began to tease it apart in the process of writing Thinking in Java and discovered , time after time , features and libraries where the decisions were slapdash -- indeed , most of these had to be repaired , sometimes after years of programmer suffering .
And on numerous occasions Gosling admitted that they had to cut corners to hurry and get it out or else the internet revolution would have passed them by .
So the reason I 'm giving this keynote is that I find it very helpful to understand why language features exist .
If they 're just handed to you on a platter by a college professor , you tend to develop a mythology around the language and to say " there 's some really important reason for this language feature that the smart people who created the language understand and that I do n't , so I 'll just take it on faith . "
And at some point , faith - based acceptance of language features is a liability ; it prevents you from being able to analyze and understand what 's going on .
In this keynote , I look at a number of features and examine how they are implemented in different languages , and why .
Here 's an example : object creation .
In C , you declare variables and the compiler creates stack space for you ( uninitialized , containing garbage unless you initialize it ) .
But if you want to do it dynamically , you must use the malloc ( ) and free ( ) standard library functions , and carefully perform all the initialization and cleanup by hand .
If you forget , you have memory leaks and similar disasters , which happened frequently .
Because malloc ( ) and free ( ) were " only " library functions , and confusing and scary at that , they often did n't get taught in basic programming classes like they should have .
And when programmers needed to allocate lots of memory , instead of learning about and dealing with these functions they would often ( I kid you not ) just allocate huge arrays of global variables , more than they ever thought they 'd need .
The program seemed to work , and no one would ever exceed those bounds anyway -- so when it did happen , years later , the program would break and some poor sod would have to go in and puzzle it out .
Stroustrup decided that dynamic allocation needed to be easier and safer -- it needed to be brought into the core of the language and not relegated to library functions .
And it needed to be coupled with the same guaranteed initialization and cleanup that constructors and destructors provide for all objects .
The problem was the same millstone that dogged all C++ decisions : backward compatibility with C. Ideally , stack allocation of objects could simply have been discarded .
But C compatibility required stack allocation , so there needed to be some way to distinguish heap objects from stack objects .
To solve this problem , the new keyword was appropriated from Smalltalk .
To create a stack object , you simply declare it , as in Cat x ; or , with arguments , Cat x ( " mittens " ) ; .
To create a heap object , you use new , as in new Cat ; or new Cat ( " mittens " ) ; .
Given the constraints , this is an elegant and consistent solution .
Enter Java , after deciding that everything C++ is badly done and overly complex .
The irony here is that Java could and did make the decision to throw away stack allocation ( pointedly ignoring the debacle of primitives , which I 've addressed elsewhere ) .
And since all objects are allocated on the heap , there 's no need to distinguish between stack and heap allocation .
They could easily have said Cat x = Cat ( ) or Cat x = Cat ( " mittens " ) .
Or even better , incorporated type inference to eliminate the repetition ( but that -- and other features like closures -- would have taken " too long " so we are stuck with the mediocre version of Java instead ; type inference has been discussed but I will lay odds it wo n't happen .
And should n't , given the problems in adding new features to Java ) .
Guido Van Rossum ( creator of Python ) took a minimalist approach -- the oft - lambasted use of whitespace is an example of how clean he wanted the language .
Since the new keyword was n't necessary , he left it out , so you say x = Cat ( " mittens " ) .
Ruby could have also used this approach , but one of Ruby 's main constraints is that it follows Smalltalk as much as possible , so in Ruby you say x = Cat.new ( " mittens " ) ( here 's a nice introduction to Ruby ) .
But Java made a point of dissing the C++ way of doing things , so the inclusion of the new keyword is a mystery .
My guess , after studying decisions made in the rest of the language , is that it just never occurred to them that they could get away without it .
So that 's what I mean about language archaeology .
I have a list of other features for similar analysis during the keynote .
I hope that people will come away with a better perspective on language design , and a more critical thought process when they are learning programming languages .
Story :
Okay , this is getting really good .
Dem Rep. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii is going to introduce a resolution on the House floor today that seems designed to put House GOPers who are flirting with birtherism in a jam .
The measure Abercrombie will introduce commemorates the 50th anniversary of Hawaii ’s statehood .
But here ’s the rub , his spokesman tells me :
It describes Hawaii as Barack Obama ’s birthplace .
" In the language of the resolution , there is a statement that Hawaii is the birthplace of the 44th President of the United States , " Abercrombie spokesman Dave Helfert confirms .
Hee .
The problem for the GOPers is obvious .
Vote for the resolution and anger your racist birther base , or vote against it and offend many of the remaining 75 % of non-insane Americans .
Of course , that did not enter into Rep. Abercrombie 's thinking .
How dare you impugn the motives of our fine congressman !
" Far be it from us to try to stir things up , " Helfert said puckishly .
" The president was born there , so what are you gonna do ?
Not mention it ? "
Indeed .
Have fun with that vote , GOPers .
For the rest of us :
Update : Rep. Abercrombie is introducing the resolution now !
Update : Chris Matthews will be addressing the birthers and Mike Stark 's video on Hardball !
Link to resolution .
Update : Crazy Lady Michelle Bachmann blocks the resolution for lack of quorum .
Final Update :
The bill passed with 378 votes .
There were n't any " no " votes .
“ I would love to make that movie next – it may be , it may not be .
I do n’t know yet , ” he said on break from editing his latest outing with Michael Myers .
“ It ’s sort of hanging out there .
It seems like , every year , it gets harder and harder to get a movie made .
Even if you ’re following up a hit , the studios – I do n’t know if it ’s the economy – but trying to get them to greenlight and loosen up the money is a f** kin ’ nightmare .
“ My Michael Myers is a totally different Michael Myers , so the rules of what has come before do n’t really apply to what I am trying to do with him . ”
Zombie continues .
“ I love the fact that he ’s big , and physical , and brutal .
He ’s like a bull in a china shop .
He ’s totally calm until that moment that his brain snaps and he ’s just beyond vicious .
He ’s much more brutal this time around .
Michael ’s insane .
I ’ve always played him as if he is completely insane .
He lives in a different reality than the rest of the world does .
What he sees and hears and does has no basis in normalcy .
In this movie I just wanted to mess a bit with the way that he perceives the world .
What he sees has no reality to it . ”
has revealed a new poster for “ ” ( AKA “ “ ) , courtesy of his MySpace Blog .
The poster in a blue shade gives a more up - close shot of , the villain who is made more human - like than other “ Halloween ” series .
Earlier this week , Zombie sat down with Ryan Rotten , of STYD , to talk the sequel .
When asked about his previous projectbeing shifted to the side in favor of H2 , the director was surprisingly honest about the current mindset within studio circles .
He also sat down with Uncle Creepy over at Dread Central to talk his vision of Michael Myers differing from Carpenter ’s original films .
The film will pick up at the exact moment the first movie stopped and follow the aftermath of Michael Myers murderous rampage through the eyes of heroine Laurie Strode .
“ Halloween 2 ” is scheduled to hit theaters on August 28th .
Tehran has blamed the US and UK for post-election unrest Five out of nine local staff from the UK embassy detained in Tehran have been released , Iranian officials say .
Iran 's media earlier said local employees at the UK mission were held over their role in protests against June 's disputed presidential election .
UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband has dismissed the allegations as baseless .
Separately , Iran 's top legislative body began a partial recount of the poll - a move rejected by defeated opposition candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi .
There is no plan at the moment to close any embassy or downgrade ties with them
Hassan Ghashghavi , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
" Out of nine people , five of them have been released and the rest are being interrogated , " Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Ghashghavi said at a news conference , state television Press TV reported .
Iran 's Intelligence Minister Gholam - Hoseyn Mohseni-Ezhei on Sunday said " the British embassy played a crucial role in the recent unrest both through its local staff and via media " , Iran 's Irna news agency reported .
" We have photos and videos of certain local employees of the British embassy , who collected news about the protests .
" The embassy sent staff among the rioters to direct them in order to escalate the riots so that the rioters could file fabricated reports about the [ rallies ] to the world from various locations , " the Iranian minister added .
' Unjustified ' Britain has protested strongly over the arrests , which have now been been confirmed by the BBC .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown told a news conference in London that Iran 's behaviour was " unacceptable , unjustified and without foundation " .
Standing alongside his Swedish counterpart and President of the EU Commission , Fredrik Reinfeldt , Mr Brown also thanked the EU for " its support and solidarity " .
On Sunday , the European Union warned Iran that " harassment or intimidation " of embassy staff would be met with a " strong and collective " response .

The British foreign office has not said what the four staff still in custody do at the embassy , but the BBC understands that one of them has the job of reviewing local news sources and keeping abreast of political developments , our Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen in Tehran says .
He says that none of the nine who were detained has dual Iranian - British nationality .
Despite the releases , the fact that some employees are still being held means the issue remains a serious problem for the UK , our editor adds .
IRAN UNREST 12 June Presidential election saw incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad re-elected with 63 % of vote Main challenger Mir Hossein Mousavi called for result to be annulled for electoral fraud Street protests saw at least 17 people killed and foreign media restricted
Your questions answered Q&A : Election aftermath How Iran is ruled Who 's who in Iran Send us your comments Iran has repeatedly accused foreign powers - especially Britain and the US - of meddling after the 12 June election .
The poll was won by a landslide by incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , but his opponents said the victory was achieved by massive fraud .
Some 17 people are thought to have died in subsequent street protests .
In the fallout from the crisis , Tehran has expelled two British diplomats and the UK has responded with a similar measure .
However , Mr Ghashghavi said on Monday that " there is no plan at the moment to close any embassy or downgrade ties with them " .
Some 17 people are thought to have died in street protests after the disputed presidential poll , which the opposition complains was rigged .
At least 1,000 opposition supporters are reported to have staged a noisy rally outside a mosque in Tehran on Sunday evening before it was broken up by police and militia .
Riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse the crowd outside the Ghoba Mosque , Iranian eyewitnesses said .
The report could not be independently verified because of reporting restrictions on foreign media .
Poll verdict due
In a separate development , Iran 's state TV said the recount had started on Monday in the capital Tehran as well as in the provinces .
Iran 's Guardian Council has offered to recount a random 10 % of the votes from the election .
The process was expected to be completed later on Monday and the result would be announced shortly afterwards , al - Alam television said .
But Mr Mousavi insists the poll was rigged and therefore should be annulled .
On Sunday , Mr Mousavi met members of a committee set up by the Guardian Council to examine the disputed poll , Iran 's semi-official Fars news agency reported .
It said Mr Mousavi was expected to present his proposal on the issue , without giving any further details .

A couple of weeks ago , some members of Congress let it be known that Leon Panetta , the director of the C.I.A. , had confessed something to them .
Panetta said that there had been a program that the C.I.A. should have told Congress about almost eight years earlier but had n’t .
He had just learned about it , and had ordered the program ended .
Naturally , people wanted to know what the big secret was .
The C.I.A. and members of Congress said that they could n’t tell , but soon enough there were reports that , as the Times put it last week ,
Since 2001 , the Central Intelligence Agency has developed plans to dispatch small teams overseas to kill senior Qaeda terrorists .
The officials who confirmed this for the Times also told reporters that “ the plans remained vague and were never carried out … .
Yet year after year , according to officials briefed on the program , the plans were never completely shelved . ”
People also remembered that Seymour M. Hersh had said or written something about this .
His reference to an “ executive assassination ring , ” which he made at an event in Minnesota with Walter Mondale , of all people , was picked up widely .
Hersh urged anyone who asked to look at what he ’d actually written about the Bush Administration and assassination .
That sounded useful , so I went back and read his stories again .
HUNTER -KILLER TEAMS
Let ’s start with motive .
In “ What Went Wrong , ” in the October 8 , 2001 , issue — on newsstands October 1 , 2001 , and reported as the dust was still settling at Ground Zero —a “ C.I.A. man ” spoke to Hersh about the need to consider tactics that “ defy the American rule of law ” :
“ We need to do this — knock them down one by one , ” he said .
“ Are we serious about getting rid of the problem — instead of sitting around making diversity quilts ? ”
Hersh picked up the story in “ Manhunt , ” in the December 23 & 30 , 2002 , issue .
The piece began with the killing , by Hellfire missile , of an Al Qaeda leader named Qaed Salim Sinan al - Harethi .
At the time , Bush Administration officials told reporters that Harethi was on a list of “ ‘ high - value ’ targets whose elimination , by capture or death , had been called for by President Bush . ”
A Yemeni official told Hersh that in the course of the operation
there had been two intelligence “ mistakes ” that almost resulted in targeting innocent Bedouins .
Hersh went on ,
The al - Harethi operation also marked a dramatic escalation of the American war on terrorism .
For more than a generation , state - endorsed assassination has been anathema in the United States .
In 1975 , after revelations of C.I.A. efforts in the nineteen - sixties to kill Fidel Castro and other hostile foreign leaders , a Senate committee led by Frank Church concluded that such plotting “ violates moral precepts fundamental to our way of life . ” …
In 1976 , President Gerald Ford signed an executive order banning political assassination , and that order remains in force .
In the aftermath of September 11th , however , the targeting and killing of individual Al Qaeda members without juridical process has come to be seen within the Bush Administration as justifiable military action in a new kind of war , involving international terrorist organizations and unstable states .
On July 22nd , [ 2002 , ] Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld issued a secret directive ordering Air Force General Charles Holland , the four - star commander of Special Operations , “ to develop a plan to find and deal with members of terrorist organizations . ”
He added , “ The objective is to capture terrorists for interrogation or , if necessary , to kill them , not simply to arrest them in a law - enforcement exercise . ”
The manhunt would be global in its reach , Rumsfeld wrote , and Holland was to cut through the Pentagon bureaucracy and process deployment orders “ in minutes and hours , not days and weeks . ”
Hersh wrote that many of those he spoke to in the military and the intelligence communities

Dear Senator Schumer ,
You recently approached SEC head Mary Schapiro with some very valid concerns about Flash trading , and the potential for investor abuse by advance looks to select market participants ahead of the general order pool .
Your crusade was subsequently enjoined by such equity market luminaries as Robert Greifeld , president and CEO of the Nasdaq Stock Market , who had this to say regarding not just Flash trades in particular , but numerous other components of market topology , whose sole purpose is to obfuscate natural order flow and to provide loopholes for dominant market players to extract inefficiencies ( i.e. , scalp regular investors ) arising from established and SEC - endorsed mechanisms of efficient market circumvention :
" Flash orders , which are a fundamental part of high - frequency trading , are but one symptom of the current evolving market structure .
Nasdaq OMX is concerned that the securities industry appears willing to accept more and more ‘ darkness ’ and limits on the availability of order information .
Instead , the policy goal should be clear : to eliminate any order types or market structure policies that do not contribute to public price formation and market transparency . ”
" The industry has a unique opportunity at this time to take a hard look at dark order types and the underlying market structure issues that do not support public price information . ”
Senator Schumer , while Zero Hedge applauds your initiative , the truth is that the wrongdoing in the context of potential investor market abuse runs far deeper and is much more pervasive than you realize .
And while one can highlight the merits of the Op - Ed published in the New York Times earlier by quant titan Paul Wilmott entitled " Hurrying Into The Next Panic " ( a recommended read for you and your staff ) , which notes numerous frightening implications brought about by the domination of Hiqh Frequency Trading , let us stick within the context of advance looks , which is at the basis of your letter seeking the ban of Flash - like behavior .
Zero Hedge would like to highlight that while your letter to Mary Schapiro indicated your concern with such market actors as DirectEdge , BATS and Nasdaq , the truth is there are substantially larger and more dangerous " fish " on which you should focus your attention .
As a primary example , I would like to refer you to Goldman Sachs ' dark pool , SIGMA X .
As evidence I present an analytical paper prepared by none other than Goldman Sachs , compliments of the Bank Holdings Company 's GSET ( Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading ) division .
While I recommend you read the full report and other related literature ( especially if you wish to understand why VWAP or Volume - Weighted Average Price is such a critical concept in modern trading ) , I would like to bring your attention to page 6 of this report , and in particular the following sections :
" The child orders generated by Goldman Sachs algorithms interact with SIGMA X liquidity . " ... and... " When a client routes a marketable order through SIGMA , the smart router first exposes the order to SIGMA X liquidity . "
This basically means that as a Goldman algo strategy splits an incoming block trade into smaller ( child ) components , these orders will first be advance - exposed to Goldman 's own prop strategies which get a " first look " ( no pun intended ) at the order flow to dispose of as they desire .
Additionally , due to the flashing advance window , Goldman implicitly knows in advance of a potential spike in order flow - in other words if there is a size buyer or seller of any given particular stock - an incalculable edge in today 's market , allowing one to potentially take advantage ( frontrun ) of forced buyins and unwinds and major block trades .
This provides the firm with a material advantage over other market participants .
In order to get a sense of the size of this potential abuse , as Goldman itself discloses , SIGMA X traded over 123 million ( matched - only , single counted ) shares daily in May , over 600 million per week .
This is a staggering amount of shares over a cumulative extended period of time , and could potentially provide the firm with a substantial unfair advantage over other participants .
Furthermore , Goldman is a dominant Program Trading market player on the New York Stock Exchange , by virtue of its participation in the NYSE 's Supplemental Liquidity Provider program .
As publicly disclosed , Goldman traded over 796 million principal shares ( for its own benefit , not as an agent ) in the prior week alone , almost double the next largest market participant Credit Suisse which traded a total volume of just over 420 million shares .
Whether or not Goldman can implicitly take advantage of the advance looks Goldman receives compliments of its own dark pool , SIGMA X , and then subsequently reroutes this informational advantage to trades executed on the NYSE , and other exchanges and ECNs , is also a very pertinent question .
However , even if acting in a vaccum exclusively within the confines of SIGMA X , Goldman 's modus operandi begs the question : if , as your letter discloses , you believe Flash - like behavior is a detriment to investors , we encourage your team to focus its attention on this matter .
The potential abuse in the context of SIGMA X , is substantial , and much more so if it is not confined to the dark pool exclusively .
In conclusion , SIGMA X was conceived and brought to market via Spear , Leeds and Kellogg : I would like to present to you the form contract with Goldman that new customers have to sign when they agree to engage SLK for any client purposes .
I bring your attention to the highlighted area :

In case readers are having trouble grabbing the original document , here is the link to the file saved internally .
England footballer Steven Gerrard launched a volley of uppercut punches at a man in a row over music , a court heard today .
The millionaire star " totally lost it " and attacked Marcus McGee , 34 , " with the style and speed of a professional boxer " in a 2 am bar brawl , it is alleged .
Gerrard was at the Lounge Inn in Southport , Merseyside on 29 December to celebrate Liverpool 's 5 - 1 demolition of Newcastle United hours earlier .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Reds ' captain , who scored twice in the game , was enjoying a night out with a party of friends including Anfield legend Kenny Dalglish , 58 .
But trouble flared when Mr McGee refused to hand over a card controlling the CD player .
The victim was in charge of music for the venue after being given the card to pick songs for a staff party in an adjacent room to Gerrard 's group .
David Turner QC , prosecuting , told Liverpool Crown Court Gerrard asked McGee for the card , saying : " Here y'are lad .
Give me that lad . "
Mr Turner said : " Mr McGee took offence at his attitude and the expression ' lad ' and he refused .
" Not many people on Merseyside , or indeed anywhere else , would refuse a request from Steven Gerrard but Mr McGee did .
" There can be no doubt that this refusal astounded Steven Gerrard .
" He walked away back to his party but the CCTV shows how much his mood had changed .
" He was no longer the centre of that high - spirited party .
" He was clearly walking around pondering , musing over what had happened - about the man who said ' no ' to Steven Gerrard . "
Several minutes later CCTV showed Gerrard returning to the victim who was sitting alone at the bar and allegedly confronting him with the words : " Who the f*** do you think you are ? "
Mr McGee stood up and the pair were head to head , Mr Turner said , " in the sort of hostile confrontation that is often seen between professional footballers " .

The barrister added : " Steven Gerrard had clearly lost his cool : he was angry with Marcus McGee . "
CCTV footage of the attack
The situation attracted the millionaire 's friends .
One , John Doran , who has admitted affray , pushed McGee away but " could not resist following through with his right elbow into Mr McGee 's face " , said Mr Turner .
" We say at this stage Gerrard totally lost it .
" Almost immediately after the blow from John Doran , in fact within seconds , Steven Gerrard joined in the attack with a succession of well aimed uppercut punches delivered with the style and speed of a professional boxer rather than a professional footballer . "
In police interview Gerrard said he punched Mr McGee because he believed he was going to be attacked .
But warning the seven women and five men of the jury , Mr Turner said : " If you consider Steven Gerrard was or even may have been acting in self defence you will acquit .
" But we say on this occasion Steven Gerrard 's fists , not his feet , did the talking .
" This was never self defence in a hundred years . "
Gerrard sat in the dock throughout the proceedings listening carefully and looking straight ahead .
As well as Doran , of Woodlands Road , Huyton , Merseyside , five other men admitted affray .
They were Accrington Stanley footballers Robert Grant , 19 , of Enstone Avenue , Litherland , and Ian Dunbavin , 28 , of Guildford Road , Southport .
Ian Gerrard Smith , 19 , of Hilary Avenue , and Paul McGrattan , 31 , of Linden Drive , both Huyton , admitted affray .
John McGrattan , 34 , of Rimmer Avenue , Huyton , admitted threatening behaviour after denying affray .
Proceedings will resume tomorrow morning when it is expected Mr McGee will give evidence .
Obama may face a fight in his attempt to get his reforms through US President Barack Obama has pledged to push through a health reform package by the end of the year that would reduce health costs , increase choice and widen coverage .
Mr Obama has made the issue a top priority of his first year in office , but with lawmakers struggling to reach agreement , it may prove one of his biggest challenges .
Here , readers from the US debate the reform package , give their verdict on whether they support it or not and describe some of the own healthcare experiences .
SUPPORT OBAMA'S HEALTH REFORMS
I believe that President Obama is on the right track .
Something has to be done about healthcare in the United States .
There are too many uninsured and too many underinsured , especially now that the recession has taken hold .
This is a necessary topic that needs to see action as soon as possible .
My hope is that Obama is able to push it through by the end of the year , and I have full faith in him that he will do what is best for the American people .
There are too many band - aids trying to cover the bullet wounds in the current system and it is time for change .

Not only has this ruined us but we can't afford continuing care .
If Obama does nothing I have to watch us continue to lose everything and watch my mother get sicker and sicker because we can't afford to keep her alive .
I lost my grandmother because we could n't afford the treatments to keep her alive and I wo n't lose my mother , because my nation says we are too poor to deserve life .
We all sat down at the television with our breaths held praying that Obama would fight for us at that health care press conference .
He needs to save us all .
Joshua , Sanford , Florida , USA
There is no question of not having universal healthcare coverage , which is not a privilege but a right in the richest country on earth .
If the bill is not passed for preventative health care , the financial health of this country will be doomed forever .
There is no other choice , whether you like it or not .
Satish , Media , USA I hope President Obama is able to push through his plans for health reform .
We need to come up to the standard of the rest of the industrialised world , as far as healthcare is concerned .
Conservatives , Republicans and the health insurance industry have so far given us a joke of a system that kills people every week , and does n't work well for anyone other than the rich .
Their lies and hatred of the rest of the country may well kill this very badly needed reform , to the detriment of the US as a whole .
Glen , St Louis , USA I think the president is correct and is heading in the right direction .
A country like the US needs a universal health plan , if it is going to continue to be a leading economy and be competitive with other emerging countries like China , Russia , and India .
The problem is that rich Americans are used to paying little tax while the middle class pay for most of the services in the US .
I think it is time to correct this issue once for all .
Alemayehu Haile , Atlanta , USA Healthcare reform is absolutely necessary .
Health insurance is really no insurance , as insurers refuse to cover people with existing conditions , and find ways to deny coverage for more and more conditions , medications , and treatments .
Healthcare providers are just as much at the mercy of the insurance companies as are the people who need care .
The health care situation is , in reality , much more damaging to Americans than any other factor and Obama is right and moral to tackle this problem .
Some people in the legislature ( Republicans ) care much more about power , and putting Obama down , than they do about American people .
Obama 's principles are sound , but the current healthcare insurance industry is a paperwork - laden juggernaut that will be hard to stop .
A Sievert , Bloomington , Indiana , USA
We absolutely need healthcare reform , so that we Americans can receive the same level of care available to most Europeans .
Our infant mortality rate is one of the highest among developed nations , yet many Americans are unaware of this .
I expect the Houses of Congress will pass some watered - down , substandard plan that bleeds the middle class without meeting its goals .
There is a stubborn streak in American thought that insists that those citizens who are not successful are somehow fully deserving of the penury in which they live , despite evidence to the contrary .
In spite of our claims to a moral high ground , the United States is , in the final analysis , a nation with little mercy .
Cameron Williams , Brooklyn , NY , United States I have been without insurance for 10 years .
I have pre-existing conditions and insurance companies wo n't insure me .
I am unable to get healthcare or medicine .
The insurance industry is very powerful and they have many politicians in their pockets .
The rich ( Republicans ) are happy with their insurance and low taxes .
Right wing mouthpieces , such as multimillionaire Rush Limbaugh , are accusing President Obama of socialism .
I believe the president and Congress will provide a healthcare plan by the end of the year that will cover every citizen .
It is absolutely essential that all US citizens receive healthcare .
Georeg Jump , Montross , USA I have worked in the American healthcare system for 32 years .
There is so much money wasted in our current system .
I am proud of President Obama for doing what is right for the American people .
A public option and a system to regulate the insurance companies is exactly what is needed .
Whitney Rill , Grand Rapids , USA OPPOSE OBAMA'S HEALTH REFORMS
I am definitely not in favour of the president 's plan .
Over 85 % of Americans currently have healthcare they are satisfied with and to overhaul the system for 15 % of the population is ludicrous .
And to further tax people at a time of severe economic distress is totally irresponsible .
The idea that it will only be a tax on " millionaires " is laughable .
It will hit the middle class without a doubt .
This president is trying to break America .
Debra Heiniger , Kansas City , MO , USA I 'm appalled at Obama 's claim that huge numbers of Americans do not have access to healthcare .
A blatant lie , as every hospital is obliged to care for everyone , even illegals that come to their door .
Indignant persons simply do not pay their bill , which is eventually written off as uncollectable .
Large numbers of people , especially immigrants who could pay , choose not to obtain healthcare insurance and rely on receiving guaranteed care for free .
We have choice .
We do n't want change .
Allan and Dolores Baumgartner , San Jose , California , USA
The entire idea that the government is somehow responsible for the individual is a dangerous and wrong direction for our republic to move in .
Our president is already hell bent on spending money that he does n't have , supported by a people that should be standing up and screaming " stop this madness " !
Bret Dukelow , Chesapeake , Virginia , USA
It will absolutely not work .
Nowhere in the US Constitution is the Federal government given the power to set up a government - run healthcare system or health insurance system .
All powers not specifically granted to the Federal government in the Constitution are reserved for individual states .
This is a power - grab by Obama to continue his quest to transform our republic into a socialist country , along with the unconstitutional bail - outs of the insurance and automotive industries .
David Zimlin , Dunedin , Florida , USA Obama keeps painting everything as a crisis , like someone with ADD .
I do n't get it - one of the biggest changes ever and he wants it pushed through without a thorough review ?
It is quite apparent it is his way or nothing .
He does not take any criticism well and instead states it is only for his opponents ' political gain .
This issue is too big to be treated as another " crisis " for him to tackle .
It should not be pushed through the House without a thorough examination .
Cheri , South Carolina , USA Obama 's healthcare plan is a disaster in the making .
Although he claims it will broaden choice , what he failed to mention is that under the terms of the bill , private insurance companies will no longer be able to sign new contracts .
What a blow to the concept of liberty and freedom .
Nathan , Bethlehem , Connecticut , USA Creating a socialist nation one bill at a time .
That is all this president is trying to accomplish .
This drive towards " universal " healthcare is the next step in tearing down the United States of America , the first being the " bail - out " .
If you you can't afford something , then why should you have it ?
If your business fails , why should I , via my taxes , pay to keep you in business ?
Adam , Indianapolis , Indiana , USA
It is a sham .
Too big , too much hidden inside .
Obama and our politicians say they want reform .
But if they truly wanted reform it would be in a series of smaller legislations , each addressing one of the issues causing the problem .
Back in the 1980s the Grace Commission Report convened under President Regan identified many of the specifics which needed to be addressed so as to bring down cost .
Just two of the many suggestions - reform the tort system and standardise paperwork - would save billions of dollars .

This is good news :
A federal judge in June threw out seizure of three fake passports from a traveler , saying that TSA screeners violated his Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure .
Congress authorizes TSA to search travelers for weapons and explosives ; beyond that , the agency is overstepping its bounds , U.S. District Court Judge Algenon L. Marbley said .
“ The extent of the search went beyond the permissible purpose of detecting weapons and explosives and was instead motivated by a desire to uncover contraband evidencing ordinary criminal wrongdoing , ” Judge Marbley wrote .
In the second case , Steven Bierfeldt , treasurer for the Campaign for Liberty , a political organization launched from Ron Paul ’s presidential run , was detained at the St. Louis airport because he was carrying $ 4,700 in a lock box from the sale of tickets , T - shirts , bumper stickers and campaign paraphernalia .
TSA screeners quizzed him about the cash , his employment and the purpose of his trip to St. Louis , then summoned local police and threatened him with arrest because he responded to their questions with a question of his own :
What were his rights and could TSA legally require him to answer ?
[…]
Mr. Bierfeldt ’s suit , filed in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia , seeks to bar TSA from “ conducting suspicion - less pre-flight searches of passengers or their belongings for items other than weapons or explosives . ”
1. I 'm Sadek Drobi .
I 'm here with Paul Hudak , at QCon San Francisco .
Paul , why do n't you tell us about yourself and what you 've been up to ?
First , thanks for having me here .
Eric
Meijer invited me to give a talk here and I 've known Eric from many years back , when were involved in the early golden years of functional programming .
I 've been at Yale for 26 years now and things are going very well and I still do Haskell and functional programming research and that 's why I 'm here .
2 . I read your book about Haskell and , surprisingly , you do n't talk about type classes and monads until late in the book .
Do you think that this is the way to learn Haskell ?
Yes , the fact that I wrote the book that way means that that was what I thought would be the best way to teach those concepts , but the reason for teaching monads later rather than earlier is that I figured most people reading the book would already have some experience with imperative programming and would expect to see some kind of notion of imperative computation somewhere .
I actually introduced that very early .
That is introduced , I think , in the 3rd chapter or so , out of 20 some chapters , but I just call them actions .
I refer to them as IO actions and that , I think , people who have familiarity with imperative programming , have no trouble with .
What I did n't introduce early was the notion of formally what a monad is and , of course , to do that you also have to know what typed classes are to really do it in the most generic sense .
I did n't even use the work " monad " early in the book because it's a scary word and there is this running joke in the functional programming community , that we should have called them " warm fuzzy things " from the very beginning instead of monads and maybe that 's right - I do n't know .
That 's one thing , but in the case of typed classes , I actually think I could have introduced the notion of the context of a typed class earlier than I did and earlier than the formal introduction of what a typed class is .
In other words , if you look at the type signature of a function that has a context or constraint on it , that relates to a typed class , that idea you can actually introduce before you introduce what a typed class declaration is and what instance declarations are and so forth .
I think it might have been a good idea to do that , because one of the complaints that I hear from people - not just using my book , but people learning Haskell - is you get type errors , you get errors in your programs and the error messages are naturally going to refer to typed classes and whatever .
And if you do n't understand those error messages , then you 're out of luck .
I probably do that a little differently if I rewrote the book .
Going back to the original question :
Yes , that was all done on purpose .
3 . We are seeing that Haskell in inspiring the mainstream languages .
I mean we see that Philip Wadler designed Generics for Java and Eric Meijer is doing a huge work for Microsoft , for the .NET platform .
Is into this a success for Haskell ?
I think it 's a great success .
I do n't think that a language has to be measured in the dimension of success by just on how well the language itself is being used or accepted or whatever .
I think its impact on other languages or programming systems in general is great .
There are lots of examples of that kind on language design , including new languages created from scratch recently , like Scala .
The other thing is that I hear this over and over again , in fact I just heard it over lunch , is that someone says " I 've been programming in Haskell ; I do n't use it in my every day programming , but I love the language .
I do n't use it at work , but I understand it and I appreciate the ideas and I 'm finding that it 's affecting how I program in Java or how I program in C# " and that 's pretty cool .
I feel good about Haskell .
I think , especially in recent years , I think it 's safe to say that it 's a success .
Even if it was to completely die at this point , its influence has already manifested itself .
I 'm not saying we are going to quit and go home now , but it's is a success .
I think so .
4 . Do you see in Haskell a programming language for research to inspire other languages , which it already done as a goal or it can be really used in the Mainstream for Enterprise , as software ?
It can definitely be used in the Mainstream and it is being used in the Mainstream .
It 's being used more and more in the Mainstream .
Finally , we have the libraries and the implementations and the programming environments to support it better in the Mainstream .
That was an impediment for a long time , but people like Simon Peyton Jones and his group at Microsoft have done an unbelievable job creating the tools that people need to use the languages in industries .
It used to be we would worry about performance as a big problem in addition and the compilers are getting better and better , as well , so I really see no reason not to use Haskell , to be honest .
We are starting to see more and more people use it , so who knows ?
5 . Can you tell us more about high order programming ?
Can I tell you more about high - order programming ?
It is a frame of mind , it is a way of thinking .
It is a way of understanding that everything is first class .
When you do something at one level , you can abstract it away to a higher level .
Once you get that idea , then it pops up everywhere .
If I were to suddenly not be able to use Haskell or be forced to use say Java or C# - although those languages are now moving more in the functional direction - it would n't be so much the types I would miss or the lazy evaluation , but I could just absolutely not survive without high order functions .
It 's just a critical abstraction to computation and it leads into such great ways of thinking about problems and writing programs , that I do n't see how people get by without higher order functions .
I could do without , I would miss the other features , but not high order functions .
When you say " high order programming " , of course that can mean other things as well .
There are high order types and so forth and Haskell has also gotten actually a little bit crazy lately with its typed system and high orderedness , if you will .
We are only recently discovering the power of that .
I do n't think that we 've seen the end of the story there .
High order functions are pretty straight forward in the sense that once you have lambda , you can abstract away everything .
The typed system things are n't quite as easy because of decidability issues and other things .
I do n't think we have the design quite right yet , and there are still extensions and ideas being developed and so forth .
Nevertheless , as we have moved into the high order types , the power of them is also becoming evident there and it's clear that it 's something that we want and we are going to continue to develop and who knows where it will end up ?
6 . When we talk about function and high order functions , we talk also about functional interactive animations .
Can you explain us more about this ?
Animations , in a graphic sense are one kind of what we call an instance of functional reactive programming in general .
This idea is due to Conal Elliott originally and when he brought the ideas over to Haskell , we started to collaborate a bit and developed FRAN , which is a functional reactive animation language .
At Yale , we also started looking at other applications of the idea , because it is a very general idea and Connell knew this at the very at the very outset , although he is main application originally was animation .
We took the idea and went into robotics and now we are doing signal processing and sound synthesis - we 've used it for parallel programming .
It 's a pretty powerful and general idea and it basically begins with the idea that , instead of thinking as values , as variables in a program as being static , so that a given variable exe has the same value in this iteration of the loop or in this invocation of this function or recursion , that you actually think of it as constantly at every infinitesimal change in time as changing so , it is truly a continuous value .
That 's the abstraction that we tried to present .
Of course , that 's not how we implement it underneath , but when you do that , so many things fall naturally into that paradigm , just to give you a quick example besides animation .
An image is normally thought of as a static value , but a time varying image is an animation .
There are tons of other examples and the one that we are using very recently is in graphical user interfaces and in particular in the context of music or sounds synthesis doing computer music applications .
You very typically have knobs and sliders that represent values that control some sound .
That 's just one of these signals - as we call them - or behaviors .
It 's a time varying quantity it 's captured very elegantly in this Framework and when you just lift everything up , every operation you do , whether it be addition or other arithmetic operations , but also stateful operations like integration or differentiation , you get a very different style of programming .
The real challenge becomes - when the whole world is n't always continuous - how do you integrate that with the fact that there are things that happen at discrete moments in time .
You do click a mouse or you do press a key - and how was all that integrated .
To do that , it turns out there is a very elegant way to do it , which is to introduce a notion of a discrete event , but to think of these events are now of being streams of events - just like we had continuously changing values , now we have a continuous stream of potential events .
You develop operators that will allow you to mediate between the discrete and the continuous and you have what we call switchers , that , on the basis of an event calls continuous behaviors to change .
It works out very nicely - creates a very high order way of programming .
To implement it in Haskell , you just absolutely depend on things like high order functions , but not just to implement it , but actually conceptualize it .
It 's the right way to think about it .
And it works out very nicely .
7 . You said a stream of events can then be applied to web applications as we know they are user events or other GUIS that we deal with in the Enterprise ?
Yes , I think so .
There has been a lot of recent work in that area .
I know I 'm not nearly an expert enough to comment very deeply on the issue , but all the same concepts that we were talking about , including the fact that you want web applications to be stateless , fit in very nicely into this model , including the idea of a continuation based notion of a web application falls in very naturally with this model .
As I said , people are still developing those sorts of things .
One of the areas that I find interesting in that is not just web applications , but Internet transactions in general , where you have overlapping , you have very timing oriented sequence of events , you may have things happening concurrently and something might time out or something might happen that causes you to want to cancel other things that have been going on .
That introduces very quickly another important thing that 's going on in the Haskell community and that is concurrency .
One of the pleasant surprises that came out of dealing with all of the problems you have in implementing high order functions and those sorts of things , is that , by the time you have all those mechanisms in place , adding concurrency turns out to be trivial .
Because just to deal with lazy evaluation in high order functions you have to have a way to encapsulate computation , suspensions , delays - whatever you want to call them - , closures .
Once you have that mechanism in place , then concurrency is just another form of that idea .
Simon Peyton Jones and his group have done a great job providing a thread library for Haskell that makes that kind of stuff really easy .
8 . What is the difference between functional abstraction power and OOP , the object oriented one ?
They are very different .
There is a lot of baggage that comes with OOP that does n't really exist so much in the functional world .
It gets a little bit confusing in the sense that Haskell 's typed classes are classes in an object oriented sense , but there is no state associated with them .
I think one of the problems with OOP languages - and this is just my personal opinion - is that they confuse several different kinds of issues and I do n't think the perfect OOP language has been designed .
They are too easily confused issues of state , issues of encapsulation , issues of objects and inheritance and you see objects being used therefore in languages such as Java in lots of different ways .
The fact that they are being used for really different conceptual ideas , means that maybe there is something not quite right there .
Again , that 's just my opinion and I do n't think that learning object oriented programming is easy .
In fact , I 've taught Java and C# enough at Yale to know that it 's not easy and I know where students get confused .
There is a sort of trend recently in teaching these languages to demphasize the object oriented aspects of these languages until later in the semester - at least - so that students can grab the basic ideas of computation first .
Obviously , there are some good ideas in object oriented programming , as well and I do n't mean to minimize that .
In order to achieve certain kinds of effects , such as inheritance , in a functional language one has to work a little bit harder .
You can simulate it with high order functions and I have done that , I do it in my computer music library HasKore , for example .
It could perhaps be expressed more easily in an object oriented language , which is n't to say that I would be ready to switch over to object oriented languages , but there are some good things there .
9 . Today , we will see more and more applications of monads .
I mean monads came , for some people , as a weird concept and now , just after some years , it 's been applied in Mainstream like in LINQ and other things .
Do you think that monads are the new API abstraction that can be used everywhere ?
Certainly , they can be used wherever they are appropriate to be used .
Trying to understand monads well enough to understand where they 're appropriate use and where they 're not is one of the challenges and to be able to teach people the skills in doing that and get them to understand what a monad really is .
Unfortunately , a lot of people think of or pretty much equate monads with what is known as a state monad - a particular kind of monad - because it relates most strongly to IO and imperative computation , but state monad is just one kind of monad .
Getting a good handle on really what the abstract notion of a monad is , I think is a challenge .
That said , I do think that monads should be understood and can have an impact in helping people understand their software , but there are things even beyond monads .
So , the really important thing to understand is that a monad is capturing , in some sense , an abstract kind of computation and that computation can be described very formally in terms of the monadic operators and the monadic laws , but it 's not the only kind of computation .
For example , a more recent thing that has become popular in certain contexts is something known as arrows , which is an idea due to John Hughes .
Arrows can be seen as a generalization of monads .
You can encode any monad as an arrow , but not the other way around .
Haskell now , actually also in addition to the monad syntax , has arrow syntax .
So , here we go : we have yet another abstract computation .
We need to understand it , we need to understand when it 's appropriate to use a monad , when it 's appropriate to use an arrow .
Of course , the question naturally arises " Is there something else ? "
There are other things .
Applicative functors is another example of something that 's actually moving in the other direction - it's an even simpler concept , simpler than monads - that is more appropriate in certain contexts .
There are certain contexts where one 's tendency might be " Oh , I 'm going to use a monad ! "
When it turns out an applicative functor would have done just fine , and the applicative functor has a simpler set of algebraic laws .
It 's a simpler set of operators , it 's easier to use in some sense , so it would make more sense to just use that .
Why use a sledgehammer to crack an egg ?
At the same time , someone may have an application that really demands an arrow and instead they are trying to force a monad into it and then you end up with something that either does n't work or is n't able to express what you want .
Coming to grips will all that , the functional programming community itself is still sorting out the details .
Papers are being published pretty much non -stop these days , on those kinds of ideas and they need to be sorted out .
In the mean time , that does n't mean the Mainstream should n't get excited about monads because maybe it's not so as much as a scary a word any more and they can see that good things were happening in other contexts and they may try to use them in new contexts , which is great .
That should happen .
What I 'm saying is there is even more there .
Will all that stuff eventually end up in the Mainstream ?
I do n't know , but it 's all exciting stuff for a programming language researcher such as myself .
10 .
We know that you worked on embedded DSLs with absolute non-programmers .
Can you tell us a little more about this experience ?
I have n't had huge amounts of experience doing that , but I have an example that I 've talked about earlier today .
In fact , I have worked with musicians , for example , in using our computer music library or DSL Haskore and HaskSound and they have loved it , at least in the circumstances that I 've been there to observe and handhold a little bit , perhaps .
It 's been a very positive experience .
I would say that 's the biggest area where I 've actually worked with complete novices
In most of the other areas that I 've worked in , take robotics : if you talk to a roboticist , you are not going to find a roboticist who has never programmed before .
For example Greg Hager and his research group ( Greg is now at Jones Hopkins , he was at Yale ) : when he was at Yale , we worked with him on a DSL called FRAD , which is for controlling robots using the functional reactive programming paradigm that I was describing earlier .
To that point in time he had done all his programming in C and C ++.
He 'd never programmed in Haskell before , so he was using Haskell for the first time in the context of this embedded DSL called FRAD .
He also liked it quite a bit as did a couple of his students and they continued working with FRAD even after they left Yale .
It was n't just a one - time down - the - hallway collaboration or something - they found it to be a productive way to program .
To be honest , I think that we need to have more of those kinds of experiences with non-programmers - certainly , non-functional programmers and see how it goes .
In the context of music , one of the things that I 'm doing right now , which is - I think - going to be a challenge , but it 's something that I think we need to see more of , is write a book on a subject matter that is not about programming .
Perhaps , along the way , teach programming , but the main purpose of the book is to teach some other subject matter .
In my case , what I 'm talking about is computer music .
I 'm actually taking my previous textbook , the Haskell School of Expression and rewriting it in the context of computer music and introducing computer music ideas very thoroughly .
To do that means potentially lots of pros about things that have nothing to do with Haskell , but along the way teaching a language and teaching it thoroughly , not just in a superficial sort of way , but really get them to understand the power of functional programming so that once they understand Haskell or once they understand the computer music ideas then they can really do some cool things .
You do n't see that happening very often .
We could do more of that if spent the time and energy to do it .
We 'll see how this effort pans out .
Here 's the whole thing .
- Married for 10 years .
5 of which we both worked , the last 5 years the kids
were born .
Mom has been at - home ever since .
- started having real bad marital problems 2 yrs , ago .
we tried therapy together ,
books , you name it ...
- about 1 year ago , we started to build our " dream home " Foolishly , thought
this would help us re-unite ...
Note : we both purchased our first apartment together .
paid it off .
gave
a downpayment for a big house .
huge mortage .
House prices went to the roof .
sold the house .
paid of mortgage , still got some money left to build a house .
Currently renting a nice , yet very small house .
- 2 months ago , caught my wife having an emotional affair with the architect .
Yeah , the same guy that is building our " dream home " .
So I confronted her .
She denied it first .
But when I said I had seen the evidence , she accepted it .
At that point , I said we could fix things , I said I forgave her , but she should immediately
stop all contact with the guy .
She said yes , and we promised that we would work on saving our marriage .
- Fast forward to the present .
To summarize , it turns out she did not
stop email contact .
Emotional affair now blown into adulterous affair .
- She does not know I know .
But I know .
A mutual friend , kinda of spilled it
out ... I have installed software to monitor .
Yes . all true .
very intimate
and loving emails ... she 's saying he is the love of her life , bla bla bla .
She 'd marry him any minute if both of them were not married ...[ sic ]
So here 's the sticky point .
Remember , she does not know I know .
In theory , we 're working on our marriage , right ?
so I got an appointment
with a marriage therapist .
We 're going there together tommorrow .
She
keeps saying she does not want to divorce , that she wants to fight for it .
BUT , in her emails , to the architect - lover , she is saying she will divorce .
No doubt about it .
She will wait until the house is finished " for obvious reasons " - quoting her .
My parents lent us around 100K to continue building .
I promised my dad I would repay .
So now , she is planning to divorce me , and to get the house when it is finished .
She 's mentioned that shes gonna get a good lawyer ...( is she a witch , or what ? )
ANYWAYS :
here are my choices .
This is what I need advice on :
a) Counter - act .
without her knowing , rent a place , move out .
Basically
tell her :
You finish the house .
you pay for it .
see if you can make it .
( I know
she wont have the money ) .
She * might * have to sell it as - it - is , hoping
that someone else will finish it .
Sue her for divorce .
I am already renting a house right now , so the kids are not left homeless or anything .
b ) continue to play dumb-ass ... finish the house .
then she 'll want to divorce ,
and we fight for the house to be sold and split in court .
risky .
If I succed ,
I use that money to buy a house for the kids .
I just feel like even after
the whole cheating thing , she wants to rip me off with the house , for which
we both worked for it , and even me much more , and then I am stuck with
a debt to my father !
Does she care about that ?
dont think so .
Life sucks .
How to deal with a cheating wife ?
very sad story ....
A pandemic of panic
A “ panic pandemic ” is worsening the crisis in the UK said health ministers over the weekend .
Andy Burnham , the health secretary , told The Observer of the need for people to keep a sense of perspective .
“ If people are made unnecessarily anxious , it makes the lives of NHS professionals , who are already under enormous pressure , far more difficult as people become unduly worried . ”
His plea was backed up by the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health , Professor Terence Stephenson :
“ Health services struggle when they are overwhelmed by people who do n’t need to be there .
There are 11 million children in England and 256 of them are in hospital [ with swine flu ] .
For the four families where children have died , it is an absolute tragedy , but if you are talking about a previously healthy child where swine flu has led to their death , there have been none . ”
The RCGP chairman Professor Stephen Field concurs :
“ This is almost like the phoney war at the moment .
The big danger and real threat is that there will be a big spike in the numbers of people with influenza in the autumn . ”
Meanwhile , opposition parties have been continuing to blame the government for launching the new national flu pandemic service too late .
Andrew Landsley , health spokesman for the Conservatives , has described it as “ too little , too late ” .
Unfair , say the Government : it was doctors who told us not to launch this until the flu was more prevalent .
Michele Drage of the Londonwide LMCs said to GPs that the first night after the service launched she had reports that “ flu - related demand on OOH services dropped off significantly . ”
Will there be a critical care bed shortage ?
A 26 year old pregnant woman was flown from Scotland to Sweden last week to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) .
She developed acute respiratory failure after falling ill with swine flu .
The five ECMO beds in the UK ( in Leicester ) were full .
As you might expect , this sparked accusations by politicians about the UK not having enough intensive care capacity .
Are they right ?
A study in the journal Anaesthesia has modelled possible outcomes from the present pandemic in England .
They took population statistics and number of intensive care beds ( adult and paediatrics ) , total number of ventilators ( assumed to be equal to the number of intensive care beds ) .
They assumed that 36 % of those admitted will require critical care and half of those will need ventilating .
This is much higher than current rates ( under 10 % according to HPA figures ) , although admission criteria might be expected to become stricter as the case load increases in the coming months .
Using historical assumptions for the hospitalisation rate they estimated whether there will be enough critical care beds and ventilators .
Assuming a hospitalisation rate of 0.25 % , critical care bed occupancy in England would be 160 % .
Demand for ventilators would be 78 % of total capacity .
The most overwhelmed area would be the South East Coast region at 230 % bed occupancy .
The authors of this study note the considerable difficulties in modelling the pandemic at such an early stage .
However , even taking this into account , they seem concerned :
Best case predictions suggest that all critical care beds will be filled with influenza A ⁄ H1N1 patients if the hospital admission rate is greater than 0.25 % .
Worryingly , even small increases to the observed admission rate make the overwhelming scenario increasingly statistically credible .
That should n’t worry the people of Exeter though .
The San Francisco Sentinel reports that Exeter ’s 19th century catacombs are being readied for use as a mass swine flu grave .
A city council spokesperson gave the following quote :
According to Mass Effect 2 Lead Designer Preston Watamaniuk on the BioWare forums the team is working hard to “ offer a smooth progression into ME3 from ME2 . ”
The reasoning is that they “ have to have reasonable knowledge ” of where a character could end up at the end of the game .
So unlike the first Mass Effect , the sequel will not allow players to restart the campaign with all the skills Shepard gained throughout his or her second adventure .
Here is what he officially said :
The short answer is no .
The reason is progression .
We have been working very hard to make sure we design the abilities system to offer smooth progression into ME3 from ME2 .
Allowing double progression on characters makes that almost impossible .
We have to have reasonable knowledge about where a character could end up finishing all content on a playthrough .
We also want to offer choice of character build within specific classes .
We replaced that feature with playing after you were done because it preserves progression and allows for smoother downloading of PRC .
Of course , Mass Effect 2 players can feel free to create a new character and start over .

Georges St. Pierre and Brock Lesnar — the defending champions — meet the press after UFC 100 .
There are many options when it comes to making VOIP calls over WiFi or 3G with your iPhone .
Many prefer
Skype but here in Canada not only are we blocked from downloading the app in the iTunes store ( though there are ways around it ) but there are no Skype In numbers available in Canada .
So this plus the fact that I already use Vonage for my home line makes it the best option for me .
There are also many SIP applications available for the iPhone either through iTunes or Cydia .
The only catch is that Vonage wants you to pay an extra $ 12 a month to get a “ softphone ” added to your account , and it gives you another number .
Since I do n’t need an extra number , nor do I want to put more money into the hands of Vonage I did some digging around and found a solution .
As it turns out any Vonage line can be used as a SIP line .
All you have to do is find out the domain and your encrypted password .
Doing so is actually quite the simple process .
Enter the following into your browser , making sure to replace the parts in bold with your account information .
https://im-config.vonagenetworks.net/config?&login=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD&type=1003
Update
09/07/2009 : Unfortunately our friends at Vonage have taken down the above link .
As of now I know of no other way to obtain your encrypted password , I will try to find an alternate method and when I do I will put up a new post .
You ’ll get a page with a bunch of information on it , the part you want to pay attention to is at the top :
[ SIP 2.0 ] ProxyUserName=username ProxyUserPassword=FAB16g9XNa
ProxyDomain=a.vonim.com ProxyPort=10000
This contains all the information you need to register your account on Fring or SIAX .
In the past I used SIAX however they decided one day to make it so you had to purchase the software , which defeats the purpose of Jailbreaking your iPhone ( in my opinion ) .
So now I use Fring , which can be downloaded for free in the App Store .
Configuring SIP in Fring was a little less than straight - forward for me , so here are the steps to set it up :
Create an account or login to your existing account
Go to More then Add-ons
Select SIP , then Other
Fill out the fields as follows :
User ID = ProxyUserName
Password = ProxyUserPassword
Proxy = ProxyDomain : ProxyPort
Now save those settings and try making a SIP call .
If you do n’t see the SIP option lit up on the Dialer pad then you may just need to wait a few seconds for it to connect to Vonage

Advertisement More than 20 Iraqis who worked for British forces are to sue the UK government , the BBC has learned .
Most were interpreters , who say they were not given adequate protection from attack by extremist militias .
They claim they were owed a duty of care , and later this week will begin their legal actions in a bid to gain compensation from the UK .
The government says it has helped hundreds of Iraqis settle in the UK through an assistance scheme .
It also says " many thousands " of Iraqis have worked for British forces since 2003 .
Some became targets for local militias who saw them as collaborators .
As the security situation deteriorated some were murdered , others fled to Syria and Jordan , some went into hiding in southern Iraq .
[ After ] my loyal and faithful service to the British army , I am alone without any help
" Jamal " Jamal - not his real name - knew he could n't go on working for the British after his best friend was killed .
" He was tortured , severe , merciless torture and was killed and thrown into a remote place , " he said .
Jamal , who is 28 , worked for the British army from March 2005 to December 2005 , but now lives secretly in Basra .
His says his family constantly worry about him .
" It was like a daily nightmare for them , whenever I was going out they were thinking of me , they were fearing and expecting the worst for me . "
Iraqi interpreters often accompanied UK soldiers on patrol Jamal now sees no option but to take legal action against the government which he feels let him down .
" I feel so disappointed .
[ After ] my loyal and faithful service to the British army , I am alone without any help .
It is devastating to me . "
Legal action Jassim - who also does not want to use his real name - decided he had to give up work and take his family to Syria because of the anonymous death threats he received on his mobile .
" They said 'we know where you are working , we know your house , we know what time you came into the base ' , " he said .
Both applied to come to Britain under the Locally Engaged Staff Assistance Scheme ( LESAS ) , set up to help local staff employed by the British .
But neither had served continuously for 12 months , so their applications failed .
The two men , along with more than 20 others , are expected to start legal action this week to sue the government .
Sapna Malik is a partner at the solicitors Leigh Day and is co-ordinating the actions .
" The MoD could certainly have taken better steps to protect the identities of interpreters and in certain cases they should have housed the interpreters on the bases , " she said .
There are 25 claims in total , and most of them are interpreters .
Three are the wives or mothers of men who were murdered by militias .
Duty of care
She says the British government owed local staff a duty of care .
" Financial compensation will go a significant way to reduce the hardship they 've been suffering .
" They are also hoping that this will help shape the policy if Britain gets involved in any future conflicts . "
IRAQIS IN UK UNDER LESAS Resettled in the UK - 201 former and current employees Total including dependents - 612 Rejected - 694
Two years ago the prime minister announced help for Iraqis who had served for a year - they were offered financial assistance or resettlement .
The scheme closed for former employees in May this year .
Of those eligible , 201 have come to Britain .
Hundreds of others have taken the money .
But almost seven hundred have been told they do not qualify .
The Foreign Secretary David Miliband praised the " dedication and commitment " of local staff in a recent statement .
" The scheme for assistance is designed to reflect our enduring debt to them .
I am pleased it has proved popular and effective , " he said .
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said : " We have made a decision to focus assistance on those staff who have had a sustained association with us in the most difficult circumstances . "
" Wherever we draw the line , there will be difficult cases . "

This blog features the rants , raves and ramblings of the writers and editors of the Peoples World / Nuestro Mundo newspaper .
Stunning and shocking are understatements in this situation , yet so appropriate .
A total of 43 children were blasted with stun guns as part of an " educational " program during visits at three state corrections facilities during " Take Your Sons and Daughters to Work Day , " a state investigation revealed Friday .
What 's more crazy is that in every case , the parents or grand parents gave permission to the guards to shock the crap out of their kids .
It 's no shock that three guards have been fired and two others resigned as part of the fallout of the April 23 incidents .
Another 16 employees , including the warden at one of the jails , will receive some disciplinary action , said Department of Corrections Secretary Walt McNeil .
' ' I can't imagine what these officers were thinking to administer this device to children , nor can I imagine why any parent would allow them to do so , '' McNeil told the Miami Herald .
" This must not happen again . ''
We wonder is there a program for shocking some sense into the parents who authorized the use of stun guns on 8 - and 9 - year olds .
None of the children were seriously harmed by the stun guns , which is hard to believe considering the electric charge that is sent through the target 's body is enough to make a grown man have to change his pants .
McNeil said the stun - gun execise only happened at three of the 55 prisons , but acknowleged that stunning childen probably happened regularly .
The officers apparently do n't get much of a chance to use the stun guns and probably had an itchy trigger finger .
According to McNeil , the guns have not been used on any of the 100,000 inmates so far this year .
Now that 's a shocker .
Many people hoped that the election of a black President of the United States would mark our entering a " post- racial " era , when we could finally put some ugly aspects of our history behind us .
That is quite understandable .
But it takes two to tango .
Those of us who want to see racism on its way out need to realize that others benefit greatly from crying racism .
They benefit politically , financially , and socially .
Barack Obama has been allied with such people for decades .
He found it expedient to appeal to a wider electorate as a post- racial candidate , just as he has found it expedient to say a lot of other popular things -- about campaign finance , about transparency in government , about not rushing legislation through Congress without having it first posted on the Internet long enough to be studied -- all of which turned to be the direct opposite of what he actually did after getting elected .
Those who were shocked at President Obama 's cheap shot at the Cambridge police for being " stupid " in arresting Henry Louis Gates must have been among those who let their wishes prevail over the obvious implications of Obama 's 20 years of association with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright .
Anyone who can believe that Obama did not understand what the racist rants of Jeremiah Wright meant can believe anything .
With race -- as with campaign finance , transparency and the rest -- Barack Obama knows what the public wants to hear and that is what he has said .
But his policies as president have been the opposite of his rhetoric , with race as with other issues .
As a state senator in Illinois , Obama pushed the " racial profiling " issue , so it is hardly surprising that he jumped to the conclusion that a policeman was racial profiling when in fact the cop was investigating a report received from a neighbor that someone seemed to be breaking into the house that Professor Gates was renting in Cambridge .
For those who are interested in facts -- and these obviously do not include President Obama -- there has been a serious study of racial profiling in a book titled " Are Cops Racist ? " by Heather Mac Donald .
Her analysis of the data shows how this issue has long been distorted beyond recognition by politics .
The racial profiling issue is a great vote - getter .
And if it polarizes the society , that is a price that politicians are willing to pay in order to get votes .
Academics who run black studies departments , as Professor Henry Louis Gates does , likewise have a vested interest in racial paranoia .
For " community organizers " as well , racial resentments are a stock in trade .
President Obama 's background as a community organizer has received far too little attention , though it should have been a high - alert warning that this was no post - racial figure .
What does a community organizer do ?
What he does not do is organize a community .
What he organizes are the resentments and paranoia within a community , directing those feelings against other communities , from whom either benefits or revenge are to be gotten , using whatever rhetoric or tactics will accomplish that purpose .
To think that someone who has spent years promoting grievance and polarization was going to bring us all together as president is a triumph of wishful thinking over reality .
Not only Barack Obama 's past , but his present , tell the same story .
His appointment of an attorney general who called America " a nation of cowards " for not dialoguing about race was a foretaste of what to expect from Eric Holder .
The way Attorney General Holder has refused to prosecute young black thugs who gathered at a voting site with menacing clubs , in blatant violation of federal laws against intimidating voters , speaks louder than any words from him or his president .
President Obama 's first nominee to the Supreme Court is , like Obama himself , someone with a background of years of affiliation with an organization dedicated to promoting racial resentments and a sense of racial entitlement .
An 18th century philosopher said , " When I speak I put on a mask .
When I act I am forced to take it off . "
Barack Obama 's mask slipped for a moment last week but he quickly recovered , with the help of the media .
But we should never forget what we saw .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) --
The Ricketts family has reached a deal to buy the storied Chicago Cubs baseball team from bankrupt media company Tribune Co. for slightly less than the original $ 900 million bid , a source familiar with the deal said Monday .
" There is a deal between the Ricketts and Tribune Co. , " said the source , who asked not to be identified because the agreement has not been announced .
Spokesmen for Ricketts and Tribune Co. ( TRBCQ ) were not immediately available to comment .
The Ricketts family , led by Chicago investment banker Tom Ricketts , agreed in January to buy the team , its home park of Wrigley Field and a stake in a regional sports cable TV network for $ 900 million .
" The terms are very similar , " the source said .
" It 's slightly less than that . "
A final deal had been held up by disagreements over the value of Cubs ' broadcast contracts and other items , as well as the Ricketts arranging their financing for the purchase .
Earlier this month , Tribune had reopened talks with private equity investors Marc Utay and Leo Hindery in a move that some analysts saw as a way to pressure Ricketts into settling on terms desired by the media company .
RIO DE JANEIRO , Brazil ( CNN ) -- A New Jersey man whose son is at the center of a five - year international custody fight that has attracted attention from high - level U.S. and Brazilian authorities expressed hope Wednesday that he will get his boy back .
David Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son , Sean , since the boy 's mother took him to Brazil in 2004 .
" I always keep hope , but I do n't really expect it , given the things that always happen , " David Goldman told CNN on what he said was his 10th or 11th trip to Brazil to regain custody of 9 - year - old Sean Richard Goldman .
" Until the wheels are up , I do n't expect it and it's tragic . "
David Goldman 's comments came after a Brazilian Supreme Court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court 's order that would have granted Sean 's custody to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro , where father and son were to reunite Wednesday .
Judge Marco Aurelio wrote in his decision that taking Sean " in an abrupt manner " from his home could cause the boy psychological harm .
But Goldman said the boy was suffering psychological harm simply by remaining with his Brazilian relatives , whom Goldman accused of turning his son against him .
" According to the expert reports , they 've already been doing that for some time and that 's very , very sad , " said Goldman , who captains boats and works part - time as a model .
" The worst is -- he 's my son , I 'm his dad , and I can't help him .
The legal system here right now is preventing me from helping my child . "
Watch father explain Brazilian court battle »
The incident began in June 2004 , when Goldman 's wife , Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro , took Sean from the family 's New Jersey home for what was to have been a two - week vacation in her native Brazil .
But instead of returning , she divorced Goldman , married Joao Paulo Lins e Silva , a Brazilian lawyer , and remained in Brazil .
She died there last September giving birth to a daughter .
Sean attends a private school and lives in a sprawling home in Rio with his half - sister and his stepfather .
Recently , after nearly five years without seeing his child , Goldman began visiting him .
" He asked me where have I been for this amount of time .
How come I never came to visit him ? "
Goldman said .
On CNN's " Larry King Live " Wednesday , Goldman said that public prosecutors and psychiatrists have declared the boy " emotionally damaged , " and added , " He needs to be reunited with me immediately . "
In March , a spokesman for the boy 's Brazilian relatives said he did not dispute the father 's biological rights , but said other matters needed to be weighed .
" The fact of the matter is that , in order to be a parent , you have to be more than a DNA donor , " said Helvecio Ribeiro .
" Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures .
It 's about sacrifice ; it 's about providing support for your child ; it 's about being there even when you are not there . "
Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back »
He said Goldman had failed to do that , and accused him of having " paid not a dime of child support " and made allegations " all over the place about us not allowing him to visit the child that are completely untrue . "
Goldman responded , " Can you take someone 's child to another country and then expect the parent to support you in the abduction of the child ? "
He said he had been making tireless efforts since his son was " abducted " to have him repatriated , " never , ever stopping . "
Do n't Miss Brazilian court rules for New Jersey dad
Goldman said the case sends the wrong message to the world about Brazil 's legal system .
" They 're sending this message that anyone can take any child from anywhere , come to Brazil and if they can hide enough or stall enough or keep the child here long enough then they 're entitled to that child ?
That 's unacceptable . "
Tuesday night 's decision , which means the entire Brazilian Supreme Court will hear the case , comes a day after a Superior Court justice ordered Sean to be taken to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father , who had arrived early Tuesday from New Jersey to pick him up .
The exchange was to have taken place on Wednesday .
The case has attracted attention from politicians .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met with Brazil 's foreign minister Wednesday .
A senior State Department official said the case was the first thing they talked about .
" We are disappointed by the decision , " State Department spokesman Philip Crowley told reporters Wednesday .
" But U.S. Embassy officials continue to work with the family , and will meet with Brazilian attorneys and Mr. Goldman 's attorney to learn next steps in the legal process . "
A lawyer representing the boy 's Brazilian relatives said earlier this week , when it appeared that he would be returned to the United States , that doing so would harm him .
" The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil , " said lawyer Sergio Tostes .
" This is not human and it is a cruelty . "
Meanwhile , Goldman was not giving up .
" My focus is to do everything I can , through every legal means in all matters of law , to reunite with my son and bring him home , " he said .
According to the U.S. State Department , 66 American - born children have been taken by a parent to Brazil , in violation of international treaties .
CNN 's Kim Segal in Rio de Janeiro and Adam Reiss in New York contributed to this story .

Whilst most studies of bacterial infection are done after the death of the infected organism , this system developed by scientists at the University of Bath and University of Exeter is the first to follow the progress of infection in real - time with living organisms .
The researchers used developing fruit fly embryos as a model organism , injecting fluorescently tagged bacteria into the embryos and observing their interaction with the insect ’s immune system using time - lapse confocal microscopy .
The researchers can also tag individual bacterial proteins to follow their movement and determine their specific roles in the infection process .
The scientists are hoping to use this system in the future with human pathogens such as Listeria and Trypanosomes .
By observing how these bacteria interact with the immune system , researchers will gain a better understanding of how they cause an infection and could eventually lead to better antibacterial treatments .
Dr Will Wood , Research Fellow in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath , explained : “ Cells often behave very differently once they have been taken out of their natural environment and cultured in a petri dish .
VIDEO :
The insect immune cells known as hemocytes ( green ) rapidly engulf the bacteria following infection and this can be studied in real - time using timelapse microscopy .
Click here for more information .
“ In the body , immune surveillance cells such as hemocytes ( or macrophages in vertebrates ) are exposed to a battery of signals from different sources .
The cells integrate these signals and react to them accordingly .
“ Once these cells are removed from this complex environment and cultured in a petri dish these signals are lost .
Therefore it is really important to study whole organisms to fully understand how bacteria interact with their host . ”
Dr Nick Waterfield , co-author on the study and Research Officer at the University of Bath , said : “ To be able to film the microscopic battle between single bacterial cells and immune cells in a whole animal and in real time is astounding .
“ It will ultimately allow us to properly understand the dynamic nature of the infection process . ”
Professor Richard Ffrench - Constant , Professor of Molecular Natural History at the University of Exeter , added : “ For the first time this allows us to actually examine infection in real time in a real animal – it ’s a major advance

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gestures during a news conference on the America ’s Affordable Health Choices Act on Capitol Hill in Washington July 22 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday ramped up her criticism of insurance companies , accusing them of unethical behavior and working to kill a plan to create a new government - run health plan .
“ It ’s almost immoral what they are doing , ” Pelosi said to reporters , referring to insurance companies .
“ Of course they ’ve been immoral all along in how they have treated the people that they insure , ” she said , adding , “ They are the villains .
They have been part of the problem in a major way .
They are doing everything in their power to stop a public option from happening . ”
Birth of a Notion
Like 9/11 “ Truthers ” a few years ago , Obama “ Birthers ” suddenly seem to be everywhere , spreading a bizarre gospel of alien invasion at the highest levels of government .
Their curious belief system is a dog ’s breakfast of dueling bureaucratic paperwork types ( one kind of birth certificate makes you good to go , the other just wo n’t do at all ) , misinterpretations of mistranslations of excerpts of interviews with grandmothers who are n’t actual grandmothers , citations of foreign law from as far back as the 1750s , and whatever else they can dig up — or make up — to convince themselves and those around them that Barack Obama is certainly ineligible to serve as President of the United States , probably an illegal immigrant , and maybe even a Communist plant from birth .
All of which is almost certainly nonsense , of course , but it ’s part of a promising trend .
Over the course of the last ten years or so , the American political establishment has begun to break back down into its component parts , and each of those parts has dragged its larger constituencies ever closer to the outside edge of the de facto consensus that makes politics possible .
The state of detente between the two major political parties , built over the course of more than a century of collusion to exclude alternatives , has been in a process of collapse since at least 2000 :
The Florida electoral dispute , the nature of and response to 9/11 , the war on Iraq , alleged voting irregularities in Ohio in 2004 , dueling narratives of vote fraud ( Diebold , ACORN ) through 2008 , and now the “ Birther ” allegations , you name it … the two wings of the uniparty have long since abandoned issues , policy , etc. as focal points and are now focused almost entirely on issues of each others ’ “ legitimacy . ”
To question the legitimacy of the governors is to question the legitimacy of the government — and to question the legitimacy of the government is to invite reconsideration of the legitimacy of government itself .
Our would - be rulers are playing around with fire , oblivious to the risk they run of getting burnt .
“ Al Gore won that election ” and “ Barack Obama is n’t eligible to serve as POTUS ” and “ maybe 9/11 was an inside job ” are n’t indicators of revolutionary consciousness , nor are they memes which have a firm grip on especially large segments of the populace , but they ’re the equivalent of dry kindling .
If the same two sticks keep rubbing against each other in the same way above these kinds of ideas , sooner or later there ’s going to be a spark , and then a fire … and who knows how far that fire might spread or how hot it might burn ?
As an anarchist , I consider it my task to entertain these feuds over “ legitimacy ” with an eye toward constantly expanding the question beyond the instant issue .
When the question of Obama ’s eligibility is raised , my counter - questions are simple :
Under what possible circumstances could his actions possess “ legitimacy ? ”
If he was born in Honolulu as he claims , does this in some way legitimize the powers he exercises ?
Do the circumstances of his birth legitimize or delegitimize the claims he makes on your wealth and income ?
When he issues an order which results in the deaths of innocents at home or abroad , should those innocents care where he first drew breath ?
Is there some place he could have been born , or some ancestral trait he could display , which would magically make him good enough to rule others without their consent ?
These are the questions which need to be asked .
And answered .

The short , tormented life of computer genius Phil Katz By Lee Hawkins Jr .
of the Journal Sentinel staff Last Updated : May 21 , 2000 Then he was found dead April 14 , Phil Katz was slumped against a nightstand in a south side hotel , cradling an empty bottle of peppermint schnapps .
Phil Katz , shown in 1994 , holds a computer disk containing compression software made by his company , PKWare Inc .
The genius who built a multimillion - dollar software company known worldwide for its pioneering " zip " files had died of acute pancreatic bleeding caused by chronic alcoholism .
He was alone , estranged long ago from his family and a virtual stranger to employees of his own company , PKWare Inc. of Brown Deer .
He was 37 .
It was an ignominious end for a man who created one of the most influential pieces of software in the world - PKZip - and it attracted the attention not only of the techno - faithful but of the mainstream press across the nation .
Katz 's inventions shrink computer files 50 % to 70 % to conserve precious space on hard disks .
His compression software helped set a standard so widespread that " zipping " - compressing a file - became a part of the lexicon of PC users worldwide .
But the riches his genius produced were no balm for what had become a hellish life of paranoia , booze and strip clubs .
Toward the end , Katz worked only sporadically , firing up his computer late at night , while filling his days with prodigious bouts of drinking and trysts with exotic dancers .
Katz owned a condominium in Mequon but rarely stayed there .
Desperate to avoid warrants for his arrest , he bounced between cheap hotels near the airport .
He got his mail at a Mailboxes Etc. store in Franklin .
" This guy did not have one friend in the world .
I mean , a true friend , " says Chastity Fischer , an exotic dancer who often spent time with Katz and was one of the last people to see him alive .
" Just imagine having nobody in your life .
Not anybody to call .
Nobody . "
High School Outcast Phil Katz was a quiet , asthmatic child whose athletic pursuits as a kid went no further than riding dirt bikes in his Glendale neighborhood .
A 1980 graduate of Nicolet High School , Katz was a " geek " long before that term was linked with dot - com companies and piles of money .
" He was an outcast , definitely someone who was picked on , " says Rick Mayer , who graduated with Katz .
" He spoke in a somewhat nasal tone .
He was short , and , well I do n't want to say homely , so I 'll say he was plain looking . "
After hearing of Katz 's death , Ray Fedderly , a Milwaukee cardiologist who sat next to Katz in high school honors math and physics classes , opened his high school yearbook and found an angst - ridden message .
" I enjoyed working with you in mathematics and physics classes through the four terrible , long , unbearable , tortuous , but wonderful years at Nicolet , " Katz wrote .
" I hope your future is bright and your life is happy ( if possible ) .
May a calculator bring great happiness to you . "
" If I were a physician as I am now when I was 18 , I would have known what to do with that note , " Fedderly says .
" I now know that that was a call for help .
That was not a joke . "
A loner by nature , Katz gravitated to analytical pursuits .
Katz and his father , Walter , spent weekend afternoons playing chess and evenings writing code for programmable calculators in the days before PCs forever changed computing .
Since programmable calculators had very little memory , Phil and Walter had to work very efficiently .
" The earliest program I remember him writing was a game program that dealt with landing on the moon , " says Brian Kiehnau , Katz 's former brother - in - law who met him in 1977 .
" It was very crude and simple , but it was complex for what he had in terms of hardware .
He got real good at optimizing programs , and he learned to get the job done with the least amount of instructions and running times . "
In 1980 , Katz entered the computer science program at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee .
Around the same time , Walter and Hildegard Katz bought Phil his first computer , an original IBM PC .
It had two floppy drives , a monochrome monitor and 64 K of memory , an astoundingly small amount compared with today 's machines .
Once he got the PC , Katz started writing programs , spending most of his free time on electronic bulletin board services , the precursors of the Internet .
The services quickly became Katz 's social circle , a place where he hooked up with others who understood his sophisticated programming techniques and shared his passion for computers .
Gradually , Katz developed a fondness for sharing information on the services , since interacting with others helped make his programs better .
Those experiences would influence Katz to embrace the " shareware " approach to distributing PKWare 's software .
With shareware , users try a product , and if they find it valuable , pay the person who created it .
In the case of PKWare , users paid $ 47 and received a manual and free upgrades .
" He spent many , many hours talking to people and helping people .
He would go to computer user groups and spend hours with them , " Hildegard Katz says .
" He was very , very , giving .
This was his great love . "
But in the spring of 1981 , tragedy overtook the family , and things would never be the same for Phil Katz .
Walter , 55 , plagued by recurring chest pains , underwent open heart surgery .
Within hours , he was dead .
Phil Katz took his father 's death very hard .
Years later , in the haze of his drinking binges , Katz told Fischer how the loss had affected him .
" It tore him up inside when his father died .
One time we went to his grave , " Fischer says .
" He 'd always say that when his father was alive they 'd go fishing and do man things . "
Walter 's death drove his son further into solitude and deeper into a one - on - one relationship with his computer , say friends and family members .
Writing Programs at Night Katz graduated with a computer science degree in 1984 and was hired as a programmer for Allen - Bradley Co .
He wrote code to run " programmable logic controllers , " which operate manufacturing equipment on shop floors worldwide for Allen - Bradley 's customers .
Katz left Allen - Bradley in 1986 to work for Graysoft , a Milwaukee - based software company .
He spent evenings holed up in his bedroom writing his own programs .
His project :
An alternative to Arc , the then - common program for compressing files .
Using algorithms , Katz wrote programs that imploded information by telling it , for example , to take every " a - n - d " out of text .
That would eliminate every " and , " " hand , " and " sand . "
A good program takes out these and thousands of other combinations of letters and restores them when needed .
Katz bounced early versions of the software , called PKArc , off his buddies on the bulletin boards and spent countless hours refining it .
By 1987 , the software had created such a buzz online that PKArc started to steal market share from Arc 's creator , System Enhancement Associates of New Jersey .
" I got a check in the mail and I thought , ' Gee ! ' that 's pretty neat , " Katz said in a 1994 interview with the Journal Sentinel .
" Then over the next few months , I got more checks in the mail . "
He turned to his mother for help .
" People kept calling him saying , ' We would like to use your software , and we want to pay you money for it , ' " Hildegard says .
Katz left Graysoft in 1987 to strike out on his own .
PKArc 's sales dwarfed his Graysoft salary , which was in the low - $ 30,000 range , says Steve Burg , a former Graysoft programmer who joined PKWare in 1988 .
In the beginning , Katz did most of his work at Hildegard 's kitchen table .
They hired an answering service to handle the flood of phone calls , and offered Burg a job as a developer .
Colleagues were impressed by his intellect .
" He was extremely intelligent , " says Doug Hay , who joined the company in 1988 and stayed until June of last year .
" He had all the equations from exams memorized from 10 years earlier , things you generally forget 20 minutes after the test . "
Almost overnight , denizens of the bulletin boards switched from .arc compression to .zip in what became known as the arc wars .
System Enhancement sued PKWare in 1988 for copyright and trademark infringement .
In 1989 , as his legal costs mounted , Katz agreed to settle .
Full terms of the settlement were not disclosed , but representatives of the New Jersey company may have been surprised when they finally met their nemesis .
" The lawyer for System Enhancement showed up at Hildegard 's house expecting a big company , " Kiehnau says .
" He had an address from the bulletin boards , so he thought there would be a big glass building or something .
It was really funny . "
Publicity about the lawsuit on bulletin board services nationwide helped fuel a backlash against System Enhancement , which accelerated the death of .arc as PKWare introduced new , incompatible archival tools with better compression algorithms .
Money poured in .
" Phil became a very wealthy man in a very short period of time , " Burg says .
While Hildegard worked to keep business matters in check , Katz devoted nearly all his time to programming .
He did n't come to work until late afternoon and worked well into the night , so he could have complete silence and not have to interact with anybody , early PKWare employees say .
" He was rarely around .
He did what he had to , " Kiehnau says .
" If the business would have went belly up two years after it started , I do n't think he would have cared . "
But Katz 's unpredictable schedule frustrated his family .
" They 'd say ' You have this business , and it 's growing .
Why are n't you here ? "
Kiehnau says .
During his frequent absences , Katz kept in touch with Hildegard and PKWare executives through electronic fax services .
He oversaw product upgrades and revisions , and occasionally gave Hildegard instructions on business matters .
As his business grew , his personal life unraveled .
Hildegard heard rumors her son was going to strip bars , cavorting with women and drinking heavily .
She questioned him about his personal affairs , people who know the family say , and the relationship between the worried mom and wayward son began to fray .
They also squabbled when Katz tried to take money out of PKWare .
He sometimes wanted as much as $ 25,000 , Kiehnau says .
" He thought it was ridiculous that a 30 - year - old man would have to beg his mother for a check from his own company , " Kiehnau says .
Katz grew bitter over his mother 's interference in his affairs .
Eventually , he stopped talking to her altogether .
The end came one day in 1995 .
Hildegard received a fax informing her that her son planned a hostile buyout of her 25 % equity stake .
He had fired his own mother .
" It was like a funeral the day it happened , " Kiehnau recalls .
" It was his product , but it was her business .
( Kiehnau 's former wife ) Cindi and I got called over to her house and she was crying and crying , ' Why would Phil do this ? ' "
That same year , Katz hired Robert Gorman as director of marketing and sales .
Gorman had previously worked in sales for Frontier Technologies , a Milwaukee - based developer of Internet software .
Gorman maintains that Katz continued to manage the company , but others close to the situation say Katz 's day - to - day role was minimal .
Although he signed off on major decisions and worked on product upgrades , the company was run by PKWare management , they say .
Despite the turmoil , PKWare 's business remained strong through the 1990s , says Richard Holler , executive director of the Association of Shareware Professionals in Greenwood , Ind .
It is difficult to measure the company 's market share because not all shareware users end up licensing the product .
But even as Windows - based " zip " products nibbled into PKWare 's sales , the company 's business held up , he says .
" They are still a big player in the commercial marketplace .
They have a lot of ongoing relationships with other software developers that use the PKZip compression algorithm within their own products , " Holler says .
At the time of his death , Phil Katz was remembered among the world 's elite programmers for writing a truly revolutionary piece of software .
But that single accomplishment , as significant and profitable as it was , could n't save Katz 's life .
Alcohol Takes its Toll Katz talked freer , laughed harder , stayed up longer and dreamed bigger when he had a drink in his hand , friends say .
Drinking brought a painfully shy man out of his shell .
" As soon as he started drinking , you could see a little smile on his face .
That 's when he could talk to people , or tell a joke .
When he did n't drink , he would pick jokes apart .
He would think really deep and would n't have as much fun , " says Fischer , the dancer who met Katz in 1994 and grew fond of him .
But the alcohol was ripping his life from its moorings .
On May 7 , 1991 , as he was driving his 1990 Nissan 300ZX with plates that read PKWARE , a police officer ordered Katz to pull over .
Katz was sitting in the driver 's seat , his glassy eyes nearly closed , according to the police report .
He was convicted of operating under the influence of an intoxicant .
It was the first in a torrent of legal troubles .
About a year later , Katz was again convicted of drunken driving .
Between 1994 and September 1999 , Katz was arrested five times for operating after suspension or revocation of his license .
Records show that courts issued six warrants related to his driving , including two for bail jumping .
Once the authorities starting looking for him , Katz started showing up at work a lot less often .
" He just disappeared , " Hay says .
" Sometimes you would see him at trade shows , but that was about it . "
When Katz did go to work , the strain was evident , former employees say .
" He lived in a state of paranoia , " says one former employee , who asked not to be identified .
" He thought that ( WITI - TV Channel 6 ) across the street from us was watching him . "
Katz knew that if authorities were looking for him at PKWare , they probably were also trying to find him at the handsome , brown - brick luxury condominium he owned near Mequon Country Club .
His neighbors , unaware of his legal problems , were baffled by Katz 's reclusive nature .
Many say they had never seen or met Katz even though he supposedly had lived there for almost five years .
" I never saw a light on , I never saw tire tracks in his driveway , and I live across the street .
It was almost spooky , " says Peter Picus , a neighbor .
The condominium was in the eye of a publicity storm in August 1997 after neighbors complained about a stench emanating from the home and mice and insects scurrying near the unit .
Mequon authorities obtained a search warrant to enter the condominium , after neighbors and inspectors were unable to locate Katz .
They found a stinking mass of garbage , sex magazines , videos and sex toys like whips and chains , according to Kenneth Metzger , former general sanitarian for the City of Mequon .
" It was a mess .
I had been in the business for more than 40 years , and it was one of the worst that I had seen , " Metzger says .
" It was knee deep in garbage .
There were bottles , cans and rotting fast - food stuff all over the place .
Whatever happened to that man , he went off the deep end . "
Though Metzger and his crew knew little about the evasive Katz , they could tell that he was wealthy .
Among all the rubbish , they found credit cards , money , a laptop computer and jewelry that had never been opened .
Publicity about the discoveries hurt Katz deeply , friends say , and some say it marked the beginning oftheend .
" When they raided his house , they exploited it and told everybody at his company about his fetish .
His mother found out , everybody found out , " Fischer says .
" He knew people would jump to conclusions about him , " she says .
" He felt really violated .
That 's the day he completely stopped going into PKWare .
He did n't want his personal life mixed in with his employees .
Nobody really does . "
By this time , Katz 's closest acquaintances were the dancers at the strip bars he frequented .
Fischer says Katz showered her and other dancers with gifts , often taking groups of them with him to Las Vegas .
Several of them accompanied him to the 1998 Comdex computer show there .
" I would sleep with him in the same bed .
He never would touch or sneak a peek or anything like that , " she says .
" Sometimes he would cry and be like , ' Hold me , Chastity . '
You 'd just have to hold him all night long . "
" There was never anything dirty about him , " she says .
" He was not a pervert .
I swear on my Bible .
He was the most harmless , most generous , unselfish guy I have ever known . "
Some of his stripper friends took advantage of his generosity , stealing his credit card numbers and buying things for themselves .
It intensified his paranoia .
Katz began to keep any receipt or piece of mail bearing his name or account numbers .
He piled it all into the back of his 1991 Nissan Pathfinder .
" That Pathfinder was so disgusting .
It literally had no back seat , " Fischer says .
" It was papers from the ground up . "
Fearful of the arrest warrants , Katz kept on the move .
In addition to the drunken - driving convictions , he had a half - dozen judgments against him from financial institutions totaling more than $ 30,000 , court records show .
Katz hopscotched along a strip of hotels near Mitchell International Airport , staying at one for three or four days , then moving to the next , usually less than a few hundred yards away .
" You know what he did ?
He sat in his hotel room every single day , " Fischer says .
" The only time he got out of the hotel room was maybe to go have dinner . "
Fischer says Katz sometimes called her answering machine late at night , pleading with her to join him .
During their conversations , he sometimes spoke candidly about his family , his company , and his childhood , Fischer says .
He said that his separation from his mother and sister was difficult , and that he continued to send Hildegard flowers and e-mails , even though they had n't talked since he fired her from the company .
Through it all , Katz drank heavily .
Fischer says he drank at least a liter of Rumple minze and two bottles of Bacardi rum a day .
" He would drink until he 'd puke .
We 'd have to see this .
I never was with an alcoholic where you 'd have to see it .
After a while it was starting to make us sick , " Fischer says .
" We 'd say Phil , you know , this is sickening .
You 're killing yourself , and we 're watching you do it . "
Hildegard Katz says her son underwent treatment for alcohol abuse .
" We all tried to help .
As with almost any alcoholic , the more you tell them to get some help , they begin to isolate themselves because they do n't want to hear it , " Hildegard says .
" I guess we really thought he turned the corner after he went through rehab . "
But he had not turned the corner .
Fischer says she realized Katz was near the end when she visited him at a south side hotel a few weeks before his death .
Clad in nothing but underwear , he was suffering from uncontrollable hiccups and burdened by a horribly swollen stomach .
" He took some Valium so he could sleep .
That was the only time he could sleep , " she says .
" Then he would have the alcohol shakes .
I 'd try to play computer games with him , but he'd run to the bathroom all the time . "
" He was so bad to the point where he would start ( urinating ) in his pants involuntarily .
His liver was just going .
He was puking up blood , " she says .
After helping Katz change his pants , Fischer left Katz 's hotel room .
She never saw him again .
Katz had been dead for two days before his body was found .
PKWare employees learned of his death almost a week later .
In the days that followed , the company was flooded with hundreds of e-mails offering condolences from software junkies around the world .
Most had never met Katz but were aware of what he had done .
Stories of his death were printed in such far - flung media as the London Times , the New York Times and abcnews.com .
But the sadness was deepest for those who had suffered the longest as Phil Katz 's life came unglued .
Hildegard had to make the sad trip to identify the son she had n't seen in five years .
Later , she reflected on the loss .
" I get the e-mails people are sending , and it is amazing how many people say that even though they never met him or talked to him they are ever grateful for what he did .
One man said he saved my butt many times .
Phil was concerned with helping people .
" It is a tragic waste of such a very vital person , and of his energy and abilities . "

A Chinese google document has been set up to collect the most up - to - date information about the Shishou riot .
Here is a translated summary of the blog posts via the google doc .
Background ( by Subei via google doc )
On June 17th around 7:30 , Xu Yuangao 's body was found outside Yong Long hotel in Shishou city , Hubei province .
Xu , 24 , was the hotel 's chef .
Police investigated the scene and said that Xu had committed suicide .
Xu's family , however , believed that he was murdered because there were no blood stains on the ground , but there were some obvious injuries in his body .
Moreover , a similar incident had taken place two years prior .
Rumor spread that local police and government officials had shares in the hotel .
The following day , the hotel told Xu's family that if they could agree with a report that Xu committed suicide , they could get 35,000 yuan in compensation .
Instead , Xu's family insisted on finding out the truth and refused to hand over Xu's body .
Xu's father then brought a gas container to the hotel to protect the body from being taking away .
[ photo : father protecting the son 's body ]
At 1 am on June 19 , police and funeral cars arrived at the hotel , wanting to take the body away .
2,000 Shishou residents blocked the hotel entrance to protect Xu's corpse .
The first confrontation between local residents and the police took place at 8 am , during which some residents were arrested , while more joined in .
At 1 pm , several thousand local residents fought back with stones and bottles and the police line broke down .
At 3 pm , police failed again in seizing the dead body and the city government had to seek help from armed police .
Eventually , Jingzhou sent a clan of armed police to back up .
However , the number of local residents had reached more than 40,000 at its peak and the armed police had to retreat .
At night , there were still more than 10,000 residents blocking the hotel entrance and main roads leading to the hotel .
At 2 am on June 20 , 500 police took action again and there was another confrontation .
Dozens of local residents and polices were injured .
The city government began to cut Internet connections on the early morning of June 20 .
Another round of confrontation took place around 7 am .
This time police were equipped with 8 anti-riot vehicles and six fire engines .
Thousands of local residents fought back with stone and bricks .
Below are some video showing the confrontation scene :
The most update news from twitter via freemoren at around 10 am on June 21 says that police had finally seized the dead body and transported it to the crematorium .
Torrent from twitter has set up a twitter account @shishou for translating updates in English .
While overseas media such as Reuters and AFP have reported on the riot , Xinhua Chinese has a news story describing the confrontation and riot as an inter- departmental fire drill .
The English - language xinhua.net has another version more sympathetic towards the protesters .
Below are some comments from twitter ( via twitter search – shishou ) :
Apple said Tuesday that third - quarter profits rose nearly 15 percent to $ 1.23 billion , or $ 1.35 per diluted share , on record non-holiday quarter sales of $ 8.34 billion for the three - month period ended June 27 , 2009 .
These results compare to revenue of $ 7.46 billion and net quarterly profit of $ 1.07 billion , or $ 1.19 per diluted share , in the year - ago quarter .
Gross margin was 36.3 percent , up from 34.8 percent in the year - ago quarter .
International sales accounted for 44 percent of the quarter 's revenue .
Apple sold 2.6 million
Macs during the quarter , representing a four percent unit increase over the year - ago quarter and the best ever June quarter in its history for personal computer sales .
The company also sold 10.2 million iPods during the quarter , representing a seven percent unit decline from the year - ago quarter .
Quarterly iPhones sold were 5.2 million , representing 626 percent unit growth over the year - ago quarter .
" We 're making our most innovative products ever and our customers are responding , " said Steve Jobs , Apple 's CEO .
" We 're thrilled to have sold over 5.2 million iPhones during the quarter and users have downloaded more than 1.5 billion applications from our App Store in its first year . "
In accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP , Apple recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their estimated economic lives .
Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting , the corresponding non-GAAP measures for the quarter were $ 9.74 billion of " Adjusted Sales " and $ 1.94 billion of " Adjusted Net Income . "
" We 're extremely pleased to report record non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings and quarterly cash flow from operations of $ 2.3 billion , " said Peter Oppenheimer , Apple 's CFO .
" Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009 , we expect revenue in the range of about $ 8.7 billion to $ 8.9 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $ 1.18 to $ 1.23 . "
We swim in a sea of information , but filter out most of what we see and hear .
A new analysis of data from dozens of studies sheds new light on how we choose what we do and do not hear .
The study found that while people tend to avoid information that contradicts what they already think or believe , certain factors can cause them to seek out , or at least consider , other points of view .
The analysis , reported this month in Psychological Bulletin , was led by researchers at the University of Illinois and the University of Florida , and included data from 91 studies involving nearly 8,000 participants .
It puts to rest a longstanding debate over whether people actively avoid information that contradicts what they believe , or whether they are simply exposed more often to ideas that conform to their own because they tend to be surrounded by like - minded people .
" We wanted to see exactly across the board to what extent people are willing to seek out the truth versus just stay comfortable with what they know , " said University of Illinois psychology professor Dolores Albarracín , who led the study with University of Florida researcher William Hart .
The team also included researchers from Northwestern University and Ohio University .
The studies they reviewed generally asked participants about their views on a given topic and then allowed them to choose whether they wanted to view or read information supporting their own or an opposing point of view .
The researchers found that people are about twice as likely to select information that supports their own point of view ( 67 percent ) as to consider an opposing idea ( 33 percent ) .
Certain individuals , those with close - minded personalities , are even more reluctant to expose themselves to differing perspectives , Albarracín said .
They will opt for the information that corresponds to their views nearly 75 percent of the time .
The researchers also found , not surprisingly , that people are more resistant to new points of view when their own ideas are associated with political , religious or ethical values .
" If you are really committed to your own attitude – for example , if you are a very committed Democrat – you are more likely to seek congenial information , that is , information that corresponds with your views , " Albarracín said .
" If the issues concern moral values or politics , about 70 percent of the time you will choose congenial information , versus about 60 percent of the time if the issues are not related to values . "
Perhaps more surprisingly , people who have little confidence in their own beliefs are less likely to expose themselves to contrary views than people who are very confident in their own ideas , Albarracín said .
Certain factors can also induce people to seek out opposing points of view , she said .
Those who may have to publicly defend their ideas , such as politicians , for example , are more motivated to learn about the views of those who oppose them .
In the process , she said , they sometimes find that their own ideas evolve .
People are also more likely to expose themselves to opposing ideas when it is useful to them in some way , Albarracín said .
" If you 're going to buy a house and you really like the house , you 're still going to have it inspected , " she said .
Similarly , no matter how much you like your surgeon , you may seek out a second opinion before scheduling a major operation , she said .
" For the most part it seems that people tend to stay with their own beliefs and attitudes because changing those might prevent them from living the lives they 're living , " Albarracín said .
" But it 's good news that one out of three times , or close to that , they are willing to seek out the other side .
Dirt - poor farmer / Living off the land in Oakland , and watching every dollar

I packed three of my kid goats into the back of my truck the other day and headed for the large animal clinic in Cotati .
We made quite a scene on the highway -- all three kids in a dog crate , my beat - up truck bearing more rust than paint , flecks of alfalfa drifting around like green flakes of snow .
The goats were born on my little farm in Oakland , where I have been keeping bees , chickens , rabbits and goats for the past six years .
In the past I 've raised ducks and turkeys , and one year I raised two pigs .
Mostly I am a subsistence farmer : I grow enough vegetables to feed myself and some other families in my neighborhood .
Sometimes I sell food to underground restaurants .
I raise chickens for eggs , and goats for their milk and meat .
Read The Chronicle 's review of " Farm City : The Education of an Urban Farmer . " >>>
I try to do things as frugally as possible on the farm .
With the pigs , for instance , I never bought them swine feed , which comes in big bags made by Purina .
Instead , I raised them on scraps I salvaged from the local restaurant and grocery store dumpsters .
Instead of soy and corn pellets , I fed them bruised peaches and burnt pizza , old wontons and expired cheeses .
They ended up making the most delicious pork I had ever tasted .
Horns a plenty
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
As I slowed down at the Richmond bridge toll booth to hand over my $ 4 , Hedwig , my biggest goatling , let out a wail that sounded like a small child calling for help .
The tollbooth operator looked concerned until he saw the little black and white horned animal in the crate .
He smiled and waved me by .
Going across the bridge , I looked intently into the rearview mirror every few minutes to make sure the girls were okay .
The white one , Milky Way , was taking a nap , the golden one , Ginger Fox , was chewing her cud thoughtfully , and Hedwig was still bleating .
As the beauty of Marin county unfolded before me , I started to feel a little anxious about our visit to the vet .
Trips to the veterinarian are always expensive , and this trip was no exception .
The goal was to get the goats ' horns disbudded -- or seared off .
If you live in a city , goats ' horns are a serious hazard to human health -- they can gouge out eyes or rip flesh .
Horned animals also can cause major injuries to other animals and to themselves ( they can get caught it fences , for example ) .
I only had to think of one of our small neighborhood kids getting his eye gouged out by one of my goats , and my mind was made up : I needed to have their horns removed .
When the goats were a week old , the ideal time for disbudding , I did n't have enough money to take them to the vet .
I had to wait three more weeks until I got my next paycheck .
I 've been on a major budget with my farm operations , but like most farmers in America , I was -- and am -- almost totally broke .
According to the most recent Structure and Finances of U.S. Farms report put out by the USDA in 2007 , " The average operating profit margin and average rates of return on assets and equity are negative for small farms . "
Looking at the spreadsheet , I had a shiver of recognition .
So - called residential / lifestyle farms ( of which there are 837,000 ) have a profit margin of negative 35 percent !
Low sales farms ( about 400,000 ) are at negative 36 percent .
These stats reminded me of joke about a farmer who wins the lottery .
He 's asked what he 's going to do with the money : " I reckon I 'll keep farming until the money runs out , " he says .
If it 's such a money pit , why do I try to be a farmer at all ?
I suppose it runs in my blood , as does poverty .
I grew up poor with my back - to - the - land parents in Idaho .
On my birth certificate , my father listed " rancher " as his profession , though we never had more than 20 head of cattle .
We lived in a trailer and I remember many meals of Spam .
But after the ranch got going , we ended up eating very well on the farm 's bounty : wild venison , freshly picked strawberries and milk straight from the cow .
After my parents divorced , my sister and I went to live with my mom in rural Washington State .
A single mom raising us on the low income of a schoolteacher meant times were tough -- we had enough to eat but could n't afford name brand clothing or any extras .
My sister and I both got jobs before we were 14 .
When I was in high school , I always wanted to be a doctor : it meant money and status .
Later , on scholarship at the University of Washington , I realized that I wanted to be a writer instead .
My mom took it with grim humor : " What pays worse than a teacher ? " she laughed .
" A journalist . "
She was right , I 've never made over $ 25,000 a year working in publishing and then doing free - lance writing .
Then I started farming and any extra money has gone toward that .
It 's like I 'm drawn to poverty because it 's a comfortable place for me .
I 'll admit to feeling a strange glee when I look at my bank balance and it's at $ 6 .
There 's a tightrope - walking feeling about it .
Something awful but thrilling at the same time .
I would never know what to do if I actually had money .
I do n't save well , and spend money frivolously .
When I got my first advance for my book , I bought two goats .
Maybe I knew that they would literally eat up my income , that they would become like dependent children , always needing something .
The rest of the money , I put in the stock market -- at the highest point it had been in the Dow 's history .
You all know how that 's going .
Note to self
I 've never been a poor person who is able to hide the fact of my poverty , either .
I somehow always manage to stain my clothes , have a bad haircut , and drive cars that get more and more dilapidated .
I never learned how to take care of things because I 'm used to them disappearing .
The material world escapes me .
I 'm hopeful , though , like so many Americans .
Hopeful that this next month is going to be much better .
I even keep a running tally of things I will buy once I finally make some money ( in no particular order ) :
1. goat registration 2 . a burdizzo ( a castrating tool ) 3 . a disbudding iron 4 . new boots ( the ones I 'm wearing right now have a hole in the sole ) 5 . new Levis 6 . new bras ( all the elastic is gone in the three I have left ) 7 . a new mattress ( my boyfriend and I found the one we sleep on ) 8 . a dentist appointment 9 . a decent haircut
I send these things to myself via e-mail , because I 'll forget otherwise .
I figured out that the main reason I 'm running at a loss is because of the farm .
When I did my taxes in April , the receipts spoke for themselves .
I spend , I found , $ 60 a month on hay -- that 's $ 18 / bale from the local racetrack .
And that 's supplemented with tree branches and shrub clippings that I scrounge for .
A dairy feed supplement costs $ 30 per bag , sunflower seeds another $ 28 per bag , sweet feed ( a combo of corn , oats , barley and molasses ) is $ 25 .
Minerals , salt and kelp cost about $ 20 per month .
Udder wipes , teat dip , milk filters are another $ 15 month .
Cabbage and salt to make them sauerkraut : $ 5 per week .
Yes , they are my babies , and I love to feed them well .
The chickens and the rabbits are less expensive .
I spend about $ 20 a month on chicken feed and oyster shells ; the same on the rabbits .
From them I get eggs and meat -- which is more affordable than buying them from the store ( assuming a dozen eggs per week , organic eggs at $ 5 per dozen ; and $ 5 per pound for rabbit meat ) .
Still , I lose money : I could be eating rice and beans , right , not organic eggs and rabbit meat .
I partially justify it by the manure the animals make , which grows the vegetables .
And the animals are my entertainment , too .
The moment of truth
I arrived to the hospital 's barn just as the vet 's office opened .
I brought in Hedwig , who is a La Mancha goat with tiny ears and big blue eyes .
I had the vet look at her .
Her horns had gotten pretty big .
" We 'll have to put her under for the operation , " he said .
" How much will that cost ? " I asked , seized by fear .
" About $ 125 dollars , " he said .
That 's how much I had budgeted for all of the goats to get disbudded .
I shook my head , suddenly feeling very sorry for myself , and my goats .
" I can't afford that , " I said .
" Let me get the others for you to look at . "
I put Hedwig back in the truck and looked at the other two .
Ginger
Fox was my favorite goat -- would I have to decide which of them to disbud ?
I knew I could n't keep horned animals on the farm so whichever one I could n't afford to disbud , I would have to sell to someone .
I brought Ginger and Milky Way into the office .
I was lucky .
These other two were pure Nigerian Dwarf goats who had much smaller horn buds -- could be disbudded without gas , the vet told me .
I was relieved and brought them into the operating room .
They got shots of a general anesthetic into their horn area and he disbudded them quickly .
My bill came to $ 147 , and I wrote a check that I prayed had enough money in the account .
If I had disbudded earlier , like I had done the year before when I had more money than this year , it would have been $ 60 .
It 's a lesson that I learn over and over again , yet never remember : if you have money , you can do things well and save money .
If you have to wait because of financial troubles , you end up spending more .
It 's like that with cell phone minutes , vehicle registration , health care , and yes , animal husbandry .
On the drive back , the goats frisked around their dog crate as if nothing had happened , even though two of them had burn marks on their heads , I wondered what I would do with Hedwig .
It was a paradox -- her horns would grow and flourish , but they would mark her as dangerous and make her nearly worthless .
I felt a terrible bitterness at not having enough money .
And I know people will criticize me , as they criticize people with children they can't afford : why do you have them if you can't take care of them ?
I know I 'm being selfish and that I should plan ahead better , that I should get a real job , maybe that pays well .
But the joys of the farmer -- pulling carrots out of the earth , watching a newborn goat 's first steps , the soft clucking of chickens in the morning -- I can't let those go no matter how much it costs me .
Once we got home , the goatlings bleated from the back of the truck , and the mom goats called out to their babies from behind the fence .
This went on until I carried each of the babies back to its mother .
One still horned and soon to be taken away , two changed for the better so they could remain .
Their respective moms nuzzled the little goats ' heads and pretended not to notice anything had happened .

Auf die im Wortlaut bei der FAZ veröffentlichte ‚ Resolution ‘ ( ‚ Verleger fordern Schutz im Internet ‘ [ 1 ] ) antworte ich wie folgt :
Kaperbrief
Das Internet ist für die Gesellschaft eine große Chance .
Aber nur , wenn die digitalen Vertriebskanäle auch von allen gleichermaßen genutzt werden können und nicht die alten wirtschaftlichen Monopole auf das Internet übertragen werden .
Das ist derzeit gefährdet .
Zahlreiche Verleger sehen die möglich gewordene Vielfalt und Demokratisierung von Meinungsäußerungen und Veröffentlichungen ausschließlich als Bedrohung ihres bisherigen Geschäftsmodells an .
Sie verteidigen den Verkündungsjournalismus alter Prägung , der heutzutage konzentriert aus der Hand weniger milliardenschwerer Medienmogule kommt , mit den Worten Qualität und Unabhängigkeit , obwohl sie unisono falsche dpa-Meldungen ungeprüft abdrucken .
Wir treten deswegen entschieden dafür ein , das Mantra des geistigen Eigentums nicht als Argument gegen die unabänderlich notwendigen , gesellschaftlichen und rechtlichen Anpassungen an die Informationsgesellschaft zu akzeptieren .
Der Wandel findet statt .
Es gibt kein zurück .
Freier Zugang zu Wissen und Kultur war und ist die Grundlage unserer heutigen Gesellschaft .
Diejenigen , die dafür heutzutage institutionell die Hand aufhalten , sind Profiteure dieser Offenheit und wollen sie doch nicht mit ins Internet nehmen .
Aber der Nutzen der neuen Technik läßt sich nicht auf Berufsgruppen einschränken und das ist gut so .
Ebenso sind wir alle auch von den Nachteilen dieser Entwicklung betroffen , daher haben wir auch ein Recht , an den Vorteilen zu partizipieren .
Wer seine Informationen nicht von anderen genutzt haben möchte , sollte sie nicht uneingeschränkt im Internet veröffentlichen .
Die digitale Druckerpresse wird nicht mehr aus der Welt verschwinden , ebensowenig wie die Druckerpresse vor zweihundertdreißig Jahren durch respressive Gesetze aus der Welt geschafft werden konnte .
Und auch das ist gut so .
Wir begrüßen deshalb die wachsende Entschlossenheit der Menschen in Deutschland , sich diese rückwärtsgewandte Politik der Bundesregierung und der alten Parteien nicht mehr bieten zu lassen , und ihre Rechte weder im Internet noch sonstwo an die Bedingungen von Großkonzernen und Lobbyisten anpassen zu lassen .
Im Internet gibt es keine rechtsfreien Zonen .
Das Geschwätz vom ‚rechtsfreien Raum ‘ ist dümmliche Propaganda , mit der die internationale Einführung von Regelungen gefordert wird , die statt von Parlamenten allein von Konzernen geschrieben werden .
Die intransparente Beteiligung von multinationalen Konzernen am Zustandekommen von Gesetzen muss verboten bleiben und dies muss endlich wirksam durchgesetzt werden .
Wes Brot ich ess ‘ des Lied ich sing ‘. – Die Demokratie gedeiht durch Offenheit und Vielfalt , nicht durch Einschränkung und Medienkonzentration .
Wissen entsteht durch Neugier , nicht durch Bezahlung .
Am Ende wird auch im Internet gelten :
„ Es ist nichts neues unter der Sonne und die Geschichte wiederholt sich immer wieder .
Es geht nicht um die Kompensierung einer bestimmten Gruppe von Arbeitern .
Es geht um die Kontrolle von Kultur und Wissen , denn wer diese Dinge beherrscht , beherrscht die Welt . “ [ 1 ]

Charles Sanford " Charlie " Babbit is a self - centered Los Angeles - based automobile dealer / hustler / bookie who is at war with his own life .
Charlie , as a young teenager , used his father 's 1949 Buick convertible without permission and as a result , he went to jail for two days on account that his father reported it stolen .
It is then that Charlie learns that his estranged father died and left him from his last will and testament a huge bed of roses and the car while the remainder will of $ 3 Million goes into a trust fund to be distributed to someone .
Charlie seemed pretty angry by this and decides to look into this matter .
It seems as if that " someone " is Raymond , Charlie 's unknown brother , an autistic savant who lives in a world of his own , resides at the Walbrook Institute .
Charlie then kidnaps Raymond and decides to take him on a lust for life trip to the west coast as a threat to get the $ 3 Million inheritance .
Raymond 's acts and nagging , including repeated talks of " Abbott & Costello " , .

In a stretch of desert just north of the U.S. - Mexico border , men and women in khakis and the colors of the American flag recently gathered at a border watch post they call Camp Vigilance and discussed their next offensive in the nation ’s immigration wars .
The target : Illegal immigrants and their U.S. - born children who receive public benefits .
The plan : a California ballot initiative that would end public benefits for illegal immigrants , cut off welfare payments for their children and impose new rules for birth certificates .
“ We will be out in full force to qualify this initiative , ” said Barbara Coe , who helped develop Proposition 187 , the 1994 measure that would have ended benefits to illegal immigrants but was ruled unconstitutional .
“ Illegals and their children are costing the state billions of dollars .
It ’s invasion by birth canal . ”
Advertisement
Supporters of the initiative , recently unveiled by San Diego political activist Ted Hilton , hope to challenge the citizenship of children born in the United States to parents who are here illegally .
The 14th Amendment states that “ All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside . ”
Backers of the initiative argue that illegal residents are not “ subject to the jurisdiction ” of the United States and that , as a result , their U.S. - born children should not be citizens .
Before Hilton ,
Coe and their allies can argue that point in court , however , they have many hurdles to overcome .
Whether the initiative will even make it to the ballot remains to be seen .
Organizers have just begun to collect the 488,000 voter signatures required to qualify the measure for the June 2010 election .
So far , Hilton said , they have raised about $ 350,000 -- far short of the $ 4 million generally needed to pay signature gatherers to get a statewide initiative over that hurdle .
But illegal immigration was a powerful political issue in the economic downturn of the early 1990s , and the initiative ’s backers hope it will be again .
Hilton said the group is enlisting an “ enormous volunteer base ” for the signature gathering .
His organization , Taxpayer Revolution , has gathered endorsements from elected officials , including Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - Huntington Beach ) , the American Legion California chapter and immigration restrictionist groups such as NumbersUSA , Save Our State and Coe ’s California Coalition for Immigration Reform .

The drive coincides with decisions in several states -- including Oklahoma , Colorado Virginia , Arizona and Georgia -- to curtail medical care , mortgage loans , homeless shelter relief and other benefits for illegal immigrants amid the national economic downturn .
Officials estimate that California ’s 2.7 million illegal residents account for $ 4 billion to $ 6 billion of the state ’s roughly $ 105 - billion budget .
Most of those costs are associated with schools , prisons and emergency healthcare .
“ Are we going to continue asking taxpayers to pay for these services when the state is completely out of money ? ” asked Hilton , who first rallied against illegal immigration two decades ago .
Most illegal residents contribute to the state through taxes and labor , but research indicates that the costs to state and local governments outweigh the additional tax revenue , at least in the short term .

The nonpartisan state legislative analyst ’s office says the measure could reduce costs by more than $ 1 billion a year if it survives legal challenges .
Peter Schey , a Los Angeles attorney who successfully challenged Proposition 187 , said courts would almost certainly strike down the measure .
“ This proposal . . . has no chance of surviving a constitutional challenge , ” he said .
“ It is plainly driven by racism and a desire to whip up xenophobia during difficult economic times for U.S. citizens . ”
Backers say , however , that they have carefully crafted the measure to avoid the legal pitfalls that doomed Proposition 187 , which would have barred illegal immigrants from receiving any public social services , education and nonemergency medical care .
Voters approved it , 59 % to 41 % , but a federal judge ruled that the measure unconstitutionally usurped federal jurisdiction over immigration .

This time , backers worked with attorneys who have helped craft successful efforts to curtail benefits in other states .
The new measure does not claim any state authority to regulate immigration , said Mike Hethmon , an attorney with the Washington - based Immigration Reform Law Institute who advised the initiative ’s authors .
Instead , he said , it is based on federal authority delegated to the states to restrict access to benefits and verify applicants ’ eligibility .
Under the 1996 federal welfare reform law , illegal residents are barred from welfare , public housing , food assistance , unemployment aid and other federal benefits .
California laws , however , allow illegal residents to receive some state and local benefits , including nonemergency medical care .
The initiative would require all applicants for public benefits to verify their legal status .
And unlike Proposition 187 , it would not attempt to curtail access to education .
Advertisement
The Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that states could not bar illegal immigrant children from schools .
The measure ’s most controversial provisions would take aim at the U.S. - born children of illegal immigrants .
It would end state welfare to an estimated 48,000 households and 100,000 children , aid that now costs the state $ 640 million a year .
Currently , children of illegal immigrants can receive CalWorks benefits if their parents are poor enough to qualify for welfare .
About 42 % of child only ” cases in the CalWorks program involve illegal - immigrant parents , state officials say .
The measure would also cut off CalWorks payments to the children of citizens or legal residents who fail to meet eligibility requirements for state aid because they are unwilling to work , addicted to drugs or absent , among other reasons .

The initiative would require that applicants for birth certificates verify their legal status .
Those who could not would have to present official identification from a foreign government , a record of any publicly funded costs for delivering the child and other information before receiving their child ’s birth certificate , which would be marked with the notation “ foreign parent . ”
The records would be sent to Homeland Security officials .
Kristina Campbell , an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense & Education Fund in Los Angeles , said that provision is legally vulnerable .
“ You ca n’t deny a U.S. citizen child a birth certificate , ” she said .

“ They are entitled to equal protection of the law . ”
The views were different at Camp Vigilance , where many of the 300 people gathered for a Fourth of July program on illegal immigration flocked to sign the petition .
“ Coming here in violation of our laws is an act of disrespect , ” said Tony Dolz , a native Cuban and campaign volunteer .
“ Those who break our laws should not benefit from it . ”

For the past week and a half , we ’ve been hearing rumors citing various dates for the launch of AMD ’s DirectX 11 graphics cards … ranging from GDC in China to newly invented delays that would push the launch window in to November .
However , all of these rumors are false , given that AMD has firmed its “ Cinema 3.0 / DirectX 11 ” launch .
As tradition goes , the North American launch will happen in seven weeks in San Francisco [ sources disclosed Thursday , September 10th ] on a very special place indeed – but we ’re not at liberty to say where the event will take place .
All we can say is that it will be someplace that neither Intel nor nVidia would even remember .
ATI will catapult not one , but rather a complete DirectX 11 line - up into the orbit , ranging from $ 50 to the high end parts in their respective three - figure pricing brackets .
Just like the Radeon 4000 series , consisting out of 4400 , 4500 , 4600 , 4700 and 4800 parts , the new Radeon series will consist out of entry - level , mainstream , performance and high - end parts with one or two GPUs .
Note that not all of these parts will be launched on the same day .
Some parts might have to wait until Holiday season to get them in OEM - level numbers , but all in all – this is the strongest line - up ATI had in years .
We might even dare to say strongest line - up ever from any GPU manufacturer .
According to information we have at hand , initial rumors about the names and specs proved true – these parts bring DirectX 11 compliancy from top to the bottom , and if you want to play upcoming DirectX 11 games [ so far , there are six confirmed DX11 titles launching this year ] in a budget less than $ 500 , you have no other choice but to go ATI .
Update , July 29 , 2009 08:03 AM GMT – We received word that Chinese ChipHell website leaked an alleged image of a card belonging to Evergreen family .
According to information at hand , the card is a little bit longer than 2900XT , and features two six - pin connectors , just like the 3870 and 4870 .
Truth to be told , the length of a card would imply a dual - GPU solution to us .

You have stumbled on one of the old articles from our archive , for the latest articles we would recommend a click to our tech news category .
There you can find the latest technology news and much more .
Additionally , we take great pride in our Home Office section , as well as the best VPN one , so be sure to check them out as well .
1 . Write a story about some fantastic piece of technology that has lain undisturbed and undiscovered for millenia in some place that still maintains some of its mystery .
Consider the sands of Egypt , the moon , Mars , or even somewhere else altogether .
What does this piece of technology do ?
Who built and used it ?
Is it truly ancient , or did it end up in the distant past some other way ?
Is it the only one , or are there more ?
Is there a whole trove of “ ancient ” technology buried somewhere that only your story dares to tread ?
If the device (s ) are discovered , what happens to those who begin to tinker with them ?
Is the discovery merely the start of their adventure ?
2 .
What do you think of when you see garden gnomes ?
In classes I ’ve taught , I ’ve heard everything from “ They ’re just dumb ” to “ I bet they walk around at night and knife people ! ”
Come up with something creative , something fun , but something definitely about the secret lives of garden gnomes .
3 .
There are few things more powerful that an individual can do for the greater good than to willingly sacrifice him or herself in order to save or protect others ( At least , story - wise . )
Write a story about a person who chooses to sacrifice himself or herself , but be creative as to what exactly that sacrifice means .
What will the sacrificee be like afterwards ?
Dead ?
Comatose ?
Ethereal ?
What causes this change ?
What is the sacrifice ultimately meant to save ?
A people ?
An ideal ?
A way of life ?
There are about a thousand different ways to go with this – modern day , drama , fantasy , sci-fi , historical fiction , magic realism , etc.4 .
Make a list of things that frighten , disgust or terrify you .
They can be things as simple as spiders , rats and disease or as far out there as werewolves , Nazis and Cthulhu .
Whatever they are , put them down on paper and then consider them both individually and how they could be combined to create the driving element of horror for a story .
( Like a furry spiderbeast that makes a noise like a thousand angry rats and has fangs which drip contagion . )
Now , write your story .
Put pen to paper and create a horror masterpiece that addresses all that you truly fear .
5 .
Pick up the closest book and flip through it until you find a word that strikes you as “ cool ” ( Try a shorter one– you ’ll see why in a moment )
Now , consider what that word might stand for if it were being used as the acronym for a project , device , or organization .
Consider an example from my own Pink Carbide series– FLAIL ( Fellowship for the Liberation of Artificially Intelligent Lifeforms . )
Now , take your own completed acronym and write a story that features it .
Be creative , really think about what you could do with your word before you settle on any one idea .
6 .
Write a story about something mysterious that a character finds while poking around somewhere ( like at a yardsale or in an unused attic , etc . )
It could be anything , a bottle of wine , an old antique , a subtle knife or something even more mysterious or interesting .
Whatever it is , give it a certain significance that makes it interesting , if not downright magical .
7 . Read one ( 1 ) piece of short fiction by each of the following authors ( in this order ) Jorge Luis Borges , Storm Constantine , Rikki Ducornet , Brian Evenson , and Kate Braverman .
Now , write about your life .
Let yourself be inspired by the material you ’ve just read , see where the experience of reading these previous five authors takes you .
8 .
Sit down and take some time to create a map of a world that does n’t really exist .
Give it detail , consider the level of technology , how long the people have lived there , etc .
It does n’t have to be an entire globe– it can be as small of a “ world ” as a town or a city .
Now , once you ’ve finished , set a story there .
Use the map as a reference while you write , and use it to inspire new ideas you might not have otherwise come up with if you had n’t made the map .9 .
Write a story that encapsulates the experience of a generation or a decade .
Think about the changes that have occurred over time , the hairstyles , the music tastes , the mannerisms , what stays cool or uncool and what changes as time goes on , or just root your story firmly in the soil of a time that has long since passed .
Be creative , and feel free to work beyond the lines laid out by this prompt .
Combine stuff , do what feels awesome .
There are about a million ways you can take this .10 .
Everybody hates scammers , cheats , and people with no moral backbone .
Write a story about an especially nasty trickster with no qualms at all about screwing people over , no matter how bad off they may be , and then have that trickster caught and punished in whatever way you think is ultimately appropriate .
( Feel free to go as far with this as feels right . )
Mogadishu 's police chief has been killed as government forces attacked insurgent bases in the Somali capital .
Witnesses saw the bodies of at least eight people , mainly civilians , in the latest battle to convulse the city .
" This is the strongest fighting we 've seen in recent months , " one resident , Asha Mo'alim , told the BBC .
" We 're ducking in our rooms . "
Pro-government forces have been locked in fierce battles with radical Islamist guerrillas in the city since 7 May .
In Wednesday 's fighting , civilians could be seen running across the streets and sheltering by walls as heavy gunfire shook the Hodan area in south Mogadishu .
A mortar landed on my neighbour 's house and killed two people and injured four others

Mogadishu carnage devours families Somali rage at grave desecration Government police spokesman Colonel Abdulahi Hassan Barise said : " The regional police chief , Colonel Ali Said , was among the dead , God bless him . "
BBC East Africa correspondent Will Ross says the police chief 's death will be a significant setback for the pro-government forces as he had often been on the front line encouraging his colleagues to defend their positions .
Radical Islamist fighters wearing headscarves with ammunition belts draped over their shoulders were seen coming from areas on the outskirts of the capital to join their men in the battle .
In one area , the fighting reportedly sucked in peacekeepers from an African Union base , prompting them to fire tank shells at the rebel strongholds , however AU officials have denied any involvement .
" A mortar landed on my neighbour 's house and killed two people and injured four others , " said another resident , Abdiwali Dahir .
More than 120,000 people have been displaced by the recent violence " I have seen the dead bodies of three civilians recognised by the local residents , an Islamist fighter and a government soldier , lying in the street , " another resident , Farah Abdi , told the BBC by telephone , with the sound of heavy gunfire echoing in the background .
The latest bout of intense fighting has killed more than 250 people , civilians and combatants since it erupted last month .
More than 120,000 people have been displaced by the violence , according to the United Nations .
A combined force of radical Islamic militants , including al - Shabab , which is accused of links to al - Qaeda , has been trying to topple the fragile UN - backed government for three years .
A moderate Islamist president took office in Somalia in January but even his introduction of Sharia law to the strongly Muslim country has not appeased the guerrillas .
The country has not had an effective national government since 1991 .
Some four million people - a third of the population - need food aid , aid agencies say .

Article Index Virtual Memory Page Faults Page 1 of 2
Virtual memory is a way of pretending that your computer has more memory than it really has .
But like all good things it comes at a cost .
Virtual memory is an example of trading speed for storage .
Virtual memory is not an idea that occurs early in the development of computing - it is n't a fundamental computing idea .
It is more something that you need to make computing practical and so you could consider it a detail of implementation .
However it is based on some fundamental computing principles and it is used by all but the simplest computers .
Virtual memory is that it is something that only makes sense after you have quite a lot of very specific technology implemented and working .
In particular , you need to have a range of different types of memory components offering different performance at different costs .
Usually a computer has a relatively small amount of fast storage which is directly coupled to the CPU and a much larger amount of storage that is slower to access .
This split is usually referred to as primary and secondary storage .
You do n't start thinking about inventing virtual memory until you have build a machine that has both types of memory and where the secondary memory is reasonably fast and cheap .
Virtual memory seems to have been thought up by Tom Kilburn around 1960 while working on the Manchester series of computers – but I ’m sure someone will tell me that it was invented much earlier by someone else .
Overlay programming
Before the days of virtual memory it became clear that we had to find a way to run programs that were larger than the memory available .
This gave rise to " overlay " programming an art that has more - or - less died out .
Even in the early days of computing the cost of memory was high compared to the cost of slower disk or drum based storage .
So there you are sitting in front of your new computer and it has a main memory of around 4 K bytes say and a disk of a few 100 Kbytes .
At first the programs that you write are easy to fit into the 4 K bytes and larger systems can be built as a “ suite ” of programs which can be run on demand .
Sooner or later , though , you are going to reach the point where the programs that you really want to run are larger than 4 K bytes and the obvious solution is to break them into chunks smaller than 4 K Bytes and arrange for the modules to be loaded into memory as needed .
Notice that you ca n’t just load the program modules from disk you also have to arrange to save modules that have done some work so that they can be restored at the point that they were interrupted .
This is called “ overlay ” programming and it was the standard way of running a large program on a small machine for many years .
It worked but its big disadvantage was that its effectiveness depended on the skill of the programmer to break the application into non-interacting chunks .
You also had to arrange for the operating system to load and unload chunks of code and this had to be specified as part of the program .
It was a very manual system and very prone to errors and inefficiencies .
We needed something better .
Logical and physical address spaces
Overlay programming is a software system but the general idea of loading only what is needed when it is needed can automated with the help of some additional hardware .
First we need to recognize the fact that from the programmer ’s point of view what matters is the machine ’s “ address space ” .
This is the range of addresses that might be used in a program .
Since the early days of computing a machine ’s address space has n’t actually coincided with the RAM available on any given machine – i.e. some addresses may be empty .
For example , a modern Pentium typically has a 36 - bit address space , i.e. 64 Gbytes .
( The actual addressing details of the Pentium design are slightly complicated so this is more like a theoretical estimate . )
Despite the fact that RAM is cheap , most machines do n’t have sufficient RAM to fill their address space and so most of it is empty .
It turns out to be very helpful to separate the address a programmer uses to specify a memory location , the “ logical address ” , from the actual “ physical address ” that some RAM is wired to respond to .
At first this seems like a crazy idea !
Why complicate matters in this way ?
It turns out to be a key idea in the design of a modern computer .
It is a good idea to use logical and physical addressing because you can arrange a mapping between the two to pretend that you actually have more memory than is available .
You can think of it as a trick where any logical address that a programmer attempts to use is automatically mapped to a physical address where the memory actually lives .
You may have only 1 GBytes of physical memory in your Pentium but by arranging the mapping of logical to physical memory it can appear to be anywhere in the 64 G byte logical address space .
It ’s a bit like having memory that can slide about to fill any hole in the address space you care to use .
Translation tables Sounds good but how is the mapping from logical to physical addresses carried out ?
The simple answer is that it is done by a lookup table implemented in hardware .
A table in RAM is used to store the physical location of any logical address you care to use .
Obviously you can’t have a lookup table that stores the location of every logical address – this would use all of the physical memory up just keeping track of where everything is !
To make it work memory has to be divided up into pages – the Pentium typically uses 4 K Byte pages for example ( but this can be varied ) .
The physical address of the start of each 4 K Byte page is stored in a table and all logical addresses within a 4 K Byte region are mapped to the same 4 K Byte physical page .
So now the table , the page table , stored in memory controls the position of 4 K Byte pages of physical RAM in the logical address space .
The operating system has to work out how to set the page table up so that an application program can be loaded into memory correctly and runs correctly but this is not a huge problem .
Logical to physical addresses via the translation table < ASIN:0131429388 > < ASIN:0131453483 >
Anyone who 's seen Japanese comics , cartoon videos , anime art or - Lady Gaga 's " Bad Romance " video - will instantly be struck by the uncommon look of the girls - big eyes that , by making the rest of the face look small , add the cuteness and sex appeal prized by many Japanese men .
Since no amount of cosmetic surgery will make actual human eyes larger , some girls are trying another way to up their cute quotient : extra - wide contact lenses !
These are no ordinary contacts - they 're not only tinted , but tinted prominently in the extra - wide outer ring .
The result is the appearance of a bigger , wider iris .
To quote the sales copy , " Wanna get big , watery shiny eyes without any surgery ?
CRAVE AND ENVY NO MORE ! "
The extra - wide contact lenses are made by a variety of companies including Geo and Dueba , and cost in the $ 30 - $ 50 per pair range .
It seems they 're not just cosmetic - send in your prescription and the lenses will be made to order .
Optometrists such as Drs. North & Watson would like to remind potential buyers of Big Circle , Baby Doll or other glamorous anime - style contact lenses that these and ALL contact lenses " are a medical device , thus monitored by the FDA , " and improper fitting can cause irreparable damage to the wearer 's eye or eyes !
This lens site has a great collection of crazy contact lenses for you to check out , including some anime contact lenses in their Anime and Fantasy section .
As well , the site featuring Big Circle contact lenses sells a few other beauty aids including a painful - sounding " nose clipper " that demands a posting of its own - keep a big , watery , shiny eye on this blog !

OFFICIALLY , IT ’S CALLED the Mérida Initiative , but critics have another name for the three - year , $ 1.4 billion plan to fight the drug war , unveiled by George W. Bush and Mexican president Felipe Calderón in 2007 .
They ’ve dubbed it Plan Mexico , a reference to Plan Colombia , the controversial US - funded drug eradication effort ; under the $ 6 billion ( and counting ) program , the production of Colombian cocaine has actually increased .
Critics say Mérida is destined to be just as ineffective and may contribute to rampant human rights abuses by Mexican authorities , and provide US military training to soldiers notorious for ending up on the payrolls of the cartels .
Though the plan does direct some funds toward reforming Mexico ’s corrupt justice system , the bulk of the money is slated for military training and hardware — equipment ranging from surveillance planes and Black Hawk helicopters to ion scanners and X - ray vans ( to see inside other vehicles ) .
By law , all of the funds must be spent by the US government , in the US , on US suppliers and contractors — a fact not lost on the private sector .
Almost none of the money has been disbursed yet , but DynCorp International , the Virginia - based military contractor with a history of controversy in Colombia and Iraq , has already begun advertising for a Mérida Initiative “ Program Director . ”
Mexicans are already wary of private security contractors .
Last July , videos surfaced showing security consultants training members of an elite Mexican police unit in what appeared to be torture techniques .
( Officers are seen squirting water up a man ’s nose and forcing a trainee to roll through his own vomit . )
Since Calderón mobilized the military against the cartels in December 2006 , complaints to the Mexican National Commission of Human Rights have skyrocketed , from 182 in 2006 to 1,230 in 2008 .
“ There ’s a very clear correlation between the increased deployment of the military and increased human rights violations , ” says Stephanie Brewer of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Human Rights Center in Mexico City .
Allegations have included rape , sexual abuse , torture , and , in 28 cases , murder .
In 2007 , two women and three children died in a hail of bullets when they failed to stop at a checkpoint in Sinaloa .
“ The soldiers ’ response , given their military training , was to fire on the vehicle , ” says Maureen Meyer of the Washington Office on Latin America .
“ Police and the military are not interchangeable .
Mexican armed forces should not be involved in anti-drug operations . ”
But the biggest risk in providing Mexican soldiers with US training is the career progression from Army grunt to cartel henchman .
More than 120,000 soldiers have deserted since 2000 , with many taking more lucrative jobs with the cartels .
The Zetas , who started as Gulf cartel enforcers and now provide muscle to various cartels , were formed by Army veterans .
A better strategy might be to concentrate on the factors that are fueling the drug war .
Yet nothing in the Mérida Initiative addresses American drug use or the smuggling of US weapons into Mexico .
In fact , though presented as a binational agreement , “ it contains not one single obligation on the part of the United States , ” says Laura Carlsen of the Center for International Policy .
Rep. Eliot L. Engel , the New York Democrat who chairs the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere , acknowledges this flaw .
But he pushed for its passage anyway .
“ It ’s the only game in town , ” he says .
“ You have Mérida , or you do n’t have anything . ”
Engel is hopeful the new administration will formulate a broader strategy ; a hint came during Hillary Clinton ’s first visit to Mexico as secretary of state , when she said that “ our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade . ”
It ’s worth noting that the cocaine trade only moved to Mexico after Caribbean routes were choked off and the Colombian cartels were reduced to suppliers .
Could success in Mexico displace the problem again ?
Mexican attorney general Eduardo Medina - Mora expressed concern in April that “ our victory may very well mean that Central America becomes a hell of its own . ”
Congress apparently agrees , recently increasing Mérida funding for Central America , the Dominican Republic , and Haiti .
So far , Mérida is mostly talk .
One of the few projects to reach fruition was a conference on arms trafficking at a resort in Cuernavaca .
What came of this meeting of the minds ?
According to Medina - Mora : “ an agreement to create a joint working group that could produce a timely report . ”

Is North Korea pwning teh intertubes ?
According to Associated Press reports here and here , both US Federal websites and South Korean governmental websites are undergoing constant denial of service attacks , which has effectively removed these sites from the Internet .
Affected are the websites for the US Treasury Dept , Federal Trade Commission and Transportation Department .
Further , South Korea reports the presidential Blue House , the Defense Ministry , the National Assembly , Shinhan Bank , Korea Exchange Bank and top Internet portal Naver have undergone DOS attacks for the same period .
The attacks have been sustained over three days , which is unusual for this kind of internet attack .
Network World reports the list of IP addresses sending out bogus traffic numbers 50,000 and according to a quoted security expert is using 10 - 20 GB of bandwidth per second , or ten times greater an amount than the average DDOS attack .
Although there is no evidence at this time of the attack ’s source , the seemingly simultaneous targeting of US and South Korean sites brings to mind the common political enemy of both countries , North Korea .
Even though Internet infrastructure in that country is poor , mounting a DDOS attack using a botnet does not use local bandwidth and does n’t need widespread local infrastructure .
In a denial - of - service ( DOS ) attack , a website is targeted with millions of false requests for web pages until the targeted website can no longer respond to legitimate requests for pages , effectively removing that website from service .
A plain DOS attack has a single vector – that is , the fake traffic comes from a single or small range of IP addresses , and as such can be stopped by the targeted web site ’s owner blocking all requests that come from the offending IP addresses .
But the three - day length of the attacks strongly suggests that the attacks are in fact distributed DOS ( DDOS ) attacks , from which there is no effective defense .
Under a DDOS attack , the false traffic requests come from hundreds or thousands of machines located physically all over the world .
Due to the high number of machines that are the source of the false requests , blocking all the IP addresses to stem the flow of bogus traffic becomes nearly impossible .
Often , these machines comprise a botnet , a name given to an ad hoc network of machines – personal , work , school – that have had their own security compromised , and who follow instructions from the party that compromised the security in the first place .
Large botnets capable of sustained DDOS attacks have been a reality since ever since huge numbers of consumer operating system machines around the world such as those running Microsoft Windows have been left attached to the Internet full - time on DSL or cable modem .
An attacker can compromise the security of such a machine and leave upon it a “ bot ” process , which is software that quietly and invisibly waits for instructions from the controller of the botnet .
Botnets have been sold on the black market , used in DDOS attacks , used to spread worms and viruses and remain a real feature of the Internet that leverages consumer ignorance and the Internet technical architecture into a potentially devastating weapon that threatens whatever sites it wants whenever it wants .
UPDATE 1
A post at Comodo.com identifies a targeted host list as well as the Windows malware that is used in the botnet attack : Additionally , the poster says the IP addresses that the attacks are coming from are located inside China .
DDOS attack files .
filename : msiexec2.exe

On Thursday of last week , the Federal Reserve ’s vice chairman , Donald Kohn , threatened to jack up interest rates if Congress continues to expose “ some of the U.S. central bank ’s most sensitive decisions to political scrutiny , ” Reuters reported .
“ Any substantial erosion of the Federal Reserve ’s monetary independence likely would lead to higher long - term interest rates as investors begin to fear future inflation , ” Kohn told a House of Representatives Financial Services subcommittee .
Kohn ’s threat came as Ron Paul ’s bill to audit the Federal Reserve ( HR 1207 ) has picked up 256 co-sponsors — more than 55 % of the House of Representatives .
HR 1207 ’s companion bill in the Senate , S 604 , has already attracted 8 co-sponsors .
Kohn and his boss Ben Bernanke are obviously very concerned over the prospect that the American people may soon have a look at their books .
Ron Paul : “ political shenanigans ” going on with the Fed .
Kohn went before Congress as debate rages over Obama ’s plan for “ regulatory reform , ” in effect granting the Fed power to gobble up companies in national socialist fashion and consolidate banking and securities across the board .
In order to quell outrage over this brazen power grab , Obama and his bankster advisers propose a token council of regulators advise the Fed .
On June 16 , Goldman Sachs operative Timothy Geithner said : “ When you have too many people involved , there ’s an accountability problem . ”
In other words , Congress and the American people need to mind their own business .
The Federal Reserve is an institution owned by the bankers , not the American people .
“ Some people think the Federal Reserve Banks are the United States government ’s institutions , ” Louis T. McFadden , Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency in 1932 during the “ Great Depression , ” had entered into the Congressional Record .
“ They are not government institutions .
They are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign swindlers . ”
McFadden ’s international swindlers are running scared from HR 1207 and public anger over last year ’s engineered financial crisis and Fed- orchestrated “ bailouts ” of investment bank Bear Stearns and insurer American International Group .
“ The Federal Reserve strongly believes that removing the statutory limits on GAO audits of monetary policy matters would be contrary to the public interest by tending to undermine the independence and efficacy of monetary policy , ” said Kohn .
He said accountability to the people would “ cast a chill ” on monetary policy deliberations held in secret behind closed doors .
[ efoods ] Kohn then threatened to jack up interest rates .
“ The bond rating agencies view operational independence of a country ’s central bank as an important factor in determining sovereign credit ratings , suggesting that a threat to the Federal Reserve ’s independence could lower the Treasury ’s debt rating and thus raise its cost of borrowing . ”
Bernanke ’s underling made no bones about the fact Paul ’s bill is a direct threat to the “ independence ” of the Federal Reserve .
“ History provides numerous examples of non-independent central banks being forced to finance large government budget deficits .
Such episodes invariably lead to high inflation , ” he said .
“ Given the current outlook for large federal budget deficits in the United States , this consideration is especially important . ”
Talk about doublespeak .
In fact , the Federal Reserve is all about huge federal budget deficits and a mounting federal debt .
The Federal Reserve was established in 1913 by the banksters for the purpose of creating debt - based money secured by thin air .
The American people are seriously and terminally indebted to the bankers and currently owe over $ 400 billion a year in interest alone , with no hope of every paying off the principal , which is in the tens of trillions .
In 1910 , before the passage of the Federal Reserve Act , the federal debt was a mere $ 1 billion , or $ 12.40 per citizen .
Now the overall debt is over 80 % of the annual output of the entire U.S. economy , as measured by the gross domestic product .
When government “ obligations ” are considered , the debt balloons to an astronomical $ 56 trillion , or roughly $ 184,000 per American , according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation .
It is simple , really — the larger the debt , the richer and more powerful the international bankers become .
The Federal Reserve is their front organization and it runs roughshod over Congress .
The passage of HR 1207 is not certain and it faces an even more strenuous uphill battle in the Senate .
It is , at this point , our only practical hope of auditing the Fed , revealing its numerous crimes , exposing its mega - grand theft scams , and delivering Donald Kohn , his boss Bernanke , and the minions of the international banksters to justice .

Sit back , relax and enjoy television without high cable prices .

Although you can't use Netflix and Hulu to gain access to all the content available through cable TV , their low - cost subscriptions and huge TV show and movie libraries make them affordable cable alternatives .
To save money , you need to evaluate their offerings and your television viewing habits , and then pick the options that best fit your needs .
Netflix vs. Hulu
Netflix is a paid service that provides programs without commercial interruptions .
Typically , Netflix does n't offer up - to - date episodes from current TV shows except for some new Netflix Original Series episodes and seasons .
Hulu provides both free and paid services .
However , at the time of publication , the content of both services is ad - supported and only a few select programs are commercial - free .
Current episodes usually become available within a day or week after they air , but many episodes are only accessible with Hulu Plus or a cable subscription .
You can create a watch list , display a history of your previously viewed content and receive " expiring soon " notifications on both Netflix and Hulu .
Streaming Considerations
Netflix and Hulu offer thousands of programs for about $ 10 a month per service , but they do n't always save money .
For example , they wo n't save you money if you continue to watch new content on one or more of the premium cable channels .
Additionally , some Internet service providers suffer network congestion and delayed services , force bandwidth caps on their customers or actively interfere with streaming speeds .
If you watch a lot of television , slow speeds and higher Internet access costs can negate any savings gained from Netflix 's and Hulu 's low subscription prices .
If you do n't already have a smart TV or a streaming player , you may need to add one , unless you plan to use the services only on a computer or mobile device .
Trial Offers
Try both streaming video services using free trials to determine their potential as cable replacements .
You can try out Netflix for one month and Hulu Plus for a week to a month , depending on the available promotion , without paying for a subscription although you are asked to provide your credit card information .
Go to each website ( links in Resources ) , follow the on - screen instructions to sign up and then compare their programs and end - of - trial pricing to your cable channel lineup , viewing habits and cable pricing .
Make a list of programs you currently watch that the services do n't offer and note any you 're willing to give up to save money .
You can save additional money by picking only one service , so compare the programs offered on Netflix to the free and paid ones on Hulu .

Review of Dogfish Head 60 - Minute IPA and Dogfish Head 90 - Minute IPA , 120 - Minute IPA , hoppy beer
Dogfish Head 60/90 Minute IPAs : Hops done right
Beer Reviews / Food & Drink Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
I should start out by saying I 'm not normally a big fan of all those over hopped " extreme " beers that have become all the rage lately .
I think people claim to love them in a sort of macho , " I 'm drinking the beeriest of beers " fashion that borders -- and often goes beyond -- pure snobbery .
They 're like chicken wings .
Certain people search out and are proud to eat the ones that are napalm - sauced hot with complete disregard for flavor and enjoyment .
I definitely love spicy wings , and there are times when I want a beer that leans heavier on the hops to keep it bitter , crisp and dry .
But , too much is often way too much .
Then there 's Dogfish Head .
Like several things in my life lately , I have held a bit of an irrational personal prejudice against them only to find , try as I might , I actually like them .
Dogfish Head brews 60 - minute , 90 - minute and now even 120 - minute IPAs that are much better than my cynical imagination would have preferred them to be .
They are n't interchangeable , exactly .
As a rule of thumb , if you 're having several stick to the 60 ( right ) , have the 90 ( below ) with a meal , and try the 120 if you are adventurous and like the other two .
The 120 is over the top by anyone 's definition .
It has something like 20 % alcohol and 120 IBUs -- an acquired taste to be sure , if anybody in their right mind would want to acquire such a taste .
I 'll just consider the 60 and 90 here .
They both have an abundance of hops .
If you do n't like hops at all , you wo n't like either of these beers .
They do n't pretend to be balanced , but neither are among those tongue pounding , absurd hop - monsters that are more punishing than enjoyable .
Both beers are hazy .
I 'm more inclined to think it 's hops floating around in them rather than the usual yeast , though .
They both tend towards the orange side of golden .
The 90 minute has a creamier head , but both hold considerable lacing .
The hops fill both beers with piney , citrus ( especially grapefruit ) , and floral aromas and tastes , with a dollop of raisins and bread in the 90 - minute .
That one also has a creamy sweetness that smooths out some of the rough edges , and all the alcohol in it gives it a warm finish as opposed to the lip - smacking , dry bitterness of the 60 .
The 60 minute has 6 % alcohol , while the 90 packs 9 % .
Plan accordingly .
I was lucky enough to sample the 90 - minute hooked up to a device called the Randall .
As if the hops the beer naturally comes with is not quite enough , this set - up holds a batch of fresh hops that the beer is pulled through on the way from the tap to the glass .
This infusion gives it a fresh , grassy , herbal hop taste rather than just increasing the bitter flavor that is already there .
If you have the opportunity , this is the best way to sample the beer .
Both 60 and 90 tend to be a little more harsh from a bottle than they are from a tap .
Those hot wings are the best accompaniment for the 60 minute , but if you 're having a real meal , go with the 90 .
It pairs up well with most manly foods -- anything spicy , grilled or barbecued .
Stay away from tame flavors or either of these beers will just trample all over them .
Dogfish Head shows that the over - hopped science experiments many of the breweries are passing off to the extreme hop - heads are misguided and wrong .
It is possible to make a beer with plenty of hop taste and remain enjoyably drinkable and tasty .
Stay away from all the pretenders that just want to impress you with the all the IBUs they can cram into a bottle , flavor be damned .
In these two ales , Dogfish Head supplies all the IBUs anybody could want , and still manages to make it taste good .
BANFF , Alberta ( Reuters ) -
The way Daniel Yergin sees it , the high - stakes debate over energy security in the U.S. presidential campaign has ignored one of the most critical parts of the United States ’ oil supply equation : Canada .
Heavy equipment mines the oil tar sands at Syncrude 's Aurora mine near Fort McMurray , Alberta in this May 23 , 2006 file photo .
REUTERS / Todd Korol / Files
The United States ’ neighbor to the north has quietly become its largest foreign oil and gas supplier , and that has actually improved energy security in the United States , said Yergin , energy and geopolitical analyst , Pulitzer Prize - winning author and chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates .
Meanwhile , Canada ’s oil industry is struggling at home to keep boosting production of the country ’s vast oil sands while facing major new environmental and cost hurdles , Yergin said .
“ People debate oil imports , but what they do n’t know is 22 percent of oil imports come from Canada , that 13 percent of our natural gas comes from Canada .
Imports of energy from Canada need to be seen in the larger context of the trade and investment network that ties the two countries together , ” he said in an interview in the mountain resort of Banff , Alberta .
“ This shows interdependence at work . ”
Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Barack Obama and Republican candidate Sen. John McCain often preach the need to break the U.S. dependence on foreign oil , evoking images of governments hostile to the United States , like those in Iran and Venezuela , profiting from American economic woes .
But with oil , gas and coal likely to remain the biggest energy sources for at least another two decades , the United States will require foreign supply , said Yergin , best known for his book on oil - industry history : “ The Prize : the Epic Quest for Oil , Money and Power . ”
“ Energy independence is a very powerful symbol because it seems to carry the U.S. back to where it was in the 1960s , but the reality is energy is part of a larger network of trade and investment , and it seems to me that the real question that needs to be addressed is energy security , ” he said .
ENERGY BORDER BLURRED
Canada ’s oil sands represent the largest deposits of crude outside the Middle East .
With more than $ 100 billion worth of projects planned and under way , the country is one of just a handful in the Americas expected to boost output in a big way .
In recent years , the border between the United States and Canada has become increasingly blurred in energy , with U.S. companies , like Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Devon Energy Corp DVN.N , investing billions of dollars in Alberta oil sands projects , and Canadian companies , such as EnCana Corp ECA.TO and Husky Energy Inc HSE.TO , buying into U.S. refineries .
Pipeline capacity keeps expanding , pushing Canadian crude now as far south as the U.S. Gulf Coast , where supplies of Venezuelan and Mexican crude have waned .
Far from being worrisome in the United States , the meshing of energy economies is largely unknown by the general public , and has scarcely entered the election campaign , Yergin said .
The timeline of “ The Prize ” ends during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 .
Yergin has updated the sweeping history in an edition to be published in December that includes the rise of Canada as a major supplier as part of a “ fact - based roadmap ” explaining the current U.S. energy situation , he said .
“ It ’s to say we need a more realistic appraisal of the U.S. relationship to the world energy markets , and , in fact , what is the key role of Canada , ” he said .
A big part of Canada ’s rise has been due to the development of technology that has made the oil sands a realistic commercial prospect after decades of experiment , he said .
But the industry now faces a combination of massive cost pressures , due to tight labor supplies and rising materials costs , as well as a full - court press by environmental groups seeking to hammer home the impacts on air , water , land and communities strained by the investment boom .
Warnings of Canada ’s “ dirty oil ” have been heard in Washington , forcing the Alberta government and the energy sector to mount their own public relations campaigns .
“ This is an important question because it ’s an environmental question , it ’s also an energy security question and it could be a fundamental question in Canada - U.S. relations , ” he said .
“ It needs to be handled properly or it could have a very disruptive impact on one of the United States ’ most critical relationships . ”

We were only going to be able to withstand so many
In the Valley of Elahs and Home of the Braves before someone finally cranked out a film about the Iraq war that was actually truly great .
I ’m more than thrilled to say that Kathryn Bigelow ’s The Hurt Locker is absolutely that film .
It is far and away the most powerful and affecting movie I have seen all year and is likely to stay that way .
You ’ve probably started hearing something about this movie , as it ’s beginning to make a bit of noise .
It ’s already made quite the impression on critics , but more than that I think this movie has the power to capture audiences all over the country and become a big hit .
It ’s thoroughly enthralling from the first frame to the last and will surely have you on the edge of your seat at many a moment , but there ’s something more to it –something smarter and contemplative yet wholly accessible , and that ’s what ’s so amazing and important about this film .
First off , let it be said that the film is not preachy in the least bit–that ’s not what it ’s here to do .
It ’s not a political film , and it ’s not about making some kind of heady pretentious statement about the current war that will have no significance in twenty years .
You wo n’t find anything in this film to be pushing an agenda or an ideology of any sort .
That is , not unless you consider “ war is hell ” to be an ideology rather than a given–and a given is exactly what it is in The Hurt Locker .
“ War is hell ” is the presupposition of the film , which is about exploring what it takes–or maybe who it takes –to be able to withstand that kind of hell and come out ready for more .
The who in this movie is an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team ( or bomb sqaud , if you prefer ) of the U.S.
Army in today ’s Iraq war .
We follow them around during the last 38 days of their tour .
Staff Sergeant William James ( Jeremy Renner ) has been brought in to replace the team ’s previous captain , who was killed when a roadside bomb was detonated before he was able to escape the kill zone .
Under his command are Specialists J.T. Sanborn ( Anthony Mackie ) and Owen Eldridge ( Brian Geraghty ) , and they are both quite taken aback by the dangerous ways in which James goes about handling the tense and terrifying situations that they have to deal with on a daily basis .
James has a rough attitude and an unshakable determination for completing his job , and sometimes comes close to getting everyone killed .
We ride with the three of them on their daily routines and watch as they continually face life - or - death situations .
At first , it sounds a little bit familiar , but I assure you that it ’s not .
This is an experience not exactly comparable to any war film I ’ve seen in recent years .
As far as a basic plot goes , it ’s a bit on the episodic side , but I mean that in a good way .
For this movie , it ’s entirely appropriate and all the better for it , as well .
The Hurt Locker is very much about exploring the day - to - day of war , in the context of the real human lives that are constantly at stake .
On the surface , Kathryn Bigelow ’s film is a taut and pulse - pounding action film , but it ’s the intimate combat and the pervasive air of suspense –the action - based elements of the movie–that not only breathe life into the film , but are the key to its profound importance .
I hate to have to bring back my anti-Transformers rant all over again , but this is the textbook example of what great cinematic action is–action that is founded on the idea that we should actually care about who and what is at stake , and should be affected by each minor scrape to every major explosion that occurs or even merely threatens to occur .
Pushing aside the label of “ action film , ” which might seem demeaning , but should n’t ( blame Michael Bay ) , as a “ war film , ” I ’ve seen few quite as powerful as this one .
I ’ve never seen any kind of combat myself –I ’m not in the military , hell , I ’ve never even been outside the United States–but I know what fear is , and this movie captures the fear of war in a way that I ’ve never seen anything else try and tackle before : the constant knowledge that every day you ’re out there , you are as close to the end as you ’ve ever come .
People die in war every day , as Eldridge observes .
“ Why not me ? ”
Bigelow pays respect to the soldiers and their courage like no other film has been able to before .
She knows that the best way to honor them is not to glorify them in broad strokes of overzealous pomposity , but by simply–and straightforwardly –showing them doing what it is they are there to do .
And damn , is it pretty harrowing .
It ’s an exhausting film with its suspense , its power , and its unflinching sadness and desperation .
It ’s not always easy to watch , but it is always nothing short of gripping and important filmmaking .
Performances in the film are fantastic from everyone involved .
Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are both outstanding in their roles of the hard - ass and the sheepish guy , respectively .
Their are even a few brief cameos from Guy Pearce , Ralph Fiennes , and David Morse , that are all very good –especially Morse .
But , it ’s Renner ’s movie all the way .
His character is so perfectly realized and genuine at every turn , that you ca n’t take your eyes off of him .
He was nominated for last year ’s Independent Spirit Award for his role in this film , and rightfully so .
This year we might be seeing him up for some Oscar gold .
The Hurt Locker is one hell of a great film .
It has the makings of a classic and scenes that will stay burned in your memory and be discussed at length for years .
By not getting bogged down in pre-dated preachiness , Bigelow creates a timeless and absorbing portrait of the horrors of war and the daily sacrifices being made by those fighting it .
It ’s reminiscent of Henri-Georges Clouzot ’s The Wages of Fear in the way that it uses such a simple and common genre technique as white - knuckle suspense to illustrate an unimaginable real - life horror .
I ’ve always enjoyed Bigelow ’s films in the past , but this one is a truly remarkable accomplishment .
With that Best Picture playing field now opened up to ten nominees , I should hope that we ’ll be seeing The Hurt Locker popping up in there ( though it would undoubtedly deserve final five status , as well ) .
If not , Oscar and I will be having some issues .
Looking back , it 's pretty miraculous that I 've lived to be as old as I am .
When I was born , my mom brought me home from the hospital in her arms , not a car seat .
The playground equipment at my elementary school was surrounded by asphalt , not mulch or woodchips .
Bicycle helmets were strictly for Evel Knievel , and seat belts were an expensive option on most cars .
The toy industry only fueled our penchant for danger ; take a look at some of these commercials :
1. Sixfinger
My younger brother had one of these , and I 'm here to tell you that that tiny gun had some serious firepower " “ those little plastic bullets hurt like heck !
( You think your average seven - year - old boy is going to pay attention to the package disclaimer that warned against aiming the Sixfinger at human targets ? )
One of the bullets could be equipped with a cap , which exploded on impact if fired at your big sister 's shoe just so .
2. Swing Wing
The Transogram Company had been producing mainstream toys such as tiddly - winks and doctor kits since 1959 .
Then one day in 1965 the vice - president of product development , whose brother - in - law was an out - of - work chiropractor , came up with the idea for the Swing Wing .
( OK , I made that last part up . )
Nothing says " fun "  like a cerebral hemorrhage , so Swing Wing was eventually pulled from the market , leaving kids searching for a new fun way to get their spinal injuries on .
3. Slip " ˜n Slide
Wham - O introduced the Slip " ˜n Slide in 1961 , a time when neighborhood swimming pools were few and far between and water slide theme parks were non-existent .
The idea was to cool off and have fun at the same time by running up to and then belly - flopping down on a water - slicked length of vinyl .
Wham - O sold millions of Slip " ˜n Slides over the years , and if a kid broke a toe on one of the stakes that secured the mat to the ground or left most of their epidermis on the driveway because they slid too far , well , as Mom always said " It 's your own fault , do n't come crying to me . " 
It was n't until the more litigious 1990s that words like " spinal cord injury "  and " death "  started appearing in the lengthy list of warnings included on the Slip " ˜n Slide instruction sheet .
4. Johnny Seven One Man Army
No wonder kids today get in so much trouble " “ it 's those no - good video games they 're always playing .
Nothing but shooting and street fighting and an overall culture of violence .
Not like the toys of the 1960s .
Back then we had wholesome products like the Johnny Seven One Man Army , which was the biggest - selling boy 's toy of 1964 .
Johnny Seven came equipped with a cap pistol , rocket launcher , and " armor piercing "  bullets , along other with a few other features necessary for stopping Communism dead in its tracks .
Johnny Seven weighed about four pounds fully assembled , so a kid got a good aerobic workout when he ran around toting one outside in the fresh air and sunshine .
Topper Toys used a unique tactic to give Johnny Seven maximum exposure ; instead of only stocking it in toy and department stores , they also made it available in grocery stores , a place mom usually dragged her kids to at least once per week .
5. Water Wiggle
It looked innocent enough , but if your neighborhood had good water pressure and some joker turned the hose on full blast , Wham - O's Water Wiggle turned into a semi-lethal weapon .
It danced and bobbed erratically and wrapped around you like a boa constrictor .
And that plastic head was heavy -- but bloody noses and chipped teeth were a small price to pay for some cool fun in the summer time .
6. Creepy Crawlers
An exposed hot plate combined with potentially toxic fumes equaled fun in 1964 .
The Thing Maker was a gadget you plugged in and then waited until it heated up to 300 Â°F .
Then you poured " Plasti - Goop "  into the creepy insect - shaped metal molds and waited for them to heat - set .
Ideally , you were supposed to wait until after you 'd unplugged the Thing Maker and it had cooled off before removing your Creepy Crawlers , but who has time for that when you want to put a fake spider in your sister 's bed before she gets home ?
Burns and blisters were a fact of life in the plastic bug business , and you simply sprayed the injury with some Bactine and hid it from Mom so she would n't take your Thing Maker away .
Plasti-Goop was marketed as " non-toxic , "  but that was in 1964 , before the dangers of little things like melted PVC and lead paint were well known .
7. Gilbert U - 238 Atomic Energy Lab
I 'm sort of sneaking this one in , as I do n't know if it was ever advertised on television , but it 's too good to pass up .
In 1951 A.C. Gilbert , the man who invented the Erector Set , introduced a brand new educational toy : the Gilbert U - 238 Atomic Energy Lab .
Gilbert worked closely with physicists at M.I.T. while developing the kit , and also had the unofficial approval of the U.S. government , which thought that such a toy would help the average American understand the benefits of nuclear energy .
The Lab came equipped with a Geiger - Mueller radiation counter , a Wilson Cloud Chamber ( to see paths of alpha particles ) , a Spinthariscope ( to see " live " radioactive disintegration ) , four samples of Uranium - bearing ores , and an Electroscope to measure radioactivity .
It also included a comic book featuring Dagwood Bumstead ( the man who could n't leave his own house without knocking the mailman down ) describing how to split an atom .
The Atomic Energy Lab 's main drawback , other than possible radiation poisoning , was its price tag : a whopping $ 49.50 , which would be over $ 300 in today 's dollars .
How did you flirt with disaster as a child ?
Did you own a set of Klackers ?
A BB gun ?
( Did you put someone 's eye out ? )
Tell us how you lived on the edge !
As Barack Obama , Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates and Cambridge police officer James Crowley get ready to share a beer , the nation finally has an opportunity to discuss racial prejudice and its lasting impact on American society .
Haha , just kidding .
For cable news , the mix of politics , race and beer is like catnip .
There are so many issues to consider :
Will this change the topic away from the controversy ?
( Yes , yes it will . )
Is Bud Light an American beer ?
( Not any more . )
Is a picnic table the proper forum for this occasion ?
( Just STFU . )
And how long do we have to wait for this thing ?
Thanks go to Mike Byhoff for the excellent video work .
Earlier this week , Brad Templeton wrote an essay explaining why Battlestar Galactica 's ending was the worst on - screen sci - fi ending of all time .
Could Lost be headed down the same disappointing path ?
Spoilers for both shows ahead !
Advertisement
In his essay , Templeton breaks his analysis of the BSG finale into 6 distinct failures .
Here 's how Lost measures up in each of those categories .
Advertisement
Failure 1 - God did it
Templeton explains why blaming god for all the twists and turns of the plot , and the eventual resolution of the story , renders the journey of the story meaningless .
In BSG , Templeton explains , when we find out that humanity ended up where they did solely because of the will of some sort of god figure , we stop caring about the story .
Lost does run a slight risk of this being the case .
The show and the writers seem to suggest that god wo n't be the answer , but there are mysterious forces at play here .
Jacob 's enemy using Locke to attack Jacob is an instance of possible god - like manipulation .
Mrs. Hawking , course correction , the " doubting Thomas " scenes ... there is clearly some element of fate , of some unseen force maneuvering events for their own gains .
But despite this " fate " aspect , Lost has always been about exploring how much influence fate can have versus our ability to make our own destinies .
Lost is a show primarily about the conflict between fate and free will , so I 'd wager we 'll get our due , without a " deus ex machina " cop-out .
Advertisement
Failure 2 - Science errors on plot - turning elements
The next major flaw Templeton discusses is a giant , plot - determinative science mistake .
On BSG , this mistake was a misunderstanding of just what the term " mitochondrial Eve " means .
On Lost , if there is such a mistake , it 's likely to be a bit more elusive and complex .
Advertisement
The creators and show - runners of Lost have claimed since the beginning that the show can all be explained using science or pseudo - science .
Lost never claimed to be a hard science fiction show ; it 's more in the soft sci - fi camp .
But that does n't mean some key errors can't undermine the show 's believability .
For example , Lost could make some severe errors in time travel science .
It could suggest something that violates the known rules of how our universe works .
Or it could break some of it's own internal rules ( whatever happened , happened , for example ) .
Advertisement
But Lost always chooses to keep the science very speculative and very experimental .
That means that even their most heavily - relied - upon science is mostly theoretical .
This lets
Lost try a lot more complex and interesting things with science .
This particular failure is hard to predict .
Knowing Lost , we might already be through the most complex or unbelievable science .
Only time will tell on this one .
Advertisement
Failure 3 - Collective unconscious
The third failure , in Templeton 's essay , is BSG 's use of the hokey concept of cultural memory to explain the parallels between the colonial fleet and our own Earth .
Lost has n't taken this particular risk , but it has experimented with an equally dangerous science fiction psychology cliche : mind reading .
Advertisement
Lost is probably going to have a difficult time explaining ( in any believable or coherent way ) how the " monster " ( whatever it is ) can read people 's minds and pasts .
It 's happened a few times , and the " monster " has even used this information to mimic people from its victims ' pasts .
The big question now is how Jacob 's newly revealed enemy relates to this monster and how this connection can be explained scientifically .
It 's a tough one , and it might end up being Lost 's undoing , as much as the collective unconscious partially undid BSG 's finale .
Advertisement
Failure 4 - The future vs. a secret history
Failure four of BSG 's ending , according to Templeton , was the inevitable complexity of casting a fictional story as a secret history of our own Earth .
Lost has flirted with this particular failure pretty often this season ( ancient Egyptian symbols , time travel , etc. ) , but the eventual resolution could be a pretty explosively bad example of a poorly constructed " secret history . "
Advertisement
This season , of course , a few of our Lost folks spent some time in the 70s .
Whenever you send a character into the past , you run the risk of doing exactly what BSG did , mainly depicting a past event that certainly could not have happened .
Lost had the perfect fix for this : all of the possible past - defying happenings took place on a secret isolated island .
Even if something big happened , no one would know , and its effects would be felt nearly exclusively on the island .
This works , but it might prove problematic , of course , with the detonation of a hydrogen bomb that spews strange matter and electromagnetic energy all over the place ...
Advertisement
And then there 's the whole Egyptian culture , Latin language , ancient history side of Lost .
While this could look troubling from a " secret history " standpoint , these aspects of the show only hint at a secret history of the island , not an impossible , unwieldy one for the whole of humanity .
Lost seems to be headed pretty squarely towards a present - day finale .
It seems as though the time jumping is over .
Unless something really strange happens ( which , again , knowing Lost , is a possibility ) , Lost has seemingly sidestepped any possible " secret history " troubles for their finale .

Failure 5 - It 's the characters , stupid
To me , this is where Lost most clearly distinguishes itself from BSG .
In his essay , Templeton says that BSG lost sight of its true goal of character development in its final episodes .
Lost seems to be not only sticking to these character roots , but moving even further towards them in its final seasons .
Advertisement
Take , for example , the fan - favorite episode , " The Constant . "
In it , we got a slew of information on one way that time travel was meant to work on the show .
But if you ask people why it 's a highlight of the show , fans inevitably cite the final moments , when Penny and Desmond have their tearful , emotionally powerful reunion .
This speaks volumes for Lost 's ability to put characters first , mystery second .
For a more recent example , take this season 's finale , " The Incident . "
As psyched as I was to finally see what the incident was and how it came to pass , the real impact of the episode was witnessing Sawyer lose the woman he loved , Juliet .
Advertisement
A lot of science fiction claims up and down that the real focus of their story is character , but only Lost has proved time and time again that they can make good on this claim .
The show 's ability to balance compelling mystery and mythology with fascinating characters that we care about will probably be what makes it one of the greatest sci - fi shows of all time .
Advertisement
Failure 6 - Not a great ending
The bottom line of Templeton 's essay , it seems , is that the show was great , but the ending was n't .
It did n't tie everything together as well as it could , it did n't fulfill the goals of the show , and it just was n't as good as it could have been .
Advertisement
We 've already been told by the producers of Lost that Libby 's fate is n't going to be revealed , that the show has a hierarchy of which mysteries will get tied up and which wo n't .
But the fact that the show - runners are thinking hard about this is probably a good sign .
It indicates that they know their priority is a good story , not nitpicky details .
So all told , it looks like Lost has a good chance of avoiding a BSG - sized disappointment .
Here 's hoping no one has to write an essay about Lost 's colossal failure this time next year .

apt - get is the command to initialize Debian 's native package management utility / application " Apt " .
This tool has also been ported to a number of other distributions .
You use the apt - get command to install and remove software packages from your system ( one at a time or many at once ) , as well as update your system 's internal listing of what packages are available from your currently selected list or repositories .
Tips
to install a package :
# apt - get install NameOfPackage
to reinstall a package
# apt - get install -- reinstall NameOfPackage
to remove a package :
# apt - get remove NameOfPackage
to remove a package and configuration file :
# apt - get -- purge remove NameOfPackage
to search for a package :
# apt - cache search NameOfPackage
to update the repository ( list of avalible .deb's ) :
# apt - get update
to upgrade your system ( can be useful in maintaining an up - to - date system ) :
# apt - get upgrade
to upgrade your distribution ( tries to choose packages needed to upgrade your dist ) :
# apt - get dist - upgrade
to enable smart - tab completion , add the line
source /etc/bash_completion
to your . bashrc file .
When you enter a command like " apt - get install a < tab > , " bash will auto - complete the entry .
to see a short list of common commands :
# apt - get -- help
Extra
Try running
apt - get moo
( __ ) ( oo ) /------\/ / | || * /\---/\ ~~ ~~
.... " Have you mooed today ? " ...
Using with other distributions
You can go to Freshrpms to find apt - get tools for distributions other than Debian .
After apt - get is installed , the command line syntax is the same as that listed above for Debian .
Trouble - shooting with RPM - based distributions
Sometimes apt - get will complain about being unable to lock a specific directory .
Many of these problems can be remedied with the following commands .
rm /var / lock / rpm/transaction rm /var/lib/rpm/__db* rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
I recently conducted a training for a group of sales individuals whose business motto is , to paraphrase , " being sustainable , green , and community focused . "
Naturally I asked them what exactly that meant for their business ?
After all , who is n't claiming sustainability these days ?
The responses I received covered all the usual bases -- we recycle , we compost , we donate to charity , we do n't use a lot of paper , we consider ourselves to be pillars of the community .
" Really ? " I thought .
" So how does that apply to me ? "
After all , I am a member of this same community , and while I , too , practice recycling , composting , etc. , what makes YOUR sustainable business any better ( more noteworthy ) than the other sales team who is claiming the same thing ?
In other words , what I want to know as a consumer is how you are different than the rest and how that applies directly to me .
Which brings me to something that we all need to think a little harder on .
As a branding consultant , when I hear someone describe themselves using words and phrases that are commonly used , my immediate focus is directed at how to make that common description something unique .
The first step in creating uniqueness out of the mundane is by giving a clear , common definition to the word you use .
For example : Sustainable .
What does sustainability mean ?
Careful , this is not asking what the media tells you sustainability means .
How would you have defined sustainability 5 years ago ?
Pull out a thesaurus if you 're having trouble :
Synonyms for Sustain : support , carry , assist , give strength , continue , carry on , maintain , preseve , conserve , perpetuate , retain , endure , uphold , verify , substantiate ...
I distill the above synonyms into the following associated key concepts : healthy , natural , organic growth , long term vs short term , self - perpetuating , strong , patient , caring
Now , if you were to take any one of those words , like " maintain " , and apply it to the way you operate your business , what examples for how you " preserve " could you come up with ?
Remember , in branding , story - telling is key .
It 's not enough for you to say " I run a sustainable business " and expect the consumer to latch on and believe you .
But if you say " I run a sustainable business by maintaining healthy , long - term relationships with local businesses " , you 've just added a whole lot more meat to your statement , and therefore more value , and hopefully more attention .
Next on my list is to talk a little bit about being confident .
After my morning coffee I can seriously spout at the mouth for a good hour or two with the most ingenious thoughts on modern advertising , branding , and marketing .
Get me in front of someone who directly asks me what I think , and all of a sudden my ingenious thoughts get overridden by the safe zone of opinions .
That never feels good .
So something I practice , and tell my clients to practice , is just letting yourself be natural in your reaction to people 's questions .
There 's absolutely never a wrong answer to your opinion .
Your opinion is shaped by who you are and your life experiences , which naturally yield organic , unique - to - you opinions on everything .
When you can confidently , passionately , honestly share your opinions about life , work , and this world , you are expressing your true self .
And that , my friends , is what sustainable branding is all about .
With the world 's largest and most powerful fleet of aircraft carriers , destroyers and cruisers , the U.S. Navy absolutely dominates the deep water .
But not so much in shallow waters – the so - called " littoral zones . "
Close to land , a ship might face overwhelming numbers of shore - based guns and missiles , swarms of small attack boats , plus the occasional hull - destroying coral reef .
It 's far too dangerous for a $ 2 - billion destroyer , to say nothing of a $ 10 - billion carrier .
The Navy 's solution is to build lots of smaller , cheaper ships .
The heart of this effort is the 3,000 - ton- displacement " Littoral Combat Ship . "
LCS adapts commercial yacht and ferry designs – then adds weapons , sensors , and robots .
When the ship was conceived in 2004 , each copy was supposed to cost just $ 220 million – and the Navy wanted to build the first 13 by 2009 .
But after years of design changes and botched contracts , only two LCSs have been finished , each at a cost of over $ 600 million .
It 's been rough sailing for the Navy 's inshore fighter .
But there might be smoother waters ahead .
The second LCS , and the first built to General Dynamics triple - hull " trimaran " ferry design , has spent this month on builder 's trials on the Gulf of Mexico .
" I am hearing nothing but good news from every possible place ” about LCS - 2 Independence , Galrahn wrote .
This in contrast to Lockheed Martin 's LCS - 1 Freedom , a modified yacht that proved a real gas guzzler on her own trials last year .
The U.S. Navy still plans on buying at least 55 of the fast , coast - hugging LCSs , despite the cost over - runs and technical glitches on the first batch of vessels .
The Navy has learned from Freedom and Independence , and costs should come down , according to Adm.
Gary Roughead , the sea service 's top officer .
" We 've turned the corner , " Roughead said .
Navy support for the LCS is undiminished , according to one officer working on the Navy portions of the forthcoming Quadrennial Defense Review , the Pentagon 's mega - strategy document .
The officer , who requested anonymity , said the inshore ship is " the only way the Navy gets bigger . "
Navy planners still hope to expand the fleet from today 's 280 combat vessels , to as many as 313 .
The Navy 's love for LCS does not extend to other small vessels that could help the sea service in the littorals , however .
According to our source , the sea service is only grudgingly accepting the shallow - water catamaran transports that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates endorsed in his April speech announcing major shifts in weapons investment .
As for new versions of the coastal patrol boats and river craft that have proved so useful in Iraq ?
" I believe in the end we will see these vessels built as an outcome of QDR deliberations , but the Navy will state that they were forced upon them , and attempt to ignore them , " the officer said .
He added that the Navy might consign all future small ships to the " purgatory " that is the Navy 's new Expeditionary Combat Command – the same command that oversees Navy construction workers and port security guards .

anyone else in America to enjoy these generous benefits .
In fact , members of Congress get the finest health care in America --- and it 's mostly paid for by taxpayers .
I do n't have a problem with Democratic politicians getting taxpayer - funded health care .
After all , many of them are trying to extend such benefits to the rest of us .
But for GOP politicians to receive such lavish , taxpayer - supported health care while loudly opposing it for everyone else is , of course , stinking hypocrisy .
Amazingly , no Republican politician to my knowledge has ever admitted this glaring contradiction .
None of them have ever demanded that their own health - care coverage be the same as what ordinary working stiffs get , out in the private sector .
And nobody in the MSM ever bothers to call them out on this blatant hypocrisy .
Members of Congress participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program ( FEHBP ) .
They get a wide range of plans to choose from .
They can also insure their spouses and dependents .
There 's no waiting period .
And unlike the rest of us , no member of Congress has to worry about being denied coverage .
I 've never heard of a member of Congress going bankrupt from medical bills .
For the rest of us , the No. 1 cause of bankruptcy in America is caused by medical bills .
In fact , medical bankruptcies affect about 2 million Americans annually .
And even as GOP politicians enjoy generous health care benefits , they seem genuinely surprised at the notion that there 's any kind of " crisis " going on with health care in America .
And here 's something that GOP politicians would rather you not know : the government ( i.e. you , the U.S. taxpayer ) pays up to 75 percent of Congress members ' health - care premiums , according to the Office of Personnel Management .
And as the St. Petersburg Times pointed out last year , members of Congress get other health - care benefits , as well , ( funded by millions in taxpayer dollars ) : Members of Congress have their own pharmacy , right in the Capitol .
They also have a team of doctors , technicians and nurses standing by in case something busts in a filibuster .
They can get a physical exam , an X - ray or an electrocardiogram , without leaving work .
GOP politicians think it 's fine to enjoy taxpayer - funded health - care benefits .
They just do n't want these benefits for anyone else in America .
Keep this in mind the next time you hear a GOP politician ranting away about how the government has no business being involved in health care .
If you think it 's important that Americans have a strong public health insurance option this year , then consider writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper .

Provisional marriage figures for 2006 show that 23 out of 1,000 unmarried men were choosing to marry - down from 25 men per 1,000 the previous year .
The marriage rate for women fell from 22 to 21 per thousand for the period .
The number of marriages has been in decline .
In 2006 there were 237,000 - the lowest annual number since 1895 .
Marriage is in danger of being lost as the core institution of society
Jill Kirby , director , the Centre for Policy Studies
Jill Kirby , from the Centre for Policy Studies , the centre - right think tank , said : " It is obviously worrying that marriage rates have reached such a low ebb but it is not surprising in view of the lack of government policy encouraging marriage over the last 10 years . "
She said the existing welfare system penalises against marriage .
" Marriage is in danger of being lost as the core institution of society .
Research demonstrates how important marriage is to maintain the stability for children .
The break - up of cohabiting couples is much higher than married couples , " she added .
Religious decline
The popularity of marriage ceremonies in approved places such as hotels and stately homes continued in 2006 .
Just over 95,300 marriages took place in such premises , accounting for 40 % of all marriages , up from just 5 % in 1996 .
But the statistics also showed that the number of civil marriage ceremonies fell 3 % from 2005 - from 162,169 to 157,490 .
Civil ceremonies represented 66 % of all ceremonies in 2006 , up from 65 % in 2005 .
In 1990 this figure was 47 % .
Religious ceremonies also declined , falling by 7 % to 79,490 compared with 2005 .
Since 1991 this figure has halved compared with a fall in the number of all marriages of 23 % in the same period .
Religious ceremonies accounted for 34 % of all marriages in 2006 .
The number of church weddings has declined
A Church of England spokesman said the number of Church of England marriages have fallen against a background of increasing choice for couples as to where they can marry .
He said the Church of England has responded with a new Marriage Measure that will expand the choice of churches where each couple can enjoy their special day later this year .
" That said , there are a complex range of factors influencing the continued trend of couples delaying marriage or avoiding it altogether , not least the mistaken idea that cohabitation is a form of marriage , " said the spokesman .
" Marriage affirms the goodness and rightness of love between a man and a woman , affirms this in the public sphere , beyond private arrangements , and is the best option for couples to grow together in mutual support , " he said .
First marriages
The new figures show that marriages that were the first for both parties in 2006 accounted for 61 % of all marriages , while remarriages for both parties accounted for 18 % - both figures about the same as in 2005 .
There was also very little change in the average age at marriage between 2005 and 2006 .
In 2006 the mean age for all marriages increased to 36.4 years for men - up from 36.2 in 2005 , and 33.7 years for women ( 33.5 in 2005 ) .
In 2006 the mean age at first marriage was 31.8 years for men and 29.7 years for women .
The number of ceremonies taking place in approved premises has continued to increase .
Los Angeles practice XTEN Architecture have completed a gallery perched on top of an art collector 's house in Los Angeles .
Called Sapphire Gallery , the project involved creating a space to display the owner 's private collection of artwork that could also be used for family activities .
The extension is elevated to allow for parking , a play area , and space for parties and projections underneath .
The structure was built in a factory and assembled on site in one day .
More information about the project in our previous story .
Photographs are by Art Gray .
The following text is from the architects :

Sapphire
Residential Gallery Addition to Private Residence , Los Angeles , California
The Sapphire Gallery is a residential addition designed to display a private collection of contemporary art while also providing for a home office with views to the surrounding hills .
The owners ’ collection includes work by the artists Gregory Crewdson , Uta Barth , Tomoroy Dodge and the video artist Jennifer Steinkamp , and they expressed interest in a new building that would be more than just a container for their expanding art collection .
The new building would have be multivalent ; with suitable spaces for the artworks , but it would also have to be open to the views , provide for various domestic program spaces , and create a compelling new focal point for the approach and entry to the residence .
The new structure is grafted onto the circulation spine of the existing house and lifted off the ground to provide a minimal footprint .
Freeing the ground plane creates a new multi-functional hardscape / landscape area for the family that they use as carport , children 's play area , for art parties and video projections .
A structural system of lightweight braced frames was developed .
They were factory built and assembled by crane in one day .
These trusses rest upon moment frames that clear span the open ground plane in the perpendicular direction , and the floor and roof diaphragms are infilled with typical 2 x wood framing .
The system proved to be a remarkably simple , flexible and cost - effective way to achieve the program parameters of the project .
The remaining details are simple and direct : casement windows , quartz pebble flooring , steel stairs and railings with perforated panels , infill walls of gypsum board with floor to ceiling pivot doors , full height glass with a ceramic coating for UV and solar protection .
An array of photovoltaic cells on the South facing sloped roof produces an average of 15 kWh per day , enough to supply all the energy for the new building with a surplus directed towards the main house .

I ’ve talked casually about using Vim as a pager before .
However , I ’m still surprised to see how many people use Vim regularly and do n’t know about this feature .
Here ’s a quote straight from vim -- help
vim [ arguments ] - read text from stdin
Admittedly , it ’s easy to overlook the hyphen in the explanation .
Why Vim as a Pager ?
If you ’re using Vim already , there ’s nothing else to install .
If you ’re using Vim already , it ’s already configured the way you like it .
More importanly , Vim detects the kind of file it is being piped and turns on the appropriate syntax highlighting .
Why page in black and white ?
In this case , “ less ” is definitely less !
Improving the experience
As a pager , you want to use Vim in read - only mode .
some command | vim -R -
What the difference ?
Vim does n’t ask you to save the file if you try to quit .
Of course , you can still modify and write the file … the - R flag is just a more reasonable pager default .
PAGER variable and ANSI Escape Sequences
You probably do n’t want to set the PAGER variable .
Vim does n’t understand ANSI escape sequences .
As such , a command like “ man vim | vim - R - ” wo n’t show colors ; it will show escape sequences .
I have n’t found any quick and simple solution to make Vim show ANSI escape sequences , but it ’s pretty easy to strip them out before passing the file to Vim :
man vim | col - b | vim -R -
I use less as PAGER .
I use vim in explicit cases .
View
The view command gets installed at the same time as vim .
It ’s just a symlink to vim .
Using view is exactly like typing vim - R .
There ’s a certain aesthetic in :
some command | view -
But I find that typing vim - R - is easier on my finger ’s muscle memory .
A number of Twitter users spoke out on Friday against a Comic - Con contest hosted by Electronic Arts that some say objectifies women .
In short , the " Sin to Win " contest , designed to promote Dante 's Inferno , encourages attendees to take photos with the so - called " booth babes " and Tweet the photos to the @danteteam Twitter account with the hashtag #lust .
It 's the wording of the contest that has Twitter up in arms , however : attendees are told to " Commit Acts of Lust " ( see image below ) , which some allege is a recipe for sexual harassment .
Others argue that attendees typically take photos with booth babes regardless .
@danteteam did receive hundreds of responses to their request , but many are negative and critical of the behavior the contest might encourage .
" Tongue in Cheek "
In response to the Tweets , the team behind the promotion posted an apology on Twitpic saying the campaign is " tongue in cheek " .
Opponents , however , seem unimpressed , and have combined their efforts using the hashtag #eafail .
What do you think : did EA go too far , or is this a storm in a Twitter teacup ?

In case you missed or avoided the CRTC net neutrality hearing , I thought I would post a few reflections ( my summaries of the events are available at Day 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ; additional coverage NetNeutrality.ca ) .
While there were some notable anecdotes and quotes ( Rogers comment about traffic managing a cure for cancer come to mind ) , I would point to six key revelations that evolved over the course of the week and a half .
1 . The rate of network traffic growth is slowing .
This was raised midway through the first week by Professor Odlyzko and was subsequently confirmed by several ISPs .
The revelations ran counter to the general sense before the hearings that ISPs cannot keep pace with the rate of growth .
In fact , it turns out the opposite is true – reasonable new investment in the networks can address current growth rates .
2 . There is a wide variation in the use of traffic management tools with a different approach for pretty much every major ISP .
There are those that throttle all the time ( Cogeco ) , during large chunks of the day ( Bell ) , only during congested periods ( Shaw ) , or not at all ( Telus , Videotron ) .
There are those that throttle upload only ( Rogers ) or upload and download ( Bell ) .
There are those that use " economic measures " such as bit caps effectively ( Videotron ) and others that doubt it can be an effective approach on its own ( Bell ) .
This points to the fact that granular rules will be difficult , but broader principled tests are essential .
3 . The rules for retail and wholesale will be different .
The hearing surprisingly included a near - rehearing of the Bell v. CAIP case .
Wholesale services were much discussed as the CRTC recognized the potential of independent ISPs to inject additional competition into the marketplace .
Based on the evidence , it would appear that the problems with wholesale are largely a Bell problem .
Many other ISPs that offer wholesale services do not traffic manage or have such small wholesale businesses that the impact is fairly small .
Bell is a big player in the wholesale side and they have designed their network in a manner that makes it difficult to fully exploit the competitive potential of smaller entrants .
While CAIP argued for rules against wholesale throttling but against retail restrictions ( thereby abandoning consumer interests ) , the opposite seems more likely to occur .
4. Disclosures are woefully inadequate in Canada .
Each day brought new and surprising revelations about how little ISPs tell their customers about their traffic management practices .
By far the most egregious was Rogers , which admitted that it charges tiered pricing for faster upload speeds but that all tiers were throttled to the same speed when using P2P .
In other words , the Extreme subscriber who pays $ 59.99 per month and is promised fast upload speeds ( 1 Mbps ) actually gets the same upload speed as the Express subscriber who pays $ 46.99 per month and is promised upload speeds of 512 kbps .
There were similar stories from many other ISPs , who disclosed actual speeds that bring P2P down to a virtual crawl .
Disclosure has improved over the past year as the issue has gained prominence , but there clearly is a long way to go .
5. Managed networks vs. public Internet .
ISPs do not focus on the fact that many run managed IP networks offering telephony and IPTV on the same pipe as the public Internet services .
When asked whether the two impact each other , the answer came back that it could .
In fact , ISPs were at pains to say that while it could happen , it would not happen since they ensure that they provision enough bandwidth for their managed services .
Yet in examples such as Bell 's three users promised 5 megs but with only 10 megs to share , it was apparent that the same cannot be said for oversold public Internet services .
6 . The Commission takes privacy seriously .
The ISPs seemed surprised that the Commission regularly asked about the privacy impact of throttling and deep - packet inspection .
The Commission was similarly surprised when Bell admitted that Canadian privacy law would permit the use of DPI data for marketing purposes with the customer 's consent .
Where to from here ?
The parties will have a couple of weeks to file final submissions and a decision will likely take several months .
My best guess is that the Commission will likely leave the wholesale side alone , though a best case might be to place restrictions on traffic management where the provider has the capability of differentiating between wholesale customers .
Bell says that they cannot do so today , but the introduction of usage based billing might change that equation .
On the retail side , I think a four - pronged approach is possible .
First , the Commission could adopt the Open Internet Coalition / CIPPIC style test based on Oakes that permits traffic management practices so long as they further a pressing and substantial objective , are narrowly tailored to the objective , and are the least restrictive means of achieving the objective .
This test would give useful guidance to ISPs and ensure that there are appropriate limits on traffic management practices that have no clear correlation with network congestion .
Second , the Commission can affirm the role of current law against undue preferences and work to stop any attempt to leverage network management for unfair advantage .
Third , it can establish minimum disclosure requirements including information on traffic management practices such as time , targets , and speeds when shaping .
Fourth , the Commission can establish a prohibition against the use of DPI data for any purpose other than network management .
Of course , the Commission could decide to do nothing and simply retain the power to address complaints as they arise .
If that approach is adopted , I think there would be significant political pushback , with political parties seeking net neutrality legislative reform .
It has been fairly easy to provide OAuth services in your web application ( see How to turn your Rails Site into an OAuth Provider ) , but to actually consume Twitter , FireEagle , my own Agree2 and other OAuth services has been a fairly manual affair .
There are great gems out there that wrap up the process for the above mentioned services .
So it has n’t been too hard to support one of them .
But what to do if you want to support 5 different services today and more in the future ?
I knew there should be some generic approach to handle the OAuth authorization process , but had not spent too much time thinking about it until we actually needed to consume external web services for Agree2 .
Well I think I ’ve cracked it in a a nice Dont Repeat Yourself fashion .
OAuth Consumer Generator
I have now added a oauth_consumer generator to the Rails OAuth Plugin .
The oauth_consumer generator creates a controller to manage the authentication flow between your application and any number of external OAuth secured applications that you wish to connect to .
To run it simply run :
./script/generate oauth_consumer
This generates the OauthConsumerController as well as the ConsumerToken model .
OAuth Authentication Flow
For each service you support the consumer presents the following 2 urls :
http://yoursite.com/oauth_consumers/twitter
http://yoursite.com/oauth_consumers/twitter/callback
To connect to a users twitter account just add a link somewhere to go to the first URL and the plugin takes care of the rest .
The callback is used internally and you do n’t really need to worry about it .
If you send the user back the first URL he / she will have the option of removing or reconnecting .
A http DELETE at that URL will remove an existing token .
Configuring services
You can configure any amount of services to support by editing :
All configuration of applications is done in
config/initializers/oauth_consumers.rb
Add entries to OAUTH_CREDENTIALS for all OAuth Applications you wish to connect to .
Get this information by registering your application at the particular applications developer page .
I decided to use Ruby rather than yaml here so heroku users can Config Values here .
OAUTH_CREDENTIALS ={ : twitter= >{ : key= >" key " , : secret= > " secret " } , : fireeagle= > { : key= >" key " , : secret= > " ssh " } , :agree2 = > { : key= >" key " , : secret= > " secret " } , :hour_feed = > { : key= >" bb " , : secret= > " aa " , :options= { : site= > " http://hourfeed.com " } } }
For generic OAuth services you need to add key , secret and an options hash with information of which URLs to use .
See OAuth : : Consumer for valid values .
For services with wrapper classess ( I ’ll get into those shortly ) you only need to specify key and secret as a wrapper class handles the rest .
For every service you add here you get the before mentioned 2 urls .
So to link to Agree2 in the above example have a user follow a link to http://yoursite.com/oauth_consumers/agree2.
Using the OAuth Services
Every time a user is linked to one of these services it creates a new ConsumerToken .
It actually uses STI and I dynamically create a new Subclass of ConsumerToken for each service listed in OAUTH_CREDENTIALS .
Using the above example you get 3 new classes :
TwitterToken
FireeagleToken
Agree2Token
HourFeedToken
This makes it easy to use from your user object .
Add the following in your user model :
has_one : twitter_token , :class_name= >" TwitterToken " , : dependent= >: destroy has_one : fire_eagle , :class_name= >" FireEagleToken " , : dependent= >: destroy has_one :agree2 , :class_name= >" Agree2 Token " , : dependent= >: destroy has_one : hour_feed , :class_name= >" HourFeedToken " , : dependent=>: destroy
Now you can access each of these directly in your own code .
Each of these tokens implement a client method which will allow you to do stuff on the web service
current_user.hour_feed.client.get ( " / report " )
By default this is an instance of OAuth : : AccessToken but you can write wrapper classes to use a higher level library .
Wrapper Tokens
Wrapper tokens are classes written using to create a high level approach to working with a service such as Twitter .
The plugin comes with wrapper classes for Twitter , Agree2 and FireEagle but it is fairly easy to write your own .
Here is an example using Twitter .
It uses the Twitter Gem to provide a high level api :
current_user.twitter.client.update ( " Just had fantastic Jerk Pork on Boston Beach .
Need beer !! " )
This example uses FireEagle .
It uses the Fireagle Gem to provide a high level api :
@location=current_user.fireeagle.location
Creating your own wrapper tokens
If you have a service in CONSUMER_CREDENTIALS called : my_service just add a class to your models folder called MyServiceToken and it will be used instead of the auto generated one .
In this example we are imagining a gem called ‘ myservice ’ that wraps around the web services actual api .
# Use a gem to do the heavy stuff require ' myservice ' class MyServiceToken < ConsumerToken MY_SERVICE_SETTINGS={:site= >
" http://my_service.com"} # override self .
consumer so we do n't have to specify url 's in options def self.consumer @consumer||=OAuth::Consumer.new credentials [ : key ] , credentials [ : secret ] , MY_SERVICE_SETTINGS
end # overide client to return a high level client object def client @client|
|=MyService :: Client.new ( MyServiceToken.consumer.key , MyServiceToken.consumer.secret , token , secret ) end # optionally add various often used methods here def shout ( message ) client.shout ( message ) end end
If there is n’t a wrapper gem for the service you want to use .
You can always add methods to MyServiceToken to do the parsing etc .
I hope this will get you started implementing OAuth .
There no longer is an excuse not to .
Do you need advise or help with implementing OAuth in your Rails application ?
I am available as a consultant and would be glad to help your company out .
Whether you need help in developing an OAuth strategy or in practical hands on implementation help .

One of the things that has both pleasantly surprised and frustrated me over the past six months is the state of Rails ' internal tests .
While the tests can sometimes cover the most obscure , important bugs , they can sometimes be heavily mock - based or very coupled to internal implementation .
In large part , this is because of the requirement that patches come with tests , so the test suite has accumulated a lot of knowledge over time , but is n't always the clearest when it comes time for a major refactor .
Just to be clear , without the test suite , I do n't think the work we 've been doing would have been possible , so I 'm not complaining much .
However , I recently became aware that Sam Ruby , one of the authors of Agile Web Development on Rails , has released a test suite that tests each step in the depot application , as well as each of the advanced chapters .
Last week , Carl and I started digging into the Rails initializer , and the tests in the initializer ( railties ) are more mock - based and less reliable than the tests in ActionPack ( which we 've been working with so far ) .
They 're pretty reasonable unit tests for individual components , but getting all of the tests to pass did not result in an ( even close ) bootable Rails app .
Thanks to Sam 's tests , we were able to work through getting a booting Rails app by the end of last week .
Over the past week or two , Carl and I have been running the tests a few times a day , and while they definitely take a while to get through , they 've added a new sense of confidence to the work we 're doing .
Facebook has decided not to remove groups that deny the Holocaust .
This policy contradicts its own " statement of rights and responsibilities " , which clearly states " you will not post content that is hateful " .
Facebook seems to be ignorant of the inherent danger of Holocaust denial , the deeply hateful nature of it , and international efforts against racism .
It either fails to understand the responsibility it has to society , or it has placed profit far above morality .
Holocaust denial is illegal in 13 countries .
Other countries , such as Australia , have broader laws prohibiting racial vilification – the carrying out of a public act that will " offend , insult , humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people " who are targeted because of " race , colour or national or ethnic origin " .
In the UK there has long been a debate over strengthening anti-hate laws to close gaps that have been exploited by the likes of the BNP .
One gap , for example , makes it an offence to incite hate , but not to be directly hateful to a victim ( the case prevented by the Australian laws ) .
The law is , however , a bare minimum .
More action against hate is often required , as the National Union of Students has shown with its " no platform policy " – a total boycott of proscribed racist and fascist groups .
As Anthony Julius has explained , combating Holocaust denial " requires the recognition that denial is an especially offensive form of antisemitism " and that " the presence of denial material on the net is treated with as much seriousness as is the presence of other kinds of offensive material " .
At the same time as defending its unpopular position to allow Holocaust denial , Facebook has been on a crusade against pictures showing breastfeeding mothers .
Either its priorities are scrambled or someone is asleep at the wheel .
Facebook 's allowance of Holocaust denial comes despite a 2007 resolution from the UN general assembly that " urges all member states unreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust as a historical event , either in full or in part , or any activities to this end " .
It comes despite EU legislation from 2005 that asks countries to pass laws that make Holocaust denial " punishable as a criminal offence " .
Facebook 's move comes at a time when the British public are still recovering from the election of the BNP 's Nick Griffin , a Holocaust denier , to represent them in the European parliament .
Facebook is a powerful social networking tool – in times like these , with racism across Europe rising , what sort of impact does it have when it helps Holocaust deniers to network and spread their message ?
Their only excuse is ignorance .
If that 's the case , there is a solution .
Today there is a widely accepted definition of antisemitism , produced by the European Union agency for fundamental rights .
The definition is used across Europe to identify antisemitic crime .
One example it gives is : " Denying the fact , scope , mechanisms ( eg gas chambers ) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during the second world war ( the Holocaust ) . "
If it is good enough for police forces across Europe , and was good enough for the US State Department , who recommended it to Congress , perhaps it will be good enough for Facebook ?
The internet requires regulation , just as film , television and computer games do .
If companies such as Facebook abdicate that responsibility , it suggests government intervention is needed to prevent an internet - powered surge in racial hatred .
The spread of racism and hate is not something that can be left to chance or the whims of the private sector .
Working against hate , bullying and racism must be part of the price companies pay when they offer an online social environment as their product .
In the meantime , more than 68,000 people have joined the Facebook group " United Against Holocaust Denial On Facebook " .
Facebook , get the message and remove the hate !
It seems to be fairly commonly believed that saving money has a deleterious effect on the economy .
I was recently told that if everyone in the US saved , the entire economy would come to a complete halt .
This is the obvious corrollary to the dumb Krugmanian idea that consumption drives an economy ( sure , I realize it ’s Keynesian , but Krugman is the diable du jour ) .
I responded thus :
First of all it is not possible that there could ever be a situation wherein everyone in an economy saves .
There will always be transactions of some kind , until there is only one person left alive .
Secondly , in the absence of a central bank , savings is what sets interest rates .
When savings is high , interest rates come down ( supply and demand works on everything ) .
When those interest rates come down , businesses realize that now is the time to embark on investments in the factors of production .
In other words : they expand .
A steel mill , for example , might build a new furnace .
This is market regulation , without the government .
The low interest rate , caused by saving , tells producers two things :
It ’s time to expand .
It ’s financially feasible .
The cost of borrowing money is cheap and When our investments in capital come to fruition , the public will have the money to buy the products we are producing .
So , savers , far from being a drag on the economy , are actually the ones who drive the economy .
What I described above , of course , is a laissez - faire economy .
What we have today is not the free market .
Savers are still important to the economy , but they do not drive the economy as they do in the free market .
In this central bank dominated economy , what is the purpose of savers ?
The function of savers in this economy is to have a moderating effect on the bust phase of the business cycle .
If it so happens that the Fed arbitrarily drives down interest rates artificially , at the same time savings are high , then the inevitable bust wo n’t be as bad .
There wo n’t be as much malinvestment in the economy to be cleared out , because the consumers will have the money to procure the products that the producers manufactured .
Incidentally , something like the real estate bubble could never happen in a laissez - faire economy , because if the public suddenly started investing absurd amounts of money in a particular commodity , soon enough the savings would start to become depleted .
As that happened , the interest rates would climb , and the bubble would be deflated even before it really got going .
But when you have a central bank that can artificially push down the interest rates , that free market check on outrageous , irrational investing is gone .
Indian scientists say the chillis will immobilise but not kill people
Indian defence scientists are planning to put one of the world 's hottest chilli powders into hand grenades .
They say the devices will be used to control rioters and in counter - insurgency operations .
Researchers say the idea is to replace explosives in small hand grenades with a certain variety of red chilli to immobilise people without killing them .
The chilli , known as Bhut Jolokia , is said to be 1,000 times hotter than commonly used kitchen chilli .
Scientists at India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation ( DRDO ) are quoted as saying the potent chilli will be used as a food additive for troops operating in cold conditions .
And the powder will also be spread on the fences around army barracks in the hope the strong smell will keep out animals .
Other forms of pepper spray are commonly used for crowd control in many parts of the world .

This is the first part of a Team Fortress 2 Medic Costume I am making for myself for Otakon this year .
This is the Medic 's Medigun - as accurate as I could make it with the material and time constraints .
YES I made it light up ( stickler for details ) using two red LED 's mounted inside the cannon .
You can see the trigger switch on the underside handle ( Its taped down in the picture where the light is on ) She is a hefty beast weighing in at around 18 pounds -
But she does look good .
CONSTRUCTION : The front tube cannon section is made of PVC Pipe and Various fittings , with Electrical tape around the barrel .
The Square Section around the barrel is Foam Core which has been cut , glued , filled and painted to blend .
There are also a few bolts and nuts running through it to keep with the original game design .
The handle attached was made of a 2x4 piece of lumber that I cut and hollowed to fit and house the batteries / trigger switch for the light .
The red middle section is a mux of square PVC fence post , and foam board ( Insulation foam ) .
The discs on the side are from thin 3ply plywood , with a custom PVC and Wood handle .
The handle was made from a thicker plywood , which I attached to some PVC connector fittings .
The handle does move forward and backward .
The back is more PVC fittings that taper down to the end where my plastic tubing will come out to attach to the Medic Pack ( which still needs to be made ) The Red / Yellow wires underneath is phone cable that I painted and used some rubber fittings to attach .
You generally do n't notice them on the Game Model unless you look real close .
Total Time : Appx 5 daysComing Soon : Pictures of the Medic Outfit and the Medic Pack !

We 're excited about our next giant leap forward into decentralizing the WAX Blockchain 's service layer with WAX ExpressTrade !
WAX is a blockchain , and blockchains should be decentralized .
Decentralization means that no single entity controls it , to create a fair and transparent system ( among other benefits ) .
As part of our path towards full decentralization of WAX services , WAX ExpressTrade has moved to the WAX Blockchain mainnet and operates in a fully decentralized fashion .
The code for the decentralized version of WAX ExpressTrade can be found here

The kidnappers of Irish aid worker Sharon Commins are reportedly demanding a $ 2 m ( € 1.43 m ) ransom for the release of the Dubliner and her Ugandan colleague , Hilda Kiwuki .
The pair were kidnapped from a GOAL compound in Darfur on June 3 .
Sudan 's Humanitarian Affairs Minister is quoted in news agency reports today saying the kidnappers have demanded a $ 2 m ( € 1.43 m ) ransom , but the Sudanese government is determined not to pay the money .
The Sudanese authorities are negotiating with the kidnappers and have said that they expect the pair to be released " shortly " .
Ms Commins has been in touch with the Irish officials to confirm that she and Ms Kiwuki are safe and in good health .
Both GOAL and the Department of Foreign Affairs declined to make any comment on the reports today .
At some point last November , an infection began to spread unnoticed through the three hospitals that make up Barts and The London NHS Trust in east London .
This was not MRSA but the Mytob worm , a common but potent computer virus .
It steadily slowed and choked the 4,700 PCs of the trust 's network .
By noon on 17 November , a Monday , the network was effectively crippled .
The following day , the trust declared an " internal major incident " .
Ambulances carry - ing accident and emergency patients were diverted to other hospitals .
Operations were postponed .
The appointments system was suspended .
Access to clinical information - usually quick and electronic - was maintained only by the slowest and most old - fashioned of methods : " runners " drafted in from the trust 's administrative departments pounded the hospitals ' endless twisting corridors with paper notes and printouts .
Scores of computer technicians from the private sector and from other London NHS trusts were brought in to eradicate the virus , but the PCs had to be decontaminated one by one .
It was a week before the crisis was officially declared over , and a fortnight before the hospitals , some of the busiest in the capital , returned to normal .
Afterwards , an official report found the virus had been able to infiltrate them because their anti-virus software " did not reach all [ their ] PCs and ... was configured incorrectly on some " .
The whole episode , the report concluded , had been " entirely avoidable " .
The Barts incident , and a series of similar virus attacks on British hospitals since 2007 , is the subject of an investigation by More4 News to be broadcast tonight .
The More4 report reflects a longstanding concern about the vulnerability of the NHS to computer viruses and hackers .
" The NHS have never really worked out the security architecture for their computer systems , " says Martyn Thomas , a visiting professor at Oxford University Computing Laboratory .
That could be said of a lot of large organisations ; but for the NHS the robustness or otherwise of its IT infrastructure has a particular importance .
A hint as to why comes at the end of the official report on the Barts episode : " As more and more patient data is only available on IT systems , the need for resilience within the network becomes more critical . "
The NHS is in the middle of what is probably the biggest and most controversial civilian computer project in the world .
The National Programme for IT has been running for seven years .
It encompasses the conversion of billions of pages of patient records from paper to digital form ; an electronic " choose and book " system to give patients power over their hospital appointments ; an electronic prescription service linking GPs and chemists ; a new NHS broadband network and internal email system ; and near - instant digital access for clinicians to x-rays and scans .
In short , the programme aims to transform the NHS in England ( Scotland and Wales are developing their own health IT systems ) into a modern computerised organisation - more efficient , more responsive , less prone to errors .
Without this hugely expensive transformation , in the view of the government , all its other increases in health spending and NHS reforms - one of the centrepieces of the last 12 years of Labour rule - will not work properly : " Effective IT underpins the future success of the NHS , " Tony Blair was told at a Downing Street seminar on NHS computerisation in 2002 .
" The volumes of data involved , " says Christine Connelly , who heads all the department of health 's IT projects , " are like something from Nasa . "
No other country has managed to connect up its healthcare system into a single digital whole .
And nor , so far , have we : the National Programme for IT is five years behind schedule .
This week , it was reported that the Conservatives , who have commissioned a review of the programme , could , if elected , abandon its scheme for computerising patient records , and instead let the data be stored on the internet by private companies such as Microsoft and Google .
A Conservative spokeswoman refuses to confirm or dismiss the story .
But the programme 's difficulties are undeniable .
" Overall , it 's early 2015 that it will be finished , " says Connelly , who previously ran and rescued a troubled giant computer project for Cadbury Schweppes , and has an air of weary determination .
" It 's certainly later than anyone would have hoped . "
As the delays have built up , so has the impression of a government IT scheme , like many before it , gradually sinking into a swamp of technical difficulties , ethical disputes , incompetent contractors and Whitehall over - ambition and careless spending .
" The estimated cost of the programme is £ 12.7bn , " reported the Commons public accounts committee in January , " although this figure remains uncertain ...
The programme is not providing value for money at present ...
Little clinical functionality has been deployed , with the result that the expectations of clinical staff have not been met ...
Patients and doctors have understandable concerns about data security ... the programme started with four main [ private sector ] suppliers but two have left . "
The programme 's many other critics have included the pressure group Privacy International , which in 2004 dubbed it Britain 's " most appalling project " for allegedly eroding medical confidentiality ; 23 of Britain 's most prominent computer scientists , who in 2006 signed an open letter calling for the programme to be independently assessed for " its basic technical viability " ; and the Conservative leader David Cameron , who in 2008 condemned the programme as " Labour 's hubristic NHS supercomputer " and has regularly hinted since that it would be completely cancelled or radically rethought by a Tory government .
Since 2006 the programme 's total cost has been predicted to rise to £ 20bn , even £ 50 bn - half the current annual NHS budget .
Connelly dismisses such suggestions : " These are not numbers I recognise .
It 's not over - budget .
Up until the end of the financial year 2008 - 9 , we have spent £ 4.5 bn out of the £ 12.7bn . "
She also contests Cameron 's characterisation of the programme : " When people talk about ' the NHS supercomputer ' , it 's a throwback to the 70s .
We do n't have one single computer system .
We have a series of computer systems that talk to each other . "
Yet large state spending projects with troubled reputations are currently vulnerable , whoever is in government .
Connelly recently gave the IT programme 's main private sector contractors until the end of November to make demonstrably better progress , or face the possible termination of their contracts .
At the Royal Free Hospital in north London , as elsewhere in the NHS , the new IT systems are only part of a broader , sometimes chaotic - looking refurbishment .
The main entrance is being rebuilt .
Ambulances squeeze between construction hoardings .
Nearby offices have been stripped and stacked with plastic crates .
The crates are full of carefully packed old cardboard files - a year on from the arrival of the new computer networks at the Royal Free , one of the first hospitals to introduce them , paper is far from being abolished .
" You could see this IT project as a journey , " says Tim Peachey , the Royal Free 's medical director , with the smooth bedside manner of a senior clinician .
" We 're on that journey , and we 're pointed in the right direction ...
But you could say it is never finished . "
We go down to accident and emergency to see the new system in action .
Amid the usual roomful of fearful and pained faces , there is a single keyboard and a flat screen , displaying a colour - coded list of patients .
The computer graphics are utilitarian , bordering on crude , but the doctor on duty is happy with them .
He can track and classify patients .
He can exchange medical data with other departments electronically - previously A&E had its own isolated IT system , and constantly had to send staff to other parts of the hospital " on errands " .
The doctor stands proudly beside the new computer .
" It 's had a few teething troubles , " he says , " but now it 's getting on very nicely . "
In fact , last year the Royal Free had so many problems with the new system - network crashes , appointments lost or incorrectly scheduled - that it took more than six months to resolve them .
The hospital lost £ 10 m .
Other parts of the Royal Free 's IT programme have been more immediately successful .
In the x-ray department , a radiologist shows me a small room filled with more flat screens .
Nowadays , she says , scans and x-rays can be digitally stored , examined in unprecedented detail , and almost instantly transmitted .
" A lot of x-ray films got lost before , " she says .
" The filing system did n't work very well .
We used to use bits of paper to measure things on x-rays .
Get a bit of paper and copy marks on to it from a ruler .
Now you can measure electronically onscreen down to fractions of a millimetre . "
Has the technology made her job less stressful ?
She shakes her head .
" We just do more scanning than before .
We need to catch up with other countries . "
Some politicians and NHS managers have long hoped that computers will transform British healthcare .
" IT programmes , initiatives and fashions ... have swept through the NHS since the 1970s , " writes Sean Brennan in his 2005 book The NHS IT Project : The Biggest Computer Programme In The World ... Ever !
" Huge projects such as the [ Conservative - commissioned ] resource management initiative of the early 1990s have been and gone and barely a ripple remains .
Most of the computer systems purchased ... have long ago been quietly switched off . "
These failed pilot schemes and technical dead - ends have been chronicled with outrage and relish by the press .
But critics of NHS computerisation often fail to acknowledge its necessity .
" In the last few years [ paper ] patient notes have got unmanageable , " says a London doctor who has been working with NHS IT since the 70s .
" In the past , if the patient had a thick file , you knew they had something wrong with them .
Now they 've got an ingrowing toenail . "
Before Labour came to office in 1997 , the NHS had a patchwork of computer systems , some ancient , some state - of - the - art , but almost all of them small and local and incompatible .
Brennan notes there could be 40 in a single hospital .
In 1998 , at a gathering to mark the service 's 50th anniversary , Blair spoke via an experimental medical video conferencing system to a clinician at the Royal Free .
" The possibilities are enormous if we can get this right , " Blair said afterwards .
A few weeks later , the government announced that it would unify and greatly expand the use of computers in the NHS .
To the IT programme 's critics , what resulted was too hastily conceived , too ambitious , too centralised , and lacked enough input from medical professionals .
" Blair did n't understand IT , " says Thomas .
" The Department of Health did n't take proper advice .
They over - claimed what the programme would achieve , to sell it to the public .
In IT , every time someone boasts that they 're trying to do something at the forefront of technology , ' the biggest in the world ' , you know it 's going to fail . "
In 2007 , ComputerWeekly.com , which has followed the NHS scheme in minute detail , characterised it as " an amorphous national programme without a simple , clear objective " .
Connelly says some of the programme 's flaws are unavoidable .
" In a theoretical world , you write the perfect specification for an IT system before installing it .
But the NHS does n't stay the same .
So you develop a system that 's three - quarters perfect , put it in , move it on . "
When the private sector contractors involved in the project have not met this standard , she points out , they have not been paid until their work improves or , in the case of the Japanese conglomerate Fujitsu , have left the project altogether .
Thomas concedes the contractors are partly to blame for the programme 's troubles : " IT is a very immature industry .
With a small project , with good people , you can get a good solution .
If it 's big , people typically lose control . "
In a tiny hot office high up in the Royal Free , Mark Harber grapples daily with some of the NHS scheme 's imperfections .
He is a doctor in the kidney unit and confidently computer literate .
But his department uses Cerner Millennium , an American software product heavily criticised by clinicians .
" The system has n't been designed for what it 's like to use , " he says .
" It 's not very Anglicised . "
Is Cerner prepared to make improvements ?
" They 're responsive ... "
Harber 's voice trails off .
" But it does take a long time . "
His narrow desk is still buried under drifts of paper .
In April , Cerner , which is based in Kansas , announced that , despite the recession , its first - quarter profits were up by 11 % .
" Cerner 's chief financial officer , " reported ComputerWeekly.com , " said the company was especially well - positioned to take advantage of ... the stimulus bill that President Obama signed into law on 17 February .
The bill provides for money to be spent on modernising medical records . "
Back in England , for all the frustration and politics surrounding it , the NHS IT scheme may well survive .
Too much money has been spent , too many parts of it are in place , and the alternatives are not obvious .
( The reported Conservative scheme to involve Google and Microsoft has already been criticised for its potential profit element , and for failing to cater for Britons without internet access . )
Yet significant adjustments to the current programme are already underway .
It is being made less centralised , and more sensitive to the needs of individual hospitals - more like what its critics say should have been installed in the first place .
But Thomas remains sceptical : " What they 're trying to do is make sure that it can not be seen to have failed .
There will be an orderly retreat , and they will declare it a victory . "
Up in Harber 's hot office at the Royal Free , even 2015 seems like an optimistic completion date .
Peachey says it will take " five years " to achieve the free flow of medical data between the capital 's health facilities , let alone across England .
Harber stares at the clunky Cerner Millennium page on his PC screen and says with quiet exasperation : " Not all the things we were sold came as expected . "
" Will it work ? " , Brennan asks in his book on the programme .
" The answer to this question is probably ' eventually ' .
. . one day it will all come together . "
But whether the biggest civilian computer project in the world will endure is another matter .
In the modern health service , Brennan points out , IT systems only survive for as long as NHS trusts are prepared to keep on paying to use and maintain them .
When and if the new IT systems become unloved relics , the Royal Free and other hospitals have plenty of dusty corners .
Although for now they 're still full of paper patient records .
No one 's had the time to scan them in yet ·

For some defense lawyers , the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was less about racial profiling than about how persons can be arrested simply for speaking angry words to a police officer .
The laws against “ disorderly conduct ” give police wide power to arrest people who are said to be disturbing the peace or disrupting the neighborhood .
In Massachusetts and elsewhere , courts have said the “ disorderly acts or language ” must take place in public where others can be disturbed .
It is probably not a crime of disorderly conduct for a homeowner , standing in his own kitchen , to speak abusively to a police officer .

According to his police report , Sgt. James Crowley said the professor was “ yelling very loud ” and “ accusing me of being a racist . ”
Complaining that the “ acoustics of the kitchen ” made it difficult to communicate , the officer said he “ told Gates that I would speak with him outside . ”
Once on the front porch , the officer arrested Gates for being loud and abusive in the presence of several neighbors who had gathered on the sidewalk .
“ You might think that in the United States , you have a right to state an opinion , even an offensive opinion .
But prosecutors like to say you do n’t have a right to mouth off to the police , ” said Boston defense lawyer Samuel Goldberg .

“ Gates was saying , ‘ You are hassling me because I ’m black . ’
I understand how that ’s offensive to a police officer .
“ It ’s astounding to me to call it criminal . ”
Police officers can arrest people in their own homes for accosting police , interfering with an investigation or resisting a lawful arrest .
But Gates was not accused of interfering with an investigation .
“ I would say it is not constitutional to arrest someone in his home just for being loud and abusive to a police officer , ” said Boston University law professor Tracey Maclin .
“ That ’s why the cop asked him to come outside , where he could be arrested for being disorderly in public . ”

Most lawyers who looked at the reported details of the incident say both men could have easily avoided a confrontation .
Crowley , after learning that Gates was the homeowner and not an intruder , could have left and ignored the abuse .
For his part , Gates continued to loudly berate Crowley as he was leaving the house , according the police report .
Gates was placed under arrest , the police report said , because of “ his continued tumultuous behavior outside the residence , in view of the public . ”

Marijuana Fear - Mongering and Misinformation
A friend recently directed me toward the website of The Foundation for a Drug - Free World , a Los Angeles - based non-profit whose tagline is â€œan effective drug education and drug prevention program.â€ 
I was shocked and dismayed to see the â€œdrug factsâ€ section ( they seem to have a monopoly on â€ œthe truthâ€ about drugs ) , which reads like an amateur 1950s terror campaign .
Marijuana , inexplicably listed under the headline â€œjoints , â€ apparently will cause you to have a heart attack , and eventually will lead to psychosis .
For MDMA , the complete list of short - term effects is as follows :
â€¢ impaired judgment
â€¢ false sense of affection
â€¢ confusion
â€¢ depression
â€¢ sleep problems
â€¢ severe anxiety
â€¢ paranoia
â€¢ drug craving
â€¢ muscle tension
â€¢ involuntary teeth clenching
â€¢ nausea
â€¢ blurred vision
â€¢ faintness and chills or sweating .
Someone clearly misnamed that drug ecstasy !
Arenâ€™t we past this fear - mongering and misinformation ?
Even the federal governmentâ€™s National Institute on Drug Abuse acknowledges that â€œstudies testing the effectiveness of information dissemination or fear - arousal approaches have consistently shown that they do not work.â€ 
To actually reduce our drug abuse and addiction problems ( and they are severe [ 1 ] ) , we need better .
And we should expect better , even from an organization founded by the Church of Scientology .

[ 1 ] According to the NIDA , in 2006 , 23 million people , or nearly 10 % of the American population over age 12 , needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- CIA Director Leon Panetta recently testified to Congress that the agency concealed information and misled lawmakers repeatedly since 2001 , according to a letter from seven House Democrats to Panetta made public Wednesday .
Seven House Democrats say CIA Director Leon Panetta recently testified that the CIA has misled Congress .
The letter to Panetta , dated June 26 , was published on the Web site of Rep. Anna Eshoo , D - California .
" Recently you testified that you have determined that top CIA officials have concealed significant actions from all members of Congress , and misled members for a number of years from 2001 to this week , " said the letter , signed by Eshoo and six other House Democrats -- Reps .
John Tierney of Massachusetts , Mike Thompson of California , Rush Holt of New Jersey , Alcee Hastings of Florida , Adam Smith of Washington and Janice Schakowsky of Illinois .
Read the signed letter on Rep. Eshoo 's Web site
The letter contained no details about what information the CIA officials allegedly concealed or how they purportedly misled members of Congress .
On February 11 , 2003 , CIA Director George Tenet told a Senate committee that U.S. intelligence indicated al Qaeda planned to attack targets in the United States and in the Middle East , perhaps with chemical weapons or radioactive materials .
On May 15 of this year , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the CIA of misleading Congress in a secret briefing she received in 2002 .
Pelosi said the CIA failed to inform her and others at the briefing about harsh interrogation techniques being used on terrorism suspects .
Do n't Miss Read the signed letter on Rep. Eshoo's Web site
Read the signed letter on Rep. Eshoo 's Web site CIA says Pelosi knew about waterboarding ; she says no
The CIA responded that Pelosi was told about the harsh techniques , including waterboarding , at the classified 2002 briefing .
However , the June 26 letter from the seven House Democrats noted that Panetta told CIA employees in a letter dated May 15 -- in response to the Pelosi allegation -- that it was not CIA policy to mislead Congress .
" Let me be clear :
It is not our policy or practice to mislead Congress .
That is against our laws and values , " the House Democrats quoted Panetta 's letter as saying .
The letter from the House Democrats asked Panetta to correct his May 15 statement " in light of your testimony . "
Asked about the Democrats ' letter , CIA spokesman George Little said Panetta " stands by his May 15 statement . "
" This agency and this director believe it is vital to keep the Congress fully and currently informed .
Director Panetta 's actions back that up , " Little said in a statement .
" As the letter from these ... representatives notes , it was the CIA itself that took the initiative to notify the oversight committees . "
The Democrats ' letter became public the night before the House is scheduled to vote on an intelligence spending measure that includes a provision to expand the number of House and Senate members privy to the kind of secret briefing that Pelosi received .
The White House opposes the provision to expand the number of briefing participants from the current eight to 40 members of Congress .
A White House memo warned President Obama 's senior advisers would recommend a veto of the bill if it contained the expanded briefing provision .
CNN 's Deirdre Walsh , Bob Kovach and Pam Benson contributed to this report .

That muttered curse word that reflexively comes out when you stub your toe could actually make it easier to bear the throbbing pain , a new study suggests .
Swearing is a common response to pain , but no previous research has connected the uttering of an expletive to the actual physical experience of pain .
" Swearing has been around for centuries and is an almost universal human linguistic phenomenon , " said Richard Stephens of Keele University in England and one of the authors of the new study .
" It taps into emotional brain centers and appears to arise in the right brain , whereas most language production occurs in the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain . "
Stephens and his fellow Keele researchers John Atkins and Andrew Kingston sought to test how swearing would affect an individual 's tolerance to pain .
Because swearing often has an exaggerating effect that can overstate the severity of pain , the team thought that swearing would lessen a person 's tolerance .
As it turned out , the opposite seems to be true .
The researchers enlisted 64 undergraduate volunteers and had them submerge their hand in a tub of ice water for as long as possible while repeating a swear word of their choice .
The experiment was then repeated with the volunteer repeating a more common word that they would use to describe a table .
Contrary to what the researcher expected , the volunteers kept their hands submerged longer while repeating the swear word .
The researchers think that the increase in pain tolerance occurs because swearing triggers the body 's natural " fight - or - flight " response .
Stephens and his colleagues suggest that swearing may increase aggression ( seen in accelerated heart rates ) , which downplays weakness to appear stronger or more macho .
" Our research shows one potential reason why swearing developed and why it persists , " Stephens said .
The results of the study are detailed in the Aug. 5 issue of the journal NeuroReport .

Greenpeace finds Amazon deforestation in supply chains of global consumer products giants .
Major international companies are unwittingly driving the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest through their purchases of leather , beef and other products supplied from the Brazil cattle industry , alleges a new report from Greenpeace .
The report , Slaughtering the Amazon , is based on a three - year undercover investigation of the Brazilian cattle industry , which accounts for 80 percent of Amazon deforestation and roughly 14 percent of the world ’s annual forest loss .
Greenpeace found that Brazilian beef companies are important suppliers of raw materials used by leading global brands , including Adidas / Reebok , Nike , Carrefour , Eurostar , Unilever , Johnson & Johnson , Toyota , Honda , Gucci , Louis Vuitton , Prada , IKEA , Kraft , Tesco and Wal - Mart , among others .

“ Top brand running shoes , ready meals and designer handbags may have an environmental footprint that includes the trashing of the Amazon and could also be linked to human rights abuses , ” said Pat Venditti , Forest Campaign Coordinator , Greenpeace International .
“ Companies worldwide must ensure that their supply chains are not caught up in this destructive industry .
They must support climate protection by pulling out of deforestation . ”
Greenpeace ’s investigation also revealed that Brazilian government is a major stakeholder in three of the country ’s top cattle producers – Bertin , JBS and Marfrig .
Given this “ vested interest ” and the role cattle ranching plays in forest loss , the report highlights an inherent conflict between in the government ’s aim to expand beef while simultaneously reducing deforestation under its climate plan .
“ By bankrolling the destruction of the Amazon for cattle , President Lula ’s government is undermining its own climate commitments as well as the global effort to tackle the climate crisis , ” said Andre Muggiati , Greenpeace Brazil , Amazon campaigner .
“ If it wants to be part of the climate solution , Lula ’s government must get out of bed with cattle industry , and instead commit to ending Amazon deforestation .
Otherwise it will be culpable in the global climate catastrophe that will ensue . ”

President Lula has committed Brazil to cut Amazon forest loss by 70 percent from a 1996 - 2005 baseline .
While details of the plan are still unclear , Lula hopes to fund the scheme by raising $ 21 billion in donations from industrialized countries .
So far only Norway has committed any money to the endeavor , which is known as the Amazon Fund .
The Nordic country has pledged up to one billion dollars by 2015 depending on Brazil ’s success in curtailing deforestation .
Still at the same time that Lula is promoting the Amazon Fund , Brazilian lawmakers are weighing bills that would significantly expand industrial activities in the Amazon rainforest .
The proposed legislation would underwrite extensive infrastructure projects , grant legal title for illegally deforested Amazon land , and scale back environmental protections for forest reserves on private land .
Greenpeace notes that the government has offered $ 41 billion in credit to farmers to boost production , or nearly twice the entire amount of the proposed Amazon Fund .
Full of accusations , short on solutions
Slaughtering the Amazon urges international companies to suspend buying from tainted cattle suppliers and calls for an immediate moratorium on further Amazon deforestation .
The report also demands support for a strong climate treaty at the December 2009 U.N. climate talks in Copenhagen .
Greenpeace says that any climate deal must include a mechanism to fund forest protection .
The report — which traces cattle products used in shoes , clothing and fashion accessories , beauty products , and read - made meals back to their origin : ranches in the Amazon — aims to expose environmental transgressions rather than make sound recommendations for improving the environmental performance of Brazil ’s beef industry .
Nevertheless the report may bolster an effort to create a certification system for beef produced responsibly in the Amazon .
The initiative , founded and led by Aliança da Terra , will reward ranchers who maintain their legal forest reserves ( Brazilian law requires landowners to keep 80 percent of their land forested ) , establish fire breaks and riparian buffer zones , and take other measures to minimize the impact of their operations .
The report may be used to justify intensification of cattle production in the Amazon .
Intensification would reduce the need to clear more land for pasture , but would carry environmental costs , including increased pollution and the need to boost supplemental feeding of livestock .
Presently a selling point for Brazilian beef in some markets is that it is generally not associated with industrial feedlots .
Others will seize upon the report as another justification to reduce beef consumption .
A 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) found that meat production generates more greenhouse gas emissions ( 14 - 22 percent of global emissions ) than either transportation or industry .
Of meats , beef is the most carbon - intensive with the production of a 1 - pound paddy resulting in roughly 36 - pounds of CO2 emissions or 13 times the emissions from chicken .

Brazil could triple agricultural output without touching the Amazon rainforest
( 04/15/2009 ) Brazil could triple its agricultural without the needing to clear additional rainforest in the Amazon Basin , Roberto Mangabeira Unger , Brazil ’s Minister of Strategic Affairs , told Bloomberg in an interview .
The argument that Brazil can expand its agricultural production without harming the Amazon is a mantra among Brazilian officials .
The country has vast tracts of pasture and agricultural land that are being underutilized or have been abandoned , but rapidly appreciating land prices , coupled with poor governance and inconsistent enforcement of environmental laws , means that it is often more profitable to clear new forest land than to rehabilitate pasture .
37,000 sq km of Amazon rainforest destroyed or damaged in 2008
( 03/19/2009 ) Logging and fires damaged nearly 25,000 square kilometers ( 9,650 square miles ) of Amazon rainforest in the August 2007 - July 2008 period , an increase of 67 percent over the prior year period , according to a new mapping system developed by Brazil ’s National Institute for Space Research ( INPE ) .
The damage comes on top of the nearly 12,000 sq km ( 4,600 sq mi ) of rainforest that was cleared during the year .
Beef consumption fuels rainforest destruction
( 02/16/2009 ) Nearly 80 percent of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon results from cattle ranching , according to a new report by Greenpeace .
The finding confirms what Amazon researchers have long known – that Brazil ’s rise to become the world ’s largest exporter of beef has come at the expense of Earth ’s biggest rainforest .
More than 38,600 square miles has been cleared for pasture since 1996 , bringing the total area occupied by cattle ranches in the Brazilian Amazon to 214,000 square miles , an area larger than France .
The legal Amazon , an region consisting of rainforests and a biologically - rich grassland known as cerrado , is now home to more than 80 million head of cattle .
For comparison , the entire U.S. herd was 96 million in 2008 .
How to save the Amazon rainforest
( 01/04/2009 ) Environmentalists have long voiced concern over the vanishing Amazon rainforest , but they have n’t been particularly effective at slowing forest loss .
In fact , despite the hundreds of millions of dollars in donor funds that have flowed into the region since 2000 and the establishment of more than 100 million hectares of protected areas since 2002 , average annual deforestation rates have increased since the 1990s , peaking at 73,785 square kilometers ( 28,488 square miles ) of forest loss between 2002 and 2004 .
With land prices fast appreciating , cattle ranching and industrial soy farms expanding , and billions of dollars ’ worth of new infrastructure projects in the works , development pressure on the Amazon is expected to accelerate .
Given these trends , it is apparent that conservation efforts alone will not determine the fate of the Amazon or other rainforests .
Some argue that market measures , which value forests for the ecosystem services they provide as well as reward developers for environmental performance , will be the key to saving the Amazon from large - scale destruction .
In the end it may be the very markets currently driving deforestation that save forests .
Lula pledges big cuts in Amazon deforestation — after he leaves office
( 12/12/2008 ) Last week Brazil unveiled plans to cut deforestation substantially from a 1996 - 2005 baseline of 19,533 square kilometers per year .
The announcement met a mixed response from conservationists .
Some applauded the decision to set hard targets for reducing deforestation , others say the targets were too low and that the country should aim for zero net deforestation by 2015 .
Nevertheless as more details have emerged , it becomes clear that the onus for reining in deforestation falls on Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ’s successor .
Future threats to the Amazon rainforest
( 07/31/2008 ) Between June 2000 and June 2008 , more than 150,000 square kilometers of rainforest were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon .

This is a look at past , current and potential future drivers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon .
Land invasions undermine Amazon forest law
( 04/03/2008 ) Land invasions are undermining a Brazilian law that requires ranchers to keep 80 percent of their land forested , according to reports from the Amazon state of Mato Grosso .
A run up in land prices , driven by surging soy and cattle production in the region , combined with a lackadaisical response from law enforcement authorities are blamed for the incursions .
Amazon rainforest burning “ worst ” in memory
( 10/16/2007 ) Fires continue to rage in the Amazon , according to local reports .
John Cain Carter , a rancher who runs Alianca da Terra , an environmental accountability group for agricultural operators , says that the fires are the worst he has ever seen in the region .
“ I have never seen fires this bad , ” he told mongabay.com .
“ The fires are even worse than in 1998 ’s El Nino event . ” NASA satellite images released at the end of September confirm widespread burning in the Amazon state of Mato Grosso .
Can cattle ranchers and soy farmers save the Amazon ?
( 06/06/2007 ) John Cain Carter , a Texas rancher who moved to the heart of the Amazon 11 years ago and founded what is perhaps the most innovative organization working in the Amazon , Alianca da Terra , believes the only way to save the Amazon is through the market .
Carter says that by giving producers incentives to reduce their impact on the forest , the market can succeed where conservation efforts have failed .
What is most remarkable about Alianca ’s system is that it has the potential to be applied to any commodity anywhere in the world .
That means palm oil in Borneo could be certified just as easily as sugar cane in Brazil or sheep in New Zealand .
By addressing the supply chain , tracing agricultural products back to the specific fields where they were produced , the system offers perhaps the best market - based solution to combating deforestation .
Combining these approaches with large - scale land conservation and scientific research offers what may be the best hope for saving the Amazon .
English footballer David Beckham has confessed to OCD and says his obsessiveness helps keep him training ( Image : Giuliano Bevilacqua / Rex Features )
Many athletes feel obliged to perform bizarre rituals before competing .
Experts say that sometimes these behaviours can stray into obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) and can even force players out of competition .
A number of sports stars have confessed to the odd habits that help them stay focused .
Here are 10 famous examples compiled by psychiatrist Thomas Newmark of Cooper University Hospital in Camden , New Jersey , and New Scientist staff .
1. Soccer star Kolo Toure , central defender for Arsenal and the Ivory Coast , likes to be last onto the pitch .
In February this made him miss the start of the second half of Arsenal ’s European Champions League tie against Italian team AS Roma – and earned him a booking for entering the field of play without the referee ’s permission .

France lifted the trophy .
4. Marshall Faulk , former running back with the Indianapolis Colts and the St Louis Rams , habitually wore all black on the way to the stadium .
5. Turk Wendell , formerly a pitcher for Major League Baseball teams including the Chicago Cubs and New York Mets , was known for multiple rituals including brushing his teeth between innings .
6. Wade Boggs , formerly third baseman for the Boston Red Sox , had a similar array of rituals , including eating chicken before each game , and writing the Hebrew word Chai , meaning “ living ” , in the dirt before each bat .
7. South African cricketer Neil McKenzie would tape his bat to the ceiling and insist all toilet seats in the dressing room were down before going out to bat .
After being dropped from the national side in 2004 , he recovered from what he describes as OCD , and returned as a successful opening batsman in 2008 .
8. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan always wore his North Carolina college shorts under his Chicago Bulls uniform
9 . England soccer star David Beckham has admitted that he suffers from OCD , which may explain the obsessive practice that underpins his prowess with free kicks .
He hates the asymmetry of odd numbers , and will throw away one can of Diet Pepsi if he has three in the fridge .
10 . World tennis number one Rafael Nadal of Spain is similarly obsessive about his drinks .

SHANGHAI  A Chinese businessman named Zhao Danyang paid a record $ 2.1 million in a charity auction on eBay last year to win a lunch date with one of his heroes : Warren E. Buffett , the so - called Oracle of Omaha .
This was a chance to get close to the world ’s greatest stock picker , Mr. Zhao says , and to pick his brain about investing , the global financial crisis and philanthropy .
But a day before the lunch , which took place on June 24 at the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in New York City , Mr. Zhao told the media he would offer Mr. Buffett a stock tip of his own : a little - known Chinese retailer called WuMart .
“ I did n’t want to influence the market , ” Mr. Zhao , 37 , said in a telephone interview Friday .
“ It was just a tip from a friend . ”
All day Paul Krugman has been involved in a brouhaha over a 2002 column which seemed to be advocating a housing bubble to get us out of the recession .
He says he was n't calling for a bubble , just that he was just explaining Alan Greenspan was trying to do .
Mark Thornton has gone through Krugman 's entire archives and undermined this defense .
Many of Krugman 's own quotes from that era suggest that he was an aggressive advocate of low - low interest in order to bring the housing market to a broil , thus bringing us out of the recession .
In Krugman 's defense , this was 2001 , when the economy was in the midst of cratering .
As yet , no one has dug up quotes suggesting that Krugman was still pounding the table for low rates and a housing boom in , say , 2004 , which is when most observers agree the housing " bubble " really started .
Here 's the full compendium compiled by Mark :
German Interview , undated
http://www.pkarchive.org/global/welt.html
" During phases of weak growth there are always those who say that lower interest rates will not help .
They overlook the fact that low interest rates act through several channels .
For instance , more housing is built , which expands the building sector .
You must ask the opposite question : why in the world should n't you lower interest rates ? "

That is , I 've always believed that a speculative bubble need not lead to a recession , as long as interest rates are cut quickly enough to stimulate alternative investments .
But I had to face the fact that speculative bubbles usually are followed by recessions .
My excuse has been that this was because the policy makers moved too slowly -- that central banks were typically too slow to cut interest rates in the face of a burst bubble , giving the downturn time to build up a lot of momentum .
That was why I , like many others , was frustrated at the smallish cut at the last Federal Open Market Committee meeting : I was pretty sure that Alan Greenspan had the tools to prevent a disastrous recession , but worried that he might be getting behind the curve .
However , let 's give credit where credit is due : Mr. Greenspan has cut rates since then .
And while some of us may have been urging him to move even faster , the Fed 's four interest - rate cuts since the slowdown became apparent represent an unusually aggressive response by historical standards .
It 's still not clear that Mr. Greenspan has caught up with the curve -- let 's have at least one more rate cut , please -- but the interest - rate cuts do , cross your fingers , seem to be having an effect .
If we succeed in avoiding recession , this will mark a big win for let - bygones - be - bygones , and a big loss for crime - and - punishment .
And that will be very good news not just for this business cycle , but for business cycles to come .

" KRUGMAN : I think frankly it 's got to be -- business investment is not going to be the driving force in this recovery .
It has to come from things like housing , things that have not been ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) .
DOBBS : We see , Paul , housing at near record levels , we see automobile purchases near record levels .
The consumer is still very much in this economy .
Can he or she -- or I should say he and she , can they bring back this economy ?
KRUGMAN : Well , as far as the arithmetic goes , yes , it is possible .
Will the Fed cut interest rates enough ?
Will long - term rates fall enough to get the consumer , get the housing sector there in time ?
We do n't know "

" KRUGMAN : I 'm a little depressed .
You know , inventories , probably that 's over , the inventory slump .
But you look at the things that could drive a recovery , business investment , nothing happening .
Housing , long - term rates have n't fallen enough to produce a boom there .
The trade balance is going to get worst before it gets better because the dollar is still very strong .
It 's not a happy picture . "

" Consumers , who already have low savings and high debt , probably can't contribute much .
But housing , which is highly sensitive to interest rates , could help lead a recovery ....
But there has been a peculiar disconnect between Fed policy and the financial variables that affect housing and trade .
Housing demand depends on long - term rather than short - term interest rates -- and though the Fed has cut short rates from 6.5 to 3.75 percent since the beginning of the year , the 10 - year rate is slightly higher than it was on Jan.
1 .... Sooner or later , of course , investors will realize that 2001 is n't 1998 .
When they do , mortgage rates and the dollar will come way down , and the conditions for a recovery led by housing and exports will be in place .

" Post - terror nerves aside , what mainly ails the U.S. economy is too much of a good thing .
During the bubble years businesses overspent on capital equipment ; the resulting overhang of excess capacity is a drag on investment , and hence a drag on the economy as a whole .
In time this overhang will be worked off .
Meanwhile , economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment .
Low interest rates , which promote spending on housing and other durable goods , are the main answer .
But it seems inevitable that there will also be a fiscal stimulus package "

" The good news about the U.S. economy is that it fell into recession , but it did n't fall off a cliff .
Most of the credit probably goes to the dogged optimism of American consumers , but the Fed 's dramatic interest rate cuts helped keep housing strong even as business investment plunged . "

Larry Harnisch , of the Los Angeles Times blog The Daily Mirror , sent in this image , published in The Mirror in 1959 , that illustrated how women ’s bodies were judged in the Miss Universe contest :
Text :
ALL FIGURED OUT–This chart is used by judges as [ a ] guide in picking Miss Universe .
First six show figure flaws , seventh is perfectly proportioned .
( 1 ) Shoulders too square .
( 2 ) Shoulders too sloping .
( 3 ) Hips too wide .
( 4 ) Shoulder bones too pronounced .
( 5 ) Shoulders and back hunched .
( 6 ) Legs irregular , with spaces at calves , knees , thighs .
( 7 ) The form divine , needs only a beautiful face .
( I had no idea that I have irregular legs until I saw figure 6 .
My self esteem is taking quite the hit .
I ca n’t tell if there ’s anything wrong with my shoulders , though –I ’ll have to ask someone else for an opinion . )
Two points :
First , some people like to suggest that men are programmed by evolution to find a particular body shape attractive .
Clearly , if judging women ’s bodies requires this much instruction , either ( 1 ) nature has left us incompetent or ( 2 ) cultural norms defining beauty overwhelm any biological predisposition to be attracted to specific body types .
Second , the chart reveals the level of scrutiny women faced in 1959 ( and I ’d argue it ’s not so different today ) .
It made me think of my years in 4 - H .
I was a farm kid and I showed steers for several years and also took part in livestock and meat judging competitions .
I was good at it , just so you know .
Anyway , what the beauty pageant image brought to mind was the handouts we ’d look at to learn how to judge livestock .
Here are some examples , from Kansas State University ’s 4 - H judging guide ( pdf here ) :
This poor pig has a low - set tail –how dreadful :
It ’s almost as if , like superior livestock , beautiful women are a desired cultural product in which we should all invest and be invested .
You might compare these to some of the images in our post about sexualizing food that come from Carol Adams ’s website .

As long as I have loved sports , I have had a unique interest in team uniforms and logos .
Why ?
I have no idea .
Perhaps it is a cognitive issue in which I like certain colors or patterns .
I have no idea why .
But , in my opinion there is something great about a nice uniform , the color combinations , the crest on the front of the jersey ’s that represent who you are going to battle for .
In medieval times , barbarians were still just barbarians , yet they still grasped the concept of being a “ team ” and having an insignia that bound them together as a unit .
That is how I associate today ’s sports with what we see teams donning whenever they go to battle .
Today , there are of course no life or death situations on the line , as they were in the medieval times , however , the concept of team unity and cohesion is there .
These are more than uniforms .
Everyone has their opinions on team uniforms or team logos .
Going out of the hockey realm , let ’s look at the NCAA ’s version of Project Runway , the Oregon Ducks .
They have new uniforms every year , new helmets every year !
That is taking it too far in my opinion and it has just become a marketing tool at that point .
To me , what makes a great uniform is how consistent the design is over the years while other teams have changed around you and your team still remains the same .
Also , a uniform that remains basic has something about it that sticks out over the more flamboyant patterns that some teams may have .
The New York Yankees , a uniform that is symbolic in all of sports .
It has become that way because it has remained simple , classy and has had the same design over many years .
That is what makes a great uniform to me .
Now , I would like to introduce to you , my top 10 hockey uniforms of both past and present .
This is totally opinionated on my part and I will be choosing them based on what I mentioned above , simplicity , consistency and cohesion .
10 ) Team Sweden :
The color combo of royal blue and gold has always been a favorite of mine .
The three crowns on the jersey have been Sweden ’s logo forever it seems .
Some of these international teams have new uniforms every time we see them ( which for most people is every four years ) .
The Swedes have remained consistent with their threads and that gets them on the board and also makes them the # 1 international jersey .
9 ) Buffalo Sabres original jersey : Alright I know it is the same color combination as Team Sweden ’s , but I did say I liked that combo .
But , in all seriousness , this is a favorite across the board , everywhere you go .
The integration of the buffalo for the city of Buffalo is excellent .
Plus , the two saber swords crossing are both simple and artistic .
8 ) Montreal Canadians Centennial Jersey : I could have easily put the Canadians regular jersey in this spot due to it being the Yankees jersey of the hockey world .
These white ones , however , are crisp and clean , yet still have that “ C - H ” logo that everyone has become so familiar with .
7 ) Edmonton Oilers :
When the Oilers changed these uniforms to darker blue and that copper looking color , well … it sucked .
These uniforms were the uniforms of a dynasty the likes of which we will never see again .
A dynasty with Messier , Gretzky , Kurri , Lowe , Fuhr … the list goes on and on .
Why did they ever change it ?
Who knows .
But these jerseys are here to stay on my list .
6 ) Toronto Maple Leafs :
The Maple Leafs are one of the leagues most beloved franchises and one of the most hated ( depends who you talk to ) .
The Leafs have changed their uniforms a lot over the years , but they have remained the same for the most part .
The colors have always been the same ( except for when they were the Toronto St. Pats ) and the simplistic blue and white combination has become the quintessential identifier of Toronto .
5 ) Boston Bruins Third Jersey :
This is the one and only third jersey I will have in here .
I love the Bruins jerseys in general , but I really , really love these .
The old school logo , now used as a primary one on the third jersey , as well as the B ’s black and gold make it the best third jersey and one of the best overall .
4 ) Chicago Blackhawks ( all 3 ) : I know above I said the Bruin ’s third was the only third I would put in here .
I do n’t really consider the black uniform the Hawks wear as a third jersey .
It is the same jersey as the other ones , just a different color .
That is why I like the Hawks uni ’s so much .
They have that awesome logo of the Indian and the red , black and white stripes bring all three uniforms together .
Can you tell I am a fan of the Original Six designs ?
3 ) New Jersey Devils :
Call me a homer , call me what you want .
But , no one can argue that the Devils have always remained classic with their uniform ( since changing from red and green to red and black ) .
They have never had an alternate jersey and Lou has said that he feels that other jerseys are too gimmicky and take away from a franchises tradition .
I agree on that 100 % .
Also , the logo is very simple and smart .
Most people may look at it and think , “ What is that ? ”
Well folks , it is an “ N ” and a “ J ” put together to form an “ NJ ” with devils horns and a devil tail .
Pretty brilliant if you ask me .
2 ) Quebec Nordiques : A team that is not even around anymore , sadly .
These uniforms are awesome .
I do n’t care who disagrees , they look great .
What that logo is exactly or what a Nordique is per say , I ca n’t give you a definitive answer .
All I know , is that the royal crosses on the bottom of the jersey , the colors and the hockey stick / hockey net logo all mesh .
It just works .
1 ) Minnesota North Stars :
This particular uniform to me is the absolute best ever .
It may not fit under my “ simplistic ” category .
But , just look at how nice it looks .
The awesome “ N ” logo with the arrow and the star .
The integration of black with the yellow and green fits perfectly .
This is one of the best logos and one of the best uniforms of all time , hands down .
So my last two are from teams that do n’t even exist anymore , but when they were alive and kicking , they sure knew how to dress .
So , there it is , my top 10 hockey uniforms of all time .
Perhaps I left one off that you feel needed to be on here , I sure have my honorable mentions .
The Hartford Whalers , the Detroit Red Wings , The New York Rangers , and the Vancouver Canucks all have good uniforms , but they just did n’t do enough for me to get into my top ten .
Oh , well .
Bridge of Blood By good - name Watch
4 Favourites 1 Comment 1K Views
It 's actually not blood ...
It 's water I colored red after I took the picture .
I used something called " photoshop " which magically makes pictures better .
I do n't know what you 'll be more interested in ; the fancy method of tediously removing all the green and blue or perhaps the picture itself .
The bridge is in Vincennes Indiana taken at sunset .
I had to wait around for about 20 minutes before the sun was where I wanted it to be .
I would have liked it to be right above the water but I cant get that angle with the bridge where it is .
I 've petitioned the state to build another identical bridge down the river till its around that bend so I could capture the actual shot I want .
I 've yet to get a response .
I 've also looked into tweaking earth 's orbit just enough to make this picture work because I think working with the government will be impossible .

Ok , for those who want to try making their own Twinkies at home I ’ve got the exact recipe plus an instructional video here by a guy who specifically specializes in cloning famous food items ( big macs , Starbucks cranberry bars , snickers , etc. ) .
The Twinkie was invented on April 6 , 1930 by bakery manager James Dewar in Schiller Park , Illinois , who was working for Continental Baking Company , the parent company behind Hostess , he made use of pans that were only used for shortcake production during the very short 6 - week strawberry season .
The Twinkie originally contained a banana cream filling , but they replaced it with the current standard vanilla cream filling because of a banana shortage during World War II .
In June 2007 , Hostess announced that they were going to start making the banana - flavored Twinkie again .
The banana - flavored version had originally been started as a limited - time promotion , however , due to the fact that sales went up by 20 % when the banana version was offered , Hostess has decided that the banana Twinkie will now become a permanent part of the Twinkie product line .
Here ’s the video , the specific recipe is just below it :
Homemade Twinkie Recipe
Ingredients for the cake :
Non-stick spray
4 egg whites
1 16 - oz box of golden pound cake mix
2/3 cup of water
Ingredients for the filling :
2 tsp very hot water
1/4 tsp salt
2 cups marshmellow cream ( or one 7 oz jar )
1/2 cup shortening
1/3 cup powdered sugar
1/2 tsp vanilla
What to do :
Pre-heat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit .
Make the molds out of aluminum foil as per the instructions in the video , you will need 10 of them , and do n’t forget to use the non -stick spray .
Beat the egg whites until stiff as per the video .
In a separate bowl combine the cake mix with water and beat until thoroughly blended ( around 2 minutes ) .
Then , pour the egg whites into the cake mix and slowly combine until blended .
Pour the batter into the molds such that it ’s about 3 / 4 of an inch deep in each one .
Bake in the pre-heated oven for around 30 minutes , or until the cakes are golden brown and a toothpick will come out clean .
To do the cream filling , first mix the salt into the bowl of hot water , and mix until the salt is dissolved .
Let it cool .
Combine the marshmellow cream , shortening , powdered sugar , and vanilla in a bowl and mix , preferably with an electric mixer on high , until fluffy .
Now pour the salt water solution in and mix .
When the cakes are done , just use a chopstick and bag or pastry gun as in the video to inject the cream filling .
Yum .
Cloning Other Delicious Recipes ( from places like Cheesecake Factory , Olive Garden , etc. )
After discovering and trying ( with great success ! ) this twinkie recipe a few months ago , I went in search of further recipes of famous dishes ( and especially deserts ) that I might like , and ended up learning how to make all sorts of dishes that I had tried before and loved from well - known restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory , Olive Garden , Red Lobster , and more .
The way I did this was I found out that there was actually a series of books that had been published specifically dedicated to exposing the recipes for these dishes and teaching you precisely how to replicate them at home !
If you ’re really interested in doing this sort of stuff and you enjoyed the Twinkie recipe above , I highly recommend you check it out , it ’s called : America ’s Secret Recipes ( click here to check out their site ) , and they show you how to make dishes like some of these that I tried and loved : Applebee ’s Orange Creamsicle Cake , Hard Rock Cafe ’s ‘ Pig Sandwich ’ , Mrs. Field ’s Peanut Butter Cookies , Olive Garden ’s Apple Carmelina , and P.F. Chang ’s Mongolian Beef .
There are 2 volumes and several hundred recipes , those were just my favorites–again , I ’ve personally tried the recipes in this book , if you follow them properly you will get an absolutely identical result to what your favorite restaurant can do , I ca n’t recommend it highly enough if you liked what you got with the Twinkies and want to do more of this .

WASHINGTON --
It is more important that health - care legislation inject stiff competition among insurance plans than it is for Congress to create a pure government - run option , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said .
" The goal is to have a means and a mechanism to keep the private insurers honest , " he said in an interview .
" The goal is non-negotiable ; the path is " negotiable .
President Barack Obama has campaigned vigorously for a full public option .
But he 's also said that he wo n't draw a " line in the sand " over this point .
On Tuesday , the White House issued a statement reiterating his support for a public plan .
" I am pleased by the progress we 're making on health care reform and still believe , as I 've said before , that one of the best ways to bring down costs , provide more choices , and assure quality is a public option that will force the insurance companies to compete and keep them honest , " the president said in the statement .
" I look forward to a final product that achieves these very important goals . "
The jockeying over the public plan came as the Senate Finance Committee pushed for a bipartisan deal .
To help pay for the package , the committee planned to announce an agreement Wednesday with hospitals and the White House for $ 155 billion over a decade in reductions to Medicare and charity - care payments for hospitals , according to a person familiar with the agreement .
That will help pay for the legislation , expected to cost at least $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
I stumbled on an interesting resource about social class today .
It was a list of various advantages a person might have had while growing up ( such as Father attended college , Went to summer camp , Had a private tutor before age 18 , Went on a cruise with family , etc. ) .
The person who posted the list was expected to bold those that applied to him or her in order to reveal the privileges he or she had inherited .
This struck me as something that would make an interesting classroom exercise , and lo and behold , after a little Google searching , I learned that that was how it started in the first place .
The original classroom exercise was titled “ Take a Step Forward , ” and was developed byWill Barratt , Meagan Cahill , Angie Carlen , Minnette Huck , Drew Lurker , & Stacy Ploskonka at Indiana State University .
It involves students starting out in a line and then each person taking a step forward for each item that applied to them .
The site includes instructions to help make the exercise a learning experience .
The full list of privileges for which you would take a step includes :
If your father went to college before you started If your father finished college before you started
If your mother went to college before you started
If your mother finished college before you started
If you have any relative who is an attorney , physician , or professor .
If your family was the same or higher class than your high school teachers
If you had a computer at home when you were growing up
If you had your own computer at home when you were growing up
If you had more than 50 books at home when you were growing up
If you had more than 500 books at home when you were growing up
If were read children ’s books by a parent when you were growing up
If you ever had lessons of any kind as a child or a teen
If you had more than two kinds of lessons as a child or a teen
If the people in the media who dress and talk like you were portrayed positively
If you had a credit card with your name on it before college
If you had or will have less than $ 5000 in student loans when you graduate
If you had or will have no student loans when you graduate
If you went to a private high school
If you went to summer camp
If you had a private tutor ( US students only )
If you have been to Europe more than once as a child or teen ( International question )
If you have been to the US more than once as a child or teen
If your family vacations involved staying at hotels rather than KOA or at relatives homes
If all of your clothing has been new If your parents gave you a car that was not a hand - me - down from them If there was original art in your house as a child or teen
If you had a phone in your room
If your parent owned their own house or apartment when you were a child or teen
If you had your own room as a child or teen
If you participated in an SAT / ACT prep course
If you had your own cell phone in High School
If you had your own TV as a child or teen
If you opened a mutual fund or IRA in High School or College
If you have ever flown anywhere on a commercial airline
If you ever went on a cruise with your family
If your parents took you to museums and art galleries as a child or teen
If you were unaware of how much heating bills were for your family
I confess to having some reservations about doing this in the public way described for fear that it would make some students ( especially at either extreme ) unduly uncomfortable , but I do think there would be ways to modify it if that is a concern .
For example , it would be possible to have students fill out the sheet and then turn in their score and then report the scores to the class as a whole and discuss them .
Students could still self - report in discussion that way if they so chose .
The site also includes additional resources designed to encourage a deeper understanding of social class including the Social Class Knowledge Quiz and Campus Connection ( a simulation about social capital ) .
They have also created a blog called Social Class on Campus .
P.S. I ’m surprised I ’ve not seen this one on Facebook yet .
I ’m sure it ’s only a matter of time .

Robert F Kennedy , hypocrite ( not breaking news )
10 November 2008 | vanity
Posted on by Lorianne
Quoth Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on September 15 , 2008 on the Huffington Post in criticism of Governor Sarah Palin :
Fascist writer Westbrook Pegler , an avowed racist who Sarah Palin approvingly quoted in her acceptance speech for the moral superiority of small town values , expressed his fervent hope about my father , Robert F. Kennedy , as he contemplated his own run for the presidency in 1965 , that some white patriot of the Southern tier will spatter his spoonful of brains in public premises before the snow flies . 

Yet the same Robert F Kennedy , to my knowledge , has n't said boo about Bill Ayers ' dedication of his book " Prairie Fire " to Sirhan Sirhan ( and has publically called Sirhan a hero ) .... the man who actually shot and killed his father !
Unbelievable !

She did n’t mention him by name , and I ’m sure would n’t have used the quote if she knew what a real fascist bigot he actually was .
Wonder if she wrote the speech herself , or who it was who fed her the quote .
Either way , it does indicate a little naivete on her part .
And I ’m surprised to hear Westbrook Pegler was still writing and apparently being read in the mid 60s .
He was a relic by that time .

Nice pickup there on Sirhan Sirhan .
Of coruse RFK got his started working for Joe McCarthy , a man whom he deeply admired .
To : Numbers Guy
All the charges of socialist , marxist , communist that were hurled at Obama this election , and not one peep about McCarthyism that I ’m aware .
Weird .
To : Lorianne
Yet this clown will be a cabinet member for Obama who ’s sugar daddy Bill Ayers dedicated a book to his father ’s murderer .
Way to go RFK , Jr .

Yes , politics makes strange bedfellows indeed ... but this is really sick .

And it turns out Matthew Scully wrote that part of the speech quite a bit before Sarah Palin was chosen as the running mate .
Interestingly , Matthew Scully is as unstereotypical a Republican as Palin is , and is known for being ferociously opposed to hunters , and all forms of what could be considered animal cruelty , for profit or otherwise .
He wrote a very well received book called DOMINION .
So he almost seems the worst fit possible to author a Sarah Palin speech .
Almost looks like a setup were it not for the abovementioned fact of the timing .

If said timing is true .
Who ’s word do we take on that ?

Not necessarily in the reputation or fact of the person who originally uttered them :
Seems to me that the value of any quote is in the words themselves - what do they say ?
Not necessarily in the reputation or fact of the person who originally uttered them :
Anyone know the quote that everyone is referring to ?

RFK Jr. is really a demented moonbat , if his name was n’t Kennedy he would be masturbating on his keyboard and posting vanities with 4 - Letter words on DU .

Sirhan Sirhan was a Palestinan , pulled off the first real big Muslim terrorist job by killing RFK , history has been re-written .
Much as it ’s been re-written that a Marxist - Leninist DIDN ’T kill JFK .
Lee Harvey Oswald , an ex-Marine with a rifle , fueled by his Marxist - Leninism and delusions of grandeur killed JFK .

Either way , it does indicate a little naivete on her part .
There are millions and millions of facts and quotes about all kinds of things in this world today that might come up about countless subjects , political or otherwise .
Who can keep track of even an eighth of them .
Do you really think that everybody who is not naive would have recognized this particular quote ?
Sarah Palin was running from one place to the next almost everyday in a whirlwind of activity .
She certainly did not have time to research every statement handed to her in her speeches .
She should of been able to trust the writers , that they were not putting things into the speeches that were sourced from fascist bigots .

RFK Jr. was convicted on drug charges years ago .
To listen to him talk , I think that the drugs affected his mind and his throat .

Mark Zuckerberg says people use Facebook " to stay updated on what 's happening around them and share with the people in their lives . "
Turns out it 's true .
According to AddToAny , a company that provides Web publishers tools to let their users share content , more people use Facebook to share links than any other service -- including , to our surprise , email .
But watch out , Facebook .
As a means of sharing content , Twitter is already about half as popular with only about one - tenth as many users .
This matters because content - sharers are the human crawlers that power both Facebook and Twitter 's real - time search engines -- which could turn out to be the way both startups end up making big money .

To the human eye the bursting of a bubble is a simple affair .
One prod of a finger and - pop ! - it 's vanished in a split second .
But as these breathtaking pictures show , the process is spectacular - if only we could see it .
These images were taken with a slow - motion camera to show every stage of the soap bubble 's disappearance .
Richard
Heeks spent weeks capturing his images of the bursting of a bubble :
This is how it begins
A tiny prod with a fingertip and the delicate surface of the bubble is broken
After being poked the surface of the breaks up , from one side to another , turning its surface into a multitude of droplets which appear to hang in the air
Photographer Richard Heeks , from Exeter , used a fast shutter speed of 1/500th of a second and chose a perfect wind - free day so nothing would disturb his shoot , while his wife Sarah provided the all - important finger .
A bubble is made up of three layers - one thin layer of water sandwiched between two layers of soap molecules .
As Mrs Heeks 's finger breaks the surface tension , the perfect sphere is replaced by a round mass of soapy droplets which dissolve into the air .
And the bubble is gone .
Mr Heeks , a student , used a macro camera to get in close and had to wait patiently for a windless day .
He even had to find a sheltered spot in his garden so any sudden gust would not disturb the shoot .
As the droplets begin to fall away only a small part of the bubble 's surface is left intact
Within the blink of an eye , what was once a splendid bubble is now nothing but a fine mist falling to the floor
It took him a month until he got the sequence right after seeing his nieces playing with bubble mixture .
' I was looking ideas for new things to photograph and I just thought the bubbles looked beautiful and with a bit of luck I managed to get one mid burst , ' he said .
' That 's what started it off .
' One day I was so absorbed in the project I did n't notice a group of builders watching me .
I think I must have looked a bit of an idiot , but maybe they thought it was fascinating .
Who knows , because I got embarrassed and scuttled back into the house . '
A bubble is actually made up of three layers - one thin layer of water sandwiched between two layers of soap molecules .
No matter what the shape the bubble is initially , it will always try to become a sphere because it as the smallest surface area and requires the least amount of energy to achieve .

Venus was once much more like Earth than thought , with oceans of water and drifting continents , new results from an orbiting space probe suggest .
The second planet from the sun has been called Earth ’s evil twin because it is so hot and dry that it resembles hell .
Planetary scientists say its climate went out of control .
They are keen to know why in case the same thing happens to our own world .
Venus is completely shrouded in clouds , causing its atmosphere to act like a greenhouse trapping heat .
Now Europe ’s orbiting Venus Express probe has used mapped a large chunk of the planet using a cloud - piercing infrared camera .
The results support previous suspicions that Venus has ancient continents produced by volcanic activity and which used to be surrounded by seas of water .
Previous maps of Venus have been produced by radar .
The new infrared chart of the planet ’s southern hemisphere , built up from thousands of individual images , is the first to tell scientists what the rocks might be made of .
Different types of rock radiate different levels of heat , in a similar way to how a brick wall gives off warmth at the end of a hot day .
The measurements for the new map , made with the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer , were similarly made of the night side of Venus .
Eight Russian probes which landed on Venus in the 1970s and 1980s discovered they were sitting on basalt rock in the few moments before they were crushed by the incredible weight of the planet ’s poisonous atmosphere .
The surface was twice the maximum temperature inside a domestic oven .
But the Venus Express map shoes lighter , old rocks on high plateau called Phoebe and Alpha Regio .
Experts say that , on Earth , such light - coloured rocks are usually granite and form continents .
Granite is formed when ancient rocks , made of basalt , are driven down into the planet by shifting continents , a process known as plate tectonics .
Water mixes with the basalt to form granite and the mixture is reborn through volcanic eruptions .
Venus Express scientist Nils Müller , of Germany ’s Münster University , said : “ If there is granite on Venus , there must have been an ocean and plate tectonics in the past .
This is not proof , but it is consistent .
All we can really say at the moment is that the plateau rocks look different from elsewhere . ”
He added : “ Venus is a big planet , being heated by radioactive elements in its interior .
It should have as much volcanic activity as Earth . ”
The European Space Agency report does not say when Venus had oceans , but it seems clear that we must be talking many millions , or billions , of years ago .
Some areas of darker rock already hint at relatively recent volcanic flows .
Space scientists are keen to send a new lander to Venus to find out more .

The new infrared map of Venus is centred at the South Pole .
The measured temperatures range from 442°C to 422 °C ( or 695 K ) blue .

Bill Maher has a politically incorrect visit on CNN today with Wolf Blitzer .
Even the police and their “ bad attitude ” are n’t safe .
Note his play on word ’s with “ Stupid Country ” when discussing Sarah Palin .
He ’s gonna catch some flack for this …

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
" I was a walking time bomb .
I knew I had to get on that plane if I wanted to be around to see my grandkids . "
Sandra Giustina is rolled into surgery to correct her atrial fibrillation at Max Hospital in New Dehli , India .
Sandra Giustina is a 61 - year - old uninsured American .
For three years she saved her money in hopes of affording heart surgery to correct her atrial fibrillation .
" They [ U.S. hospitals ] told me it would be about $ 175,000 , and there was just no way could I come up with that , " Giustina said .
So , with a little digging online , she found several high quality hospitals vying for her business , at a fraction of the U.S. cost .
Within a month , she was on a plane from her home in Las Vegas , Nevada , to New Delhi , India .
Surgeons at Max Hospital fixed her heart for " under $ 10,000 total , including travel . "
Giustina is just one of millions around the world journeying outside their native land for medical treatment , a phenomenon known as " medical tourism . "
Experts say the trend in global health care has just begun .
Next year alone , an estimated 6 million Americans will travel abroad for surgery , according to a 2008 Deloitte study .
" Medical care in countries such as India , Thailand and Singapore can cost as little as 10 percent of the cost of comparable care in the United States , " the report found .
Companies such as Los Angeles - based Planet Hospital are creating a niche in the service industry as medical travel planners .
One guidebook says that more than 200 have sprung up in the last few years .
" We find the best possible surgeons and deliver their service to patients safely , affordably and immediately , " said Rudy Rupak , president of Planet Hospital .
" No one should have to choose between an operation to save their life or going bankrupt . "
Planet Hospital , which works with international clients as well as Americans , books patients ' travel and arranges phone interviews with potential surgeons .
Patients are greeted by a company representative at the airport in the country where they 've chosen to be treated ; a 24 - hour personal " patient concierge " is also provided , a level of service that 's standard among many of the top medical travel planning companies .
Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta meet some medical tourists »
" Our patient concierge was amazing , " said Giustina .
" He came to the hospital every day , gave us his personal [ telephone ] number and after my operation , he arranged private tours of India . "
Just two days post - op , Giustina and her husband , Dino , toured local markets and landmarks including the Presidential Palace and the Taj Mahal .

" I was able to fix my heart and tour India , which is something I thought I 'd never do . "
Walk through a patient wing at Max Hospital in New Delhi on any given day and you 're likely to see people from around the world .
In one visit , CNN met patients from the United Kingdom , Nigeria , Jordan , Afghanistan and the United States .
They 're alike in choosing surgery abroad , but their reasons differ .
Many South Asians and Africans said they travel abroad because they do not have access to care in their homeland .
Some Canadians and Europeans said they chose to travel aboard , despite having national health plans , because they are tired of waiting -- sometimes years -- for treatment .
Patients from the Middle East said they come to India because the technology as well as the staff is more advanced .
For most Americans CNN spoke to , it came down to finding the best value .
" If I could have afforded my procedure in the United States , I would have taken it , but that was not my option , " Giustina said .
" I had to get online and look for a Plan B . " Read about hot destinations for medical tourism
The private hospitals in India market themselves as having upscale accommodations , Western - trained surgeons and state - of - the - art medical equipment .
CNN spent time at Max Healthcare in New Delhi and saw operating rooms similar to those in many U.S. hospitals .
If fact , Max 's neurosurgery room had an inter- operative MRI scanner , which is technology hardly seen at hospitals in the United States .
The lobby had marble floors , a book café , coffee station and a Subway sandwich shop .
The patient suites were equipped with flat screen TVs , DVD players and Wi-Fi .
This hospital also catered to families traveling together .
The suites had adjoining rooms with a kitchenette , coffee maker and a sofa bed .
Max neurosurgeon Dr. Ajaya Jha said the hospital can provide high - quality care at low prices because the staff work hard to cut waste .

" I 've seen hospitals in the U.S. where they open up something costing $ 10,000 and say , ' Oh it 's not working .
OK , give me another one . '
We would never do that here .
Even for 100 rupees ( about $ 2 ) -- we would say , " Do we need to open this suture ?
Do we need to open this gauze ? '
We are very conscious of cost . "
Hospital officials negotiate hard to keep costs low for high - tech medical machinery and other supplies , Jha said .
" In the U.S. people are making careers out of carrying laptops and documenting things that are not really useful in the long term for the patient . "
The salary of a U.S. surgeon is five times that of a surgeon in India .
" We [ surgeons in India ] want to make a profit , but we do n't want to profiteer .
We do n't want squeeze people and I think American industries should also think that way , " Jha said .
Critics of medical tourism warn patients to be diligent when researching treatment aboard .
" I 've found that industry voices tend to crowd out those of us who are more cautious about the legal risks , " said Nathan Cortez , assistant law professor at Southern Methodist University , who is conducting a case study investigating what legal recourse patients have outside America .
Patients do n't think about their legal vulnerabilities , Cortez said .
" Some countries limit patient access to medical records so they can't really learn what happened during the surgery .
And a lot of practitioners in other countries just refuse to give you your medical records .
So people have to weigh the risk versus benefits . "
While most tourism patients from America are uninsured , major U.S. insurance companies are considering providing " medical tourism " coverage to their customers .
Several have already launched pilot programs .
" I think what 's really important about medical tourism is that you make the choice for what 's right for you and what 's important to them , " said a spokesman for U.S. health insurer WellPoint Inc .
Experts say that every patient considering traveling abroad for surgery should inquire about postoperative care , legal rights and the safety standards and certifications of the hospital .
Foreign health care providers should be willing to discuss the procedure and answer question ahead of time .
" What really helped me feel good about the process was that my doctor in the U.S. spoke to the cardiologist in India prior to my trip , " said Giustina .
" They were so open about everything ; I knew I 'd be in good hands . "
Just weeks from returning from abroad , Giustina says she has only one regret , " I should n't have waited so long !
I feel like a new person again , no more pain . "

Salahidin Abdulahat and Khalil Mamut were " small fish " caught in the US net
By Jo Meek
Producer , From Guantanamo to Paradise
Bermuda , with its pastel - coloured homes overlooking the turquoise waters of the Atlantic Ocean , is now home to four Chinese Uighurs who were released from Guantanamo Bay after seven years inside .
The men are a long way from home , but they say they had heard of Bermuda , a UK overseas territory off America 's eastern seaboard , before they got there .
" Actually I did know something about Bermuda , about the Bermuda Triangle .
When I first heard we were coming here I thought , that 's that mysterious place , " said Khalil Mamut .
When I met Khalil Mamut , 31 , Abdullah Abdulqadir , 30 , Salahidin Abdulahat , 32 , and Ablikim Turahan , 38 , in their new home , they were all smiling , laughing and joking with one another .
As they ordered Bermudan fruit punch and rock fish , it became clear that they were relishing their new - found freedom .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I saw someone fishing and I walked down , and said ' I want to do that .
Can I have a go ? '
He said OK , and in one minute I caught two small fish .
" The fish reminded me of Guantanamo - I had mercy on them and let them go , " said Khalil Mamut .
This is exactly how these men used to see themselves , as small fish caught in a huge net as the US military rounded up terror suspects in the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan after 9/11 .
Mr Mamut says the four men had initially fled their homes in China because they wanted to escape oppression and lead free lives .
Recent ethnic violence in Xinjiang province has focused attention on the Muslim minority and their efforts to establish a Uighur homeland , which they call Turkestan .
The men were fleeing oppression in China
The men's separate journeys from China in early 2001 led them to meet in a refugee camp in Afghanistan 's Tora Bora mountains .
" When I was in Turkestan , I made rock candy , but the Chinese oppressed us so I left to seek freedom , " Khalil Mamut says .
" If I had stayed there I could have been a slave to the Chinese and I did n't want to be slave . "
When the US bombing of Afghanistan started , the four men all fled to Pakistan .
" The town we came to gave us a warm welcome and told us to rest and they would take care of us , " says Salahidin Abdulahat .
" In the middle of the night they got us up and said they would move us somewhere safe .
But we ended up in jail .
They sold us out . "
Initially no country wanted to take the Uighurs
The men say they were handed over by bounty hunters as " terrorists " to US forces and taken to Khandahar .
They were then transferred to Guantanamo Bay , where they were held in the military detention centre for almost seven years .
It was here that they met their translator Rushan Abbas .
A petite woman with expressive eyes , she now calls these men " her children " but their relationship started very differently .
Ms Abbas , a Uighur living in the US , was hired as a translator by US interrogators at Guantanamo .
" During the first interrogation I was totally surprised .
These men were so happy to be in US custody , they were saying that US is the only country defending Uighur people 's rights , " she says .
" After I met these men I realised right away that they were the wrong men to be in Guantanamo . "
The men were accused by the US of being linked to the East Turkistan Islamic Movement , a group which the UN , China and the US classify as a terrorist group with links to the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
All four men always denied the charge , and four years ago were found not to be " enemy combatants " .
However , their release was complicated by their nationality .
" When US forces took custody of us they did not know us so they had to do their investigation , " says Salahidin Abdulahat .
The tropical waters of Bermuda are a stark contrast to Guantanamo " They soon said they knew we were innocent but because we did n't have our own country it was more difficult . "
Last October , a senior US judge in Washington DC ordered that all the men be released into the US .
That ruling was quashed in February and they remained in Guantanamo , because it was considered unsafe for them to return to China and no country was willing to take them .
The US has 50 to 60 Guantanamo detainees who it has been unable to repatriate since President Barack Obama announced the camp was to close .
Beijing has demanded the return of all Uighurs held by the US forces to China .
However on the evening on 10 June , a guard came and told them they had 45 minutes to get ready to leave .
Their sudden release to Bermuda on the 11 June caused a political storm .
Britain voiced its disapproval and told Bermuda , a UK territory , that it should have consulted the UK government before accepting the men .
Salahidin Abdulahat has already begun to learn to swim Bermudan Premier Ewart Brown explains how the decision came about : " One of the White House people raised this issue , that they were having trouble finding places to accept these detainees , and I said , ' I wonder if Bermuda could help ' . "
Questions have been asked about what Bermuda gained from the deal , and whether it would help the country 's position with the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act , which the US Senate is debating .
" I do n't want to predict that , but I believe that whatever engagements we have with the US from here on will be held in the context that we have helped the US at the time when they needed help , " says Premier Brown .

The US authorities are paying up to $ 100,000 ( £ 62,000 ) for the men 's relocation costs .
Over the next few months they will be taught English and they will go fishing and learn to swim .
Nearly a dozen local companies have already offered the men jobs .
These men have been on a long journey , but they are not angry or bitter about the years spent locked up in Guantanamo .
They all say they are happy and grateful to Bermuda and its people for giving them a home .
Mr Mamut says he is looking forward to his future .
" I want to make a family .
I want to have 10 children , maybe more .
" I have to get situated and everything will be OK step by step .
I have to get money and buy house and furniture - I have to ready myself for everything , a family , a wife , a new life . "
Despite the tropical location , for these men paradise is not warm azure waters and swaying palm trees .
Paradise is the freedom they now share .

Instead of seeing older workers staying on the job longer as the economy has worsened , the Social Security system is reporting a major surge in early retirement claims that could have implications for the financial security of millions of baby boomers .
Since the current federal fiscal year began Oct. 1 , claims have been running 25 % ahead of last year , compared with the 15 % increase that had been projected as the post - World War II generation reaches eligibility for early retirement , according to Stephen C. Goss , chief actuary for the Social Security Administration .
Many of the additional retirements are probably laid - off workers who are claiming Social Security early , despite reduced benefits , because they are under immediate financial pressure , Goss and other analysts believe .
The numbers upend expectations that older Americans who sustained financial losses in the recession would work longer to rebuild their nest eggs .
In a December poll sponsored by CareerBuilder , 60 % of workers older than 60 said they planned to postpone retirement .

Goss said it remained unclear whether the uptick in retirements would accelerate or abate in the months ahead .
But another wave of older workers may opt for early retirement when they exhaust unemployment benefits late this year or early in 2010 , he noted .
The ramifications of the trend are profound for the new retirees , their families , the government and other social institutions that may be called upon to help support them .
On top of savings ravaged by the stock market decline and the loss of home equity , many retirees now must make do with Social Security benefits reduced by as much as 25 % if they retire at age 62 instead of 66 .
“ When the recession ends and the economy bounces back , there may be a band of people for whom things will never be the same again .
They ’ll still be paying the price for 10 , 20 , 30 years down the road , ” said Cristina Martin Firvida , director of economic security for AARP , the nation ’s largest membership organization for people 50 and older .

For Herman Hilton , 66 , of Jacksonville , Fla. , a lean 6 - foot - 2 electrician with a bushy gray beard , the decision to lay down his pliers and screwdriver was born of frustration .
For at least the last 10 years , as he wired new buildings , he was looking toward retiring as soon as he hit 66 and qualified for full benefits .
And last fall , like millions of other older workers , Hilton put his “ golden years ” plan on hold when his 401 ( k ) lost more than a third of its value .
Then last month , his life took another unwelcome turn : Hilton ’s foreman pulled him aside to tell him that he was being laid off .
For several weeks , Hilton collected unemployment insurance .
But he soon decided to call it quits and file for Social Security .
“ I can live on what I have , ” Hilton said .
“ But it ’s not what I planned on .
I wo n’t have the comfort factor of as much of a safety cushion . ”

That cushion is important .
As Americans live longer , the elderly are increasingly at risk of outlasting their financial assets .
That ’s a serious problem for them and their families , who are often called upon to provide assistance .
Because benefits are reduced for people who retire early , the surge in retirements should not have any long - term effect on the solvency of the Social Security system , although it will probably add to the near - term budget deficits confronting the Obama administration , Social Security ’s Goss said .
The full consequences of retirement decisions made in hard times will become apparent when people who retired early begin to exhaust their savings .
“ As they get into their 70s and 80s , it will be increasingly inadequate , ” said Alicia H. Munnell , director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College .
Advertisement
The most severe effect will probably fall on the unemployed widows of workers who retire early , Munnell said .
Survivors ’ benefits also take a deeper cut when people retire early -- reduced as much as 30 % for retirement at 62 .
Because women tend to live longer than men , that leaves them more vulnerable to running out of money as expenses for assisted living and other costs rise in advanced old age .
Significant numbers of workers have long chosen to retire early .
In 2007 , the most recent year for which statistics are available , 42 % of men and 48 % of women began collecting Social Security retirement benefits at age 62 , the first year of eligibility .
The current recession , the worst since the Depression , is striking when older workers are by historical standards unusually vulnerable .
Though older workers in previous recessions were less likely than their younger counterparts to be laid off , that advantage has eroded in recent years , said Munnell , who analyzed more than two decades of Labor Department data on layoffs .
Fewer workers are now protected by union contracts that require newer employees to be laid off first .
And older workers now typically have less of a seniority advantage in a workforce that more frequently switches jobs .
Advertisement
Once they lose their jobs , older workers have a harder time finding new ones .
On average , it takes laid - off workers 55 and older nearly a month longer than their younger counterparts to find new employment , and the gulf has been growing recently , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Goss said it was theoretically possible that people who claimed retirement benefits during the recession would resume working once the economy improves .
Yet experience suggests that retired workers are unlikely to return to work in large numbers , particularly not to full - time jobs that would allow them to make up their earnings losses while they were out of the workforce , said Paul N. Van de Water , a former senior policy official at the Social Security Administration and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , a Washington think tank .
“ It ’s partly a question of intent , ” Van de Water said .
“ It ’s partly a question of your skills not being kept up to date . ”

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered a large reduction in the fleet of state vehicles Friday after an audit revealed that possibly thousands of state workers have been given government cars to drive home at night without justification .
The number of employees reported with take - home cars has increased up to 20 % during the last three years , according to records obtained by The Times .
The state allows 8,662 workers to have such cars , costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars amid the state ’s financial crisis , the records show .
The trend in the private sector has been to reduce such perks , said Jon Coupal , president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn .
Schwarzenegger , who many days is driven across the street by a California Highway Patrol motorcade from the Capitol to the hotel that is his home in Sacramento , issued his executive order Friday after receiving the audit .
Allegations about the misuse of state vehicles also had been made through a government website soliciting reports of waste and misdeeds .

“ Today I am taking action to get rid of waste and abuse in the state ’s vehicle fleet and ordering my administration to reduce the [ entire ] fleet by 15 % , eliminate all wasteful home storage permits and sell surplus cars at our state garage sale next month , ” Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
The fleet reduction will save at least $ 24.1 million the first year , according to the Department of General Services .
A self - critical audit by Caltrans found that in 38 % of the permits tested , “ the permit holder did not appear to have a justified or documented need for the permit . ”
If that percentage were applied to all take - home cars , it would mean more than 3,200 of the cars are being driven home by workers without justification .
Schwarzenegger ordered that the number of take - home cars be cut by at least 20 % .
Home permits are supposed to be given to workers based on demonstrated need , such as a job assignment that requires them to respond to after - hour emergencies .
“ Maintenance managers and superintendents who had minimal recorded emergency call - outs were listed as third , fourth or fifth responders for emergency situations , ” states the audit by Caltrans ’ Division of Audits and Investigations .

Some workers said they needed take - home cars to minimize overtime , but auditors found they had worked little or no overtime before they were given a permit .
Others were given permits after claiming that state parking was not secure , but auditors found the parking was behind gates .
Some managers approved their own permits .
Caltrans reported that 680 of its employees had permits to take vehicles home three years ago , but 1,643 have permits today .
Caltrans spokesman Matt Rocco blamed “ under - reporting the number of permits ” issued three years ago , but could not provide a different tally .
People have reported to the state ’s Waste Watchers website that it appears some government cars have been used for personal business .
Specific reports are under investigation , state officials said .

Meanwhile , the governor and legislative leaders met Friday in an effort to plug California ’s $ 26.3 - billion deficit .
Education financing and welfare cuts remained sticking points .

Last week we showed you how most of our daughter ’s room has come together so far , and today we ’ve got all the details about one wall that you did n’t see – along with an update to this post as it originally appeared because there was a second phase of the mural inspired by our ten - year - old just a few days after publishing this !
So we took some updated pictures & added the details below for you .
It was one of the most fun and impactful painting projects we ’ve done in a while .
And it was extremely budget - friendly too .
As you saw in last week ’s post , we were able to vault the ceilings in this room ( this

As lawmakers rejected the core of a Democrat - backed budget plan intended to tame California ’s $ 24 - billion deficit , a top finance official warned that the budget crisis could force him to begin issuing IOUs next week .
Controller John Chiang announced that he would have to start paying many of the state ’s bills with IOUs on July 2 if the partisan tug - of - war over the deficit is n’t ended by then .
With a scant seven days to that deadline , both houses of the Legislature took up one of the 20 bills that make up the latest spending plan but failed to garner the two - thirds vote needed to pass it .
Republicans in both houses voted against the measure , even though it consisted of government cuts normally embraced by the GOP and did not include $ 2 billion in Democrat - endorsed tax hikes on the oil and tobacco industries .
They were joined by two Democrats in the Senate and one in the Assembly .

Democrats vowed to fight on , but resolution of the crisis is expected to require closed - door meetings between legislative leaders and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) said his house will meet every day , if necessary , until a budget is approved .
He also challenged Republicans to produce an alternative plan to bridge the budget gap .
Schwarzenegger has offered a plan that includes deep cuts to government services and the elimination of some health and welfare programs .
Steinberg and other Democrats said they wo n’t budge from holding Schwarzenegger ’s most severe proposed cuts at bay .
Advertisement
“ This is a matter of conscience , ” Steinberg said .
“ We have a sacred obligation , I would call it a moral obligation , to stand up for the least among us . ”
Republicans , meanwhile , said they would stand fast against any new taxes and complained that the majority Democrats did not let them participate as a joint conference committee crafted the latest budget proposal .
“ Frankly , Republicans have been frozen out of the process , ” said Assembly GOP leader Sam Blakeslee ( R - San Luis Obispo ) .
The complete budget text arrived so late , he complained , that voting for it would have been “ an act of supreme faith . ”

With no GOP votes forthcoming , Democrats said they were contemplating options to pass their budget revisions with a simple majority vote .
Such an act would take 90 days to go into effect and blunt some of the savings they hope to achieve .
“ We do n’t want to go there , ” said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) .
Still , she refused to rule out that possibility .
Schwarzenegger has been warning Democrats for weeks that they should drop any hope of a tax hike and embrace his deep cuts .
Aaron McLear , the governor ’s spokesman , said the Democrats ’ “ insistence ” that their budget plan be considered has cost the state “ valuable time and pushed us closer to insolvency . ”

The governor advanced two new proposals Wednesday in lieu of an earlier plan to borrow $ 1.9 billion from cities and counties .
He would instead save $ 1 billion by stopping the state ’s contribution to its workers ’ health benefits and $ 890 million more by slashing the state ’s share of funding for child welfare services and foster care .
Chiang , meanwhile , described the state ’s money troubles as unlike anything “ since the Great Depression , ” with an anticipated $ 2.8 - billion shortfall in July that could grow to $ 6.5 billion by September .
“ IOUs are almost an admission of guilt that we ca n’t pay our bills , ” said Garin Casaleggio , Chiang ’s spokesman .
Without a budget solution , the controller expects next month to issue more than $ 3 billion in IOUs to some of the state ’s most vulnerable citizens .
Those would include the aged , blind and disabled , college students who receive state grants , welfare recipients and patrons of regional centers for the developmentally disabled .
Advertisement
Counties , which provide many of government ’s services , could be hard hit .
“ If this drags out into August and September , we will be in a world of hurt , ” said Paul McIntosh , executive director of the California State Assn. of Counties .
Los Angeles County officials said IOUs would delay nearly $ 645 million expected by the end of September -- a shortfall the county can’t cover .
“ This is the beginning of the statewide meltdown , ” said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky .
“ People ca n’t go to Ralphs and buy their groceries with an IOU .
They ca n’t go to the doctor or catch the bus with an IOU . ”
Advertisement
The controller had to delay payments in February as the state grappled with a smaller cash crisis .
The new shortfall would be nearly five times larger .
Chiang met with legislative leaders earlier this week to warn them of the consequences of further delays in adopting budget revisions .
He said in a news release that resorting to IOUs “ sends a signal ” from Wall Street to Main Street that California is out of options .
Lawmakers said they were aware of the stakes .
“ The clock is ticking and it ’s ticking fast , ” declared Assemblywoman Noreen Evans ( D - Santa Rosa ) , chairwoman of the legislative budget panel that crafted the deficit - reduction package .

“ Everybody ’s talking about jumping off the cliff , ” said Sen. Bob Dutton ( R - Rancho Cucamonga ) .
“ We ’re already off the cliff . ”

Trine , the highly anticipated physics based , action / puzzle game from developer Frozenbyte has been available for the PC on Steam for a few weeks now .
Trine has long been pegged for a July PSN release , but week after week , eagerly awaiting fans have been left in the cold .
Frozenbyte , has given us a chilling update about the game ’s release on the PSN .
According to Frozenbyte Developer FB_Lauri of their community forums
Trine will not be hitting the PSN this week , due to a glitch in the matrix … er , a small bug that needs to be ironed out .
Here is what FB_Lauri had to say :
Unfortunately , Trine is n’t coming to PSN this week , and this time it ’s our fault as there was discovered yet another small bug which needed to be fixed .
I ca n’t tell for sure when the release is coming , as no - one really seems to know .
Also , I have no idea are EU and NA releases timed differently .
For us , not knowing is also a bit tough , but I hope it ’s eventually worth all the waiting .
Keep checking back to PlayStation LifeStyle , as we ’ll keep you updated of the progress of Trine , and it ’s eventual PSN release .

President Obama has placed health care reform high on his domestic agenda .
He believes that a better health care system is essential for the nation ’s economic recovery , so health reform “ will not wait another year . ”
However , he has made only general proposals for reform , leaving Congress to work out the details of the legislation .
The Democratic - led Congress has already passed some limited health legislation and its leaders say that they will put a comprehensive reform bill on the President ’s desk before the end of this year .
Despite wide popular support for major reform , there will be powerful opposition .
Most Republicans in Congress , allied with a small band of fiscally conservative “ Blue Dog ” Democrats , and most people in the for - profit health care industry will resist significant change .
Many others with ideological objections to “ big government ” pay lip service to reform , but will balk at proposals that threaten private insurance .
Compromises will be necessary , so it remains to be seen what legislation emerges and how effectively it addresses the basic problems of the US health system .
1
The central problem is its expense .
Health care in the US is about twice as expensive per capita as in other developed countries — nearly 17 percent of US GDP in 2008 — and its costs are rising faster .
High costs partly account for another huge health care problem — nearly 50 million people are uninsured , and the number is rapidly increasing .
Economists say that the main reason for high costs is the ever - expanding use of expensive kinds of diagnosis and treatment , such as new drugs , diagnostic tests , imaging methods , and surgical procedures .
Physicians in most other advanced countries have access to virtually the same resources , but use them less .
This difference is partly explained by a higher proportion of specialists in the US , who rely more than primary care physicians on expensive technical procedures for their livelihood , and in general are much more highly paid than primary care physicians — one reason why primary care doctors are now in short supply .
The American College of Physicians attributes much of the high cost of the US health system to its relative excess of well - paid specialists and lack of primary care doctors .
There are also much greater financial incentives in the US to use technology , since health insurers pay doctors and clinical facilities most of what they charge for such services .
In most advanced countries with universal coverage , the government determines how medical expenses are reimbursed , and the income of health care providers from technical services is therefore more modest .
Also , relatively more practicing physicians in those countries are paid salaries , and relatively more hospitals ( where most advanced technology is concentrated ) are controlled by government budgets .
This limits the availability and use of expensive technology .
Another very important but often overlooked reason for greater health expenditures in the US is that , more than in any other advanced country , large parts of the system are owned by investors .…
Some senior Microsoft search bosses have reportedly flown to California for face - to - face talks with Yahoo management over a search merge .
The two sides are said to be at their closest point to a deal to date .
According to a report by the All Things Digital site , the two sides are being even more secretive than usual .
However , it quotes a source as saying " It is down to the short strokes , for sure ; it is just a question if we can finally close this . "
( Source : allthingsd.com )
Naturally , the finer points of any potential deal are under wraps at the moment .
However , some general principles have emerged : Microsoft would pay a hefty sum ( possibly in the billions ) to take over Yahoo's search advertising business , then pay it some royalties out of future revenues for a fixed period .
Meanwhile , Yahoo would likely take over the display advertising business for both firms .
Three Billion Dollar Deal
One report puts the figures as a $ 3 billion up - front payment from Microsoft , with some hefty royalties : 110 % of profit from Yahoo - originated searches for the first two years and 90 % in the third year .
That 's an expensive amount on paper , but would give Microsoft control of as much as 30 % of the entire search market .
Yahoo would have a healthy cash injection over the next three years , allowing it to stabilize and rebuild the other elements of its business .
( Source : 247wallst.com )
It may seem strange that Microsoft is suddenly closer to a deal after the launch of Bing helped it gain some ground in the search market .
It may be , however , that Bing changed the relationship with Yahoo and Microsoft , such that Microsoft was more confident about succeeding on its own and thus less desperate for a deal .
That change in relative status might have been enough to make it easier for the two sides to negotiate a mutually acceptable deal .
The 10 - member commission deferred many central decisions to the legislature and to a new authority that would be created to establish and oversee the new payment system .
In doing so , it preserved cautious support from the state ’s hospital association , medical society and leading insurers for a proposal that resembles guiding principles more than bill language .
Representatives of those groups joined in a unanimous commission vote for the recommendations .
But they made clear that their continued support might depend on devilish details , the kind that will determine whether their members are net losers and , if so , by how much .
It was only by keeping those stakeholders at the negotiating table that the state succeeded in 2006 in vastly expanding subsidized coverage for the uninsured .
Maintaining that coalition is expected to be more difficult as the state tries to slow the growth of costs , an effort that typically translates into less revenue for providers and insurers .
The existing “ fee for service ” system has been roundly criticized as offering incentives that encourage doctors to provide more treatment than is necessary , a significant contributor to the high cost of health care .
Global payments , it is thought , would reward health care providers for keeping their patients well rather than for merely treating their ailments .
If the cost of treating a patient was less than the global payment , the provider networks , called accountable care organizations , would keep the difference as profit .

Yesterday I had the chance to sit down ( via phone ) with Nick Jasenovec , the director of the upcoming documentary / narrative hybrid film Paper Heart , starring Charlyne Yi and Michael Cera .
We talked about the unique stylistic choices Jasenovec made with the film , the difficulty of mixing documentary and narrative styles , the pros and cons of shooting digitally , and what it was like to create a world of blended fantasy and reality .
Paper Heart follows Charlyne
Yi on a journey to understand a concept in which she does n’t believe : love .
Along the way , she interviews fellow travelers about their ideas of love , and even manages to find love herself in the arms of one Michael Cera ( playing a fictional version of himself ) .
The movie also casts Jake Johnson as a fictional version of Jasenovec , showing him “ directing ” the film as it ’s made .
Part documentary and part romantic fiction , Paper Heart sets out to find the answer to that age old question : does love really exist ?
You can check out the trailer HERE .

So where are the best places in Portland Oregon to cowork with coffee wifi and cohorts ?
Here are ten choices for your coffee shop coworking pleasure , with a couple of bonus suggestions .
[ Editor : Thanks for swinging by !
Unfortunately , this post is severely out - of - date .
But fear not , gentle reader .
There ’s a new and improved resource for coffee , wifi , and coworking here in Portland , Oregon . ]
[ HTML1 ] Admittedly , we in the Portland Web , Mobile , blogging , and startup scene are a bit of a nomadic bunch .
Whether finding some place to camp out in between meetings or hunkering down to crank out code for hours on end , folks around these parts are always looking for a good spot to work — preferably with an infusion of caffeine nearby .
And sometimes , it ’s nice to have some peers around for bouncing ideas or simply just a little company .
So where are the best places in Portland to cowork with coffee , wifi , and cohorts ?
Here are ten choices for your coffee shop coworking pleasure , with a couple of bonus suggestions of up and coming spots .
Always great coffee with always comfy couches in the front and back , Albina Press is a favorite haunt of many a North Portland and Mississippi Ave tech type .
Did I mention the coffee ?
Whoof .
If you ’re looking for a hard - to - find - a - seat bustling atmosphere with plenty of folks moving through it , Albina Press is the perfect place to spend a few hours .
Or you could always hang at the window - facing bar and keep one eye on the passers - by .
But do n’t just take my word for it .
Here ’s what Portland Food and Drink has to say about Albina Press :
The interior is rather unremarkable , pretty much your typical laid - back coffeehouse .
Still , it is a spacious place to while away a rainy afternoon with the paper .
Thereâ€™s a bar area next to the windows so you can stare out on a rainy day and contemplate life .
Plenty of regular tables are scattered around , and there are two areas with soft couches to dive into .
Free Wi-Fi is available , with a surprising number of electrical outlets to plug in your laptop if need be .
The mix of customers runs the gamut , from neighborhood regulars to coffee geeks who come from a distance .
College students make up the bulk of the crowd ; still anyone can feel comfortable here .
See who has shouted from Albina Press lately on Shizzow .
Or see what WifiPDX has to say about Albina Press .
Now stop .
I can hear you already .
“ Beaverton is not Portland . ”
But give me a sec , would you ?
Jeez .
Ava Roasteria makes the list for a number of reasons .
First , it ’s open 24 - hours - a- day .
That ’s right .
Just like in the dotcom days .
Second , it has blisteringly fast wifi .
Third , it ’s huge .
Now , wo n’t that help you overlook the facts that it ’s a little off the beaten path and that they have an all Flash Web site with music that you ca n’t figure out how to mute ?
There are n’t many user reviews , but I thought Nathan E. Lewis summed up Ava Roasteria quite nicely .
If you are in Beaverton , check out Ava Roasteria , Beavertonâ€™s new coffee house .
It is beautiful !
Free wireless , rich coffee , and perhaps , the new center of Beaverton , a great place to meet people .
It also happens to be my new office .
Come visit me and I will treat you to a cup .
The owner , an Iranian woman , specializes in purchasing contaminated properties , transforming them into beautiful retail spaces .

The always bustling Bipartisan Cafe is a great place to hang out in deep Southeast Portland .
Do n’t be intimidated by the crowd .
Tables tend to turn over fairly quickly here .
Or the bar is usually open .
And the coffee is worth the wait .
Need more than coffee , wifi , and people ?
How about pie ?
Bipartisan Cafe serves hand crafted coffee beverages made with world class , locally roasted Stumptown Coffee .
We have a nice selection of black green or herbal teas from Tao of Tea .
Our sandwiches are made to order on Grand Central Bakery bread and the soups are homemade from scratch .
Our specialty is our piesâ € ” made from scratch like grandma used to make .

Arguably the de facto hub of the Portland coffee shop coworking and startup scene , Backspace provides an expansive space , plenty of plugins , and enough wifi for hours and hours of work .
Suffice it to say , if you ’re looking to see a bunch of Twitter avatars walking around in real life , this Old Town coffee shop is the place to be .
Given its locale and its accouterment , there are always five to ten people you ’ll recognize at Backspace .
Guaranteed .
WifiPDX concurs :
Backspace is the default place to go when you have nothing else to do .
25 computers for internet and a mass of video games .
Huge 4000 sq ft. building to enjoy stumptown coffee and see incredible art .
Pool tables , X - box room , and Board games galore .
Open Late !
2 am every night !
But do n’t just take locals ’ words for it .
See what a tourist has to say about Backspace :
Lest you think Backspace is a restaurant , the coffee bar is just a small part of why we go there .
This is part Internet - cafe , part club , part beatnik hangout , part art gallery , and 4000 square feet more of whatever band , show , or feature is hot in the Rose city .
â€¦ Ground Kontrol classic arcade is around the corner , where you can still play the old games for a quarter .
In short , this is just a nice play to “ be ” .
i Ate is surprisingly quiet about Backspace .
Maybe because its just assumed that you ’re there .
Or you can take a look at the Shizzow traffic through that joint .
Much to my chagrin , James John Cafe is one of the few Portland coworking coffee shops I have yet to visit — but it comes highly recommended .
Do n’t believe me ?
Ask WifiPDX .
Great coffee , fantastic pastries .
And Ken at the counter is a great guy .
It ’s usually just busy enough to be interesting without being so busy that you ca n’t find a table .
Great place .
See who ’s hanging out in St. Johns via Shizzow .

If you ’re in the Belmont area and you ’re a nomadic worker , you ’ve not doubt spent some time at Opposable Thumb .
The big bonus to the Thumb as opposed to the Stumptown further up the street ?
Space for one thing .
Opposable Thumb has plenty of space to spread out .
And usually some places you can hole yourself up to avoid the foot traffic .
Food is another plus .
If you ’re going to be heads - down on a project for a few hours , tasty sustenance is well within reach .
In fact , marathon sessions at Opposable Thumb are a common occurrence .
The Opposable Thumb is a pretty delightful place to hang out and do work , especially if youâ€ ™re a twenty - something hipster , like most people wandering around the 20â€™s and 30â€™s blocks of Belmont .
To give you an idea of the amount of time you can spend here , Iâ€™ll mention that I once remained here for about eight hours without once going outside .
See who ’s using their opposable thumbs to shout via Shizzow .

Since World Cup in the EcoTrust building closed , the next best “ near Jamison Park ” location for grabbing a cup of coffee and banging out a few lines of code has become Sip & Kranz .
And now they ’ve — somewhat sadly — torn out the kids area .
But that just means that there ’s more room for the highly refined and mature activities of surfing the Web and making snarky comments on Twitter .
What ’s more , Neighborhood Notes gives Sip & Kranz rave reviews .
The service is great : there are ample ( Pleasant !!! ) folks on hand to help with coffee , pastries or juice .
Sip & Kranz proudly serves and sells Stumptown Coffee– the staff went through a lengthy training process to ensure that they meet the quality guidelines of “ the holy grail ” of coffee roasters .
And it gets better … the pastries are from Nuvrei Fine Cakes & Pastries and there are glorious cupcakes from –where else– Saint Cupcake ( the patron saint of sweet ! ) …

Yes , it ’s loud .
Yes , it ’s crowded .
And yes , you have to carry that big damn duck to the restroom .
But I ’ll be damned if Stumptown on SW 3rd does n’t have the finest con panna in town .
And that rocket fuel combined with wifi is more than anyone needs to be a productive little worker .
And while I ’ve singled out Stumptown Downtown , to be honest , they ’re all pretty good locations to work on whatever it is you need to get done .
And the one at the Ace allows you to wander over to the big cushy lobby couches .
But let ’s get back to the location at hand .
Now the most common complaint about the downtown location is the noise .
Whether it be the crowd or the music that ’s always jacked up .
But you know what ?
I actually think that ’s the big positive for this location ?
How can that be ?
Well , I ’ll tell you .
You see , Stumptown Downtown is perfect for meetings .
Because when you want to sit down and chat about your top - secret stealthy startup project you can be sure no one is eavesdropping .
Because the people next to you can barely hear themselves think .
Yay for aural obfuscation !
And honestly ?
You come here for the coffee .
Do n’t believe me ?
Well , do you believe The New York Times ?
But Mr. Sorenson and a few like - minded coffee hunters around the country will go almost anywhere , do almost anything and pay almost any price in pursuit of the perfect cup of coffee.â€ ¦
But itâ€™s not a point he feels the need to argue stridently , because the proof â€ ” for anyone to taste â€ ” is in the cup .
Check out the Stumptown chatter on iAte .
Or see who ’s been by Stumptown Downtown recently on Shizzow .
Whether you ’re in Northeast Portland or up in the Pearl , swinging by Urban Grind is sure to have you sidling up alongside someone from the Portland tech scene .
They ’ve each got their pluses .
NW tends to see more folks traipsing through , thanks to its location , and it ’s always easy to find an outlet .
But NE has a ton of room .
And more secluded areas to hide .
Both of them have great connectivity and comfy seats for hours and hours of slaving away on your projects .
And , at either location , the coffee and tea are good and the staff is knowledgeable .
So you ’re set there .
Portland Octopus gives Urban Grind a thumbs up or maybe eight thumbs up .
Suction cups ?
Whatever .
They like it .
Urban Grind is living proof that getting your daily fix doesnâ€™t have to involve paying above average prices for a below average experience .
On the contrary , this place is a perfect example of a local business that has established a huge following by providing a great atmosphere to compliment amazing products .
Who winds up where ?
Well , here are the folks who frequent Urban Grind NE .
And here are the folks who wind up at Urban Grind NW .
For what it ’s worth , it appears that Urban Grind NW gets far more love on WifiPDX than Urban Grind NE .
Bonus : Up and coming coworking coffee shops ?
[ HTML2 ] Now , sometimes , you ’re looking for somewhere to work that ’s a little less coworking and maybe a little more isolated .
Invasion Cafe : Dawn Foster recommends Invasion , “ New coffee shop called Invasion Cafe on 4th between Washington and Stark .
Better than Stumptown to hang out . ”
Portland Coffee House : Don Park offers “ portland coffee house on broadway , one block from pioneer square , is a decent work place . ”
Taborspace : Thanks to Chase Reeves for introducing me to Taborspace , yesterday .
Great coffee .
With a big wide open room lit by stained glass windows — it ’s in part of an old church — this nonprofit coworking coffee shop was an inspiration for this post .
Tiny ’s on MLK : I ’m hearing more and more folks mention Tiny ’s as a place to get some work done .
Great coffee .
Comfy seats .
And they ’ve got food too .
More suggestions ?
It ’s common knowledge that you can never build a list of recommendations without slighting someone ’s favorite spot .
So , if I ’ve left your favorite coworking coffee shop out of the mix — and you ’re interested in other folks starting to show up at your secret hideaway — feel free to add it to the comments .
But be forewarned .
If you make a compelling argument , I ’ll be adding it to the list .

That raised doubts about the Trident replacement , but Mr Brown made clear he was not prepared to consider getting rid of all of Britain 's nuclear weapons , saying they remained vital to national security .
He said : " Iran is attempting to build a nuclear weapon , North Korea is attempting to build a nuclear weapon .
Unilateral action by the UK would not be seen as the best way . "
Spam levels have risen over the past month to more than 90 percent of all corporate e-mail , according to Symantec ’s May 2009 MessageLabs Intelligence Report ( PDF ) .
The latest report effectively communicates the concept of " spam , boy there sure is a lot of it , " but goes into detail about the latest trends in spamming activity like botnet activity and the use of social networks .
In May , spam rose by 5.1 percent over April , with 57.6 of it coming from known botnets .
One particular botnet called Donbot was named as the most active , and is responsible for 18.2 percent of all spam .
Symantec wrote that much of the remainder ( 42.4 percent ) of spam originated out of smaller or unclassified botnets .
Despite the seemingly automated botnet activity , spammers are apparently most active during the US working day .
As Symantec noted in the report , this could be indicative that most active spammers are based in the US , or that they find the US workforce to be the best targets .
" Spammers are finding this large target audience that ’s online and more likely to respond as being very profitable for their nefarious activities , " the company wrote .
Spam levels also " drop significantly " on Sundays in all regions .
Symantec also pointed out that , according to its research , " [t ] he common assumption that most web - based malware resides on less reputable websites , perhaps touting adult content , was called into question . "
Instead , the company found that malicious content is often hidden on well - established domains , particularly social networking sites or those that rely heavily on user - generated content .
The report also made note that image spam seems to be making a comeback , corroborating a report from IBM 's X - Force team earlier this month that image spam was back on the rise after hitting record lows last year .
IBM was n't sure why spammers decided to resurrect this technique , but image spam skyrocketed to 22 percent of all spam in April .
Of course , there 's some disagreement on exactly what percentage of e-mail is spam —
Microsoft claimed earlier this year that it was 97 percent .
But we know one thing : spam - wielding botnets will keep growing as as filtering technology continues to mature .
Hey , somebody 's gotta make up for that drop in clickthroughs .

WASHINGTON , July 22 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it earned a 23.15 percent annualized return on its $ 10 billion investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , including stock warrants redeemed by the Wall Street giant for $ 1.1 billion .
“ In just 9 months , the taxpayers have been repaid the full $ 10 billion that the government originally invested , along with $ 318 million in dividends , ” a Treasury official said in a statement .
“ And Goldman is repurchasing the warrants for $ 1.1 billion , generating a total of $ 1.418 billion in payments to the government .
That amounts to an annualized return of 23.15 percent on the taxpayer ’s investment , ” the official added .
Stephen Conroy ’s ambitious plan to censor all Australian internet users has earned him the title of Internet Villain of the Year at the 11th annual Internet Industry Awards in the UK .
But the Communications Minister is just the latest in a long line of pro-censorship politicians on both sides of Australian politics .
Before Don Chipp waved his magic anti-censorship wand at all the old fogeys in Parliament House in the early 1970s , we lived in a very prudish nanny state .
Most young people these days would be shocked and astounded if they had to live a month under the sort of sexual and moral censorship that their grandparents had to under Bob Menzies .
Prior to Chipp becoming the Minister for Customs , one in two US Playboy magazines were banned in Australia and all decisions by Customs officials were kept secret .
Don Chipp changed all this by simply making the " banned list " public .
This public listings of banned books was the beginning of our national uniform classification scheme .
Free speech in Australia peaked under Bob Hawke ’s administration .
Gareth Evans ’ first Classification
Act in 1983 was a landmark civil libertarian response to a rapidly changing entertainment media : the introduction of video had given consumers more power to decide what they would watch .
For the adult industry this was a boom period , but , in terms of censorship , it ’s been downhill ever since — and things do n’t look like changing under Kevin Rudd ’s leadership .
In the 1990s , Paul Keating personally intervened on film and computer game classifications by introducing an upper level to the M rating — MA15 + — and then restricting the new computer games industry to that same MA15 + level .
This issue is still being hotly debated in State and Commonwealth Attorneys - General Meetings .
The war against censorship lost significant ground during the Howard years as an outright assault was launched on telephone sex , early internet content , TV and film guidelines .
Firstly , we saw the premium rate adult phone services restricted to 1901 numbers with an opt - out filter .
If you wanted to access these services you had to apply in writing to your telco .
Of course very few people did this and the multimillion dollar industry moved offshore .
We then saw the further restriction of the X classification : all fetishes were deemed offensive and removed from the classification .
They even banned foot fetishism and mild spanking on adult videos !
This was of course better than Howard ’s promised ban but it was not in step with community attitudes at the time .
Eight national polls conducted by Roy Morgan Research and the McNair group between 1992 and 2006 showed that on average 72 per cent of Australians wanted X rated films legalised around the country .
The Howard government also banned the hosting of X rated material by Australian ISPs .
The then communications minister , senator Richard Alston , proudly announced that Australia would have a porn - free internet .
For this he was dubbed the " global village idiot " by a number of international internet companies .
And now Kevin Rudd is following Howard as he seeks to coddle us in a retrogressive online censorship regime .
It ’s time political parties made the sort of censorship laws that their stated philosophies would logically promulgate rather than the opposite .
This year the ALP posted a Consultation Draft of the new National Platform on its website and invited discussion from the public and members alike .
Unchanged at Point 54 is the single sentence policy on censorship :
" Labor believes that adults should be entitled to read , hear and see what they wish in private and in public , subject to adequate protection against persons being exposed to unsolicited material offensive to them and preventing conduct exploiting , or detrimental to the rights of others , particularly women and children . "
The policy is listed under the heading " Defending free speech " .
Their 2007 election promise reads as follows :
" Labor will : Provide a mandatory ‘ clean feed ’ internet service for all homes , schools and public computers that are used by Australian children .
Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) will filter out content that is identified as prohibited by the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) .
The ACMA ‘ blacklist ’ will be made more comprehensive to ensure that children are protected from harmful and inappropriate online material . "
As many have commented on newmatilda.com and elsewhere , the clean feed proposals on the table are even more draconian than this .
Point 54 should be the basis for all federal ALP censorship laws and the equivalent state laws where the ALP is in office .
Otherwise it ’s a hollow promise intended to keep people feeling good about Labor being in charge of their civil liberties .
This policy hypocrisy has not been without consequences .
Research by the Eros Association has shown that over the last 20 years , state Labor governments have created a $ 40 million black market in adult films by maintaining a prohibition on them even after they have been given the okay by the Federal Classification Board .
Effectively this policy saw State Attorneys - General like Rob Hulls in Victoria and Bob Debus in NSW threatening to send people to jail for selling films that John Howard ’s censors had approved .
Under ALP policy , the federal platform should override any inconsistencies with state platforms .
Sending vendors of adult films to jail is light years away from Point 54 of Labor ’s federal platform .
It is true that when it comes to minors having access to adult material on the web , there are problems .
Unlike in an adult shop — where the owner simply throws out pimply faced boys — the internet is not equipped with a bouncer to check ID .
But there are numerous tools available to parents and educational institutions to restrict access .
Education , as usual , is the key here and if parents or schools want to opt into an ISP - based filter , then there are already companies offering this service .
It does not require a compulsory filter that will block all adults from accessing otherwise legal adult material .
These arguments have been articulated in many outlets , including on newmatilda.com .
Although the Coalition is currently opposing Conroy ’s clean feed proposal , when it comes to freedom of speech and censorship issues , there is now little difference between the major parties .
Conroy ’s attempt to filter the internet is in large part a copy of John Howard ’s 2007 attempt to introduce legislation that would stop the Big Brother " Turkey Slap " from being re-broadcast on Australian television , mobile phones and computers .
Howard ’s Online Content Services Bill was drafted in January 2007 , just in time for the November election .
Access to the first draft of this legislation was restricted to a handful of people but it was nevertheless leaked to the Eros Association and Electronic Frontiers Australia .
This draft contained lengthy jail sentences and six figure fines for companies and individuals who created , uploaded or hosted adult content on the internet .
Where the content was hosted had no impact on liability to prosecution .
If the content was created or uploaded in Australia and the provider or creator was based in Australia , there would be a case for prosecution .
The words " with an Australian connection " were repeatedly used in the draft legislation .
In the online context , " adult content " is defined as Refused Classification , X or R-rated filmed material and Category 1 and 2 Restricted publications .
In the draft , R- rated content was to be exempt if there was a satisfactory age - verification device in place but this did not apply to the other categories .
Category 1 magazines that were freely available in newsagents around the country could have had their electronic versions banned and the publishers sent to jail for two years .
Category 1 publications include Madonna ’s coffee table book Sex ; all books by David Hamilton , who moonlights as a photographer of European royalty , and all of ACP ’s restricted magazines .
The Eros Association , which represents the adult retail and entertainment industry , worked with two large mainstream groups who would be adversely affected by the proposed Online Content Bill .
The Australian Publishers Association ( APA ) represented the distributors of many erotic and " bodice - ripper " publications that would have been caught up in this legislation .
ACP magazines also produced some adult publications which were about to be put online and would have run foul of the new regulations .
Eros approached the Liberal Party organisation rather than the parliamentary wing to let them know how unpopular this legislation would be with the business community — as well as with the four million consumers of adult erotica out there in Voterland .
Our bottom line was that if these draconian laws came into effect , we would email and mail these four million adults asking them not to vote for the Coalition and pointing out how severe Howard ’s government was on censorship issues .
Sending company directors to jail for uploading content that was being sold at the local newsagent proved how totally out of touch they were with reality .
In the end , this strategy proved effective .
The second draft of the Bill which surfaced about two months after the first , had had all the criminal provisions removed as long as content was hosted off shore — basically what it was under the 1999 Online Services Act .
This was not the first time that these reforms had been tried .
In 2004 NSW became the first state to attempt to legislate the enforcement provisions of the Commonwealth ’s 1999 Online Services Act .
This would have meant jail terms and large fines for anyone in NSW who created or hosted adult content for upload anywhere in the world .
This included amateur couples who may have posted their explicit nude photos to a swingers site in New York .
This legislation gave police the right to break down the doors of anyone suspected of running adult content on websites .
All they had to do was show a connection between the image and the person living in NSW .
Eros tackled this legislation as it passed through the Upper House in the NSW Parliament in the early hours of the morning .
The next day , before the legislation could be sent to the NSW governor for " Royal Assent " , we convinced the then Attorney - General Bob Debus to intervene and refer it to an Upper House Committee which included ALP members Meredith Burgmann and Amanda Fazio .
While the committee did not formally refute the legislation , it was " decided " that it would be shelved .
Although still a law on the NSW Statute Books , it has never been enacted .
It was in response to these censorship debates that the Australian Sex Party ( of which I am Convenor ) was formed in 2008 .
The NSW and WA Liberal parties have turned into breeding grounds for extreme right wing religious ideologies and the National Civic Council and the old DLP are regrouping as spurious " inter - faith " organisations .
With the demise of the Democrats and the Greens ’ retraction of their former progressive platform on moral issues , Labor ’s abandonment of their policy platform on censorship has proceeded unchecked .
As reactionary religious groups and moral crusaders are grabbing hold of more and more politicians , there has never been a greater need for a strong voice against censorship and for free speech .

Donald and Jan Miller were looking forward to a weekend in Grand Forks .
But their trip got off to a terrifying start when they were ordered out of their vehicle at gunpoint , handcuffed and then held for questioning by U.S. border guards .
It was just a case of mistaken identity .
A Winnipeg couple on a weekend trip to Grand Forks was ordered out of their car at gunpoint , handcuffed and marched inside the Pembina border crossing station for questioning on Friday .
Their crime ?
Having a common name .
Jan and Donald " Dusty " Miller were questioned for several minutes by U.S. border agents after the 54 - year - old man 's name and birthdate came up listed as " armed and dangerous " on a border crossing computer .
" I just find it very frightening , " Jan Miller said on Monday after returning to Canada the day before .
" All of a sudden , six guns were pointed at our car .
We were told to get out and walk backwards .
They handcuffed me .
" I 've never had handcuffs on in my life .
I was just in shock . "
She said neither she nor her husband and herself have been in trouble or have criminal records so she does n't understand why the incident happened .
About 15 minutes after being ordered from their vehicle , the couple was told it was a case of mistaken identity because of the man 's name and birthdate .
The husband said he was expecting smooth sailing at the border because the couple -- who were heading to Grand Forks for a weekend golf and shopping getaway with some friends -- had planned ahead for the new passport rules .
The couple made the trip about once a year , and Donald Miller said he never had trouble crossing the border with his driver 's licence .
The last thing he expected was to have guns trained on him , a sight that petrified him despite his military background .
The fear was mixed with embarrassment .
As he was being handcuffed , he noticed passengers from other cars leaning out their windows to snap photos using their cellphones .
The husband and wife were then put in separate interrogation rooms , and Donald Miller underwent an embarrassingly intimate search .
" That 's the only thing they did n't do , was a strip search , " he said , but added the agents removed his shoes and socks looking for concealed weapons .
Although he asked numerous times , Donald Miller said , no one would tell him why he was being detained .
After a long line of questioning by one agent -- while another searched him and yet another trained a gun on him -- he was uncuffed and led toward the lobby where his wife was waiting .
Only as he was leaving the interrogation room did the agents tell Miller the mistake had been his identity .
Looking back at the incident , Miller said he was n't angry at the American border agents for searching and questioning him .
" They were doing their job , what they should do , " he said .
But Miller said it 's upsetting that he was n't uncuffed sooner , and that no one offered an apology .
" Thing is , the Americans do n't know how to say ' I 'm sorry for the inconvenience . ' "
The couple both expressed concern the experience could have been far more traumatic if there had been children travelling with them , or someone with a heart condition .
" I can understand the high security at the border -- I really do -- but there has to be some way of not doing this , " Jan Miller said .
" I 'm afraid of going down there now . "
When a vehicle stops at a border crossing , border agents punch in names and birthdates into computers linked to the National Crime Information Center , the country 's central database for crime - related information .
Chris Misson , supervisor at the Pembina Port of Entry , said when a name pops up as armed and dangerous , customs agents proceed on that basis until information comes out to refute it .
" This does happen from time to time -- especially with common names like Smith and Johnson , " Misson said .
" It 's unfortunate , but the officers have to do with what 's in front of them .
We have to proceed until we find out it 's not a match .
" On a given day , there are an average of 76 arrests throughout the country -- we have to take each hit seriously . "
But Misson said now that Donald Miller of Winnipeg has been checked out , they have added information to the computer so he wo n't get pulled over again at a border crossing .
Still , Miller said he would n't be convinced until he tried crossing the border again .
" I 'll go back by myself because I do n't want to take the wife through that again , " he explained .
" I do n't want to take the chance . "

Gamers may be clamoring for Knights of the Old Republic 3 , but they 're going to have to face the fact that that particular game is n't going to be coming to consoles any time soon .
On the other hand , Bioware has revealed that further entires in the KOTOR franchise are n't being worked on right now because the upcoming MMORPG
The Old Republic is going to contain enough narrative content for a slew of sequels to the series that Bioware established .
Having spent some time behind closed doors with a demo of the game , it 's understandable why Bioware believes this to be true : the game 's writing is superb and will provide its players with a truly epic play experience that is much deeper than anything currently on the market .
The Old Republic is unlike any MMORPG I 've ever seen , mainly because it feels so very much like a single - player game in terms of its gameplay .
While it was confirmed that MMO staples like PvP combat , crafting , and guilds would all appear in the title , it was also revealed that no two character classes will ever encounter the exact same mission .
On top of that , every character in the game is voiced , which means that when missions are assigned , a player is treated to a small cutscene that allows them to receive the details of an assignment ; during these sequences , players will utilize the dialogue tree ( as seen in Mass Effect ) to respond to the assigned quests , which will dictate , in turn , how NPCs behave towards one 's character .
We were also shown how the game starts players off with characters who actually feel heroic .
During the demo , a bounty - hunter character was sent out into a town , whereupon he immediately started laying waste to the local police force .
As it was explained , " we want you to feel like the hero from the start ; it 's going to be hard to expect to be the toughest bounty hunter in the universe if you start off shooting rats in an alley . "
As a result , this detail certainly carried a much more epic feeling than so many other MMORPGs .
Ethical choices also affect a player 's play experience : this was shown during the demo when a moral fork in the road appeared .
While playing as a Sith warrior , the player was ordered to execute an imperial captain who had disobeyed orders to hunt down a member of the Jedi Order on a nearby space vessel .
After cutting through a swath of security officers and making his way to the bridge , the character was presented with the choice to either execute the captain or work with him to find a better solution to his orders .
Everyone in the room voted to cut the man down , which immediately changed the story path of the game ; not only were certain events set in motion , but the ship 's officers reacted towards the character with a noticeable amount of terror .
Ultimately , The Old Republic looks like it's going to be the perfect MMO for the Star Wars universe , because it will combine , in the words of the developers , " ridiculous action combat and compelling story . "
The story seems compelling largely because of the quality of Bioware 's writing and the cinematic feeling provided by the voice acting and cutscenes ; and the action that was on display managed to feel rather fast - paced and fluid .
THE MACHINE STOPS by E.M. Forster ( 1909 ) I THE AIR - SHIP
I magine , if you can , a small room , hexagonal in shape , like the cell of a bee .
It is lighted neither by window nor by lamp , yet it is filled with a soft radiance .
There are no apertures for ventilation , yet the air is fresh .
There are no musical instruments , and yet , at the moment that my meditation opens , this room is throbbing with melodious sounds .
An armchair is in the centre , by its side a reading - desk - that is all the furniture .
And in the armchair there sits a swaddled lump of flesh - a woman , about five feet high , with a face as white as a fungus .
It is to her that the little room belongs .
An electric bell rang .
The woman touched a switch and the music was silent .
' I suppose I must see who it is ' , she thought , and set her chair in motion .
The chair , like the music , was worked by machinery and it rolled her to the other side of the room where the bell still rang importunately .
' Who is it ? ' she called .
Her voice was irritable , for she had been interrupted often since the music began .
She knew several thousand people , in certain directions human intercourse had advanced enormously .
But when she listened into the receiver , her white face wrinkled into smiles , and she said :
' Very well .
Let us talk , I will isolate myself .
I do not expect anything important will happen for the next five minutes - for I can give you fully five minutes , Kuno .
Then I must deliver my lecture on " Music during the Australian Period " . '
She touched the isolation knob , so that no one else could speak to her .
Then she touched the lighting apparatus , and the little room was plunged into darkness .
' Be quick ! ' she called , her irritation returning .
' Be quick , Kuno ; here I am in the dark wasting my time . '
But it was fully fifteen seconds before the round plate that she held in her hands began to glow .
A faint blue light shot across it , darkening to purple , and presently she could see the image of her son , who lived on the other side of the earth , and he could see her .
' Kuno , how slow you are . '
He smiled gravely .
' I really believe you enjoy dawdling . '
' I have called you before , mother , but you were always busy or isolated .
I have something particular to say . '
' What is it , dearest boy ?
Be quick .
Why could you not send it by pneumatic post ?'
' Because I prefer saying such a thing .
I want ----'
' Well ? '
' I want you to come and see me . '
Vashti watched his face in the blue plate .
' But I can see you ! ' she exclaimed .
' What more do you want ? '
' I want to see you not through the Machine , ' said Kuno .
' I want to speak to you not through the wearisome Machine . '
' Oh , hush ! ' said his mother , vaguely shocked .
' You must n't say anything against the Machine . '
' Why not ? '
' One must n't . '
' You talk as if a god had made the Machine , ' cried the other .
' I believe that you pray to it when you are unhappy .
Men made it , do not forget that .
Great men , but men .
The Machine is much , but it is not everything .
I see something like you in this plate , but I do not see you .
I hear something like you through this telephone , but I do not hear you .
That is why I want you to come .
Pay me a visit , so that we can meet face to face , and talk about the hopes that are in my mind . '
She replied that she could scarcely spare the time for a visit .
' The air - ship barely takes two days to fly between me and you . '
' I dislike air - ships . '
' Why ? '
' I dislike seeing the horrible brown earth , and the sea , and the stars when it is dark .
I get no ideas in an air - ship . '
' I do not get them anywhere else . '
' What kind of ideas can the air give you ? '
He paused for an instant .
' Do you not know four big stars that form an oblong , and three stars close together in the middle of the oblong , and hanging from these stars , three other stars ? '
' No , I do not .
I dislike the stars .
But did they give you an idea ?
How interesting ; tell me .'
' I had an idea that they were like a man . '
' I do not understand . '
' The four big stars are the man 's shoulders and his knees .
The three stars in the middle are like the belts that men wore once , and the three stars hanging are like a sword . '
' A sword ? '
' Men carried swords about with them , to kill animals and other men . '
' It does not strike me as a very good idea , but it is certainly original .
When did it come to you first ?'
' In the air - ship -----'
He broke off , and she fancied that he looked sad .
She could not be sure , for the Machine did not transmit nuances of expression .
It only gave a general idea of people - an idea that was good enough for all practical purposes , Vashti thought .
The imponderable bloom , declared by a discredited philosophy to be the actual essence of intercourse , was rightly ignored by the Machine , just as the imponderable bloom of the grape was ignored by the manufacturers of artificial fruit .
Something ' good enough ' had long since been accepted by our race .
' The truth is , ' he continued , ' that I want to see these stars again .
They are curious stars .
I want to see them not from the air - ship , but from the surface of the earth , as our ancestors did , thousands of years ago .
I want to visit the surface of the earth . '
She was shocked again .
' Mother , you must come , if only to explain to me what is the harm of visiting the surface of the earth . '
' No harm , ' she replied , controlling herself .
' But no advantage .
The surface of the earth is only dust and mud , no advantage .
The surface of the earth is only dust and mud , no life remains on it , and you would need a respirator , or the cold of the outer air would kill you .
One dies immediately in the outer air .'
' I know ; of course I shall take all precautions . '
' And besides ----'
' Well ? '
She considered , and chose her words with care .
Her son had a queer temper , and she wished to dissuade him from the expedition .
' It is contrary to the spirit of the age , ' she asserted .
' Do you mean by that , contrary to the Machine ? '
' In a sense , but ----'
His image is the blue plate faded .
' Kuno ! '
He had isolated himself .
For a moment Vashti felt lonely .
Then she generated the light , and the sight of her room , flooded with radiance and studded with electric buttons , revived her .
There were buttons and switches everywhere - buttons to call for food for music , for clothing .
There was the hot - bath button , by pressure of which a basin of ( imitation ) marble rose out of the floor , filled to the brim with a warm deodorized liquid .
There was the cold - bath button .
There was the button that produced literature .
And there were of course the buttons by which she communicated with her friends .
The room , though it contained nothing , was in touch with all that she cared for in the world .
Vashanti's next move was to turn off the isolation switch , and all the accumulations of the last three minutes burst upon her .
The room was filled with the noise of bells , and speaking - tubes .
What was the new food like ?
Could she recommend it ?
Has she had any ideas lately ?
Might one tell her one 's own ideas ?
Would she make an engagement to visit the public nurseries at an early date ?
- say this day month .
To most of these questions she replied with irritation - a growing quality in that accelerated age .
She said that the new food was horrible .
That she could not visit the public nurseries through press of engagements .
That she had no ideas of her own but had just been told one - that four stars and three in the middle were like a man : she doubted there was much in it .
Then she switched off her correspondents , for it was time to deliver her lecture on Australian music .
The clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned ; neither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms .
Seated in her armchair she spoke , while they in their armchairs heard her , fairly well , and saw her , fairly well .
She opened with a humorous account of music in the pre Mongolian epoch , and went on to describe the great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest .
Remote and prim�val as were the methods of I - San- So and the Brisbane school , she yet felt ( she said ) that study of them might repay the musicians of today : they had freshness ; they had , above all , ideas .
Her lecture , which lasted ten minutes , was well received , and at its conclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the sea ; there were ideas to be got from the sea ; the speaker had donned a respirator and visited it lately .
Then she fed , talked to many friends , had a bath , talked again , and summoned her bed .
The bed was not to her liking .
It was too large , and she had a feeling for a small bed .
Complaint was useless , for beds were of the same dimension all over the world , and to have had an alternative size would have involved vast alterations in the Machine .
Vashti isolated herself - it was necessary , for neither day nor night existed under the ground - and reviewed all that had happened since she had summoned the bed last .
Ideas ?
Scarcely any .
Events - was Kuno 's invitation an event ?
By her side , on the little reading - desk , was a survival from the ages of litter - one book .
This was the Book of the Machine .
In it were instructions against every possible contingency .
If she was hot or cold or dyspeptic or at a loss for a word , she went to the book , and it told her which button to press .
The Central Committee published it .
In accordance with a growing habit , it was richly bound .
Sitting up in the bed , she took it reverently in her hands .
She glanced round the glowing room as if some one might be watching her .
Then , half ashamed , half joyful , she murmured ' O Machine ! O Machine !' and raised the volume to her lips .
Thrice she kissed it , thrice inclined her head , thrice she felt the delirium of acquiescence .
Her ritual performed , she turned to page 1367 , which gave the times of the departure of the air - ships from the island in the southern hemisphere , under whose soil she lived , to the island in the northern hemisphere , whereunder lived her son .
She thought , ' I have not the time . '
She made the room dark and slept ; she awoke and made the room light ; she ate and exchanged ideas with her friends , and listened to music and attended lectures ; she make the room dark and slept .
Above her , beneath her , and around her , the Machine hummed eternally ; she did not notice the noise , for she had been born with it in her ears .
The earth , carrying her , hummed as it sped through silence , turning her now to the invisible sun , now to the invisible stars .
She awoke and made the room light .
' Kuno ! '
' I will not talk to you . ' he answered , ' until you come . '
' Have you been on the surface of the earth since we spoke last ? '
His image faded .
Again she consulted the book .
She became very nervous and lay back in her chair palpitating .
Think of her as without teeth or hair .
Presently she directed the chair to the wall , and pressed an unfamiliar button .
The wall swung apart slowly .
Through the opening she saw a tunnel that curved slightly , so that its goal was not visible .
Should she go to see her son , here was the beginning of the journey .
Of course she knew all about the communication - system .
There was nothing mysterious in it .
She would summon a car and it would fly with her down the tunnel until it reached the lift that communicated with the air - ship station : the system had been in use for many , many years , long before the universal establishment of the Machine .
And of course she had studied the civilization that had immediately preceded her own - the civilization that had mistaken the functions of the system , and had used it for bringing people to things , instead of for bringing things to people .
Those funny old days , when men went for change of air instead of changing the air in their rooms !
And yet - she was frightened of the tunnel : she had not seen it since her last child was born .
It curved - but not quite as she remembered ; it was brilliant - but not quite as brilliant as a lecturer had suggested .
Vashti was seized with the terrors of direct experience .
She shrank back into the room , and the wall closed up again .
' Kuno , ' she said , ' I can not come to see you .
I am not well .'
Immediately an enormous apparatus fell on to her out of the ceiling , a thermometer was automatically laid upon her heart .
She lay powerless .
Cool pads soothed her forehead .
Kuno had telegraphed to her doctor .
So the human passions still blundered up and down in the Machine .
Vashti drank the medicine that the doctor projected into her mouth , and the machinery retired into the ceiling .
The voice of Kuno was heard asking how she felt .
' Better . '
Then with irritation : ' But why do you not come to me instead ? '
' Because I can not leave this place . '
' Why ? '
' Because , any moment , something tremendous many happen . '
' Have you been on the surface of the earth yet ? '
' Not yet . '
' Then what is it ? '
' I will not tell you through the Machine . '
She resumed her life .
But she thought of Kuno as a baby , his birth , his removal to the public nurseries , her own visit to him there , his visits to her -visits which stopped when the Machine had assigned him a room on the other side of the earth .
' Parents , duties of , ' said the book of the Machine , ' cease at the moment of birth .
P. 422327483 . '
True , but there was something special about Kuno - indeed there had been something special about all her children - and , after all , she must brave the journey if he desired it .
And ' something tremendous might happen ' .
What did that mean ?
The nonsense of a youthful man , no doubt , but she must go .
Again she pressed the unfamiliar button , again the wall swung back , and she saw the tunnel that curves out of sight .
Clasping the Book , she rose , tottered on to the platform , and summoned the car .
Her room closed behind her : the journey to the northern hemisphere had begun .
Of course it was perfectly easy .
The car approached and in it she found armchairs exactly like her own .
When she signalled , it stopped , and she tottered into the lift .
One other passenger was in the lift , the first fellow creature she had seen face to face for months .
Few travelled in these days , for , thanks to the advance of science , the earth was exactly alike all over .
Rapid intercourse , from which the previous civilization had hoped so much , had ended by defeating itself .
What was the good of going to Peking when it was just like Shrewsbury ?
Why return to Shrewsbury when it would all be like Peking ?
Men seldom moved their bodies ; all unrest was concentrated in the soul .
The air - ship service was a relic from the former age .
It was kept up , because it was easier to keep it up than to stop it or to diminish it , but it now far exceeded the wants of the population .
Vessel after vessel would rise from the vomitories of Rye or of Christchurch ( I use the antique names ) , would sail into the crowded sky , and would draw up at the wharves of the south - empty .
So nicely adjusted was the system , so independent of meteorology , that the sky , whether calm or cloudy , resembled a vast kaleidoscope whereon the same patterns periodically recurred .
The ship on which Vashti sailed started now at sunset , now at dawn .
But always , as it passed above Rheas , it would neighbour the ship that served between Helsingfors and the Brazils , and , every third time it surmounted the Alps , the fleet of Palermo would cross its track behind .
Night and day , wind and storm , tide and earthquake , impeded man no longer .
He had harnessed Leviathan .
All the old literature , with its praise of Nature , and its fear of Nature , rang false as the prattle of a child .
Yet as Vashti saw the vast flank of the ship , stained with exposure to the outer air , her horror of direct experience returned .
It was not quite like the air - ship in the cinematophote .
For one thing it smelt - not strongly or unpleasantly , but it did smell , and with her eyes shut she should have known that a new thing was close to her .
Then she had to walk to it from the lift , had to submit to glances from the other passengers .
The man in front dropped his Book - no great matter , but it disquieted them all .
In the rooms , if the Book was dropped , the floor raised it mechanically , but the gangway to the air - ship was not so prepared , and the sacred volume lay motionless .
They stopped - the thing was unforeseen - and the man , instead of picking up his property , felt the muscles of his arm to see how they had failed him .
Then some one actually said with direct utterance : ' We shall be late ' - and they trooped on board , Vashti treading on the pages as she did so .
Rachel Maddow demolished the last legs of Pat Buchanan ’s credibility last night by way of correcting his errors :
Maddow apologizing for him is an especially nice touch ; it ’s like a daughter - in - law asking guests to forgive the family patriarch ’s dementia .
MSNBC should put the original culture warrior out to pasture .
He ’s a fossil ; why would MSNBC want to become his museum ?
A trend we 've highlighted a few times continues is continuing in June :
FT : Executives in charge of the largest US companies sent a signal of their concerns by selling far more shares than they bought this month , according to data based on Securities and Exchange Commission filings .
Share sales by so - called company insiders are outstripping purchases so far this month by more than 22 times .
TrimTabs , the investment research company , said insiders of S&P 500 listed companies have unloaded $ 2.6bn in shares in June , compared with $ 120 m in purchases .

Of course , their companies are doing the same thing on the corporate level : selling stock , raising cash and delevering generally .
Mom & pop , meanwhile , are rushing into mutual funds again .
From the ' how much faster can it go ' files :
The race for the fastest Linux boot has been going on for about a year at this point and now we 've got a new winner .
Embedded Linux vendor MontaVista today is announcing the demonstration of a 1 second Linux boot .
In contrast the fastest production Linux releases today are in the 20 - 25 second range .
To be fair , MontaVista 's Linux with the 1 second boot is embedded and designed specifically for the Freescale Semiconductor
MPC5121e hardware built on Power Architecture technology .
That 's not to say they can't get the same performance on other architectures , it 's that is the hardware on which the first 1 second boot is being demonstrated .
" The achievement of one second boot from cold power to operational
status is a breakthrough in embedded Linux performance , " said Jim Ready ,
CTO of MontaVista Software in a statement .
" It 's always been thought that embedded
Linux could never perform at this level of speed and efficiency . "

“ If English was good enough for Jesus Christ , it ought to be good enough for the children of Texas , ” supposedly said Miriam “ Ma ” Ferguson , first woman governor of Texas , in opposing the teaching of foreign languages in Texas schools .
In fact , the college - educated Ferguson probably did n’t say it .
But the misquote endures because it captures pretty well one particular segment of the American population – those who are almost always against learning and science , particularly when that science is “ inconvenient . ”
Whether it ’s evolution or landing on the moon or daylight savings time or climate change , there is always a group of people who are just plain agin ’ it .
It ’s a lot of fun for those of us with a smattering of education to make fun of these rubes – at the Creation Museum in Kentucky , you can have your picture taken riding a saddled triceratops .
But there are also anti-scientists who are n’t rubes and should know better , like George Will , who has jumped on the climate - change denial bandwagon .
97 % percent of scientists around the world believe that climate change is occurring and is at least partially caused by man .
According to Wikipedia , every single scientific organization worldwide of any standing has taken the same position .
As for the other 3 % , it ’s understandable why those who design SUVs and drill for petroleum should be reluctant to admit that global warming is occurring .
My client Michael , who retired from Philip - Morris after thirty plus years , only recently acknowledged that smoking might play a role in lung disease .
But why are George Will and my friend Chris , a CEO educated at Oxford and Harvard Business School , climate - change denialists ?
With George , I assume it is just simple cynical expediency .
I ’ve done enough big - time public speaking to know the only way to get paid is to tell the audience what it wants to hear and there are audiences for this stuff .
George and Rush Limbaugh have mortgages and prescription bills just like the rest of us .
( In kind , not in degree . )
With Chris it ’s a mystery why he cares so much , but he has invested countless hours cherry picking the data to “ prove ” that global warming is a data blip .
Is it simply pro-growth reflex ?
Who knows ?
Not that it really matters .
Whether George and Chris buy into it or not , overwhelming scientific evidence suggests anyone who asserts man-made climate change is not occurring is either A ) a fool or B ) completely blinded by self - interest .
The problem is this : I do believe in the climate change science .
That takes me out of Category A , thank goodness .
But I am pretty sure I am still a climate - change denialist .
I am just in Category B .
Do n’t get me wrong .
At our house , we meticulously sort every bit of garbage for recycling .
We compost .
I ride public transportation to work .
We have instructed the architect for our new home to install solar panels and a geo - thermal heat pump .
Our new refrigerator has the highest energy rating possible .
We bought a first - generation hybrid car .
We support climate change legislation like the Waxman bill ( HR 2998 , such as it is ) .
But the inconvenient truth is we also have three vehicles , including a rather large Audi that my eco-friendly wife drives .
We have two houses and are building another ( for two people . )
We have a television on every floor of both houses , including three flat panels , each of which soaks up as much energy as a refrigerator .
We fly to Barbados in the summer and Tahoe in the winter .
In other words , sorting our garbage to reduce our carbon footprint is like pissing into a hurricane .
At best , it is naïve and ridiculous tokenism .
At worst , it is just a cynical as George Will ’s denialism .
When Al Gore justifies his massive mansion and fleet of cars by saying he purchases green energy and carbon offsets , that is pure sophistry .
Here ’s the bottom line .
If reducing global warming depends on reducing carbon emissions , the planet is screwed .
Consuming the same amount more efficiently , i.e. driving a hybrid car , is just fiddling around the edges .
It ’s like obese people who drink diet soda with their fried chicken .
In fact , carbon intensity will probably increase going forward , not decrease .
For example , the computer you ’re reading this blog on .
That takes energy .
In Japan , the hot new items are electric toilets with stool analyzers , heaters and music players in them .
That takes energy .
Organic food means fewer chemicals , but often requires far more tillage .
That takes energy .
Most of the new and wonderful things we routinely incorporate into our lives take more energy than what they replaced .
Is it possible to substitute non-carbon emitting energy sources for those that emit carbon ?
Yes , but a colleague of mine who is in the business of building windfarms claims that best case , alternative energy will replace 10 % of carbon - sourced energy .
Assume the best case : we are able to find enough efficiencies and alternative energy sources to hold steady .
It ’s not at all clear that holding steady is enough .
Reducing carbon emissions per capita would mean consuming less food , less electronics , less transportation .
And that ’s just not very likely .
George may be anti-science , but if I believe washing out milk bottles makes up for driving an eight - cylinder Audi to the store to buy milk , I am anti-arithmetic .
My grandkids will be screwed just as badly by my good intentions as by his Know - Nothing - ism .
( Note to George .
I know the Know - Nothings were really an anti-Catholic party .
I ’m making a point here , dude . )
Gulp .
I am a climate - change denialist , just like Chris .
And George .
And Rush .
God help me .

Hi , I ’m Mark Nottingham .
I currently co-chair the IETF HTTP and QUIC Working Groups , and am a member of the Internet Architecture Board .
I usually write here about the Web , protocol design , HTTP , and caching .

What to Look For in a HTTP Proxy / Cache
Part of my job is maintaining Yahoo ! ’s build of Squid and supporting its users , which use it to serve everything from the internal Web services that make sites go to serving Flickr ’s images .
In that process , I often am asked “ what about X ? ” , where X is another caching or load balancing product ( yes , Squid can be used as a load balancer ) .
For example , Varnish , or lighttpd .
Generally , these comparisons come down to three factors ; performance , features and manageability .
Almost invariably , Squid does n’t do as well as newer comers in performance ( although it generally is faster than Apache ) , but wins on features and manageability — and that ’s why it ’s so widely used .
I ’m not going to argue that Squid is best for every deployment , but I do think that it ’s important to evaluate the whole picture , rather than just one metric .
So , here are a few initial thoughts about what ’s important when you ’re evaluating a proxy / cache :
Performance
Performance can mean a lot of things .
The least interesting but most widely cited benchmark for this kind of server is “ how many 1 k responses can it serve from memory per second ? ” but that does n’t tell you how it will do serving 200 K ( or 200 M ) responses from disk , which is a much more difficult thing to manage .
Try looking at :
Persistent connections — support is necessary for good performance , and a good proxy server should be able to handle tens of thousands of idle connections with nearly no overhead .
This means epoll , kqueue , libevent or similar under the covers .
Make sure it supports HTTP / 1.1 chunked encoding as well .

Hit rates — it ’s necessary to test the code paths both to the cache and forward to the origin server .

Response latency — intermediation means adding an extra layer , so it ’s critical that it does n’t add latency as well .
A proxy should be able to serve a hit in less than a millisecond , easy .

Cache efficiency — some implementations take shortcuts which improve benchmark speeds by making the cache less than perfectly efficient for a given workload .
This may or may not be good for your use case , but you need to be aware of it .

If they ’re in the critical path , these can affect performance greatly .
Per - object overhead — caches need to be able to find things quickly , and this means some level of per-cached - response overhead in memory .
The amount of overhead can limit the overall scalability of your cache ( because it consumes too much memory ) , but sometimes having more metadata in memory helps the cache be more efficient .
Features
Concurrence
How does the proxy handle multiple requests for the same URL ?
This is often critical in “ reverse proxy ” deployments , where a flood of requests can come in for the same thing if it gets suddenly popular , or when you first bring a cache online .
If the response is n’t cached and fresh , that flood of requests can quickly overcome your back - end servers .
There are a few techniques for dealing with this .
Collapsed forwarding will only allow one request for a URL to go forward at a time , if there is n’t anything in cache ; if the response is cacheable , it will be sent to all waiting clients , saving those requests from going forward and swamping the origin server .
If something is cached but stale , stale - while - revalidate lets the cache serve the stale response while it refreshes what it has in the background .
Not only does this save you from a flood of validation requests , but it also effectively hides the latency of refreshing your content from your clients , offering better quality of service .
ACLs
In my experience , one of the biggest things that gets a workout in a proxy / cache is the ACL system .
Make sure you have maximum flexibility here ; e.g. , can you apply access control to something based on whether it ’s a cache miss ?
Can an ACL select things by the request method , URL , headers , client address ?
Can you combine ACL directives ?
Can you extend the ACL system ?
Streaming and Buffering
A good proxy will offer fine - grained control over how it buffers requests and responses .
For example , if you ’re deploying as a reverse proxy , you want to be able to buffer up the entire response , so that you can free up resources on the origin server as quickly as possible if the client is slow .
Likewise , buffering the request before sending it to the origin server can help conserve resources in some deployments , increasing capacity .
Conversely , however , it ’s not good if your proxy requires responses to be buffered before they ’re sent ; this consumes too many resources on the proxy if you ’re sending large responses , and does n’t work at all for streaming applications ( e.g. , video ) .
Cache Behaviour Tuning
Although HTTP has excellent controls to allow both the origin server and the client to say how caches should behave , inevitably there will be cases where you ’ll need to … ahem … fine - tune them .
This includes tuning the heuristic algorithm , which is what to do when there are no such instructions .
It also includes overriding the specified behaviour .
For example , a reverse proxy probably wants to ignore Cache - Control : no-cache , since the cache is under control of the origin server .
All of these tuning knobs need to be applicable in a fine - grained way ; Squid does it with regular expressions against the URL ( in refresh_patterns ) .
Cache Configuration
The cache as a whole needs to be configurable as well .
For example , when the set of cached objects gets larger than the allocated memory or disk space , the cache needs to evict some .
As a mountain of research will attest , some replacment policies are more efficient than others , especially under different workloads .
Resilience to Errors
Networked systems inevitably fail .
Besides the obvious aspects of this ( e.g. , configurable timeouts ) , in a cache it ’s also important to handle failures as gracefully as possible , to preserve both quality of service and cache efficiency .
Stale - If - Error helps to hide temporary back - end problems by allowing a cache to use a stale cached response ( if available ) when it ca n’t get a fresh one , or if the server returns an error code like 500 Internal Server Error .
For situations where having something stale is better than nothing at all , this helps .
Quick Abort works from the other side ; when the client aborts ( because of a network or software problem , or a simple timeout ) , the cache should be able to be configured to continue downloading the response from the server , so that the next client will have the benefit of having it in cache .
Peering
Caches are often deployed in sets , both to increase capacity and also to assure availability .
In these deployments , support for inter -cache protocols like ICP and HTCP means a better hit rate and , perhaps more importantly , the ability to bring a “ cold ” cache up - to - speed without overloading origin servers .
When evaluating support for peering , keep in mind that HTCP is more capable than ICP , because it takes into account the request headers , not just the URL .
Also , HTCP CLR support means that something becoming invalid in one cache can trigger purges from neighbouring caches too ( a pattern I ’ll talk more about soon ) .
Good implementations should also have a means of assuring that forwarding loops do n’t happen .
Finally , Cache Digests are an interesting way to use a Bloom filter ; by keeping a lossy digest of peers ’ contents , it ’s possible to predict whether a given request will be a hit .
This is useful when the latency between peers makes “ normal ” inter - cache protocols too expensive ( e.g. , deployments between coasts or continents ) .
Routing
Proxies often get used as layer 7 routers ; usually , to shift traffic around to the right server , for some value of “ right . ”
A good proxy will have a number of tools to help you do this , including active and passive monitoring of peers and origin servers ( to determine health and availability ) , flexible request rewriting ( including both the request URI and response Location headers ) , and controls over how many connections can go to a particular server , as well as how many idle connections to keep open to each server .
Another form of routing is CARP , which routes based upon a consistent hashing algorithm — like DHTs .
This allows you to build a massive array of caches to serve a very large working set ( e.g. , photos , a CDN ) .
One thing that often goes hand in hand with routing is retries — i.e. , being able to try a different origin server ( or IP address , or peer ) if you ca n’t get a successful answer on the first try ( if allowed by the protocol ; this makes sense for GET , not POST , obviously ) .
Getting the Standards Right
Really , this is n’t a feature , it ’s a floor to entry .
If you ’re going to use a proxy / cache , you have to be sure that it ’s going to behave in a predictable , interoperable way , and that means conforming to HTTP1.1 , SSL and all of the other applicable standards .
In the case of HTTP , this means not taking shortcuts ; for example , variant caching is hard , but it ’s necessary to have it for a cache to be useful .
A great tool to help evaluate this is Co-Advisor .
Manageability
Stability
A proxy is worthless if it goes down all of the time , or if you ’re worried that it will .
Part of this is how mature it is , and part is how well it ’s been tested .
One of the reasons I like Squid is that it ’s used in thousands ( if not tens of thousands ) of applications around the world ; it ’s been around for more than a decade , so it ’s been hammered on hard .
Because of this breadth of deployment , I can confidently use it in a new ( to me ) situation , knowing that it ’s probably been used in that way before .
Contrast this with software that ’s been designed for a particular purpose and has n’t been used outside that narrow profile very much .
Metrics
Managing a cache means knowing what it ’s doing , and what went wrong if you have a problem .
A good implementation should have extremely extensive metrics available , ideally in many forms ( e.g. , over HTTP , SNMP , in logs ) , as well as easy - to - use debugging mechanisms , because at the end of the day all of these platforms are really complex beasts .
Ease of Use
Finally , caches have to be intuitive to use .
Typically , they ’re designed for a sysadmin or a netadmin , not a developer , and I think this is a shame , because these days that should be a primary audience .

Web sites have been blocked over the past couple of days , including the Web sites of the opposition parties in Iran , Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube .
While political organizers have learned to leverage the organizing power of Web 2.0 tools , government censors in Iran are quick to shut them down when they are most effective .
None of this is surprising ; it reflects similar events seen in many places around the world .
Digital tools have been shown to be effective political organizing tools , from the Obama presidential campaign in the US to Ukraine , Colombia and Moldova .
As powerful as new technologies may be as political tools , information and communication technologies have also been proven to be exceedingly fragile ; in countries where the government has sufficient latitude to interfere with the use of these tools , they are easily disrupted and if necessary , can be shut down entirely .
The role of information and communication technologies in Iranian politics has matured rapidly over the past year .
Political opposition groups in particular have adopted new online and mobile phone - based organizing tactics , using Facebook , Twitter , Web sites , email , cell phones and SMS and the full suite of Web 2.0 tools as mechanisms for political organizing .
This is has all taken place in a highly restrictive media environment in which the Internet and other forms of digital communication are intensely regulated .
Facebook has been blocked and unblocked several times in the past year .
The rationale and legal justifications for censoring Internet communications are broad .
Anything construed as anti-Islamic or damaging to the Iranian state can be blocked by what amounts to executive fiat , although there are many voices within the institutions charged with blocking web sites in Iran .
Earlier reports that the government shut down the Internet entirely during the June 12 elections appear to be exaggerated .
Jim Cowie at Renesys looked at the evidence from international routing data and indeed found evidence of some strange events in Iran ’s traffic to the outside .
However , the Internet is still up in Iran , though reports from inside Iran suggest that it is much slower than normal and a broader range of websites are being blocked .
The fact that Iran has invested so much in blocking Internet content might mean that they have greater confidence about keeping tight controls over content available in Iran without shutting down the Internet entirely , as Burma had done in the face of popular protests there .
After a large surge in SMS traffic in the run-up to the election , multiple sources inside Iran reported that the country ’s SMS networks went down just nine hours before the polls opened .
This is unsurprising , as SMS has been used in many places as a powerful tool for organizing protests .
Reporters Without Borders reports that the SMS take - down was part of attempt to prevent opposition supporters from collecting election results .
By Saturday , all mobile phone services had been shut off in Tehran .
Plans by an organization led by former president Rafsanjani to carry out election monitoring using cell phones might have factored into this decision .
Cell phone service was restored on June 14 , but SMS continues to be blocked .
Western media sources have covered the news as it unfolds , although some US media outlets have been criticized for not focusing more attention on the events in Iran .
The government has not thrown western journalists out of the country , though it has made reporting difficult .
The BBC has traced the jamming of one of its satellites , which has interrupted access to radio and television for audiences in Iran , the Middle East and Europe , to a location inside Iran .
Despite the tightening restrictions on communications tools , citizen journalists inside Iran have been hard at work .
Video clips are widely available on the net , as are photos of Iranian voters and post-election protests .
Although YouTube and DailyMotion are both blocked , we were able to upload a small video to Vimeo .
The generally slow Internet speeds will hinder the upload of large files .
ONI has confirmed the expansion of blocking over the past several days , making access to ongoing reporting of events as well as political organizing far more difficult for Iranians .
In the past several days , YouTube , Twitter , and Facebook have been blocked .
The English version of BBC is now blocked ; the Persian version has been blocked for months .
Websites of the major opposition candidates are all blocked , including Mousavi ’s website ( mirhussein.com ) and Karoubi ’s website ( teribon.com ) .
The blog host , blogfa.com , has been down for several days now , preventing many Iranian bloggers from updating their blogs .
We tested the thirty web sites that receive disproportionate attention from the reformist segments of the Iran blogosphere and about half of these are not blocked , including norooznews.ir , webneveshteha.com , emruz.biz , emruz.info , yaarinews.com , mowj.ir , maryamshab.blogfa.com , mirhussein.com , masoudbehnoud.com , drmoeen.ir and noandish.com .
Among those not blocked include ghalamnews.ir , aftabnews.ir and khatami.ir .
( Thanks to John Kelly for the list of sites that we tested .
This is derived from the blogosphere mapping work of John Kelly and Bruce Etling ) .
In response , some pro-democracy activists are targeting government Web sites with DDOS attacks in an attempt to strike back at the current regime .
While they have had some success – leader .ir , ahmadinejad.ir , and iribnews .ir were reported to be down – experts worry that the attacks may be used by the Iranian government to justify their own filtering or , worse , may cripple the Iranian network as a whole .
( Note : Leader.ir was back up when we tested .
Ahmadinejad.ir and iribnews .ir were still down . )
Many years of Internet filtering have prompted the development of circumvention tools by and for Iranians .
Many Internet users in Iran have become adept at getting past the Internet censors there .
An unintended consequence is that there are many sophisticated users and tools that are prepared to circumvent government attempts to limit access to online sites .
This increase in filtering associated with the elections can be expected to increase the demand for access to and knowledge about circumvention technology .
These measures to further limit access to information around the contested election results are not going to help the current the Iranian government if it seeks to build legitimacy .
Info GTO File Format GTO
File Format GTO is an open source file format designed for computer graphics .
It was developed by Tweak Films to serve as the core storage format for our geometry and rendering pipeline .
GTO is used by VFX and animation facilities , post - houses , and game developers for a wide variety of applications .
It 's small size and versatility make it useful for animation , modeling , particle dynamics and 3D paint .
It can be used to replace file formats such as PDB / PDC , obj , and binary RIB .
At heart GTO is just a clean and optimal way of storing large , named , and organized arrays of binary data ( although there is a text version of the file too ) .
GTO naturally lends itself to a " least common denominator " role between computer graphics applications .
The storage mechanism and the data layout are independent , so that the format can be easily adopted without regard to how the format is used by any particular application .
The GTO library has bindings in C++ and Python making it relatively easy to develop custom tools to read , write and manipulate GTO files .
The GTO library includes the low - level reader and writer classes , a slightly higher level raw data reader / writer , and source code for a Maya scene and particle export , particle display , a Maya deformer to use GTO as a geometry cache , Houdini plug-ins , a number of command line tools , a Wavefront .obj parser ( for a command line converter ) , and a Python module for reading and writing GTO files .
The GTO reader / writer and tools have been tested thoroughly in feature film and game production on GNU / Linux and OSX as well as Windows XP , Vista , and 2000 .
GTO is also used as part of Tweak Software 's commercial products .
Development
GTO is still being developed .
In the past , all development occured at Tweak Films .
However , since Tweak Films has gone into hibernation , that situation has changed : there are now a handful of organizations contributing to the project .
We at Tweak Software are also continuing development ( GTO is native file format for RV ) , and are coordinating with the other big users .
There is a new project -- which is currently in the design phase -- to create a higher level library on top of GTO to make geometry and other graphics related data even easier to deal with in an agnostic manner .
The primary use target for this work will be simulation , modeling , and image processing applications .
Two of the major goals will be to have machine verifiable correctness for data layout and the storage and retrieval of multiple arbitrary graphs connecting GTO objects .
Getting the Code
The official distribution and project pages can be found on SourceForge .
net or go directly to the download page .
This repository on github is the current Tweak Software cut of the code .
You need to install git to get it .
Once you have git do the following in your shell : $ git clone git://github.com/jimhourihan/gto.git
There is also an emacs mode gto - mode.el for editing GTO text files .
Documentation Latest Version ( 3.4 ) License Brief
The GTO library and included programs are provided under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License with exceptions for static linking ( see LICENSE file in the source code for details ) .
If you extend , repair , or invent a new protocol for the GTO format and would like it incorporated in our tree drop us a line at some email address you can probably figure out .
Or just drop us a line telling us you 're using it ( at the same email address ) .
Version History Version 3.4
The GTO license terms have been changed : the code is still covered by the LGPL , but with additional exceptions similar to those used by the FLTK library .
These exceptions make it easier to use GTO in commercial projects .
The library no longer attempts to be source code compatible with older Microsoft compilers .
Some functions may throw on error .
Bug fixes to the C++ Gto :: Writer class for output of text GTO files .
Run -time error checking of the Gto : : Writer API .
The class will complain if the API is used in a undocumented manner .
It may throw an exception .
The GTO source code distribution now comes with Maya and Houdini plugins for cached deforming geometry and particle export and display .
Version 3.2 Human readable plain text version of GTO .
Some readers may not function if they assume that the property size is known when the property ( ) virtual function is called .
The property size is only really known when the data ( ) virtual function is called .
Only version 3.2 GTO readers can read the text version .
Animation curves are now stored per-object using the animation protocol .
Bug fixes to Gto:: Reader class to allow reuse of existing class with a newly opened file .
Version 3.1 RenderMan plug - in documentation added .
Version 3.0
An interpretation string has been added to the property header .
An additional uint32 has been added as padding to the object , component , and property headers for future expansion slop .
A section on interpretation strings has been added to the documentation and to the reader / writer classes .
Added a type reference to the documentation .
Version 2.1 - gtofilter - was changed to optionaly accept POSIX style regular expressions in addition to shell - like “ glob ” expressions .
The C++ writer class now defaults to writing compressed files when the open ( ) function is called .
A second bool argument can be passed to it to prevent the compression .
The proposed texture assignment protocol ( from version 2.0.4 ) has been rejected .
A new protocol “ channel ” is introduced for assigning mapped surface varying data on geometry .
An arbitrary number of texture maps may be assigned to the geometry .
The material protocol has been fleshed out .
The polygon protocol was missing the definition of the optional mappings component .
Version 2.0.5
Bug fix version .
Repaired problems with the configuration scripts .
Missing headers .
Version 2.0.4
Bug fix version .
Some configuration problems solved .
Version 2.0
File headers changed .
The format is not compatible with 1.0 .

Unrest in Iran has opened a theological rift within the Shiite sect of Islam , undermining the Iranian regime 's founding dogma that is shared by millions of fellow Shiites across the Middle East .
The concept , known as wilayat al - faqih -- literally " guardianship by a jurist " -- holds that , in an Islamic state , a divinely anointed scholar of Islamic law must exercise unquestioned authority over elected officials and the rest of the government .

Alvy Singer , a forty year old twice divorced , neurotic , intellectual Jewish New York stand - up comic , reflects on the demise of his latest relationship , to Annie Hall , an insecure , flighty , Midwestern WASP aspiring nightclub singer .
Unlike his previous relationships ,
Alvy believed he may have worked out all the issues in his life through fifteen years of therapy to make this relationship with Annie last , among those issues being not wanting to date any woman that would want to date him , and thus subconsciously pushing those women away .
Alvy not only reviews the many ups and many downs of their relationship , but also reviews the many facets of his makeup that led to him starting to date Annie .
Those facets include growing up next to Coney Island in Brooklyn , being attracted to the opposite sex for as long as he can remember , and enduring years of Jewish guilt with his constantly arguing parents .

The micro-blogging service Twitter continues to increase in popularity but while it 's great to hear about what that B - grade celebrity had for breakfast or where your best friend woke up this morning , readers of TorrentFreak will probably prefer hearing about torrents .
That 's where TorrentTwitter steps in .
In the unlikely event you ’re unfamiliar with the basics of Twitter , here is a twenty second crash course .
Twitter is a free micro blogging platform where users can send each other short messages .
Known as ‘ tweets ’ , these messages consist of no more than 140 characters and are sent to other Twitter users who previously subscribed to the sending user ’s profile .
These people are known as ‘ followers ’ .
The message will also be available for all to see on the web .
Now , clearly inspired by Twitter , comes a new micro-blogging service called TorrentTwitter .
After the brief registration process ( OpenID accepted ) , users can post short messages of maximum 140 characters .
It ’s possible to send any information you choose using the original Twitter and the same is possible on the TorrentTwitter service , but it seems to have been designed with the sharing of BitTorrent links in mind .
Most updates on this niche Twitter seem to contain the the location of . torrent files on the web via a short URL , along with related details .
These messages are sent to the user ’s followers via the web , instant message , RSS feeds or SMS , and also appear on the public timeline on the mainpage .
Of course , as a user of TorrentTwitter it ’s also possible to follow other users of the service too .
Maybe you know of someone who likes downloading the same kind of music as you – subscribe to his or her feed and get informed the second they share that information .
Alternatively , with enough users TorrentTwitter will become a user generated meta - search engine for torrent files .
The other possibility for users on TorrentTwitter is the creation of a group to which other users can join .
In a torrent context , a group can be focused on a particular subject , say the latest TV shows .
Any member of that group could send an update of where to find the latest torrent for a particular show , and instantaneously everyone in the group is notified .
Groups can be as specific or as diverse as the user chooses .
Right now since the site only launched on June 2nd , there are only a handful of groups listed , leaving plenty of scope and opportunity for those wishing to start a new group .
Joining a group is easy , just click ‘ join ’ on the group ’s page .
TorrentTwitter also has a cloud displaying the most popular tags on the site , along with most popular and featured TorrentTweets , if that ’s the correct term .
We ’re expecting news from the site owner and we ’ll update this post when that arrives .
A new DJ mix to capture the best of a vintage Nineties Japanese dance music sound .
Think of it as retromania for retromania .
Thanks to the international success of Pizzicato Five , Cornelius , and Towa Tei , the loosely - defined , decade - spanning Nineties indie music movement known as Shibuya - kei has been one of Japan ’s most influential cultural exports .
The last fifteen years , however , have been unkind to the genre , as the movement ’s originators abandoned its signature sound and pleaded for distance from the terminology .
No one ever liked being pigeonholed under the dated term “ Shibuya - kei ” in the first place , but once the trend was over and its cachet depleted , artists wanted a chance to be themselves without all the SK - related baggage .
But here we are nearly 25 years after Shibuya - kei ’s birth , and its eclecticism once again stands out on a global stage , this time as an antidote to the globalized factory - made pop monotony of the Twenty - Tens .
Yet the musicians ’ œuvres are partially buried under the sands of time , and knowledge of the genre ’s hidden gems are locked in the heads of obsessive former young people ( and in the bargain bins of provincial used record store dumps with pages on Yahoo !
Auction ) .
The time has been right for a new mix that showcases , celebrates , and reintroduces the best tracks from Shibuya - kei ’s peak years .
So here we are : The Best of Shibuya - kei , Volume One .
While many would identify 1993 - 1995 as Shibuya - kei ’s shining moment in the sun — an era where Pizzicato Five ’s “ Sweet Soul Revue ” and Kahimi Karie ’s “ Good Morning World ” were pop chart hits — the genre crystallized as a dance music movement much later in the decade .
“ The Best of Shibuya - kei , Volume One ” prioritizes beats over melodies , and the best beats popped up around 1998 - 2001 with the emergence of Readymade Records ( Pizzicato Five , Fantastic Plastic Machine , Mansfield ) and Escalator Records ( Cubismo Grafico , Losfeld ) as well as later followers in the 21st century such as Halfby .
As a nod to deep connections to a wider international movement , the mix also includes a few key foreign artists who were either directly linked to the Shibuya - kei movement ( Dimitri from Paris ) or otherwise took heavy influence ( Ursula 1000 ) .
Most dance music genres hover around a specific BPM range , but Shibuya - kei ’s ravenous consumption of global rhythms stretches the tracks across the scale , from hip - hop to house to breakbeats all the way up to speedy bossa nova , samba , and drum ’n’ bass .
The mix , like Shibuya - kei itself , is designed to seamlessly flow through what otherwise would be disparate and discordant sounds .
There are symphonic strings , jazz riffs , groovy bass lines , yé- yé rips , Hammond solos , digitally - degraded funk samples , vocoders , saxophones , MiniMoogs , turntable scratches , old - school rap toasts , bongos , acoustic guitar strums , a surprising amount of mambo , Lollapalooza melodies , dinky electro synths , jazz scat , schoolyard chants , whisper raps , Twilight Zone tones , Amen breaks , 909 hats , lyrical references to Jeremy Scott , and samples spanning from Scritti Politti , Sesso Matto , Bobby Valentín , and Buddy Rich , to Hair Goes Latin .
With so much freedom , maybe the better question is , what is n’t Shibuya - kei ?
The groups employed a punk D.I.Y.
attitude but do not sound like “ rock . ”
The electronic elements would never be confused with techno .
Shibuya - kei is often “ dumb ” like Brighton big beat but too subtle and feminine to have been part of that boys club .
The genre shares with trip - hop a love of rare samples but is bright and chipper in spirit .
Artists dipped their toes into disco , Latin house , and downtempo but never fully subsumed the seriousness .
The songs are too cartoonish and hyper to play in boutique hotel lobbies .
One clear thread is retro aesthetics — a love for the sounds of the past .
Shibuya - kei was a hyperextension of sampling culture into the pop realm , whether actual stolen loops or simply perfect pastiche layered on top of elements alien to the original songs .
The artists mostly looked to the 1960s but stole nearly anything from the past canon of independent music .
Pizzicato
Five always kept the horns and space - age bachelor pad sweeps but over time moved from house beats to drum ’n’ bass .
Another trait is the obsession with obscurity .
Shibuya - kei artists seemed motivated to make music in order to further distinguish themselves from other music snobs .
They worshipped the deepest cratedigging that never sampled or referenced sogs that could be heard accidentally as standard - issue background music .
They listened to the Mondo Music catalog cover to cover .
Compare them to inferior sub -Shibuya - kei groups in 1990s J - Pop like My Little Lover who took the production techniques but just sampled things we ’ve all heard — Michael Jackson , Electric Light Orchestra , the Beatles .
Shibuya - kei , at its best , took all of its phrases from “ musicians ’ musicians ” and LPs that would have otherwise been forgotten to the ages .
This love of discovery is perhaps the most attractive element of Shibuya - kei at the moment , when so many young creators — bored with the over - information of the Internet Age — no longer find allure in re-serving lost treasures from the past .
So many artists are complacent to go again and again to the same soft - synth preset patches that sound exactly like the year in which we live ( and somehow not that different from a decade ago ) .
The specific sounds of 1990s Shibuya - kei can be thrown away but the genre possesses a potentially timeless methodology .
There is magic born in a ruthless pursuit of rule - breaking beat - swapping , maniacal one - upsmanship .
And this mix , The Best of Shibuya - kei , Volume One attempts to capture that sound .
Note for Trainspotters : I cut up and re-edited most of these tracks , some would say with great violence .
For the song selection , there is a bit of overlap with some of the era ’s best mixes ( e.g. Spinout ) but I prioritized lining up the most representative and highest quality songs rather than worrying that we ’ve heard too much of Montparnasse ’s “ Hugo . ” ( Maybe we have , but there is a reason that song is on so many mixes . )

Startling Comics 49 , 1948
An absolutely classic cover that 's always a favorite with collectors !
This one has it all : A beautiful bound girl , a robot , a spaceman with ray - gun ...
I guess the only thing missing is a tentacled alien .
Without a doubt , this is one of Alex Schomburg 's greatest airbrush covers .
It 's got beautiful composition , color and execution - and I just love the delicate pink mountain range in the background .
I could go on and on , but I wo n't ; just enjoy the artwork !!!
Now here 's a bit of unconfirmed
trivia --
I believe this cover is the
inspiration for Bender the robot
on Matt Groening 's Futurama
cartoon !
Nameless robot
Bender Separated at birth ?
Conclusive evidence !
This image below is from the Futurama episode " Crimes of the Hot " ( 8th episode of the 4th season ) .
The robot is described in the program as being a " primitive bending unit " , and seems to be a clear acknowledgement of the Startling Comics robot 's role in Bender 's creation .
Note the similar forehead rivets , perforated mouthpiece , insulated top antenna , and ear cones .

During the Hutton Inquiry in to the death of David Kelly , millions of British citizens listened to Alistair Campbell , who had so berated the BBC for suggesting the Labour Government had exaggerated the case for war , tell the inquiry that perhaps the Government had used language that helped push the case for war .
They had not as the BBC suggested , sexed up the case for war , they just used language to promote war .
The Hutton Inquiry reported .
Their findings were at one stage one of the biggest of UK political websites .
Lord Hutton had however been set up to fail .
New Labour managed to destroy the reputation of not just Dr. Kelly , but of Lord Hutton as well .
The Government deliberately confused the public about the enquiry .
This was exacerbated by media coverage of key members of Government and Security forces admitting that they may have not been exactly truthful about the War .
The ability of Iraq to attack the UK within 45 minutes was exposed as a lie .
People watched it on tv .
Surely someone was going to be punished .
It was on TV after all .
The misreporting and government spin muddied the waters about the exact nature of the Hutton Inquiry .
Some considered it to be an inquest , some considered it to be an inquiry in to whether the Government has mis-sold the Iraq war .
It was neither of those and thus , when Lord Hutton reported on what was allowed within his remit , whether Government pressure to find the “ mole ” had led to the death of David Kelly , the newspapers condemned the whitewash .
The remit was narrow and simple , to “ urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr Kelly . ”
Hutton reported on his remit .
As a good judge does , there was nothing more , nothing less .
He had no power to go outside of his remit .
Pressure to find the mole did not lead to the suicide of David Kelly , therefore the Government , by ensuring the wrong question was asked was in the clear .
The BBC and Andrew Gilligan in particular had however been in the right .
The Government lied about the Iraq War .
The Prime Minister , Tony Blair sold the war on a lie .
The BBC had however won the battle , but lost the war .
Hutton was The BBC v The Government .
The Government had spun it that way and they had won .
Ever since Hutton the BBC went soft on this Government .
New Labour had after all managed to do something Thatcher never could , intervene in the partiality of the BBC .
New Labour managed to sack a BBC Director General , one whose appointment was controversial in the first place .
Reporters were muzzled .
New Labour would not be given tough interviews .
Even Paxman was muzzled .
After Blair left office , this has changed , but this change has taken years .
In those intervening years , British and American Soldiers killed tens of thousands of Iraqis , for a war that even today , seems to have been without purpose .
We do however know Bush and Blair prayed for it .
Literally .
We know that a secular nation , with a lunatic Leader , who was unable to pose any real threat , became a nation run by uber religious war lords that we bribe to keep the peace .
Many of these warlords more loyal to the fraudulent Government of Iran than this new Iraq .
We will get an Iraq inquiry .
It will not cover the political consequences of that war , which will hurt Anglo - American Foreign Relations for years .
We still do not know why David Kelly died .
We do know the knife story was a lie .
There were no fingerprints on the knife .
He could not have cut himself with it .
Neither the drugs that were found in his body or the cut to his wrist were enough to kill him .
There was very little blood found at the scene .
There are lots of reports about how angry he was about his treatment by a Labour MP .
No one thought he was suicidal .
The family of Dr. Kelly wish that this issue was laid to rest .
The widow has expressed her pain and anguish about his death , hoping that a good man can simply rest in peace .
For that she has accepted the official report of suicide .
An American programme may however shed new light on this .
US television investigators have spent four years preparing a 90 - minute documentary , Anthrax War , suggesting there is a global black market in anthrax and exposing the mystery “ suicides ” of five government germ warfare scientists from around the world .
Director Bob Coen said :
‘‘ The deeper you look into the murky world of governments and germ warfare , the more worrying it becomes .
“ We have proved there is a black ­market in anthrax .
David Kelly was of particular interest to us because he was a world expert on anthrax and he was involved in some degree with assisting the secret germ warfare programme in apartheid South Africa . ”
In addition , to add to the misery for the Labour Party , 13 Doctors are now demanding a full inquest .
They have absolutely rejected that he could have died through the method he was supposed to have taken to commit suicide .
Given his scientific background , Dr Kelly would also have had access to far better , cleaner chemicals to ensure an efficient suicide .
Tony Blair is reported to feel vulnerable to the accusation that he has the blood of Dr David Kelly on his hands .
It would be added to the blood of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
It is not likely that Tony Blair personally arranged for the death of Dr David Kelly .
Norman Baker , a Liberal Democrat MP has suggested the possibility of Iraqi opponents to Sadam Hussein , who had everything to gain from the invasion .
I appreciate the wishes of the family in this case , but the death of Dr Kelly meant the death of BBC impartiality and thousands upon thousands of Iraqis .
What happened on Harrowdown Hill had consequences that we all now grieve over .
Many British reporters have directly accused Tony Blair of having the blood of Dr David Kelly on his hands .
His culpability rests on three points .
If this was a Security Services assassination , he would have had to approve it .
If it was suicide , his Government pushed him in to it .
If as Norman Baker suggests , it was Iraqi opposition that murdered him , again by exposing him Blair was culpable .
There are far too many suspicious elements about this case .
The British people need a full inquest .
Specialist garda units are to be deployed against so - called hole - in - the - wall raiders where crime gangs use diggers to steal entire cash machines , it was revealed today .
Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy met senior officers in Dublin after a spate of similar robberies in the last few weeks taking the total to seven in the last nine months .
Assistant Commissioner Derek Byrne will lead operations to catch gangs involved in the daring raids using powers and resources under the anti-gangland Operation Anvil .
“ Regional resources and specialist unit personnel will be deployed using Operation Anvil funding where appropriate , ” Mr Murphy said .
“ An Garda Siochána would strongly appeal to owners of heavy plant machinery to review their security arrangements in order to ensure their equipment is not used in these crimes .
“ As many of these robberies take place in the early hours of the morning , I am also appealing to members of the community to immediately report any unusual activity to gardai . ”
It is believed one gang has adopted the method , using a digger to tear down walls and pull out an ATM .
The entire machine is then carted off and emptied .
But there have been a spate of similar raids across the country sparking fears that other gangs have copied their style .
The most recent attempt occurred at an Ulster Bank on Main Street , Athboy , Co Meath at the weekend .
Thieves pulled the ATM out of the wall using a digger but detectives suspect the gang was disturbed and fled the scene leaving the machine behind .
The five - man gang had moved a 4X4 vehicle with a trailer into place outside the bank .
However , when their efforts to rip the ATM from the wall failed the men abandoned the robbery attempt .
They then ran from the scene and are believed to have left the area in a VW Golf .
Last Friday morning , a digger was used to take an ATM from the wall at a service station on Enniscorthy , Co Wexford .
Last Saturday week a gang in Co Monaghan used a digger in a failed attempt to steal a cash machine from a bank .
Last month in Co Kildare a digger ripped a cash machine from the wall of a Mother Hubbard ’s restaurant in Moyvalley on the N4 .
Fine Gael spokesman on justice Charlie Flanagan said gardaí needed " intelligence - led " policing and further resources to tackle ATM raiders .
“ A secure digital radio network for gardaí is vital .
The current analogue system can easily be tuned into by criminals and this grossly undermines garda activity .
Criminals should not be in a position to anticipate garda movements , " he said .
" Ultimately , the longer term solution must include community gardaí on the beat and with access to the latest technologies . "

One of my fundamental realizations in life is that popular media in the 20th and 21st century is no better at conveying information than the “ yellow journalism ” of the Robber Baron era .
A corollary to this is that most popular science “ experts ” are clowns .
I realized this almost immediately in physics , as I had the good fortune to meet a couple of the charlatans I admired as a youth .
It would be incredibly solipsistic of me to assume that this was only true in physics , but that is in fact what I assumed .
Until I gained enough expertise in other fields to see through the impostures .
The most popular pop-writer in quantitative finance at present is Nassim Taleb .
His latest screed in the Financial Times is what spurred me to write this post .
The article was n’t entirely written by Taleb - though I guess the other guy is his fund partner , so it is no surprise that it suffers from all the mush headed absurdity of Taleb ’s other articles and books .
I wo n’t pick on the other guy ; or even mention his name : he ’s got a job to do , and he has the good manners to not make himself a public figure .
Taleb , on the other hand , is sort of the Paul Feyerabend of quantitative finance .
Like Feyerabend , he is well read , a good writer and quite charming .
Like Feyerabend , Taleb seems to earn his daily bread by showing up and being kind of witty .
Finally , both Feyerabend and Taleb are very much Against Method .
This means , effectively , they ’re both intellectual nihilists .
Feyerabend thought we could n’t know anything for various reasons too silly to get into right now .
Taleb thinks all of quantitative finance is nonsense and we should do away with quants .
I am guessing the former ’s delusions had something to do with drinking the same Berkeley tapwater in the 1960s which made everyone else believe in crazy things , but Taleb was a trader , and it ’s a common prejudice of traders to dislike quants for cutting into their P/L .
A lot of what Taleb says is kind of sensible , and even obvious .
Many models used in quantitative finance are bad models .
Virtually all models used in quantitative finance are nowhere near as statistically sound as , say , models in physics , or even models in a subject as squishy as psychometry .
That is no reason to discard the idea of models , yet it seems to be something Taleb repeatedly suggests .
If you ca n’t be bothered to register for Taleb ’s FT diatribe , I will regale you with a few choice quotes .
It ’s a disjointed and bizarre screed , though at least he nails “ excessive debt ” as the root of the present crisis - this is correct and has plenty of historical precedent .
But then , as Taleb generally does , he takes a fairly reasonable statement and uses it as an excuse to careen off into cloud cuckoo land :
Taleb : “ … homeowners and others have been recklessly amassing debt .
Such non-linearity makes the mathematics used by economists rather useless .
Our research shows that economic papers that rely on mathematics are not scientifically valid .
Not only do they underestimate the possibility of “ black swans ” but they are unaware that we do not have any ability to deal with the mathematics of extreme events .. ”
Um , where did the nonlinearity come from ?
I ’m assuming from a bad editing job .
The larger issue is rather more alarming : one rather wonders if he used mathematics in his research on the scientific validity of these “ economics papers that rely on mathematics . ”
I agree that many economics papers are silly .
Since economic papers often involve math , his reasoning seems to be something along the lines of “ we must do away with mathematics and instead base economic policy on chicken entrails and pixie dust . ”
It seems to me , sticking some well motivated error bars on economic models is going to get you farther than the chicken entrails approach .
Sure , a lot of it will end up as chicken entrails anyway , but it seems utile to use models as a sort of starting point for understanding the world rather than , you know , actual chicken entrails .
You can argue about the validity of a mathematical model - if you ’re just using chicken guts , there is little hope .
Perhaps a more reasonable approach to doing away with bad economics papers would be to insist all economics papers be written in High Church Latin , since most of the bad ones are presently written in English .
Restricting economics papers to people who are familiar with the classics would filter out a lot of shallow thinkers .
While I ca n’t prove this is a more “ scientific ” approach by Taleb ’s lights , I ’m pretty sure “ write economics papers in Latin ” is going have a lot more win than “ no more math for economists . ”
If nothing else , latin means less people will read them , which ought to cure some of Taleb ’s dyspepsia .
Later , Taleb , presumably unencumbered with any troublesome mathematical thought , informs us he has come up with a solution to the economic crisis :
Taleb :
“ The only solution is to transform debt into equity across all sectors , in an organised and systematic way .
Instead of sending hate mail to near - insolvent homeowners , banks should reach out to borrowers and offer lower interest payments in exchange for equity . ”
By jingo , that ’s it !
We ’ll just transform the debt to equity !
Hey , wait a minute … what exactly is this “ equity ” of which Taleb speaks ?
In return for lowering interest rates on insolvent home owners … the banks get “ equity … ” in the form of what ?
A warrant on the front porch ?
So in 30 years , when the loan is payed off , Bank of America can open a branch office on your porch ?
Or do you have to go pay off the warrant too ?
In the latter case - dude , you ’re just making the loan term longer : why not just make the term longer ?
In that case , why not let t-> infinity on everyone ’s loans and just pay rent to the bank ?
We ’ll all be rich !
Or serfs , depending on how you look at things .
Since Taleb and friend never tell us what kind of equity they ’re talking about , it is rather difficult to assess this proposal .
I guess since they never bothered doing so , we can just assume they are merely waving words around .
I fear for America should anyone attempt to implement a solution which is based on waving words around .
Oh , wait a minute … too late !
Mountebanks like Taleb sell their wares by making the regular jamoke reading his books and essays feel fiendishly intelligent for understanding the concept of fat tails at the expense of all those pointy headed Ph.D. ’s in the back room with their slide rules and white laboratory jackets .
I think there would be a lot of social equity in doing this , except , the dudes in the white laboratory jackets are well aware of those fat tails .
As such , Taleb is merely setting himself up as some sort of heretical alpha monkey of the quants for stating the obvious , the misleading , and occasionally the gratuitously wrong - headed and untrue .
One of the annoying things about all this , is his fame has given him access to vast amounts of capital … capital which would be better off invested in T - bills .
His strategy of betting on the fat tails has a miniscule Sharpe ratio , though it is hard to tell how bad , as his returns do n’t get published in the IASG .
Sure , his strat looks like genius during the occasional downturn , but the rest of the time ( which is most of the time ! ) he looks like a plain old bear in a bull market .
There are far more successful and long lived funds , as I have already pointed out which trade the inverse of the Taleb “ swan strategy ” at very high Sharpe ratios .
They even win in “ black swan ” events if they manage their money correctly .
Taleb ’s strat will only strike paydirt when the poop hits the prop .
The poop does n’t hit the prop very often , almost by definition , no matter what kind of fat tail your black duck has .
So why do people listen to this guy ?
Part of it is doubtless the “ famous for being famous ” effect .
Taleb is witty and clever , and ruthlessly promoted himself as a public figure after his trading days were over .
Not a bad strat for success in the modern media culture : grab the megaphone and declare yourself a genius .
Everyone wants to think they ’re more of a mental bigshot than the eggheads who run things .
Plus , it ’s not like Jim Simons has time to write Financial Times articles .
He ’s too busy making money more or less proving people like Taleb wrong .

The world 's first human trials of a swine flu vaccine have begun in Australia , drug company officials said today , as the global death toll from the virus rose to 700 .
Two biotechnology companies have started injecting adult volunteers in the southern city of Adelaide .
CSL , a Melbourne company , has 240 people in its seven - month trial starting today .
Vaxine , from Adelaide , began trials on Monday with 300 people .
At least 41 people have died in swine flu - related illness in Australia , now well into its winter flu season .
" We 're in the southern hemisphere , and that is where the problem is right now , " Vaxine 's research director , Nikolai Petrovsky , said .
" The demand was here yesterday .
We 're right in the middle of a surge of swine flu cases where perhaps the US wo n't have to worry about it as much until their flu season hits , in six months . "
Australia had confirmed 14,703 cases of swine flu , while the number of deaths from the virus globally is more than 700 , according to the World Health Organisation , which recently stopped counting the number of cases worldwide .
A surge in cases is predicted in September and October , when students and workers in the northern hemisphere return from summer vacation .
The Australian government has already ordered 21 m doses of CSL 's vaccine for use in Australia , should it be proved to work .
" We have a specific vaccine that we believe will be able to protect millions of people against this new H1N1 flu , " Andrew Cuthbertson , CSL 's director of research and development , told reporters .
He called swine flu " a novel strain of influenza " , and said the trial would determine the dose and schedule of the vaccination .
Petrovsky said it would be six to eight weeks before results would verify whether a vaccine was effective .
" There is no guarantee any of these vaccines will work , " he said .
" Swine flu is a very peculiar beast .
It is a very different virus that we 're dealing with .
But we are hopeful . "
Medical experts warned against rushing the vaccines through trials .
" I think it 's important for the public to know that they 're going to get a safe and effective vaccine , " Andrew Pesce , president of the Australian Medical Association , told Sky News television .
" No one will give anybody brownie points for putting out a vaccine that did n't work or caused harm . "
In Britain , the UK's health protection agency ( HPA ) estimates there were 55,000 new cases of swine flu in England the week before last , including people visiting GPs and those who are looking after themselves at home .
The British pharmaceutical giant , GlaxoSmithKline , said in May it had agreed to supply nearly 130 m doses of the swine flu vaccine to the UK , France , Belgium and Finland .
It also said it would donate 50 m doses to developing countries .
The vaccine is expected to come before the end of the year .
Glaxo is one of several companies charged with producing a vaccine for H1N1 after the outbreak of the virus was declared a pandemic last month .
Avery was laughing as she blocked the ambulance , the court heard A judge told a driver she displayed " moronic stupidity " by deliberately and repeatedly blocking an ambulance which was carrying a dying patient .
Annika Avery , 20 , of Leicester , was given a five - month prison sentence , suspended for two years .
She had already admitted dangerous driving .
The court was told that Avery overtook the ambulance at speed and slowed down , causing the vehicle to brake suddenly .
She did this even though the siren was on , Leicester Crown Court heard .
Avery , of Tatlow Road , Glenfield , was said to be under stress at the time of the incident in July 2008 , although no other reason was given for her behaviour .
Obscene gestures
In the back of the ambulance a paramedic was giving heart compressions to an elderly patient .
Such was the force of the braking that the paramedic was flung the length of the vehicle , the court heard .
The driver of the ambulance said at one stage Avery pulled alongside him and she was travelling at 60 mph ( 96 km / h ) in a 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) area .
People who commit this type of crime must think of the consequences
Nick Arnold from East Midlands Ambulance Service
The paramedic said he looked across and saw Avery and a male passenger laughing and making obscene gestures .
Judge Howard Morrison called Avery 's driving " disgusting and dangerous " .
The patient in the ambulance died and the judge said if Avery 's driving had played any part in that death , she would have been facing a very different sentence .
He added that ambulance crews did a difficult job , telling Avery : " Your moronic and anti-social behaviour is exactly what they cannot tolerate . "
Speaking after Friday 's sentencing hearing , Nick Arnold from East Midlands Ambulance Service said : " We are deeply disturbed at the actions this woman took .
" She purposely obstructed our ambulance which was clearly dealing with an emergency .
" People who commit this type of crime must think of the consequences - one day because of the mindless actions of someone else they , or their loved one , might not get the urgent medical care they need . "

There are several ways to consider the composition of the human body , including the elements , type of molecule , or type of cells .
Most of the human body is made up of water , H 2 O , with bone cells being comprised of 31 % water and the lungs 83 % .﻿﻿
Therefore , it is n't surprising that most of a human body 's mass is oxygen .
Carbon , the basic unit for organic molecules , comes in second .
96.2 % of the mass of the human body is made up of just four elements : oxygen , carbon , hydrogen , and nitrogen .
Oxygen ( O ) - 65 % - Oxygen together with hydrogen form water , which is the primary solvent found in the body and is used to regulate temperature and osmotic pressure .
Oxygen is found in many key organic compounds .
Carbon ( C ) - 18.5 % - Carbon has four bonding sites for other atoms , which makes it the key atom for organic chemistry .
Carbon chains are used to build carbohydrates , fats , nucleic acids , and proteins .
Breaking bonds with carbon is an energy source .
Hydrogen ( H ) - 9.5 % - Hydrogen is found in water and in all organic molecules .
Nitrogen ( N ) - 3.2 % - Nitrogen is found in proteins and in the nucleic acids that make up the genetic code .
Calcium ( Ca ) - 1.5 % - Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body .
It 's used as a structural material in bones , but it is essential for protein regulation and muscle contraction .
Phosphorus ( P ) - 1.0 % - Phosphorus is found in the molecule ATP , which is the primary energy carrier in cells .
It 's also found in bone .
Potassium ( K ) - 0.4 % - Potassium is an important electrolyte .
It 's used to transmit nerve impulses and heartbeat regulation .
Sodium ( Na ) - 0.2 % - Sodium is an important electrolyte .
Like potassium , it is used for nerve signaling .
Sodium is one of the electrolytes that helps regulate the amount of water in the body .
Chlorine ( Cl ) - 0.2 % - Chlorine is an important negatively - charged ion ( anion ) used to maintain fluid balance .
Magnesium ( Mg ) - 0.1 % - Magnesium is involved in over 300 metabolic reactions .
It 's used to build the structure of muscles and bones and is an important cofactor in enzymatic reactions .
Sulfur ( S ) - 0.04 % - Two amino acids include sulfur .
The bonds sulfur forms help give proteins the shape they need to perform their functions .
﻿ ﻿
Many other elements may be found in extremely small quantities ( less than 0.01 % ) .
For example , the human body often contains trace amounts of thorium , uranium , samarium , tungsten , beryllium , and radium .
Trace elements considered essential in humans include zinc , selenium , nickel , chromium , manganese , cobalt , and lead .
Not all of the elements found within the body are essential for life .
Some are considered contaminants that appear to do no harm but serve no known function .
Examples include cesium and titanium .
Others are actively toxic , including mercury , cadmium , and radioactive elements .
Arsenic is considered to be toxic to humans , but serves a function in other mammals ( goats , rats , hamsters ) in trace amounts .
Aluminum is interesting because it is the third most common element in the Earth 's crust , but its role in the human body is unknown .
While fluorine is used by plants to produce protective toxins and has " apparent beneficial intake " in humans .
You may also wish to view the elemental composition of an average human body by mass .

Criminal enterprises and botnet authors are mimicking the IT sector by working together and creating new business models such as botnets as a service ' .
The Cisco Midyear Security Report said that it was a spin on the SaaS ( Software as a Service ) trend , which was gaining more popularity in the technology sector .
The criminals ' increasing business acumen was highlighted with the way the creators of the Conficker and Waledac botnets collaborated .
In April , the Conficker botnet started to make money by delivering the Waledac malware as well as scareware , which meant that Conficker was serving as a large - scale distributor .
Cisco highlighted the networked nature of the threat , as the two illegal enterprises collaborated to launch from the same hosts over a long period of time , causing greater damage .
Tom Gillis , vice president and general manager of Cisco Security Products , said in the report that criminals were copying the practices of the most successful legitimate businesses to make money and grow .
He said : " It seems the best practices espoused by Fortune magazine and Harvard Business School have found their way into the online underworld . "
The report also said that Cisco security experts expected cybercriminals to join up in similar partnerships in the coming months .
Indeed , they 'd already seen ads online where other criminals could access existing botnets for a fee .
New Zealand has signed a Tax Information Exchange Agreement with Guernsey -- one of the Channel Islands off Britain , known as a tax haven .
Revenue Minister Peter Dunne signed the agreement in London overnight New Zealand time with Guernsey , a British crown dependency .
" The Tax Information Exchange Agreement with Guernsey will help to encourage greater co-operation between tax authorities , " Mr Dunne said .
Tax Information Agreements are bilateral international treaties that set up a way for tax authorities to request tax records , business books and accounts , bank information , ownership information , and other tax - related information from each other for purposes of preventing tax avoidance and evasion .
Growing numbers of agreements were being made as countries adopted Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) and United Nations standards for exchange of tax - related information , Mr Dunne said .
This month an agreement was signed with the Cook Islands .
That country was previously on an OECD blacklist of uncooperative tax havens but was removed after pledging to improve its tax and regulatory systems .

If NBC Sports can’t carry Wimbledon matches live , especially crucial ones , it should n’t carry Wimbledon at all .
The network ’s tape - delay dance  and its excuses  have grown tired .
Here ’s what happened Wednesday : at 8 a.m. Eastern , ESPN2 started showing the Tommy Haas - Novak Djokovic match live (! ) until early in the third set .
But the network had to leave at 10 a.m. , when NBC ’s exclusive three - hour window kicked in .
That was NBC ’s cue to go to the videotape of Roger Federer ’s straight - sets victory over Ivo Karlovic  on an unnerving two - hour delay .
Then , as if diced - and - sliced tennis were how its surveys found that fans preferred to watch Grand Slam events , NBC showed the rest of the Haas - Djokovic match on what was a four - to five - hour delay .
Oy !
NBC might have been following tennis history by choosing  with first dibs over ESPN2  Federer for its time slot .
But Federer on videotape ?
He ’s trying for a record 15th Grand Slam singles title and his quarterfinal match is on tape ?
This is how screwy it gets when two networks and their broadband services share an event : NBC did n’t stream the match live because its broadband window started at 10 a.m. , and ESPN360.com could n’t stream it because it was protected for when NBC wanted to show it on TV .
Oh boy :
On January 28 , Rep. Randy Forbes ( R - VA ) , founder of the Congressional Prayer Caucus , introduced H. Con. Res. 34 , a resolution " Calling upon the Capitol Preservation Commission and the Office of the Architect of the Capitol to place the Lincoln - Obama Bible on permanent display upon the Lincoln table at the Capitol Visitor Center for the benefit of all its visitors to fully understand and appreciate America 's history and Godly heritage . "
Now , I have no objection whatsoever to this Bible being displayed in the Capitol Visitors Center .
It is an historical fact that this was the Bible that Abraham Lincoln used at his second inauguration , and an historical fact that Barack Obama chose to use this same Bible at his inauguration , so displaying it on the table used to hold it at Lincoln 's inauguration , which is already in the exhibit , and adding a sign saying that Obama also used it , is absolutely appropriate .
I do n't think anyone could reasonably disagree that the symbolism of our first black president incorporating in his inauguration this connection to the president who freed the slaves is something that should be seen by future generations visiting the Capitol , and putting the Bible on the table used to hold it at Lincoln 's inauguration would add to the accuracy of the exhibit 's recreation of that event .
What I do object to in H. Con. Res. 34 are some of the reasons given by Forbes for displaying the Bible , in both the resolution 's title and its " Whereas " clauses , the most objectionable of which is : " Whereas the Holy Bible is God 's Word "
This is nothing but a sneaky way of getting the Congress of the United States to declare that the Christian Bible is the word of God , which , of course , for many Americans , it is not .
This " Whereas " should be struck from the resolution entirely .
That whole " Separation of Church and State " clause really is soooo hard to grasp , is n't it ?
Rodda has since introduced HR 397 affirming our " rich spiritual and religious history " and designating the first week of May as " America ’s Spiritual Heritage Week " .
He also issued a challenge to Obama or any takers to debate when we stopped being a Judeo - Christian nation :
" I challenge the president or anyone else -- come up , either debate me on this issue or simply tell me where that single moment in time was when you can say we crossed the threshold -- we ceased being a Judeo - Christian nation -- and you can't do it . "
Oh ye of too much faith and too little information .
Your challenge has been accepted by Chris Rodda of Talk To Action and she 's ready to rumble :
Mr. Forbes , just name the time and place -- your turf , my turf ( up here in NJ - 6 ) , DC , or anywhere else -- and let 's debate your resolution clause by clause and see how well that very impressive looking list of footnotes you keep boasting about stands up to scrutiny .
I 'll be sending a registered , return receipt letter to Mr. Forbes 's office formally accepting his challenge to make sure he knows that I , as an " anyone else , " have stepped up to accept it .
For those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Forbes 's " spiritual heritage " resolution , it 's a re-introduction of H. Res. 888 , the " religious heritage " resolution he introduced in the last congress .
In a series of pieces last year , I debunked the dozens of instances of historical fiction in that resolution , and thanks to the efforts of a few organizations and a whole bunch of bloggers who joined in the fight , H. Res. 888 never made it to the floor .
But , a few months ago , outraged over President Obama 's statement in Turkey that America is not a Christian nation , Mr. Forbes reintroduced the same resolution as H. Res. 397 .
It currently has 74 co-sponsors .
I recently re-posted my debunking of H. Res. 888 , as soon as I saw that Mr. Forbes had re-introduced it as H. Res. 397 , so , if anyone wants more details about the resolution , or to see why I 'm thrilled that he has issued a challenge for someone to debate him on it , you can find it here .
You can contact Forbes here to encourage him to schedule the debate .
Better yet , let 's get it up on video and we 'll be happy to air it here .

Harry Patch fought at the Battle of Passchendaele in World War I The last British survivor of the World War I trenches , Harry Patch , has died at the age of 111 .
Mr Patch was conscripted into the Army aged 18 and fought in the Battle of Passchendaele at Ypres in 1917 in which more than 70,000 British soldiers died .
He was raised in Combe Down , near Bath , and had been living at a care home in Wells , Somerset .
The sole British survivor of the war is former seaman Claude Choules , who is aged 108 and lives in Perth , Australia .
' Great man '
Mr Choules , who is originally from Worcestershire , saw service with the Royal Navy .
Henry Allingham , who served in the navy and the RAF in WWI , died at the age of 113 a week ago .
The Queen said she was " saddened " to hear of Mr Patch 's death .

" We will never forget the bravery and enormous sacrifice of his generation , which will continue to serve as an example to us all . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " I had the honour of meeting Harry , and I share his family 's grief at the passing of a great man .
" I know that the whole nation will unite today to honour the memory , and to take pride in the generation that fought the Great War .
The noblest of all the generations has left us , but they will never be forgotten . "
A national memorial service should be held as " a special commemoration " of the efforts of Mr Patch and " a generation of people " who fought in World War I , Mr Brown added .
' Remained loyal '
The Prince of Wales said nothing could give him greater pride than paying tribute to Mr Patch .
He told the BBC : " Harry was involved in numerous bouts of heavy fighting on the front line but amazingly remained unscathed for a while .
SURVIVING WWI VETERANS John Babcock , who turned 109 on 23 July , was with Canada 's Boys Battalion in England but the war ended before he turned 18 and could go to the front Frank Buckles , 108 , joined the American army aged just 16 and was held in reserve in England from December 1917 .
After six months he was sent to France but never saw action on the frontline Claude Choules , 108 , served with the Royal Navy during World War I .
Originally from Worcestershire , he now lives in Perth , Australia " Tragically one night in September 1917 when in the morass in the Ypres Salient a German shrapnel shell burst overhead badly wounding Harry and killing three of his closest friends .
" In spite of the comparatively short time that he served with the Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry , Harry always cherished the extraordinary camaraderie that the appalling conditions engendered in the battalion and remained loyal to the end . "
Chief of the General Staff , General Sir Richard Dannatt , said : " He was the last of a generation that in youth was steadfast in its duty in the face of cruel sacrifice and we give thanks for his life - as well as those of his comrades - for upholding the same values and freedom that we continue to cherish and fight for today . "
Conservative leader David Cameron said : " The passing of our last surviving WWI soldier marks the end of an era and is a reminder of the huge debt of gratitude we owe Harry and those he served alongside . "
' Last of generation ' Mr Patch was born on 17 June 1898 and left school at the age of 15 to train as a plumber .
He was a machine - gunner in the trenches and served as a private from June to September 1917 .

Mr Patch was at the time of his death the oldest man in Europe and the third oldest man in the world , according to the Ministry of Defence .
He was married twice , first in 1919 in Hadley , Shropshire , to Ada which lasted 60 years , and then to Jean when he was 81 .
He had two sons with Ada , Dennis and Roy , both of whom he outlived .
From 2003 he had a third partner , Doris , who lived in the same retirement home and died two years ago .
HAVE YOUR SAY
He will symbolise the thousands of lives lost in Britain alone during World War I Martin Harrison , Coventry His biographer Richard Van Emden said Mr Patch " had a sparkle about him " and was " one of the most rewarding people to be with " .
" He was the last of that generation and the poignancy of that is almost overwhelming .
He remembered all of those who died and suffered and every time he was honoured he knew it was for all of those who fought , " he said .
' True gentleman ' Mr Patch 's friend Lesley Ross said she felt great affection towards him .
BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE
The battle lasted from 31 July to 6 November 1917 An initial bombardment of German positions involved 4.5 m shells and 3,000 guns
The battle was infamous for the mud - shelling had churned clay soil and smashed drains
The heaviest rain for 30 years made the mud so deep that men and horses drowned
The battle ended when British and Canadian forces captured Passchendaele
The village was barely five miles beyond the starting point of the offensive
There were a total of 325,000 Allied and 260,000 German casualties " Extremely modest , dignified gentleman , with a slightly wicked sense of humour and considerate to everybody he met .
Very polite and I would sum him up as a true gentleman , " she said .
The Ministry of Defence said there would be a funeral cortege through Wells followed by a service at Wells Cathedral .
The Fletcher House care home said in a statement it extended its deepest sympathies to Mr Patch 's family and friends .
Andrew Larpent , chief executive of Somerset Care , said Mr Patch died peacefully in his bed having been unwell for some time .
" His friends and his family have been here .
He just quietly slipped away at 9 am this morning , " he said .
" It was how he would have wanted it , without having to be moved to hospitals but here , peacefully with his friends and carers . "

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Active compounds in green tea may slow down the progression of prostate cancer , researchers reported on Friday .
A woman pours hot water to make green tea at a traditional tea house in Boseong , about 397 km ( 246 miles ) south of Seoul , September 23 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Han Jae-Ho
Capsules made using green tea extracts called polyphenols lowered levels of proteins that tumors use to grow , the researchers found .
Made by Polyphenon Pharma , the capsules called Polyphenon E contain epigallocatechin gallate or EGCG , a green tea extract that has antioxidant properties .
Jim Cardelli of Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in Shreveport and colleagues tested 26 prostate cancer patients , aged from 41 to 68 .
Each took four Polyphenon E capsules a day -- equivalent to drinking 12 cups of green tea -- for about a month before they had their prostates removed .
Blood tests showed levels of three proteins associated with the growth and spread of prostate cancer fell .
Hepatocyte growth factor or HGF fell 18.9 percent on average , vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF fell by 9.9 percent and prostate specific antigen PSA fell by 10.4 percent , they reported in the journal Cancer Prevention Research .
HGF and VEGF are produced when tumors spread and some patients showed “ significant ” reduction levels of more than 30 percent , Cardelli said .
Few side effects were reported and liver function of the patients remained normal .
“ It ’s still in an early stage .
Green tea can keep cancer from growing very fast , but it may not be able to shrink tumors , ” Cardelli said in a telephone interview .
“ But it can be a good addition to traditional therapies , like chemo ( chemotherapy ) or radiation . ”
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men .
The American Cancer Society projects prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 192,280 men and will kill 27,360 in 2009 .
The test in 26 prostate cancer patients was a small trial and bigger studies would be needed to confirm the results .

The Mousavi camp wants the vote annulled over alleged fraud Iran 's powerful Guardian Council is due to give its verdict on the result of the disputed presidential election , two weeks after the poll was held .
Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi has refused to support the electoral authority 's plan for a partial recount .
Mr Mousavi wants a re-run of the vote , but said on Saturday that he would accept a review by an independent body .
However the Guardian Council has already backed President Ahmadinejad 's re-election as a fair result .
On Friday it said the presidential election was the " healthiest " held since the Iranian revolution in 1979 .
Some 17 people are thought to have died in street protests in the past two weeks , and Tehran has imposed severe restrictions on journalists , blogs and other media .
Major fracture Although President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was almost invisible when Tehran 's streets were full of demonstrators , he is now out in public sounding very confident , says the BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Tehran .

He has blamed foreigners for inciting violence in Tehran , and on Saturday lectured US President Barack Obama for denouncing as " outrageous " the violence used to suppress protests .
Behind President Ahmadinejad stands the Revolutionary Guard , whose regular forces and Basij militia have regained control of the streets for him , our correspondent says .
Human Rights Watch , a New York - based pressure group , has accused the militia of carrying out " brutal " night - time raids , destroying property in private homes and beating civilians .
The group said the raids were an attempt to stop the nightly chants against the government that resonate from the rooftops and balconies of Tehran in recent days .
It also said satellite dishes were being confiscated to stop people from watching foreign news .
Although everyday life is returning to the capital , the election has opened up a major fracture in the elite that may not heal , according to the BBC's Jeremy Bowen .

Chefs searching for an authentic medieval way to cook a porpoise can now look up the recipe online .
The Forme of Cury , compiled by master cooks to Richard II , is part of a collection of medieval texts held by the John Rylands Library , Manchester .
Now an edition of the cookbook dating from the early 15th Century , compiled in about 1420 , has been digitalised and uploaded to the library 's website .
John Hodgson , keeper of manuscripts , said it contained hundreds of recipes .
Among them are exotic dishes featuring porpoise and more recognisable names like blancmange .
Mr Hodgson said the latter was different to the modern interpretation - a rice dish , highly spiced and sugared .
It 's very much suck it and see , but great for experimenting
John Hodgson , keeper of manuscripts
Such ingredients were extremely expensive and beyond the income of most ordinary people during Richard II 's reign .
The recipe begins " For to make blanc mange " and goes on to say " put rice in water all night and in the morrow , wash it clean " .
" It 's not a like a modern cookery book so it does n't give you exact quantities and times , " said Mr Hodgson .
" It 's very much suck it and see , but great for experimenting .
" The complete book - all 100 pages - is now available online so that anybody who is interested in cookery , well , you could actually make some of the recipes now . "
The original manuscripts which make up the Forme of Cury are thought to date back to 1390 .
Researchers have more evidence that takes aim at the old stereotype that boys are better at math than girls .
Psychologist Janet Hyde had previously studied scores on standardized math tests in the United States , and found no difference in performance between girls and boys .
Her new study expands the scope of the work by analyzing international data .
She and her colleague
analyzed studies from around the world on math performance along with gender inequality as measured by the World Economic Forum 's Gender Gap Index .
This index measures the gap between men and women in economic opportunity , educational attainment and other socioeconomic factors [ LiveScience ] .
They found that countries with poor gender equality , like India , had a larger gender gap in math , while in countries with excellent gender equality , like the Netherlands , girls performed as well as boys .
If males really did have an innate advantage in math , the researchers note , that advantage should be obvious throughout all these cultures .
Instead , the study suggests that cultural issues are the basis of the math gender gap .
The study , published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , also tackled a more subtle stereotype :
Even if girls and boys perform equally well in math on average , is it true that more math geniuses are male ?
That was the idea expressed by then - Harvard president Larry Summers in 2005 when he raised an uproar by talking about males ' " intrinsic aptitude " for math .
The researchers looked for evidence of such an imbalance , but found that in countries with the greatest gender equality , as many girls as boys scored above the 99th percentile -- and in a few countries , there were more girls in that elite rank than boys .
The
" scarcity of top - scoring females in many , but not all countries .. . must be largely due to changeable sociocultural factors , ” the scientists write , “ not immutable , innate biological differences between the sexes . ”
If the differences were innate , they should show up in every culture [ Newsweek ] .
To erase the last remnants of the math gender gap , the researchers say that adults should tell all girls that they can excel at math , and should nurture girls who are especially gifted in the subject .
Says Hyde :
" There 's a gender stereotype that boys are better at math than girls are , and stereotypes die very hard ....
Teachers and parents still believe that boys are better at math than girls are " [ LiveScience ] .

A campaign in Greece to raise money to rebuild a Chrisian Palestinian hospital in Gaza allegedly destroyed by Israel appears to be a scam , JTA has learned .
The hospital that was the focus of a campaign , which included the participation of Greece ’s president and foreign minister , never actually existed .
For nearly a week in February , Greece ’s official state television network inundated viewers with news about a telethon that would take place Feb.
9 to raise money to “ rebuild the Christian hospital in Gaza that Israelis destroyed with their bombs ” during the Israeli army ’s operation there in January .
In its announcements , the network made clear that it was referring to a specific Christian hospital destroyed by Israel .
The telethon included recorded video messages by Greek President Carolos Papoulias and Foreign Minister Dora Bakoyianni , along with a parade of Greek politicians , singers , public personalities and trade unionists .
Many used the telethon to cast broadsides at Israel .
The campaign raised $ 1.67 million , according to telethon organizers , who said little Greek children had gone so far as to break their piggy banks to offer $ 14 to Palestinians in need .
A JTA investigation revealed , however , that no Christian hospital was on the list assembled by the United Nations and the Red Crescent Society of structures in Gaza damaged and destroyed as a consequence of the Israel - Hamas war in January .
JTA spoke to two Palestinians living in Gaza who are active in or former members of nongovernmental organizations there , both of whom looked into the issue independently .
Both reported that the only Christian hospital in Gaza , Al Ahli , was used during the war and did not receive a scratch .
Al Ahli , which was started by the Church of England , is owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem , a diocese of the Anglican Communion .
Outside the city there is also small medical center supported in part by the Near East Council of Churches that was destroyed during the war .
One of the Palestinians demanded to know where the money from the Greek telethon went .
Asked who decided that the telethon money should go to a hospital that turned out to be fictitious , the president of ERT / NET , the TV station that broadcast the program , Vangelis Panagopoulos , told JTA that “ ERT does not organize these things but simply provides the time slot .
The event was organized by the General Confederation of Greek Workers ” – Greece ’s main trade union organization – “ and the Foreign Ministry . ”
Reached by JTA , a spokesman for the General Confederation of Greek Workers said , “ Ask the Greek Foreign Ministry and [ Foreign Minister ] Bakoyianni – they know . ”
During the telethon , the union of engineers in Greece , known as TEE , announced that it would rebuild the hospital for free .
Yet in a phone conversation with JTA , TEE said it participated in the telethon under the impression that if there were a project to build , the union would build it .
No “ Christian hospital ” was mentioned , the union said .
But a statement released by the TV station the day after the telethon specifically said that “ The [ Christian ] hospital , which will be designed from the start by the engineers of the TEE , will provide its services to people in the area . ”
Asked about the subject in a chance meeting with JTA , Greece ’s ambassador to Israel , Nikos Zafiropoulos , denied knowing anything about the matter and said the Greek Consulate in Jerusalem handled all matters in the West Bank and Gaza .
Five days later a Greek financial newspaper , Kerdos , published a small item requesting proposals for a project to be funded by $ 1.67 million raised in the telethon .
It was the first public acknowledgement that the Christian hospital claim had been a lie .
“ A project is being sought in Gaza to be financed by the money raised from the Solidarity Telethon organized last February by the Technical Chamber of Greece and another nine trade union organizations in cooperation with Greek Public Television , ” the item read .
“ A delegation of the bodies involved will visit the area in the near future in order to decide where the 1.2 million Euros raised for a project that will provide substantial services to all the area ’s residents will be allocated . ”
No one was taking responsibility for the situation .
The spokesman for the Greek Foreign Ministry , Gregory Delavekouras , said , “ Along with the Ministry of Health , it was our intention to raise money for the restoration of schools and hospitals , and more specifically for the medical center , ” he said .
Delavekouras could not say how the “ medical center ” morphed into “ the Christian Hospital of Gaza ” on TV .
One thing is certain :
In a six - hour telethon loaded with Israel bashing , the Greek public was deceived that money contributed would go to rebuild a Christian hospital destroyed by the army of the Jewish state .
What remains unclear is whether organizers deliberately perpetrated the fraud or the telethon had fallen into the deception by accident .
A massive earthquake last week has brought New Zealand closer to Australia , scientists say .
The 7.8 magnitude quake in the Tasman Sea has expanded New Zealand 's South Island westwards by about 30 cm ( 12in ) .
Seismologist Ken Gledhill , of GNS Science , said the shift demonstrated the huge force of the tremor .
But correspondents say that with more than 2,250 km ( 1,400 miles ) separating the countries , the narrowing will not exactly be visible .
Nor , as the New Zealand media have observed , is it likely to bring cheaper air fares .
Tsunami alert
The earthquake causes some landslip in the Fiordland region
The quake was powerful enough to generate a small tsunami with a wave of one metre ( 3ft ) recorded on the west coast of New Zealand .
People in coastal areas were for a time advised to move to higher ground .
While the south - west of the South Island moved about 30 cm towards Australia , the east coast moved only one centimetre westwards , Dr Gledhill said .
" Basically , New Zealand just got a little bit bigger is another way to think about it , " he told AFP news agency .
Although it was New Zealand 's biggest earthquake in 78 years , it caused only slight damage to buildings and property when it struck in the remote Fiordland region west of Invercargill last Thursday .

" For a very large earthquake , although it was very widely felt , there were very few areas that were severely shaken , " Dr Gledhill said .

New Zealand frequently suffers earthquakes because it sits on the meeting point of the Australian and Pacific continental plates .

I 'm developing a feature for Zenoss that lives in its own Zope product .
For the time being , it 's fairly independent of Zenoss and can be demoed in a separate Zope instance .
So I have a buildout for the Zope environment , also setting up a copy of the new product as a development egg ( see this tutorial for an example of how to set that up ) .
I have that development egg pulled into the Zope demo buildout via svn:externals .
At certain points in the development cycle , however , I want to send QA an RPM of the demo instance , with my package installed , so they can test it .
This is kind of a hassle if I have to build the egg of the product and get it in the buildout directory on the build box in order to generate an RPM .
Nor can I simply leave it as a development egg , because the package would n't be in the same place on the test box , so the link would fail .
So here 's an easy way to turn a development egg into a production egg for the purposes of creating an RPM , using a separate buildout config file .
You 'll want to read this tutorial on basic RPM creation using zc.buildout .
In addition , the buildout.cfg will include a develop option in the buildout section :
[ buildout ]
...
develop = src / Products .MyCustomProduct
( src exists in my demo directory , and has the svn:externals definition pointing at the custom package . )
The egg is also included in the instance section :
[ instance ]
...
eggs =
$ {buildout: eggs}
Products .MyCustomProduct
zcml = Products .MyCustomProduct
This gets me a development buildout , in which I can work on the package in src / Products .
MyCustomProduct without building eggs or anything .
Now when it comes time to build the RPM , we need to modify the rpm config file from the tutorial to build Products .
MyCustomProduct as an egg , then install it .
We 'll use the z3c.recipe.egg , which lets you run setup.py in a source package with arbitrary arguments .
Here 's the new rpm.cfg :
[ buildout ]
extends = buildout.cfg
develop =
parts =
MyCustomProduct - build
zope2
instance
zopepy
myzope
[ MyCustomProduct - build ]
recipe = z3c.recipe.egg:setup
setup = src / Products .MyCustomProduct
args = bdist_egg
[ instance ]
find - links =
$ {buildout:find - links}
$ {MyCustomProduct - build : setup}/ dist
[ myzope ]
...
Explanation .
So , the egg is already referenced in buildout.cfg as one of the instance eggs .
All we do in this one is remove its declaration as a development egg ( with develop= in the buildout section ) , add a part to create the egg artifact ( MyCustomProduct - build ) , and tell the instance section where to find it ( expanded find - links ) .
z3c.recipe.egg just needs the setup option defined , which points at a package directory containing setup.py .
It 'll install by default , whereas we just want it to build an egg , so we specify custom args with the args option .
Notice that we have to build the egg first .
This is obvious upon reflection , but the first time I just added MyCustomProduct - build to the parts instead of making sure it was first , which meant that buildout could n't find it in the instance step , because it did n't exist yet .
This will create a deployment instance just fine on its own , in the current directory .
But in the RPM example , we build out somewhere else , so we 'll have to update the buildout command in the spec file so that it can tell buildout where to find the source of the custom package .
This is a modification to the % build script :
% build
...
bin/buildout -c rpm.cfg buildout:directory=%{installdir} MyCustomProduct - build : setup=%{sourcedir}/src/Products/ZenUI3
Then we build the RPM as in the tutorial .
This time , it 'll package up the egg in its current state and install that artifact into the Zope instance .
This means that I can generate an RPM for QA on the fly with a single command , which is lots easier than assembling the parts manually .

On The Sean Hannity Show today host Sean Hannity claimed that Obama has remained silent after the Iranian election , and thousands of people are growing outraged with Obama .
Hannity said that Obama does n’t want to make Adolf Jr. mad .
The problem is that President Obama was on television this morning talking about …. the Iranian election .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Advertisements
Hannity said , “ It was funny that President Obama took credit on Friday for what looked like a historic upset in Iran sayinging that his speech in Cairo made the difference , well that now all appears that Ahmadinejad , Adolf Jr. as we call him , that he stole the election , and since then Obama is silent , and the outrage is now starting to build over the White House ’s refusal to support Iranian democracy .
Now apparently , there are hundreds of thousands of people now taking to the streets in Tehran angry over what ’s happening here . ”
Hannity said the White House does n’t want to make Ahmadinejad angry , “ In other words we do n’t want to go out on a limb and take the wrong side of this .
We do n’t want to make Adolf Jr. mad .
After all we wanted to negotiate with the guy without preconditions . ”
However , here is video of Obama talking about the Iranian election this morning :
Obama said , “ It ’s not productive , given the history of U.S. - Iranian relations , to be seen as meddling , the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections . …
I do believe that something has happened in Iran where there is , there is a questioning of the kinds of antagonistic postures towards the international community that have taken place in the past , and that there are people that want to see greater openness and greater debate and want to see greater democracy . ”
Does Hannity not watch the news ?
How can he claim that Obama is staying silent , when he was on TELEVISON this morning talking about the Iranian election ?
You know television Sean .
You are on it every weeknight at 9 PM Eastern .
Hannity ’s comments are example of how desperate Republicans are to attach something negative to Obama .
They do n’t care that the correct approach to take is one that avoids the appearance of meddling in the domestic affairs of another Middle Eastern country .
People like Hannity are only interested in making Obama look weak , and uninterested in democracy .
Obama ’s comments on this situation demonstrate more insight about the Iran and the Middle East than the Bush administration ever showed .
The attitude in the majority of the GOP is still reflective of the Bush era cowboy diplomacy .
We have already seen the results of this policy in Iraq and North Korea .
It is a failed approach that is more interested in playing domestic politics with foreign policy , instead of doing the right thing for the United States .
Last July , the City & County of San Francisco launched the first local solar energy incentive program in the nation , The results are in , and , the program is an unequivocal success .
In the year since our solar energy incentive program GoSolarSF launched , we have seen a 450 % increase in applications for solar installations in San Francisco over the previous year , from 200 to 850 .
And despite the current recession , 56 applicants met our low - income standards and will receive incentive payments .

And nonprofit and affordable housing organizations are going solar too .
Just last week , I joined a local affordable housing developer , our San Francisco Housing Authority and our San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to announce three new solar installations at Hayes Valley North and South and Plaza East public housing in San Francisco .

The State continues its terrific reporting on the Sanford scandal , paints a portrait of a staff privately panicking over the location of their boss , but publicly covering up their concern :
Sanford ’s office could n't locate missing governor
E-mails , phone calls outline efforts to contact , cover for AWOL leader
Gov. Mark Sanford ’s chief of staff , Scott English , called the governor ’s cell phones 15 times during the governor ’s secret trip to Argentina to visit his lover last month .
But the governor never picked up .
So how did the South Carolina Republican 's staff handle the situation ?
Naturally , they lied :
Meanwhile Sanford ’s communications director , Joel Sawyer , worked to minimize the fact the governor had been out of touch with his staff for about four days .
Records released Monday show Sawyer juggled e-mails and media calls from around the nation , giving a consistent message that was later proven to be untrue .
Pause for a moment to consider the reality of what happened : Mark Sanford 's staff had no idea where he was .
Instead of admitting that they had no idea where in the world the governor might be , they decided to lie about his whereabouts .
In so doing , the staff not only risked putting Sanford in jeopardy -- imagine if instead of goofing off in Argentina with his mistress he had actually been in physical danger for some reason -- but they also risked creating a constitutional crisis in South Carolina .
What if something had happened in the state -- a wild fire , or some other natural disaster -- that required gubernatorial action .
With Sanford AWOL , would they have simply forged his signature ?
Would they have trotted out a look - alike , as in the movie Dave ?
The more you think about it , the more breathtaking Mark Sanford 's lapse was .
In any other job , he'd have been fired for going AWOL .
But thanks to South Carolina Republican Party , Sanford has gotten off with nothing more than a bit of self - inflicted public embarrassment .
Most mainstream distributions , like Ubuntu , Fedora , and Mandriva , have already adopted a time - based release schedule , meaning that releases are not done on a feature basis , but according to a pre-determined time schedule .
The Debian project has announced that it has adopted a time - based release schedule too .
Where most time - based distributions have a schedule of round and about six months , Debian takes another approach , obviously because Debian is more about stability and longevity than about the latest and greatest features in each release .
As such , the project adopted a two - year release schedule , with a development freeze every December of odd - numbered years , with the actual release following in the first half of the following year .
Time - based freezes will allow the Debian Project to blend the predictability of time based releases with its well established policy of feature based releases .
The new freeze policy will provide better predictability of releases for users of the Debian distribution , and also allow Debian developers to do better long - term planning .
A two - year release cycle will give more time for disruptive changes , reducing inconveniences caused for users .
Having predictable freezes should also reduce overall freeze time .
The first of this new type of freeze will happen December 2009 , making the time between the current release and the next one rather short – this is a one - time occurrence .
“ To accommodate the needs of larger organisations and other users with a long upgrade process , the announcement reads , “ the Debian project commits to provide the possibility to skip the upcoming release and do a skip - upgrade straight from Debian GNU / Linux 5.0 ( Lenny ) to Debian GNU / Linux 7.0 ( not yet codenamed ) . ”
Despite the relatively short development time , the next Debian release , codenamed Squeeze , will still have some interesting features , such as multi-arch support , which will make it easier to install 32 bit packages on 64bit installations .
It will also sport an optimised boot process which will reduce boot times and improve reliability .
Bowing to pressure , the World Health Organization announced Friday that it would rewrite its rules for alerting the world to new diseases , meaning the swine flu circling the globe will probably never be declared a full - fledged pandemic .
Dr. Keiji Fukuda , the deputy director general making the W.H.O. announcement , said that he could not predict exactly what the new rules would be but that criteria would include a “ substantial risk of harm to people , ” not just the geographic spread of a relatively benign virus .
The six - point system was created in 2005 when the threat was H5N1 avian flu , which has a fatality rate of about 60 percent .
But the system does not take into account a virus ’s lethality , and in the current outbreak , some countries have complained that the warning system created panic and pressure for border closings , even though the strain was less deadly .
Asked if the W.H.O. could damage its credibility by changing the rules in mid-outbreak , Dr. Fukuda said : “ There ’s nothing like reality for telling you whether something is working or not .
Rigidly adhering to something that is not working would not be very helpful . ”
Editor 's note : Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of the San Diego Union - Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist .
Read his column here .
Ruben Navarrette says the administration defended Biden by misrepresenting what he said .
SAN DIEGO , California ( CNN ) --
The Obama administration forgot the first rule in a crisis : Never send Vice President Joe Biden to calm people 's fears .
During a television interview Thursday , Biden had a recurrence of his trademark foot - in - mouth disease when he said he had warned members of his own family that -- while some people are steering clear of Mexico -- they should be extra cautious and not get on airplanes altogether or , for that matter , go into any " confined places " where germs could spread .
" If you 're out in the middle of a field and someone sneezes , that 's one thing , " Biden said .
" If you 're in a closed aircraft or closed container or closed car or closed classroom , it 's a different thing . "
Watch Biden 's remarks »
You do n't know whether to laugh or cry .
Recognizing that Biden could create a panic and cripple the airline industry , Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander went into damage control mode and put out a statement that read , " The advice he is giving family members is the same advice the administration is giving to all Americans : that they should avoid unnecessary air travel to and from Mexico .
If they are sick , they should avoid airplanes and other confined public spaces , such as subways . "
How sad .
That 's not what Biden said .
His comments were n't limited to Mexico , and he was n't talking about what people should do " if they are sick . "
It was about what you should do if someone else is sick .
So , the administration 's response initially was basically , " Are you going to believe us or your own lying ears ? "
The White House later apologized " if anybody was unduly alarmed " by Biden 's comments , and press secretary Robert Gibbs tried to explain what Biden " meant to say . "
Watch Gibbs ' comments »
Up to now , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia , has gone only so far as to advise people to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico , which seems to be ground zero in the imminent pandemic .
It 's there that at least 2,500 people may have been infected .
Mexican authorities also suspect that 159 deaths have resulted from the infection , although only a small number of cases -- less than a dozen -- have been confirmed .
And in most of those cases , it was n't the flu that was fatal but some another illness that took advantage of a weakened immune system caused by the H1N1 flu .
And by all means , for the sake of beleaguered pig farmers who are bound to take a serious economic hit before this is over , let 's keep referring to it that way .
The real significance of Biden 's boneheaded comments is that they help feed the national hysteria over the virus formerly known as swine flu .
Few Americans know more about that hysteria and the cost it incurs than U.S. pig farmers , who can probably feel pork prices dropping everything someone uses the " s- word " despite the stubborn fact that one cannot contract this virus by eating pork .
It 's a bum rap that has been fed by media hysteria .
It 's getting so I can't even watch the news without feeling the urge to reach for hand sanitizer .
Even so , countries such as Ecuador have impulsively and foolishly banned imports of U.S. pork products .
That got the attention of the free trade community , who this week rushed to defend the little piggy that got maligned .
U.S. trade representative Ron Kirk warned about other countries taking advantage of the crisis to wiggle out of trade agreements .
As a free trader myself , I was glad to see that .
Good for Kirk and the pork lobby for fighting back .
But what I waited for -- and never saw -- was a similar effort by the administration to defend the other group unfairly blamed for spreading the flu : Mexican immigrants .
If the concern is with people who might visit Mexico , then we should scrutinize legal immigrants and U.S. citizens who can travel freely between the two countries .
Consider that the rash of cases in New York stemmed from students who went to Cancun for spring break .
Yet , ironically , it 's illegal immigrants who usually do n't travel back and forth who catch the blame from those who -- like some foreign countries , regarding the trade issue -- are shamelessly taking advantage of this crisis to serve their interests .
Some members of Congress and immigration restrictionists are foolishly and impulsively calling for the closing of the U.S. - Mexican border .
Kudos to President Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano for instilling common sense into all this by pointing out that closing the border would n't do any good now that the flu has jumped the fence , so to speak .
Meanwhile , what I want to know is this :
Have many Americans have gone from scooping up immigrant workers on streetcorners to avoiding them altogether ?
If we 're really concerned about catching the H1N1 flu from south of the border , we can always fire our housekeeper , cook our own food , mow our own lawns and babysit our own kids .
I can hear the response : " Hold on , now .
An imminent pandemic is no reason to do something drastic . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette .

Since its launch on July 23 , 1999 , the Chandra X-ray Observatory has been NASA 's flagship mission for X - ray astronomy , taking its place in the fleet of " Great Observatories . "
Who we are
NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory is a telescope specially designed to detect X - ray emission from very hot regions of the Universe such as exploded stars , clusters of galaxies , and matter around black holes .
Because X - rays are absorbed by Earth 's atmosphere , Chandra must orbit above it , up to an altitude of 139,000 km ( 86,500 mi ) in space .
The Smithsonian 's Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge , MA , hosts the Chandra X - ray Center which operates the satellite , processes the data , and distributes it to scientists around the world for analysis .
The Center maintains an extensive public web site about the science results and an education program .
What we do
Chandra carries four very sensitive mirrors nested inside each other .
The energetic X - rays strike the insides of the hollow shells and are focussed onto electronic detectors at the end of the 9.2- m ( 30 - ft. ) optical bench .
Depending on which detector is used , very detailed images or spectra of the cosmic source can be made and analyzed .
What we are excited about
Chandra has imaged the spectacular , glowing remains of exploded stars , and taken spectra showing the dispersal of elements .
Chandra has observed the region around the supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way , and found black holes across the Universe .
Chandra has traced the separation of dark matter from normal matter in the collision of galaxies in a cluster and is contributing to both dark matter and dark energy studies .
As its mission continues , Chandra will continue to discover startling new science about our high - energy Universe .

The power structure of the Iranian government contains checks and balances , but also concentrates power in a few hands .
It is not a dictatorship ; I would describe it as a competitive oligarchy with unequal and shifting shares of power .
Ayatollah Khamenei is the Supreme Leader , and he does exercise a great deal of influence , but his authority is not absolute .
He is appointed by the Assembly of Experts , and they are an elected body .
Hashemi Rafsanjani is the most influential , or powerful among the Assembly of Experts and he has resigned his post on the Expediency Council in protest on Saturday , but remains on the Assembly of Experts .
He is reported to be in Qom ( the Religious Center of Iran just south of Tehran ) , and there is speculation that he may be trying to undermine Khamenei 's position among more moderate clerics .
Here 's a historical reference for these two men : think of Khamenei as Robespierre and Rafsanjani as Danton from the French Revolution .
Khamenei is more of an ideologue and a purist who does not hesitate to exercise brutal authority , while Rafsanjani is an indulgent who has enriched himself and his family through his access to power .
Unlike the French Revolution , this is 30 years later , and Rafsanjani has managed to keep his head , so far .
To many Iranians , this election is also about these two men .
Much of Ahmadinejad 's support comes from revulsion to Rafsanjani .
It was Rafsanjani who lost to Ahmadinejad in the runoff election of ' 05 , and he lost resoundingly .
This is why in much of Ahmadinjad 's debate with Mousavi , he attacked Rafsanjani ; he was trying to make this election about Rafsanjani and not Mousavi .
We do n't really know the results , this might have worked .
Moreover , Rafsanjani 's support for Mousavi may not be a good thing .
He has power , but he is corrupt -- so where does it go from there ?
What will Mousavi owe Rafsanjani if he successfully gets Khamenei voted out ?
( I am not saying that I think that is likely , I am just working through a hypothetical . )
I am a strong Mousavi supporter , as my previous diaries clearly show .
I watch for what he says and does in the next few days .
He is no fool and he can take care of himself .
Another figure I am watching is Mohsen Makhmalbaf .
He is an internationally acclaimed film director , whose film Kandahar was even viewed by W in the White House .
He is a man who has worked tirelessly in Afghanistan on behalf of Afghani children .
He has put his money where he mouth is and arranged to bring thousands of Afghani children to Iran to be able to go to school .
His work reflects the complexity of Iran as a culture and society .
He reveals a proud non-Western nation capable of charting their own course .
I would also recommend Gabbeh to anyone not familiar with his work .
He reported on behalf of Mousavi the story that Mousavi was contacted by an election official and told he had won , but that they should avoid saying anything until Saturday .
Mousavi smelled a rat and announced immediately he had won .
That was the point on Friday ( Around 3:15 EDT ) , where I was happy , but worried .
The polls were not even closed , and yet Mousavi made this announcement .
Again , Mousavi is a serious and calm man -- I believed he must have had his reasons .
The unfolding events seemed to indicate that something was very wrong .
SO , as I wrote on Saturday night , until I hear Mousavi 's public and unrestrained statements on the subject , I wait to make final judgments .
At this point there is no way to know for certain what happened on Friday .
Moreover , Khamenei's " Probe " will be a " Blue - Ribbon " Committee that will be " shocked , shocked to find gambling going on " as they are presented with their winnings .
( I watched Casablanca late Friday night to escape . )
Any action taken by Rafsanjani , however , will be suspect and come with strings attached .
It is vital to keep in mind , that we view Ahmadinejad through the lens of foreign policy , and that distorts our vision .
He has done a great deal for the poor and the remote villages of Iran , and much of the underclasses .
Those people do not like Rafsanjani or what he represents , and they are correct in their assessment of him .
If nothing else , this election indicates deep divisions in a country with a young government ( 30 years ) -- the situation is explosive .
Tehran is around 12 % of the country , but just as we are pretty ticked off at Wall Street right now and subsequently New York , many Iranians feel similarly about elites in Tehran .
This is the reason that rioting in Tehran , North Tehran in particular , brutal as the suppression may be , does not necessarily reflect the mood of the country as a whole .
The truth is , we are not really in a position to accurately gauge the meaning of much of what we are seeing .
If the United States had re-established diplomatic relations , we would have an embassy in Tehran and consulates in major cities around the country .
I am not taking about spying here .
I am talking about the regular activities and reports written by the diplomatic corps about what is going on .
Many native speakers recording the attitudes of people and groups , and the political orientation of classes and other enclaves throughout the country .
We do n't have any of that , so our State Department is virtually flying blind in this incredibly important and volatile situation .
Here are just a few of the questions we need accurate information on : 1 ) How many clerics appear to support Khamenei ?
2 ) Is there division within the Revolutionary Guard on how to proceed ?
3 ) Where do the regular Armed Forces stand ?
4 ) What about the Basijis ?
Are they mostly unemployed kids , or do they really reflect the ideology of the Revolutionary Guard ?
and on on on ...
We need information and we need it to be accurate , and we need it now .
One of my favorite Generals , Joseph Stilwell , who served in China during WW II , used to say , " Good news does not hurt me ; I need to know the bad news yesterday . "
Sure we can find speculation about the answers to those questions on the Internet , but we need careful , thoughtful and informed analysis -- not knee - jerk reactions .
No matter how things turn out -- Iran is going to be a divided country in the near future .
If Ahmadinejad and Khamenei prevail , they will have little choice but to become more dictatorial than ever .
The suppression will not be pretty .
If Rafsanjani prevails and gets Khamenei reversed or unseated , Mousavi ruling over a diverse nation with corrupt officials like Rafsanjani has major liabilities as well .
The US needs to consider options carefully going forward .
Regardless of the results , I think sanctions should be dropped .
We need to stop talking about " Carrots and Sticks " as if our international adversaries are donkeys for us to ride .
We need to stop punitive policies period .
Sanctions tend to re-enforce the governments we do not like and punish the poorest in those countries .
The people of Iraq suffered throughout the 90s ; Saddam Hussein and his friends did not .
Now at the same time we need to make our positions clear , and those positions need to be reasonable .
We can stick to reasonable positions and if we can couple that with policies that do n't put down entire nations we might find we make a bit of progress instead .
I do n't think anyone around here would say that our foreign policy of the last 30 years has been a raging success .
( Before you start , do n't give me any of that " We won the Cold War " stuff , The Soviet Union mostly collapsed on its own . )
It 's time to really try something new .
Street Dentists
In India and China
If you thought that businesses were only run in four walled shops or corporate houses with big price tags and that if you needed a doctor you would have to look out for a clinic or hospital , think again !
India and China have a different story to offer you , you could find dentists on streets too and they had all “ tools ” that your treatment would require !
We bring to you India and China doing some shocking “ open ” business below .

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - MN ) took a break today from fear mongering about the 2010 Census to fear monger about healthcare reform .
On Dennis Miller ’s radio show today , she said , “ On the 16th page , it says whatever health care you have now , it ’s going to be gone within five years . ”
However , this is never mentioned on page 16 , or anywhere else .
Here is the audio , courtesy of Think Progress :
Advertisements
Bachmann said , “ Well , what does that mean ?
That means that politicians are going to substitute their choice for your doctor ’s choice for you .
That ’s exactly what this bill does .
Here ’s the other thing about that bill .
It ’s a monstrosity .
I have the bill printed out on my desk , it ’s over 1,000 pages long .
On the 16th page , it says whatever health care you have now , it ’s going to be gone within five years .
So your current health care plan , you ’re not going to have in five years .
What you ’re going to have is a government plan and a federal bureau is going to decide what you get or if you get anything at all . ”
Ok , Bachmann was doing fine with her Republican talking points until the stuff about page 16 .
Here is the bill , and there is nothing on page 16 about losing coverage .
The section covers grandfathered in health plans .
Five years does not even show up on the page .
I do n’t think Bachmann has read page 16 , or any other part of the bill .
Usually with Bachmann if you go back to the source material , you can find where her intellectual choo - choo train hopped the tracks , but this time , I have no clue where she got that phrase or page number .
Bachmann also attacked the AARP .
She claimed that the organization is turning on the elderly .
Bachmann apparently does n’t know what the term grandfathered in means .
Grandfathered in means that the plan will stay as is .
Being that Bachmann was mouthing the GOP talking points almost word for word on healthcare , it is a pretty safe guess that she has n’t read the bill .
The people in her district should do the nation a favor and not reelect Bachmann to another term .
The main product of the discussions with Beijing so far has therefore been agreement to hold more discussions .
Yet the clock is ticking .
Only six months remain before the opening of United Nations - sponsored talks in Copenhagen to produce a climate change treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol .
Without the full participation of the United States and China , most negotiators believe that any agreement is doomed to fail .
Congress and two American presidents refused to accept the Kyoto accord , which expires in 2012 , because it imposed no pollution limits on China or other developing countries .
The American refusal to ratify the treaty and the lack of participation by China and other developing nations have left the pact all but toothless .
“ China may not be the alpha and omega of the international negotiations , but it is close , ” said Todd D. Stern , the top American climate negotiator at the three - day talks in Beijing .
“ Certainly no deal will be possible if we do n’t find a way forward with China . ”
The Obama administration has pledged to be a leader in the talks that culminate in December in Copenhagen , although it is far from clear that Congress has the will to approve emissions targets and furnish enough aid to developing countries to satisfy the Europeans , Chinese , Indians , Brazilians and other major participants .
Mr. Stern described the demands from China and other countries as “ not serious , ” and said the United States was “ jumping as high as the political system will tolerate . ”
As a measure of how far apart the two nations are , China says the United States should reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
The bill before Congress , which could be further weakened , now calls for less than a 4 percent reduction over that period .
The Chinese have begun to consider a series of unilateral actions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , stepping up production of renewable electricity and increasing the efficiency of their manufacturing , buildings and vehicles .
But Beijing insists it will not sacrifice China ’s economy to meet the demands of outsiders , particularly those in the developed world that are responsible for the vast majority of human - caused carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere .
This week the senate held confirmation hearings on Judge Sotomayor who is widely expected to receive more than enough votes in the democratic controlled congress .
This would be historic in the respect that it would be the third woman nominated to the Supreme Court and the first Latina .
Not much is known about where Judge Sotomayor stands on LGBT issues , she has had very few cases that have dealt directly with queer concerns .
Major LGBT advocacy groups however like the Human Rights Campaign applaud her nomination and claim " confidence " in her judicial philosophy .
The mere fact that she has been nominated by democrats is not enough to assure us on how she will rule on key issues .
Many republican nominated judges have turned out to be more moderate / liberal as seen in the California supreme court ruling on Prop 8 , and the Iowa Supreme Court 's unanimous ruling on marriage equality .
Judges are supposed to rule on the merits of the case and only follow the constitution .
Ideally issues on LGBT equality should not be considered a conservative nor liberal issue , but a civil rights and constitutional issue .
Sadly , activist judges on the conservative end of the spectrum have failed to uphold the constitution and use loopholes in the law to justify their viewpoint .
Do you think Judge Sotomayor should be confirmed , will she be an LGBT ally on the bench or might we see a democratically appointed judge who is conservative on social issues that effect our community ?
Everything is deeply intertwingled .
— Ted Nelson
The literatures that touch on synesthesias — scientific , art - historical , literary , phenomenological , ethnographic , psychedelic — vary widely in their definitions , interpretations , and in their degree of comfort with the first - person , subjective nature of experiential reports .
The significances given to synesthetic experiences are similarly wide - ranging .
This article explores the relationships among synesthesias , psychedelic experience , and language , highlighting Terence McKenna ’s synesthetic language experiences on DMT and magic mushrooms .
The complexities of creating and performing with the Intertwingulator , a system that provides the means to weave together , in multiple mappings , two or more complex visual , aural , and linguistic systems in live performance , are briefly described .
Contemporary neuroscience ( Cytowic , Marks , Harrison ) views synesthesia as a rare , ( perhaps abnormal , perhaps pathological ) ‘ condition . ’
Visionary artists , ( Blake , Scriabin , Kandinsky , the French symbolists ) link synesthetic perception to a spiritual dimension .
Phenomenologists ( Abram , based in Merleau - Ponty , the phenomenologist of perception ) locates synesthesia as fundamental to perception and language , both spoken and written .
Ethnographic reports of ayahuasca shamanism in the Amazonian rain forest ( Luna , Amaringo ) describe the centrality of the icaros , the shaman ’s songs , that guide and create the content of the visionary experience on many levels , calling visual forms and presences into being with sound .
Reports of psychedelic synesthesias ( James , Pankhe , McKenna , Munn , Narby ) link the states of multisensory perception to noetic experience of deep insights into the nature of reality and consciousness , and their profound intertwinglement ..
A range of contemporary artistic practices , especially in immersive , interactive , electronic media environments seek to create , or invoke , synesthesias .
The psychedelic connections to the creation and participation in many of these experiences ( rave culture , Burning Man ) , and their enabling technologies — such as computer graphics , are common knowledge .
This paper touches on one example of such artistic experimentation .
The Intertwingulator is a Max software implementation that can link the sensory qualities of two or more intricate systems , each producing complex , aesthetic forms in differing sensory modalities through an intermediate zone ( the intertwingulator ) where mappings can be constructed and tested in performance .
The Glide system of dynamic , multidimensional visual language is mapped to keyboard input from a midi synthesizer and / or from another software system , such as composer Pauline Olivero ’s EIS ( Expanded Instrumentation System ) to create a variety of synesthetic performances .
The collaborators acknowledge the dual difficulties : technological and aesthetic .
Making the technology work on the one hand and designing and performing a meaningful aesthetic experience with these highly complex instruments are interdependent challenges .
A Synesthetic Sampler
“ Sounds seem to affect what I see .
I see music ; the textures of rhythms and the colors of melodies float before my eyes ..
My visual images alter or change whenever I hear a sound or noise …
Sight , feeling , motion , texture , thinking , sound — all are one … .
The interaction between sight , music , and physical feeling is most remarkable . ” ( Dobkin de Rios , p. 48 . )
“ When I get there I lie down with my eyes closed and sunglasses on , there is some interesting synesthesia going on , corresponding patterns in regards to distance and volume and other characteristics of the sounds I hear .
The most interesting ‘ looking ’ sound comes from a moped that passes by on the bike road below the hill . ”
( DOM , Vaults of Erowid )
“ I experienced powerful synesthesia between hearing and touch .
I ran my
hands over the sharp edges of the springs underneath my girlfriend ’s bed and simultaneously heard , felt , and saw an intense static / sharp / bright sensation . ”
( 5 - MeO - DMT , Vaults of Erowid )
“ Your name , Richard , tastes like a chocolate bar , ” she writes , “ warm and melting on my tongue . ” ( Cytowic , p. 14 )
“ The spirits one sees in hallucinations are three - dimensional , sound - emitting images .
In other words , they are made of their own language , like DNA . ” ( Narby , p. 71 )
“ Through his icaro , he also calls the rainbow with the whole range of colors that the boa yakumama has .
He sings the icaro of the diamond , the gold , the silver , and of all the precious stones in order to put them on the woman to protect her … ” ( Luna , p. 112 . )
“ The first thing I saw was the ‘ visible language ’ ! …
The ‘ elves ’ appeared .
They sang / I saw / read / felt / heard .
They are ‘ made out ’ of the visible language .
The message is conveyed by the medium itself in several simultaneous sensory modalities . ”
( DMT , Vaults of Erowid )
“ The ancient wise men , to describe the kaleidoscopic illuminations of their shamanistic nights , drew an analogy between the inside and the outside and formed a word that related the spectrum colors created by the sunshine in the spray of waterfalls and the mists of the morning to their conscious experiences of ecstatic enlightenment : these are the whirlwinds he speaks of , gyrating configurations of iridescent lights that appear to him as he speaks , turned round and round and round himself by the turbulent winds of the spirit . ” ( Henry Munn )
Neologisms in Ancient Geek
Xanadu never shipped , but Ted Nelson ’s word still bears fruit , now in the context of synesthesia .
Intertwingle : itself a blended word , ( to say it is to do it : noeto - poetic ? ) a braid of intertwining , mingling , perhaps twisting together , the deepness of which suggests the mycelial networks of brain and WWW ; the immersive , multisensory bombardment of a rave ; googling around the fractal depths of contemporary dataspaces ; navigating by synchronicities , “ hints and allegations ; ” dense heterarchies of meaning emerging and dissolving ; connecting paths and patterns , linkings , unlinkings .
And this theme of intertwingularity is the common ground underlying the discourses of synesthesia , whatever the variances among epistemological theme parks , or the bewildering richness person to person in experiential reports , whether those reports are quoted in neuroscientific works , the Vaults of Erowid , William Blake ’s visions , or the heavenly or hellish trip reports of Aldous Huxley .
The Noetic Disconnection
From this small sampling of quotes , it seems clear that under the broad rubric of “ synesthesia ” almost any sensory — and / or emotional — and / or cognitive experience can be cross - linked .
Neuroscientist Richard Cytowic narrows the definition of synesthesia to
“ the involuntary physical experience of a cross-modal association .
That is , the stimulation of one sensory modality reliably causes a perception in one or more different senses .
Its phenomenology clearly distinguishes it from metaphor , literary tropes , sound symbolism , and deliberate artistic contrivances that sometimes employ the term “ synesthesia ” to describe their multisensory joinings . ”
Cytowic estimates the occurrence of the synesthetic experience to be statistically rare , one in 25,000 .
When psychedelics are the testbed of synesthesias , the occurrence of synesthesias increases dramatically :
“ It is reasonably common for individuals who take hallucinogens to report that their senses become mixed .
Given the illicit nature of the topic it is hard to find reliable data on this issue , but a recent web - based questionnaire conducted by Don DeGracia , suggested that , of a total of 62 respondents who admitted to using hallucinogenic compounds , 45.9 % reported synesthetic symptoms .
Clearly the most common manifestation ( over 90 % ) was to see sounds .
Now , just as with the patients described in the last section , it would be prudent to treat such accounts with an element of caution , as it can be hard to dissociate ‘ true ’ synesthesia from possibly imagined forms of the condition . ” ( Harrison )
Questioning the reality or validity of these experiences in the scientific discourses is common , and interesting ambivalences arise in the handling and evaluation of first person reports .
On the one hand , Cytowic invokes The Varieties of Religious Experience , in which “ William James ’ spoke of ecstasy ’s four qualities of ineffability , passivity , noesis , and transience , ” claiming that “ These same qualities are shared by synesthesia . ”
Further , in the section titled “ The Rejection of Direct Experience , ” Cytowic states that “ Questioning its reality [ synesthesia ] without first having some technological confirmation shows how ready we are to reject any first - hand experience .
We are addicted to the external and the rational .
Our insistence on a third - person , “ objective ” understanding of the world has just about swept aside all other forms of knowledge . ”
At the same time , this very ineffability , is , for Cytowic , a bug not a feature .
He sympathizes with Heinrich Kluver , who , in trying to get his subjects to report on their mescaline hallucinations , “ was frustrated by the vagueness with which subjects described their experience , their eagerness to yield uncritically to cosmic or religious explanations , to “ interpret ” or poetically embroider the experience in lieu of straightforward but concrete description , and their tendency to be overwhelmed and awed by the “ indescribableness ” of their visions …
Similarly , once Kluver got his subjects past elaborating or , even worse , explaining what they saw … ” [ emphasis added ] .
Clearly the noetic aspect of the experience is to be edited out by the “ phenomenological ” psychologist .
Cytowic ’s own example of pruning direct experience :
“ In explicating MW ’s description of mint , I distinguished between his factual description of curved , smooth , and cool tactile attributes , and his analogical explanation of the taste as “ cool glass columns . ”
For Kluver , Cytowic , and Harrison , the experiencing subjects ’ data is inherently untrustworthy in some way , needing to be refined in such a way as to ( conveniently ) fit the categories established by the scientist for that experience .
Further , when did adjectives such as cool and smooth attain such universal status ?
Is your smooth and my smooth the same ?
Are there degrees and admixtures of smooth ?
How does one fix as fact a word that can be used to describe wine , dance movements , and the way a pickup line is delivered ?
More significantly , perhaps , interpretation is assumed to be the privilege of the scientist ; profound noesis , often a part of synesthetic experience , psychedelic or otherwise , is stripped from the ‘ primary experience , ’ denied epistemological potency , and tamed by the scientific reduction of ‘ only the facts . ’
The descriptive potency of natural language is put to the test in the discourses of synesthesia and psychedelics .
Hallucinogenic discourse , both of scientific and “ recreational ” nature , faces a similar rhetorical dilemma as the rest of the ecstatic traditions it responds to :
It must report on an event which is in principle impossible to communicate .
Writers of mystic experience from St Teresa to William James have treated the unrepresentable character of mystic events to be the very hallmark of ecstasies .
Hallucinogenic discourse faced a similar struggle in the effort to report on the knowledge beyond what Aldous Huxley ( and Jim Morrison … ) described as the “ doors of perception . ” ( Doyle )
The Noetic Connection
Jose Arguelles in his analysis of William Blake quotes the famous lines of Blake ’s adopted by Huxley to describe the psychedelic visionary state :
“ If the doors of perception were cleansed , everything would appear to man as it is , infinite . /
For man has closed himself up , till he sees all things thro narrow chinks of his cavern . ”
Arguelles gets to the heart of the synesthetic matter in his interpretation of this passage :
“ History is the result of an overelaboration and separation of the senses . . . Blake ’s vision of man ’s natural condition and the condition man shall return to following the apocalyptic disclosure of the present era—is that of a psychosensory unity in which each sense is not a “ narrow chink walled off from the other senses but in a state of communication with them .
This state of sensory interfusion , often referred to as synesthesia , is presupposed by a consciousness in which body and soul are realized to be one , and in turn presupposes a social order so totally different from the present one that its closest approximation is to be found in the remnant of so - called primitive societies . ” ( Arguelles )
David Abram , following Merleau - Ponty , finds this synesthetic unity in the very nature of perception itself .
“ Although contemporary neuroscientists study “ synaesthesia ” — the overlap and blending of the senses — as though it were a rare or pathological experience to which only certain persons are prone ( those who report “ seeing sounds , ” “ hearing colors , ” and the like ) , our primordial , preconceptual experience , as Merleau - Ponty makes evident , is inherently synaesthetic .
The intertwining of sensory modalities seems unusual to us only to the extent that we have become estranged from our direct experience ( and hence from our primordial contact with the entities and elements that surround us . ) :
… Synaesthetic perception is the rule , and we are unaware of it only because scientific knowledge shifts the center of gravity of experience , so that we have unlearned how to see , hear , and generally speaking , feel , in order to deduce , from our bodily organization and the world as the physicist conceives it , what we are to see , hear , and feel . ” ( Merleau - Ponty )
Walter Pahnke , of the famous “ Good Friday ” experiment in the heyday of Harvard psychedelic research , describes the noetic aspect of the psychedelic experience as one of it main features , along with synesthesia :
“ The Noetic Quality , as named by William James , is a feeling of insight or illumination that , on an intuitive , nonrational level and with a tremendous force of certainty , subjectively has the status of Ultimate Reality .
This knowledge is not an increase of facts but is a gain in psychological , philosophical , or theological insight . ”
Psychedelic Language
All language is psychedelic by definition , functioning to make manifest the mind , to bring thoughts , feelings , information , from the interior of one mind and make them available to be interiorized in another .
David Porush calls this “ Technologically Mediated Telepathy . ”
And Porush , Abram , and Erik Davis all relate the story of how this psychedelic , originally synesthetic , oral language - making connected us deeply and reciprocally to our natural environment , a mutual be -speaking that was progressively lost when writing , and most particularly alphabetic writing , froze knowledge - making into eternal signs in rows on flat surfaces , signs you could come back to — and they had n’t changed .
These signs deployed progressively deeper disconnections — among the senses , between time and space , between reason and emotion .
The alphabet : the cybernetic technology that changed everything .
Synesthesia , in this light , comes to stand for the promise of reconnection , of noesis , of recovery of some long lost unity , within ourselves , among ourselves , within the world .
Psychedelics can deliver synesthesias with a noetic quality , at intense , supersaturated , high - bandwidth delivery rates , as well as bringing tales of new forms of language that both create and express these altered states of consciousness .
Psychedelics may appeal to some deep longing for knowledge not delivered as information arranged in hierarchical tree structures , taxonomized and bowdlerized , the promiscuous metaphor and the unseemly miscegenation amongst disciplines that it encourages , excised from the “ phenomenological ” reports .
The psychonaut ’s noesis can arrive live and lively , paradoxically gesturing , zany , even alien .
Terence McKenna ’s accounts of the DMT self - transforming machine elves made of language dispensing unbearably high - speed , condensed blasts of pure , and extraordinarily alien gnosis , and the mushroom experiences reverberating with the logos , seen and heard in synesthetic unity , weird as they are , have been reported , in varying forms , by many others .
Do the reports of synesthesias in the scientific literature of psychedelic - like weirdnesses ( Richard , your name is like chocolate melting in my mouth ) leaking into baseline consciousness , ( strangeness usually kept in bounds by the state - bound nature of other forms of consciousness — dreaming , meditating , drugs — according to Roland Fischer ’s model of mind - states ) fascinate us in the same way ?
There are entire classes of synesthesias attached to letters and numbers , flavored and colored linguistic objects .
McKenna himself comes back to these language experiences time and again in his books and lectures : new forms of language perceived , theories of the evolution of language and consciousness catalyzed by psychedelics are proposed :
“ Perhaps a human language is possible in which the intent of meaning is actually beheld in three - dimensional space .
If this can happen on DMT , it means it is at least , under some circumstances , accessible to human beings .
Given ten thousand years and high cultural involvement in such a talent , does anyone doubt that it could become a cultural convenience in the same way that mathematics or language has become a cultural convenience ? ” ( McKenna , p. 39 . )
The LiveGlide Synestheater
My own testbed for synesthesias has been in the seven year development project of LiveGlide , a visual performance instrument based on the psychedelically informed visual language , Glide .
The Synestheater , an interface within LiveGlide , allows the software coupling of the parameters of two complex artistic systems , each organized around a different sensory modality ( the aural , the visual , for instance ) .
Parameters from the visual system , LiveGlide , can be flexibly mapped to aural parameters in a composer ’s MAX patch .
But the mapping of aspects of the aural experience to properties of the visual experience in such a way that in performance an aesthetically satisfying experience is created is largely unexplored territory , beyond the obvious mapping of beat or amplitude in dance music to synchronized changes in the visual .
Often the visual is slaved to the aural , delivering an amplified entrainment , but not necessarily exploring other inter-relations possible between sight and sound .
We have , with the advent of sophisticated technologies emerging from the Protean sorcery of the CPU , come to a point where we are building new instruments — and instruments with which to build instruments ( such as MAX - MSP , Jitter , Audio Mulch , etc. ) — at a much faster rate than we are learning to play them in an artistically mature manner .
How many years does it take to master a musical instrument ?
An abstract animation technique ?
How can they meaningfully link ?
How can our perceptions be re-educated to encompass multiple sensory modalities and make magic in these unexplored , complex , subtle , infinitely variable synesthetic zones ?
And yet , we keep doing it , always on the verge of overwhelm , drowning or going with the flow .
As Terence McKenna put it ,
“ Information is loose on planet three … .
Earth is a place where language has literally become alive . ”
The cyberspirits are out of the bottle .
Chiasmatics 101 is a recommended course for psychedelic journeying .
And if all knowledge ultimately comes down to what we sense , what new things will we know in what new ways when we get just a little more in control , not of the waves , but of our ability to stay on our feet on the surfboard as we ride the rainbow serpent down the wave - ways into the great unknown , reached by connecting new pathways in the mind ?

The Palinists ’ bogus beefs about double standards reached farcical proportions at Fox News on the sleepy pre-Fourth Friday afternoon when word of her abdication hit the East .
The fill - in anchor demanded that his token Democratic stooge name another female politician who had suffered such “ disgraceful attacks ” as Palin .
When the obvious answer arrived  Hillary Clinton  the Fox host angrily protested that Clinton had never been attacked in “ a sexual way ” or “ about her children . ”
Americans have short memories , but it ’s hardly ancient history that conservative magazines portrayed Hillary Clinton as both a dominatrix cracking a whip and a broomstick - riding witch .
Or that Rush Limbaugh held up a picture of Chelsea Clinton on television to identify the “ White House dog . ”
Or that Palin ’s running mate , John McCain , told a sexual joke linking Hillary and Chelsea and Janet Reno .
Yet the same conservative commentariat that vilified both Clintons 24/7 now whines that Palin is receiving “ the kind of mauling ” that the media “ always reserve for conservative Republicans . ”
So said The Wall Street Journal editorial page last week .
You ’d never guess that The Journal had published six innuendo - laden books on real and imagined Clinton scandals , or that the Clintons had been a leading target of both Letterman and Leno monologues , not to mention many liberal editorial pages ( including that of The Times ) , for much of a decade .
Those Republicans who have not drunk the Palin Kool - Aid are apocalyptic for good reason .
She could well be their last presidential candidate standing .
Such would - be competitors as Mark Sanford , John Ensign and Newt Gingrich are too carnally compromised for the un-Clinton party .
Mike Huckabee is Palin-lite .
Tim Pawlenty , Bobby Jindal  really ?
That leaves the charisma - challenged Mitt Romney , precisely the kind of card - carrying Ivy League elitist Palinists loathe , no matter how hard he tries to cosmetically alter his history as a socially liberal fat - cat banker .
Palin would crush him like a bug .
She has the Teflon - coated stature among Republicans that Romney can only fantasize about .
Were Palin actually to secure the 2012 nomination , the result would be a fiasco for the G.O.P. akin to Goldwater 1964 , as the most relentless conservative Palin critic , David Frum , has predicted .
Or would it ?
No one thought Richard Nixon  a far less personable commodity than Palin  would come back either after his sour - grapes “ last press conference ” of 1962 .
But Democratic divisions and failures gave him his opportunity in 1968 .
With unemployment approaching 10 percent and a seemingly bottomless war in Afghanistan , you never know , as Palin likes to say , what doors might open .
It ’s more likely that she will never get anywhere near the White House , and not just because of her own limitations .
The Palinist “ real America ” is demographically doomed to keep shrinking .
But the emotion it represents is disproportionately powerful for its numbers .
It ’s an anger that Palin enjoyed stoking during her “ palling around with terrorists ” crusade against Obama on the campaign trail .
It ’s an anger that ’s curdled into self - martyrdom since Inauguration Day .
Its voice can be found in the postings at a Web site maintained by the fans of Mark Levin , the Obama hater who is , at this writing , the No.2 best - selling hardcover nonfiction writer in America .
( Glenn Beck is No.1 in paperback nonfiction . )
Politico surveyed them last week .
“ Bottomline , do you know of any way we can remove these idiots before this country goes down the crapper ? ” wrote one Levin fan .
“ I WILL HELP !!!
Should I buy a gun ? ”
Another called for a new American revolution , promising “ there will be blood . ”
These are the cries of a constituency that feels disenfranchised  by the powerful and the well - educated who gamed the housing bubble , by a news media it keeps being told is hateful , by the immigrants who have taken some of their jobs , by the African - American who has ended a white monopoly on the White House .
Palin is their born avatar .
She puts a happy , sexy face on ugly emotions , and she can solidify her followers ’ hold on a G.O.P. that has no leaders with the guts or alternative vision to stand up to them or to her .
For a week now , critics in both parties have had a blast railing at Palin .
It ’s good sport .
But just as the media muttering about those unseemly “ controversies ” rallied the fans of the King of Pop , so are Palin ’s political obituaries likely to jump - start her lucrative afterlife .

The following amendment was made on Monday 29 June 2009
The article below was amended to delete an incorrect statement that Sheikh Bin Mahfouz had sought to have his award for damages enforced in the state of New York .
This has been changed .
While various campaigning groups spring up left , right and centre with the aim of reforming Britain 's mangled political system , it seems that our friends abroad have already grown tired of waiting for us to get it right .
It is time , they have decided , to take matters into their own hands .
On Monday , the US House of Representatives passed a bill designed to protect American citizens ( and others within its jurisdiction ) from the effect of libel judgments handed down by the British high court .
The US Senate will now consider the legislation .
The bill erects a legal barricade for Americans against the growing problem of " libel tourism " , the phenomenon whereby foreigners sue each other in British courts , sometimes on the most spurious of grounds .
When the concept of a " gentleman 's good reputation " , devised in the 18th century to avoid the problem of duels , is applied uncritically in the globalised and connected 21st century , Her Majesty 's judges are cornered into handing down rulings which amaze her subjects .
We 've learned that a Ukrainian businessman can sue a Ukrainian news organisation in the British courts , over an article written in Ukranian on a website , all because that site may be viewed in the UK .
We find that an Icelandic investment bank can use all the resources of the British system to sue a Danish newspaper over articles published in Denmark .
With laws stacked overwhelmingly in favour of the claimant , the UK has become the jurisdiction of choice for anyone wishing to silence or suppress a journalist working anywhere in the world .
We have unwittingly allowed our courts to become an international libel tribunal , and free speech is suffering as a result .
But no longer for Americans .
Ever the exceptionalists , they are acting to ensure that at least their investigative journalists are protected .
The measures enacted , first by the state of New York and now mirrored at a federal level , seek to end the principle of comity , a legal reciprocity whereby libel damages awarded in the UK can be enforced in the US .
The New York laws were inspired by the case of Rachel Ehrenfeld , an academic who was sued in Britain by Sheikh Khalid Bin Mahfouz over claims made in her book Funding Evil .
The book was published in the USA in 2004 , but 23 copies had found their way onto British soil , via websites such as Amazon.com .
She was therefore sued in the UK .
The British courts ruled against Ehrenfeld .
It was this act that the American courts found " repugnant " , because in the US , the claims made in Funding Evil were protected by the first amendment .
Why does this matter ?
First , it signals a sharp divergence in the legal traditions of two countries with strong , shared values .
There is no doubting that the US 's approach to human rights is both flawed and inconsistent , but in the case of the freedom to write , our American cousins have chosen a much more open and democratic approach .
When the principle of comity is rendered void , yet another sinew of our already strained " special relationship " is severed .
Worse yet , the bill just approved by the House of Representatives has been branded the " libel terrorism bill " .
As we found last year when the government froze the assets of Icelandic Banks , calling a friendly country a " terrorist " – even just as rhetoric , or hyperbole – usually provokes some sort of grave diplomatic incident .
And yet , American politicians are doing just this .
Our legal system is slowly becoming utterly discredited abroad .
The continued passage of this bill must be a clarion call to our own legislators .
Reform is long overdue – libel tourism in its current form has existed at least as long as the Labour government .
Unfortunately , it is only in this parliamentary session that the eyes of British politicians come to focus on the problem .
The next report of the culture , media and sport select committee , due later this summer , will examine the problem .
Committee members such as Paul Farrelly ( Labour ) , Philip Davies and Chairman John Whittingdale ( both Conservative ) clearly understand what is at stake .
However , in recent evidence to the committee , the justice minister Jack Straw said he was " yet to be convinced there was a significant problem " .
To campaigners witnessing the creation of hostile laws in the US Congress , Straw 's view is surprising and disconcerting .
We must hope that the CMS select committee can assemble enough evidence to change his mind , and quickly .
The publication of their report cannot come soon enough .
Amarok finally switched to git today after many weeks of discussion and preparation .
Our part of KDE SVN has been made read - only and commits should be made to the repository at http://gitorious.org/+kde-developers/amarok/amarok from now on .
We can hopefully work out all the problems soon so the rest of KDE ( except translations ) can follow asap .
Please report problems you encounter and help us get documentation up to date .
Oh btw : Perfect birthday present , KDE 😀
One millionth commit and move to git on my birthday rocks !

Helen Redmond explains the terrible consequences of the " war on drugs " on the life - improving potential of medical marijuana .
IN PRESIDENT
Obama 's first virtual town - hall meeting , questions about legalizing marijuana ranked at the top of the " green jobs , " " financial stability " and " budget " sections , and came in a close second in the health care section .
Obama took up the question , saying voters wanted to know " whether legalizing marijuana would improve the economy and job creation " -- then joking , " I do n't know what this says about the online audience . "
After the laughter subsided , Obama 's answer was " no " to legalizing marijuana .
But there 's nothing to laugh about .
A person is arrested every 38 seconds in the U.S. for violating marijuana laws .
In 2007 , police arrested an estimated 872,720 people , the highest annual total ever recorded , according to statistics compiled by the FBI .
Over the last 10 years , close to 15 million people have been arrested ; 89 percent of them were charged with possession only .
A marijuana conviction has given millions of Americans criminal records , and deprived them of jobs , housing and financial aid to attend school .
A medical cannabis dispensary in San Francisco
There is an enormous disconnect between laws that are enforced so broadly and ruthlessly and yet are viewed as pointless by large numbers of the population .
Marijuana is the most popular and widely used illicit drug .
Millions of Americans have smoked it despite its illegality , including Obama who , when asked if he inhaled ( a litmus - test question since Bill Clinton lied and said he did n't ) , deadpanned , " I inhaled frequently .
That was the point . "
This is a country suffused in cannabis culture , from hip - hop artists defiantly smoking blunts to the Golden Globe - nominated Showtime series Weeds .
There are millions of Americans for whom smoking marijuana is as normal and natural as drinking a beer or a glass of wine .
Marijuana is one of the safest drugs .
No one has ever died from using it , and its effects are mostly benign .
The federal government , however , has launched a campaign of myths , distortions and outright lies to demonize marijuana as a dangerous and unsafe drug .
Among the " reefer madness " claims about marijuana : it is a " gateway " to harder drugs , it is highly addictive , it destroys long - term memory , and it causes lung cancer and mental illness .
All of these assertions have been refuted by decades of scientific research and by the direct experience of millions of people who smoke marijuana and suffer no negative health problems .
What else to read For additional reading on medical marijuana , visit the Drug Policy Alliance Network Web site .
Read more about Will Foster 's case at the Medical Marijuana Project Web site .
Marijuana Myths Marijuana Facts : A Review Of The Scientific Evidence , by Lynn Zimmer and John P. Morgan , provides a meticulous and concise survey of scientific studies to cut through the lies told about marijuana .
MARIJUANA IS also medicine and is taken by thousands of sick and dying patients to ease the nausea and vomiting induced by chemotherapy , reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma , and treat peripheral neuropathy .
The medicinal properties of cannabis have been widely researched in Europe and Canada , and there is little debate in the scientific community anymore -- marijuana successfully treats a range of health conditions .
It 's impossible to conduct marijuana research in the U.S. because the Drug Enforcement Agency ( DEA ) classifies it as a Schedule 1 Drug - - drugs in this category are deemed to have high abuse potential and no accepted medical use .
But in a review of the evidence , the American Institute of Medicine found , " The accumulated data indicate a potential therapeutic value for cannabinoid drugs , particularly for symptoms such as pain relief , control of nausea and vomiting , and appetite stimulation . "
The report concluded , " The adverse effects of marijuana are within the range of effects tolerated for other medications . "
Even the conservative American Medical Association supports the use of medical marijuana .
But in the government 's " take all prisoners " war against medical marijuana , the first targets were doctors .
In 1997 , former drug czar Barry McCaffrey threatened to revoke prescription licenses or criminally prosecute physicians who recommended marijuana to their patients .
In a 2002 class - action lawsuit , a federal appeals court unanimously upheld the right of doctors to recommend marijuana to their patients .
The ruling protected doctors against prosecution , but not patients who actually carried out the recommendation and used marijuana .
Meanwhile , the federal government was losing the battle against medical marijuana , with 13 states passing laws allowing for " compassionate use . "
California was the first state to legalize marijuana sales to people with a doctor 's prescription .
Licensed medical marijuana dispensaries were opened , and the law allowed patients to grow plants for personal consumption .
The Feds and the DEA were outraged and fought any change to marijuana 's illegal status at the federal level .
In its 2005 Gonzales v. Raich decision , the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could prosecute medical marijuana patients even in states with compassionate use laws .
In effect , federal law would trump and nullify state law .
The raids and arrests began with the new targets -- medical marijuana dispensaries , hospices , and the homes of sick and terminally ill patients .
One of these patients , Suzanne Pfeil , a paraplegic , was sleeping when 20 armed federal agents raided her medical marijuana hospice and held assault rifles to the heads of patients and caregivers .
Here is her description of the raid :
At dawn , I awoke to five federal agents pointing assault rifles at my head .
I did not hear them come in because my respirator is rather loud .
They yelled at me to put my hands in the air and stand up .
I tried to explain to them that I needed to put my hands down on the bed in order to sit up because I am paralyzed .
They again shouted at me to sit up .
I pointed to my crutches and braces , and I normally use a wheelchair .
At that point , they ripped the covers off the bed and finally realized what I was trying to explain amid their shouts and guns .
They handcuffed me behind my back and left me on the bed .
Will Foster has severe rheumatoid arthritis and was prescribed narcotics to manage the pain , but could n't tolerate the side effects .
Foster tried marijuana , and the pain and swelling subsided .
He grew marijuana in the basement of his home .
In 1995 , the police knocked on his door with a search warrant .
Behind a locked steel door in the basement , they found Foster 's marijuana plants and arrested him .
Even though Foster , a father of two children and successful computer programmer , had only $ 30 in the house and no evidence of any sales , the jury convicted him of cultivation and intent to distribute .
He was sentenced to 93 years in prison .
Foster said of his conviction :
My medical use of marijuana never interfered with my work .
I ran a successful business .
I told my conservative doctor what I was doing , and while he did not really agree with it because of the health risk of smoking , he witnessed my positive results .
I was minding my own business , taking care of my health and family .
What was I doing to anybody that got me 93 years ?
Foster fought the conviction , served four years in prison , and was finally paroled in 2001 .
The majority of the public opposes these violent , paramilitary SWAT team raids and outrageous prison sentences .
Support for medical marijuana is so high that after a federal raid on the Wo / Men 's Alliance for Medical Marijuana ( WAMM ) in Santa Cruz , the mayor and city council permitted WAMM to publicly hand out marijuana to its patients at City Hall .
Vice Mayor Emily Reilly said , " It 's just absolutely loathsome to me that federal money , energy and staff time would be used to harass people like this . "
Even the Santa Cruz sheriff 's office opposed the raids .
MEDICAL MARIJUANA patients won a victory last month when Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would end the raids of marijuana dispensaries .
The Obama administration 's position on medical marijuana is a welcome and long overdue change to that of the Bush administration .
Obama laid out his position during the campaign .
" My attitude is if the science and the doctors suggest that the best palliative care and the way to relieve pain and suffering is medical marijuana , then that 's something I 'm open to , " he said .
" There 's no difference between that and morphine when it comes to just giving people relief from pain . "
But just one week later , the DEA raided Emmalyn's California Cannabis Clinic , a licensed medical marijuana dispensary in San Francisco .
Bill Piper , director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance Network , asked , " Does n't the Obama administration have more important issues to deal with right now ? "
For more than 30 years , the federal government has been waging the " war on drugs . "
The criminalization of marijuana and the prosecution of users is the leading edge of the war , and functions as a conveyer belt that delivers hundreds of thousands of people into the criminal justice system , year after year .
It 's not possible to have a drug war on the scale that currently exists if marijuana is legalized .
This is what the DEA and the forces that benefit from the drug war fear the most .
They need the war - on - drugs hysteria to justify the DEA 's existence and the more than $ 20 billion a year spent to enforce prohibition .
The war on drugs also plays an important role ideologically by reinforcing racism .
Drug dealers and users , particularly Latinos and African Americans , have been convenient scapegoats for society 's social and economic problems .
But cracks in the cannabis control system are wider than ever .
A Zogby Poll conducted this year showed that 58 percent of West Coast respondents agreed that marijuana should be " taxed and regulated like alcohol and cigarettes . "
On the East Coast , 48 percent supported legalizing marijuana .
A CBS / New York Times poll showed that 41 percent of Americans favor legalizing marijuana .
Canonical , the commercial organization behind the Ubuntu variant of the Debian distribution of Linux , said today that it has certified its Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition to run on all 17 configurations of Hewlett - Packard 's sixth - generation of ProLiant servers .
As El Reg was crabbing about earlier this week , HP does not officially and fully support Ubuntu , as it does commercial Linux distributions from Red Hat and Novell .
With the Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating systems from those two respective vendors , HP has signed OEM deals that allow it to sell and front - end installation and technical support on behalf of those Linux disties , and the parties divvy up the money so they each get a cut of the action .
And as I explained earlier this week , HP has for many years used Debian Linux on internal projects and customized products and therefore has a support organization of its own in place and has offered CarePack support contracts for Debian , just as it does for RHEL and SLES .
But even though Ubuntu is itself a variant of Debian , that support organization does not extend to Ubuntu .
That 's why Canonical has stepped up to the plate and certified that Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition will run on the new ProLiant G6 servers , whether they are using Xeon or Opteron processors .
With HP being the volume leader in terms of shipments in the server space ( with about 30 per cent of worldwide shipments ) , the certification is the second and perhaps most important step in getting Ubuntu sitting side by side , in terms of respect and support , with RHEL and SLES .
The first step , of course , is for HP to work with the upstream Linux communities that create Ubuntu , other Debian releases , Asianux , Fedora , and openSUSE to make sure that drivers for the peripherals and features in its servers are written for the Linux kernel and its related systems software stack .
And according to Jeffrey Wade , open source and Linux marketing manager at HP , this is the approach that HP has been taking with other Linux distros for years and there are no plans at this time to change that .
While conceding that Canonical 's certification of Ubuntu on the ProLiants was progress , Wade said only that HP would " continue to look at the opportunity " of providing its own support for Ubuntu on ProLiants in conjunction with Canonical , but made no commitments whatsoever to do this .
This could take some time .
The Asianux distribution of Linux ( a joint development project between the Chinese Red Flag , Japanese Miracle , and Vietnamese VietSoftware Linuxes that runs on x64 , Itanium , and Power processors ) has been certified by Asianux for more than four years and is still not put up side - by - side , even in the Asian market , with RHEL and SLES .
And as Wade explains it , the cost of fully supporting any Linux is high and the numbers do not work unless HP does a certain amount of business .
Prior to this announcement , Canonical did testing on selected models of ProLiant servers , and it merely said that they were validated , but after HP has reviewed the compatibility tests on ProLiant G6 iron done by Canonical to ensure that the iron and OS play well together , Canonical felt assured that it could call them certified .
It will be interesting to see if the certification by Canonical makes any difference in the uptake of the server edition of Ubuntu 9.04 .
It will probably take until the next Long Term Support ( LTS ) release comes out perhaps in April 2010 for this to really sink in to the server space .
HP is helping the cause along a little by releasing a ProLiant Support Pack for Ubuntu , a collection of agents , drivers , and utilities that help Ubuntu integrate better with the system management and monitoring tools on the ProLiant machines .
This was an important step toward official support for RHEL and SLES many years ago .
But it is by no means a guarantee of any intentions by HP . ®
On April 22 , visitors to Apple 's iPhone App Store found a new -- and very twisted -- offering : " Baby Shaker . "
For 99 cents , you could download the " game , " the object of which was to silence an animated baby 's cries by shaking the iPhone until two red X's appear over the infant 's eyes .
" See how long you can endure his or her adorable cries before you just have to find a way to quiet the baby down , " the instructions read .
Two days later , and shortly before Apple announced its 1 billionth App Store download , the company took down the app and apologized .
No word on any resulting shakeup that may have occurred in Apple 's quality control department .

I came across this approximate statement today :
Lisp - 2 programmers avoid using the same names for functions and variables .
That did n't sound right to me .
I use Common Lisp , and I could n't come up with any personal examples of avoiding that practice .
I also could n't remember actively thinking about the issue at all ; I just use whatever variable names seem natural .
Then I tried to think of examples when I did use variables with the same name as a function : I often use the variable name list , and I often have variables with the same name as a slot accessor ( I do n't use the foo - of convention ) .
But it has n't been an active , conscious decision when writing , and it does n't jump out at me when re-reading as some kind of clash .
So my survey question is this :
Are you are a Lisp - 2 programmer , and do you avoid using the same names for functions and variables ?
Let me know .

Here is a short summary of the results .
( Adds Fox comment )
NEW YORK , July 30 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. judge on Thursday denied a bid by Fox News Network LLC seeking details from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve about the central bank ’s loans to companies affected by the financial crisis .
The owner of the Fox Business cable network made an initial request for documents in November last year under the Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) about the companies and funds they received between August 2007 and November 2008 .
Both parties had filed motions with U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein in Manhattan federal court to rule in their favor after Fox filed its request to the court in January .
“ I rule that one document , which the Board determined is not a record , is indeed , a record .
The Board shall identify this document and either produce it or claim an exemption , ” Hellerstein said in a written order .
“ In all other respects , I grant the Board ’s motion and deny Fox ’s motion , finding that the Board performed an adequate search and that Exemption 4 permits the Board not to disclose the documents that Fox seeks . ”
Under Exemption 4 of the FOIA , an agency must demonstrate that the information sought is a “ trade secret ” or “ commercial or financial ” in character and “ obtained from a person ” and “ privileged and confidential . ”
Fox said in a statement in response to the ruling : “ We respect the judge ’s decision , but we will probably appeal . ”
The Fed has been a critical player in financial rescue packages for companies .
It also opened up its discount window to a wider range of entities in an attempt to provide more liquidity to the financial sector .
Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp NWSA .

Every once in a while a captivating piece of historical information is uncovered , but time has often taken its toll and that information is lost to time itself .
The hours and dedication required to restore its glory frequently means these items never reveal themselves to subsequent generations , but with a race as magical as the Tour de France comes passionate people dedicated to bringing history alive .
That ’s exactly what has happened with the story of the 1930 Tour de France – now being re-told through a series of limited edition prints .
Australian organisation The Cycling History Collection has just launched a range of 15 images from the year Frenchman Andre Leducq beat Italian Learco Guerra to the Tour title .
The series of images is a reminder of just how popular the Tour was , even in those early years , with thousands of people lining the streets when the only way to see the event was being there .
Moments captured include Alfredo Binda ’s
Tour debut , breakaways on the famed 2556 m Galibier in the Alps , Charles Pelissier on his way to an amazing eight stage victories and the aftermath of Leonida Frascarelli crashing out of the race .
Leonida Frascarelli , team - mate to second overall Learco Guerra and dual stage winner Alfredo Binda , abandoned on stage seven from Bordeaux to Hendaye after a fall .
Not only are the images an amazing piece of history , but also the story behind them .
The collection has been brought back to life after a group - led by six - time Tour rider Stephen Hodge - purchased the original lanterns from an auction of Sir Hubert Opperman ’s estate in 2004 .
“ We believe that Hubert Opperman , who rode the 1928 and 1931 editions of the Tour , used these lanterns for showing in town hall meetings that would have helped him raise the money to fund the Australian team to the 1931 event , ” reveals Hodge .
Stage 9 - Col du Tourmalet :
Two riders were alone on the two major climbs , Benoit Faure - who won the KOM on both the Aubisque and Tourmalet - and André Leducq , both believed to be pictured here on Tourmalet .
A further eight images that were retrievable from the batch of 41 purchased are expected to be released at a later date .
Starting at $ AU295 for unframed copies , the collection is limited to 250 prints per image , with a certificate of authenticity issued for each print .

Written by Nick Riganas
VICTORIA faces a fire season of unprecedented danger , with the states fire officials expecting conditions to be worse than last summer when more than 170 lives were lost to bushfires .
Less than six months after the Black Saturday disaster , a leaked Department of Sustainability and Environment report warns the next fire season could start as early as November and that fires will burn with greater intensity this summer .
The report , written by department fire management officer Paul Brockhoff , says the bush has dried out to such an extent that official methods for predicting fire behaviour will be less accurate , and will tend to underestimate the threat .
Singling out Melbourne and its hinterlands as being among the states driest areas , Mr Brockhoff used impassioned language to illustrate the extreme danger posed by the coming summer .
The prospect we are looking at is not just another above - average fire season with above - normal losses or risks to life and property ,  he said .
Four Year From Now Plans By Bryan Caplan
In the thirties , governments had Four Year Plans .
Today , they have Four Year from Now Plans – big policies that basically do n’t kick in until the next election .
Waxman - Markey lets emissions grow normally until 2012 .
When I criticized the House ’s health care plan , several defenders quickly pointed out that its payroll tax does n’t kick in until 2013 .
Why would politicians push Four Year From Now Plans , instead of “ immediate action ” ?
At first glance , retrospective voting provides a good explanation .
In the retrospective voter model , citizens vote on the basis of recent economic performance .
In this framework , it seems natural for politicians to delay costs until the next election .
But that ’s not quite right .
At least in the standard version of retrospective voting , benefits and costs are symmetric .
So politicians who delay get neither credit nor blame for their actions .
This might make sense if a politician favors a policy that costs more than its worth – and is willing to spend his valuable time pushing legislation with no electoral benefit .
Maybe that ’s what ’s going on , but I think I ’ve got a better story : Voters give politicians immediate credit for “ doing something ” about a problem , but only get upset about negative side effects when they actually happen .
( Added bonus :
The longer you wait , the less likely voters are to realize that “ doing something ” had negative side effects ) .
In this setting , politicians want to delay whether or not a policy costs more than its worth .
It ’s a nice way to get the political gravy without the political grief – or at least delay the grief until it ’s too late for electoral punishment .
You might call this a “ voter ignorance ” story , but as usual , I call it full - blown irrationality .
If you ’re going to do retrospective voting , it ’s crazy to support politicians who willfully increase the lag between action and consequence .
When your agent blatantly tries to game your rules to win your favor , the rational response is to punish him for his opportunism , not reward him for his “ statesmanship . ”
A clever Team Fortress 2 fan printed out and sent the coupon from a fake catalog ad that Valve created for one of The Scout 's new items .
Valve actually responded , and they did so not only in style , but without breaking character .
Remember the fake catalog advertisement Valve produced for The Scout 's Force - A - Nature gun ?
There was a coupon at the bottom of it , just like you used to find in the catalogs common back when people actually used the mail to buy things .
" MAIL COUPON NOW , " it said , and one clever TF2 fan did just that and mailed it Valve .
He or she probably got a chuckle out of it but did n't expect Valve to write back .
Valve did .
They did n't just send a cheeky letter , though .
They sent one that 's done up to look like stationary for the fictional Mann Co. that produces all the weapons , with a company logo and a sly stamped signature from Saxton Hale , the CEO of Mann Co himself .
The actual content of the letter is full of the clever humor that Valve seems to pack into everything TF2 nowadays , and even provided a hint about The Ambassador , the Spy unlockable announced yesterday .
There 's also a mention of TF2's April Fools Joke , The Jarate , a throwable jar full of urine .
Confirmation of The Sniper 's next item ?
I hope so .

It 's funny , sure , but if this is how Valve is spending its precious work hours these days , Half - Life 2 : Episode 3 is never going to come out .
When we finally sat opposite Doctor Who 's Russell T. Davies at Comic Con , there was only one question we were burning to ask him :
Why exactly is the blonde ingenue Rose Tyler the most special of all the Doctor 's companions ?
Advertisement
This was part of a group interview with Davies and director Euros Lyn , where we were lucky enough to be able to ask some questions .
Oh , and if you still have n't watched the most recent Torchwood miniseries , A ) You are wasting your life on vain pursuits , and B ) There 's a spoiler for them below .
Why is Rose the most special ?
So we had the impression , watching Davies ' era of Doctor Who , that he regarded Rose Tyler as the most important , or most special , of the Doctor 's companions .
She 's come back a couple of times , she was referenced constantly in the season after she left , and she got to keep her own duplicate of David Tennant 's Doctor .
So we asked Davies why Rose deserves to be so extraordinary .
He replied :
I do n't think she has been [ treated as special ] .
I do n't think I feel any more special when I 'm writing Rose than when I 'm writing any of the others .
I think there 's an iconography about Billie Piper .
When the programme came back , it was the biggest advertised , most hyped - up programme in the world [ and she was at the center of the imagery ] .
I 'd never prefer her to Donna or Martha when writing her .
But she was enormously popular and so — let 's be blunt — every time I brought her back , the ratings went up .
It 's my job to make people come back to watch this .
Sometimes people roll their eyes and go , " Oh , you 've got another returning character . "
[ To which I respond ] " Yeah , leave me alone with my millions , thank you very much . "
So you know , it simply works .
Plus we like Billie ...
So simply by dint of being her , she 's come back the most often .
I think that was a very special chemistry between her and Chris and between her and David , and it 's very fondly remembered .
Advertisement
Adds Euros Lyn : " In that first series , she was the Doctor 's equal , and equally as interesting as the Doctor , which was a revelation in the Doctor Who world . "
The death of Ianto
And of course , RTD addressed the ongoing controversy about the death of Ianto Jones in the most recent Torchwood miniseries , " Children Of Earth . "
And Davies ' comments will not appease the fans who feel he 's been callous and dismissive .
He called the backlash " massively exaggerated " :
You know the campaign to send [ packets of ] coffee [ to the BBC ] to save Ianto 's life ?
There 's a campaign , because he was a coffee boy .
But do you know how many packets of coffee they 've received so far ?
Nine .
So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people , but they are nine .
And they have the proof in the office , they are nine .
And so when you say " Lots of people hated it , I challenge you [ to prove it . ]
And that 's the way you talk from online reaction , which is why I never follow online reaction .
It 's just untrue .
Advertisement
Director Euros Lyn added that it was important to show the " moral cost " that Jack has to pay to defeat the 456 , as part of a story about " sacrifice and death . "
Not taking the characters to that place would " sell them short . "
Children Of Earth was risky
Davies said he was acutely aware what a risky proposition " Children Of Earth " was — and not just because of its heavy political themes .
He 's always aware , working for the BBC , that he 's spending the public 's money ( collected thorugh license fees ) to make television .
And he insisted that this miniseries had to air consecutively over five nights , not spread out over five weeks , because of the way it was structured .
The bosses at the BBC kept changing , and the new bosses would try to change Davies ' mind and switch it to running every Friday — but Davies stuck to his guns .
And he was terrified it would fail , and he'd have " damaged " a whole week of BBC One programming .
Advertisement
" I thought it was good , and I was proud of it , " said Davies .
If it had flopped and everyone had hated it , " I was willing to wear my martyrdom through Comic Con . "
Advertisement
What 's next for Torchwood ?
Just like everyone else we 've talked to , Davies was fairly uncertain about the future of Torchwood , despite its great ratings .
But he did say he felt the show had " found its tone , " so future outings would definitely be one continuous story - possibly five episodes , possibly longer .
But definitely , there 'll be no return to " monster of the week " type stories .
He liked the way the miniseries had " Torchwood " followed by the subtitle " Children Of Earth , " making it part of the show 's title .
So that 'll probably happen again next time .
Advertisement
Added Davies : " Torchwood has become an umbrella for telling a good story .
This was n't anything to do with Cardiff , or the rift , " or any other standard elements of the show .
If the show does come back , " everyone who survived " will return as well .
But the show will also do what " Children Of Earth " did with John Frobisher and the other new supporting cast — introduce a whole new set of characters .
Davies does n't believe in replacing a character after he / she is killed off , because it seems heartless , like buying a new puppy right after your dog dies .
That 's why , in " Children Of Earth , " he deliberately introduced a " replacement " for Owen — and then shot him .

Mexican illegal immigration falls 60 % in 1 year
July 23 , 2009
Apparently deterred by rising unemployment in the U.S. , the number of Mexican immigrants who crossed the border in the past year dropped sharply to the lowest level in a decade , while undocumented workers already here are opting to stay .
The analysis of census data from the U.S. and Mexican governments , being released today by the Pew Hispanic Center , highlights the impact of the economic downturn on Mexican immigrants , many of whom enter the United States illegally .
The study found that immigrants arriving from Mexico fell by 249,000 from March 2008 to March 2009 , down nearly 60 percent from the previous year .
As a result , the annual inflow of immigrants is now 175,000 , having steadily decreased from a peak of 653,000 in 2005 , before the bursting of the housing bubble dried up construction and other low - wage jobs .
The total population of Mexican - born immigrants in the U.S. also edged lower in the past year , from 11.6 million to 11.5 million , according to the study by Pew , an independent research group .
Up to 85 percent of immigrants are believed to be in the country illegally .
Immigrants already in the U.S. are opting not to return to Mexico .
Many of them are betting the economy will improve , as well as perhaps hoping that immigration reform can pave the way for U.S. citizenship , said Jeffrey Passel , a senior demographer at Pew who co-authored the study .
According to the data , the level of Mexican migrants who return home from the U.S. and other countries each year , about 450,000 , has remained largely unchanged .
“ There ’s not a lot in Mexico to go back to because , if anything , the Mexican economy is doing worse , ” Passel said .
“ But also , in light of enforcement that has made it more dangerous and expensive to get into the U.S. , once people get here , they ’re reluctant to leave . ”
Passel said that although the immigration shifts may be temporary depending on the length of the U.S. recession , some of the effects could be longer - lasting .
He noted that fewer Hispanics coming to the U.S. could further slow minority - population growth here because higher fertility levels among Hispanics are driving much of the recent increases .
Mexico ’s population also is graying and its labor force shrinking , which could mean a better job picture in that country due to less worker competition in the next five to 10 years .
That could mean reduced immigration levels from Mexico to the United States after the economy recovers , Passel said .
In 2008 , the number of Mexicans apprehended by the U.S. Border Patrol , 662,000 , was 40 percent below the peak of 1.1 million in 2004 , reflecting in part the sharp decline in the number of new immigrants arriving .
Mexico is the origin of most U.S. immigrants , accounting for one - third of foreign - born residents and two - thirds of Hispanic immigrants .
About one in 10 people born in Mexico now lives in the U.S .
The total number of apprehensions by the Border Patrol in 2008 - 724,000 - was at the lowest level since 1973 .
More than 90 percent of people detained by the Border Patrol are Mexican .
The findings come as the Obama administration has pledged to take up immigration law this year .
A key Democrat in the effort , Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , has said he hopes to have a bill ready by Labor Day .

Some prisoners say they watched fellow detainees being beaten to death by guards in overcrowded , stinking holding pens .
Others say they had their fingernails ripped off or were forced to lick filthy toilet bowls .
The accounts of prison abuse in Iran ’s postelection crackdown  relayed by relatives and on opposition Web sites  have set off growing outrage among Iranians , including some prominent conservatives .
More bruised corpses have been returned to families in recent days , and some hospital officials have told human rights workers that they have seen evidence that well over 100 protesters have died since the vote .
On Tuesday , the government released 140 prisoners in one of several conciliatory gestures aimed at deflecting further criticism .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad issued a letter urging the head of the judiciary to show “ Islamic mercy ” to the detainees , and on Monday Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , personally intervened and closed an especially notorious detention center .
But there are signs that widespread public anger persists , and that it is not confined to those who took to the streets crying fraud after Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s landslide victory last month .
Several conservatives have said the abuse suggests a troubling lack of accountability , and they have hinted at a link with Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s recent willingness to defy even the venerated Ayatollah Khamenei .

Ellen DeGeneres Delivers Moving Speech at Tulane ’s Commencement
Ellen DeGeneres returned to her hometown of New Orleans last Monday to deliver a moving commencement speech to the 2009 graduates at Tulane University , the Katrina class .
She joined honorary degree recipient Harry Connick Jr. as the honored celebrity guests at the event .
Tulane President Scott Cowen presented DeGeneres with the Tulane University President ’s Medal for her work to raise money and awareness for New Orleans after Katrina .
Ellen ’s talk was equal parts funny , serious , touching and memorable .
From her first greeting to the robe - clad graduates ( “ Look at you … .
Usually when you ’re wearing a robe at 10 in the morning , it means you ’ve given up ” ) , to re-telling the sad story behind her the famous “ phone call to God ” joke that got her a spot on The Tonight Show , to jokes about being gay ( “ When you ’re older , most of you will be gay ” ) , it was all priceless .
After her address , which she concluded with lyrics from Lady Gaga ’s “ Just Dance , ” Ellen proceeded to dance through the audience bringing the graduates and their families joyously to their feet .

DNA confirms coastal trek to Australia
DNA evidence linking Indian tribes to Australian Aboriginal people supports the theory humans arrived in Australia from Africa via a southern coastal route through India , say researchers .
The research , lead by Dr Raghavendra Rao from the Anthropological Survey of India , is published in the current edition of BMC Evolutionary Biology .
One theory is that modern humans arrived in Australia via an inland route through central Asia but Rao says most scientists believe modern humans arrived via the coast of South Asia .
But he says there has never been any evidence to confirm a stop - off in India until now .
Rao and colleagues sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of 966 people from traditional tribes in India .
They report that several of the Indians studied had two regions of their mitochondrial DNA that were identical to those found in modern day Australian Aboriginal people .
The team compared Indian sequences with those from Aboriginal Australians collected in past studies .
Rao and colleagues used computer programs to predict that a common ancestor existed , between the Indian population and Aboriginal Australians , up to 50,000 years ago .
Skeletal remains , dating back between 40 - 60,000 years from Lake Mungo in New South Wales , also support the theory that modern human arrived in Australia at least as far back as this , he says .
Link through mothers
Rao says he and colleagues sequenced mitochondrial DNA because it is the best type of DNA to use for ancestral studies .
Mitochondrial DNA is passed on by mothers only and does not change much over time .
Evolutionary biologist Dr Jeremy Austin , of the University of Adelaide , says the new data " definitely supports the coastal route hypothesis " .
He says that before this research was published , genetic markers from Aboriginal Australians were known to be closely related to markers from traditional Indian and South East Asian peoples .
" But this is the first time people have been able to find these exact same mitochondrial DNA types inside and outside Australia , " says Austin .
He says now that a mitochondrial DNA link has been found between tribal Indian populations and Aboriginal Australians it would be interesting to see if a connection exists through the Y chromosome , where DNA is passed only from fathers to sons .
Human beings are all crazy .
And if you tap on our brains just a little , we get so crazy that even other humans notice .
Anosognosics are one of my favorite examples of this ; people with right - hemisphere damage whose left arms become paralyzed , and who deny that their left arms are paralyzed , coming up with excuses whenever they 're asked why they can't move their arms .
A truly wonderful form of brain damage - it disables your ability to notice or accept the brain damage .
If you 're told outright that your arm is paralyzed , you 'll deny it .
All the marvelous excuse - generating rationalization faculties of the brain will be mobilized to mask the damage from your own sight .
As Yvain summarized :
After a right - hemisphere stroke , she lost movement in her left arm but continuously denied it .
When the doctor asked her to move her arm , and she observed it not moving , she claimed that it was n't actually her arm , it was her daughter's .
Why was her daughter 's arm attached to her shoulder ?
The patient claimed her daughter had been there in the bed with her all week .
Why was her wedding ring on her daughter 's hand ?
The patient said her daughter had borrowed it .
Where was the patient 's arm ?
The patient " turned her head and searched in a bemused way over her left shoulder " .
I find it disturbing that the brain has such a simple macro for absolute denial that it can be invoked as a side effect of paralysis .
That a single whack on the brain can both disable a left - side motor function , and disable our ability to recognize or accept the disability .
Other forms of brain damage also seem to both cause insanity and disallow recognition of that insanity - for example , when people insist that their friends have been replaced by exact duplicates after damage to face - recognizing areas .
And it really makes you wonder ...
... what if we all have some form of brain damage in common , so that none of us notice some simple and obvious fact ?
As blatant , perhaps , as our left arms being paralyzed ?
Every time this fact intrudes into our universe , we come up with some ridiculous excuse to dismiss it - as ridiculous as " It 's my daughter 's arm " - only there 's no sane doctor watching to pursue the argument any further .
( Would we all come up with the same excuse ? )
If the " absolute denial macro " is that simple , and invoked that easily ...
Now , suppose you built an AI .
You wrote the source code yourself , and so far as you can tell by inspecting the AI 's thought processes , it has no equivalent of the " absolute denial macro " - there 's no point damage that could inflict on it the equivalent of anosognosia .
It has redundant differently - architected systems , defending in depth against cognitive errors .
If one system makes a mistake , two others will catch it .
The AI has no functionality at all for deliberate rationalization , let alone the doublethink and denial - of - denial that characterizes anosognosics or humans thinking about politics .
Inspecting the AI 's thought processes seems to show that , in accordance with your design , the AI has no intention to deceive you , and an explicit goal of telling you the truth .
And in your experience so far , the AI has been , inhumanly , well - calibrated ; the AI has assigned 99 % certainty on a couple of hundred occasions , and been wrong exactly twice that you know of .
Arguably , you now have far better reason to trust what the AI says to you , than to trust your own thoughts .
And now the AI tells you that it 's 99.9 % sure - having seen it with its own cameras , and confirmed from a hundred other sources - even though ( it thinks ) the human brain is built to invoke the absolute denial macro on it - that ...
... what ?
What 's the craziest thing the AI could tell you , such that you would be willing to believe that the AI was the sane one ?

A couple of magazine writers have used a commercial satellite to locate a mysterious pirate arms shipment bound for Sudan .
Back in September , Somali pirates boosted the MV Faina , a Ukrainian cargo ship laden with rocket - propelled grenades , anti-aircraft guns , and T - 72 tanks .
The pirates then scored a major ransom in return for the arms and the vessel .
But one mystery lingered : the true destination of the Faina ’s cargo .
Kenya 's government said the weapons and munitions were for its military , but observers speculated that they were intended for the breakaway government of South Sudan .
With the aid of some satellite analysis , Jane 's Defence Weekly has the answer :
The weapons were part of a series of weapons shipments bound for South Sudan .
JDW Middle East / Africa editor Lauren Gelfand and Jane 's imagery analyst Allison Puccioni drew on extensive satellite imagery to track the movement of the T - 72s from the port of Mombasa , Kenya ; while Jane 's does not conclude definitively that the tanks from the Faina ended up in South Sudan , the analysis does show a pattern of tanks making their way north to Sudan .
Jane 's also confirmed previous arms shipments from Ukraine .
It 's yet another example of how commercial imagery satellites are allowing private citizens to gather intelligence in ways that only government - funded spies could do before .
George Mason University doctoral candidate Curtis Melvin uses such snapshots form space to plot out North Korea 's military bases .
The * News * of Pakistan found pictures of U.S. drones parked on Pakistani runways — in a Google Earth cache .
Images captured by DigitalGlobe satellites in March 2009 showed 33 tanks parked at Kahawa Barracks northeast of Nairobi ( pictured ) .
In parallel , satellite imagery captured from southern Sudan showed tracked vehicles , parked under camouflage , at a Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) compound northeast of Juba , the capital of South Sudan .
Jane 's observed that SPLA attempts to conceal the location " were deliberate and masterful , but dimensional analysis , tracked - vehicle scarring and the staging of three vehicles in a tactical perimeter established the concealed vehicles as tanks . "
All told , Jane 's estimates that South Sudan has ordered around 100 main battle tanks .
Observers have worried that an arms race is now under way between the Khartoum government and the government of South Sudan .
A comprehensive peace deal was reached in 2005 after two decades of civil war , but that agreement has recently frayed .
A referendum in 2011 opens the possibility that South Sudan may secede .

Where are my legs ?
I know very little people ( if any ) that do n't like chocolate or bananas .
The combination of both is even better , so when I ended up with an extra tart shell from my last Daring Bakers challenge , I knew exactly what to do with it .
It 's hard to go wrong with chocolate and bananas .
If you have already a tart shell frozen or if you are using a store - bought one , this dessert comes together in no time at all and can easily be made on any busy week night .
If you are going to make the dough from scratch , than you 'll have to add some extra time , but this dough is really easy to work with .
For this recipe , I used an already blind - baked tart shell ,
The idea here is to make a layer of chocolate on the bottom of the tart shell and top it with fresh bananas .
A no -brainier , really .
I also added some possible variations and additions to make this tart even more delicious .
Banana - Chocolate Tart Recipe :
makes one 9 inch round tart
You will need :
1 tart shell , homemade or store - bought , par baked and cooled ( recipe for sweet short crust pastry as well as how to blind bake a tart shell , here )
4 oz of semi-sweet chocolate
1/4 cup of cream or half and half
3 - 4 ripe bananas , depending on their size
1/2 lemon
2 tablespoons of brown sugar
Preheat oven to 375 degrees .
Heat the cream just until bellow boiling point .
Pour it over the chocolate and stir until you get a smooth consistency .
Let it cool .
Peel the bananas and half them lengthwise .
Squeeze the lemon juice over the bananas and add the sugar .
Mix well .
Spread the chocolate sauce on the bottom of the tart shell and top it with the bananas , cut side up , forming a circular pattern .
Bake it until tart is golden brown and bananas are soft , about 30 minutes .
Serve warm by itself or alongside some vanilla ice cream .
Enjoy it !
Possible variations :
Sprinkle the bananas with some chopped peanuts or walnuts half way trough baking .
Place a layer of shredded coconut between the chocolate and the bananas .
Use cinnamon - sugar instead of the brown sugar .

Question : How sexy are Ron Paul - style Republicans ?
We intended to post a YouTube video that might have addressed the above question , but before we did so , we decided to place a call to the Washington office of U.S. Rep.
Ron Paul , the Republican from Brazosport and one - time presidential candidate .
We did n't want to talk to Paul .
We wanted to talk to Rachel Mills , his press secretary who last week caused a small stirring in the loins of the Internet that ended prematurely .
You can't see the aforementioned YouTube viddy now .
Rachel took it down after we called her .
( The best we can do is show you this frame of her from her video . )
By way of explanation , the video was in the vein of a one - woman comedic skit in which she spoke directly to the camera , talking about what she wanted in a fella .
In the political vernacular of the gag , she was looking for a " candidate " -- preferably one who believed in " Constitutional protection , " an oblique reference to safe sex .
Va-va-voom !
She then , more or less , vamped for the camera and laid down a few other sexual innuendos and double entendres .
Some found it clever ; others , not so much .
Said one commenter on a thread at RonPaulforums.com : " Practice safe lunch ; use a condiment .
By the way , should this be considered NSFW ? "
L. Golden , a Paul constituent in the 14th Congressional District , was among those put off by the display , telling us :
" The problem I have is that there is ZERO coverage of our Congressman in District 14's news media .
This is what a press secretary is supposed to be doing , correct ?
Instead , we have this video circulating on the internet .
It 's distasteful , downright inappropriate and does not reflect well on Dr. Paul and whoever hires and manages the congressional staff .
In addition , this person 's salary is paid by the taxpayers ... for doing what ?? "
We talked to Rachel on the phone last night and she said she wished we did n't write about this video .
In her own defense , she said she performed in the video on her own time .
She did n't want to talk about this during office hours , either , asking to speak to Hair Balls via her " personal cell phone " after work .
( Yea , taxpayers ! )
She 's only billed as " Rachel " in the video and not as Paul 's press secretary .
Nevertheless , she said she decided to pull the video after getting our phone call .
" I do n't want to upset anybody , " she said , most especially Congressman Paul , whom she said she greatly respects .
Mills , who once ran for a state House seat in North Carolina and marketed a pin-up calendar featuring herself and other Libertarian women wearing bras and panties , called her now - deleted video a " casual , fun thing " and nothing more .
Mills appears in a few other videos on the " Ladies4 Liberty " YouTube Channel .
She 's the " waitress " in the " Unidine " vid , a sketch that equates universal health care to a restaurant where the customers are told they can't pick from the menu and must eat whatever they 're served .
It 's not the least bit sexually suggestive and no one 's complained about it yet , so far as we know .

We take reality to be what is sensed and perceived .
What we feel is – for all intents and purposes – what we think of as real .
But what one thinks they sense is not always what is actually being sensed .
Instead , a mistake could erupt from cognitive biases .
One example of this could be the confirmation bias , or the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one ’s preconceptions .
Another example is the primacy effect , or the tendency to weigh initial events more than subsequent events .
A list of other cognitive biases can be found here .
Similarly , what can be sensed is not always what is actually there .
Instead , the experience could be due to a flaw in our perceptual system – an illusion or a hallucination .
Take for example the visual illusion called the café wall where the horizontal lines ( which are actually parallel ) are seen as bent , or look at the Rubin vase , also called the Figure - ground vase because if one focuses on the figure of the picture one interprets it as a vase , but if one focuses on the ground of the picture one sees two faces staring at each other .
One of my personal favorite optical illusions is the Spinning Dancer , which one can perceive as either spinning clockwise or counter - clockwise ( try it out with your friends or try to see both ) !
Often , these kinds of illusions are used in the field of Systems neuroscience , in order to reveal how the brain normally organizes and interprets different kinds of sensory stimulation .
As can be seen , the mind in itself can be just as much a tool of clarity as it can be a tool of deception .
To understand the reality of things , one cannot simple look at them , but also understand the conditions of what one is experiencing .
This is why science has a particular method of empiricism , one that includes not only observation but also quantitative measurements of what is observed , and statistical - based conclusions .
By doing this science protects itself from these perceptual and cognitive biases – or “ knowledge ” that may often be sensed or thought of as reality , but turn out not to be so .
However , despite all of these potential illusions and biases – there is one thing that is always real : the experience of them .
The Reality of Experience
What distinguishes one experience from being any more or less real from any other experience ?
Sure , we may see two dogs in the room when really there is just a pile of clothes on the floor .
In this example , the observer wrongly interprets the conditions of what he or she is experiencing .
But the experience is just as real as any other combination of thoughts , feelings and external senses that take place in a given moment within time and space .
But no , we might claim that these illusions , hallucinations , or dreams are always – in retrospect of the experience – proven to be unreal .
Of course , this does not discount the possibility that we could one day wake up from the “ bigger dream ” of our waking life spent on Earth .
But that would be considered one of the more extreme , albeit interesting , perspectives to take on the nature of reality .
What if we were just a brain in a vat ?
What if this reality was just a life - long simulation , like the whole theme behind The Matrix ?
But even if our brains are n’t in a vat , how much of experience is illusory ?
But what first makes something an illusion ?
Colloquially , something that is imaginary or fantasy could be considered illusory .
But the how do we define something like that ?
But no matter what questions are asked , the same place always arises : at least most people hold the belief that “ those things that are strictly in the mind ” are the essence of what is “ illusory ” or a “ delusion . ”
We are inclined to perceive true reality as “ out there ” – the external world – something ultimately separate from us , separate from even our own mind .
We are all dualists – we have disconnected our minds from reality .
We forget that mind experiences are just as real as physical experiences .
The mind is real .
There are thoughts , memories , feelings , and emotions , and they are all just a real as anything you can see , hear , feel , smell and taste .
Sometimes , we even perceive them as “ more ” real than our external senses – but there is no such thing as “ more ” real – there is only truth and non-truth .
Reality is digital , it is either there or not there , you are either experiencing it or not experiencing it .
But experiencing reality does not mean understanding reality .
Understanding the True Nature of Reality through Consciousness
To fully understand reality one would have to be omniscient .
But to understand the nature of reality one only needs to observe consciousness with a clear mind and a scientific enquiry .
A clear mind is necessary because that is your tool of observation – and you would n’t work with a microscope to study atomic particles nor a telescope to study the cosmos if either tool of observation had a dirty lens .
So what makes a mind dirty or unclear ?
Contrary to popular belief ( even amongst a big portion of the West who practice meditation ) – it is not thoughts that muddy the mind per se .
Mental clarity , is more broadly any degree of concentration that can be paid to any particular field of awareness .
This field of awareness includes both body and mind , meaning : physical sensations , emotions , and thoughts .
The observer has two ways of making an immediate and intentional effect on consciousness : awareness and concentration .
Meditation : Awareness and Concentration ( Cleansing The Lens Into Reality )
In meditation , or any other experience , there is awareness and there is concentration .
Awareness is a lot like the shape , size , and location of the spotlight on a stage .
Concentration is the level of brightness / dullness of that light .
Awareness can both expand and contract .
Awareness can shift to an individual sensory object ( such as a pain or prickle sensation in the foot ) or it can cover the full range of sensations throughout the whole body ( and mind ) .
In meditation and in all everyday experience it is common to find that the observer ’s awareness is constantly reshaping , changing size , and shifting between various physical and mental phenomena .
This is where the meditative practice of mindfulness is most important .
Mindfulness is the concentration of our ever - changing field of awareness .
So , mindfulness is not concentration in the traditional sense of being concentrated on a particular object , but instead , it is the concentration on a process .
As beginners of meditation , there are very low levels of concentration or clarity in the mind at first .
This is due to the ever - fleeting nature of our awareness , even when it is a shift of awareness towards our own awareness .
But by practicing mindfulness we can slowly build greater levels of concentration on the process of changing awareness – what Vipassanna meditation teacher Shinzen Young often labels “ flow . ”
By consciously labeling these changing sensations – by noting them in the mind as something such as “ flow , ” – Young recognizes that we can improve our “ mindfulness ” to this ever - changing experience , this single moment we call life .
As mindfulness becomes an easier practice , the observer begins to build more and more levels of concentration to the processes ( just as an observer can build concentration to a particular object by following a similar discipline of meditation ) .
Mindfulness is the passive observation of the rising and falling of physical and mental sensation ( the “ flow ” of consciousness ) .
Mindfulness is not originally intended to build concentration , but experienced mindful observers ( after cultivating the right way to direct attention and awareness ) will reach a point in their mindfulness practice where it becomes a concentrative meditation , as much as it is a mindful one .
Once the observer reaches the first true balancing point of stillness and concentration then the mind begins on its path into full concentration and full absorption ( what is known in Buddhism as Jhana , a meditative state of profound stillness and concentration in which the mind becomes fully immersed and absorbed in the chosen object [ or process ] of attention . )
These states of absorption ( Jhana ) are considered instruments used in developing wisdom – by cultivating insight and using it to examine true nature of phenomena .
During this , the practitioner will need to investigate and verify their view on what is the nature of reality .
Within this process , “ right knowledge ” is said to arise , which is later followed by right liberation .
It is often considered premature in Buddhist tradition for an individual to share an experience of Jhana , but there are plenty of reading materials around the internet and especially at Access To Insight ( one of my favorites ) that will give you the tools you will need to identify the different states of Jhana .
Shinzen
Young ’s videos also go into some teachings of Jhana but he often refers to them as “ Resting States . ”
“ Our tendency is to be interested in something that is growing in the garden , not in the bare soil itself .
But if you want to have a good harvest , the most important thing is to make the soil rich and cultivate it well . ”

JD Salinger has also refused filming rights for his famous novel A US judge has banned publication of a book promoted as a sequel to JD Salinger 's The Catcher in the Rye. US District Judge Deborah Batts ruled that Swedish author Fredrik Colting 's novel too closely mirrored Mr Salinger 's 1951 classic .
Mr Salinger brought the lawsuit against Mr Colting , with his lawyers calling the book a " rip - off pure and simple " .
Mr Colting claims his book , featuring a character based on Salinger 's hero , is a literary commentary not a sequel .
But Judge Batts , in her 37 - page ruling issued in Manhattan , said the main character in Mr Colting 's novel - Mr C - was " an infringement " on Mr Salinger 's main character , Holden Caulfield .
She said the Swedish author 's claim that he also wrote the book to critically examine the character Holden Caulfield , was " problematic and lacking in credibility " .
The judge said Mr Colting had " taken well more from ' Catcher ' , in both substance and style , than is necessary for the alleged transformative purpose of criticising Salinger and his attitudes and behaviour " .
She issued a preliminary injunction , indefinitely banning the publication , advertising or distribution of the book in the US .
The book has already been published in the UK .
Restraining order
In June , Judge Batts issued a 10 - day restraining order before ruling on whether to grant Salinger 's legal request to ban publication of Mr Colting 's book in the US .
Mr Salinger , 90 , who has health problems and has led a reclusive life , was not present at the hearing last month .
But the Swedish author 's lawyer , Edward Rosenthal , had told the court in New York that his client 's book was " not about what happened to Holden Caulfield but it is about JD Salinger trying to deal with this character " .
The Catcher in the Rye , first published in 1951 , is a tale of adolescent alienation and has become one of the most influential American novels of the modern era .
The novel sees Caulfield wandering around New York and railing against the establishment , following his expulsion from boarding school .
Mr Colting 's novel sees 76 - year - old Mr C - who the author has admitted is based on Caulfield - escape from a retirement home and head to New York .
Both books end near a carousel in Central Park .

I ’m not a big fan of canned foods , not since the whole chicken in a can post , but if you like them , you ’re gonna love this .
It turns out they put everything in a can these days , even cheeseburgers .
Honk , a brave German dude from the Something Awful forums , decided to try this weird dish and document his experience .
Apparently , all you have to do is boil the damn thing , open the can and stuff your face .
Honk tried the cheeseburger in a can and said it had a very bland taste and left him with a bitter aftertaste .
It does n’t look as bad as I imagined a canned cheeseburger would look like , but the bottom bun does look a bit soggy .
Honk says he would eat one of these things again and admits he would appreciate canned cheeseburgers more if he was serving them on top of a mountain .
Let ’s face it , any kind of cheeseburger is better than dry bread or power bars , even a disgusting burger .
It is a popular custom among learned society to toss around the names of theories without explanation or elaboration -- Murphy 's Law , Occam 's Razor , and so on .
But who were Murphy and Occam , and who are they to come up with these life - governing rules ?
Below are five well - known rules and laws , and the stories behind their namesakes .
1. Occam's Razor
Occam 's razor is known more formally as the law of parsimony or the law of economy , and states that " entities should not be multiplied unneccesarily . "
Put simply , it is the notion that the simplest explanation is usually the right one .
It is named after William of Occam , who was a scholastic philosopher and Franciscan friar that lived in England in the 14th century .
His contemporaries were the likes of Thomas Aquinas and the Islamic scholar Averroes .
William was the first to write down the principle in its formal wording , and it gained his name due to its frequent usage in medieval philosophy .
William was also one of the first to argue that people should not attempt to derive the idea of God from reason or natural logic .
2. Moore's Law
Moore 's Law is not actually a law , but instead an observation made in 1965 regarding transistors -- specifically , that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years .
The observation was made by Gordon E. Moore , a graduate of UC - Berkeley and Caltech , in an article in the now - defunct Electronics Magazine .
Three years after this observation , Moore co-founded Intel Corporation and served in various positions before becoming its chairman and CEO in 1979 , and retiring to a chairman emeritus position in 1997 .
Nowadays , chip manufacturers treat Moore 's Law as a professional challenge , struggling to keep the pace by constantly inventing new ways to squeeze more transistors onto chip surfaces .
3. Murphy's Law
Murphy 's
Law is also less of a law and more of an old saying : " anything that can go wrong , will go wrong . "
It is named after Edward Murphy , who was an American aerospace engineer who , funnily enough , worked primarily on safety - critical systems .
Most of his efforts went into developing escape systems for experimental aircrafts , such a the F - 4 Phantom II and the SR - 71 Blackbird .
Murphy thought that people in his profession should always consider the worst - case scenario , and so he often cited his old adage as a central tenet of defensive design .
However , his efforts to have the law taken seriously were unsuccessful .
There also exists a " corollary " to Murphy 's Law , called Finagle 's Law of Dynamic Negatives , which states " anything that can go wrong , will , at the worst possible moment . "
4. Pareto Principle
The Pareto Principle , also known as the " 80 - 20 rule , " is the observation that for many events and sets of data , 80 % of the effects come from 20 % of the causes .
It is named after Vilfredo Pareto , an Italian economist who lived and worked around the turn of the 20th century .
In 1906 , he noted in his research that 20 percent of the population in Italy owned 80 percent of the the land .
He extrapolated this relationship to the general distribution of wealth , noting in a book published in 1909 that this proportion applied roughly across time and location .
It was n't until much later that the rule was named after Pareto , by business management consultant Joseph Juran .
The rule is now applied very widely , not just to wealth but to quality assurance -- Microsoft has noted that fixing the most - reported 20 % of bugs fixes 80 % of errors and crashes -- and time management by gurus like Tim Ferriss , author of The 4 - Hour Workweek , who encourages people to focus their energies on the 20 % of activities that generate 80 % of the results .
Would - be applicants should use the rule with caution , though -- it is meant to illustrate a general majority - minority relationship , and is not a hard - and - fast law applicable to all cases .
5. Parkinson's Law
Parkinson 's Law states , " work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion . "
Despite the fact that it is quoted quite soberly today among efficiency experts , Parkinson 's Law began as a joke .
It was the first sentence of a satire piece published in 1955 in The Economist by Cyril Northcote Parkinson .
Parkinson was no economist or scientist , but rather a naval historian and professor , first in Liverpool and then in Singapore .
After the success of the article , Parkinson expanded upon his piece in a book called Parkinson 's Law .
Though the book was only a hundred pages long , it became an instant best seller in the United States .

You will also be on the front page of every newspaper and be in jail for 150 years but at least your wife can enjoy a good life with money you stole from other people .
If you take this path by the way , let me know so I can report you .
4. Corporate Slave
Okay , this is the first way to be a millionaire while avoiding the headlines .
Many high paid professionals end up with significant wealth over time .
Of course , they get beaten up at work daily as they climb the corporate ladder and then pay obscene amounts of government taxes afterward , but hey , nothing is going to stop you from becoming a millionaire right ?
5. Forget Millions , I Was Born a Billionaire
Having rich parents ai n’t a crime , right ?
Even if you are n’t born that way , you might get a second chance by being adopted .
Of course , no money is ever safe if you do n’t know how to use it .
Just ask this guy who blew $ 10 million in 10 years .
6. Marry Rich
If you go to any bars or restaurants that are within close proximity to high end neighborhoods , you will see many very attractive ladies at the bar .
There are some fairy tales alright , but most die trying .
7. Save Your Ass Off Millionaire
You can keep trying , but this is exactly how most of us will become a millionaire .
It ’s not glamorous like winning the nobel prize but no one will bother you ( that ’s a good thing when you are wealthy ) because no one will ever know you are rich either .
Since this is actually the most probable way of becoming a millionaire , I ’ve outlined a few steps you can take .
1. Generate Some Income
All the rubbish about a penny saved equal two pennies earned is true because pondering about that all day will save you exactly two pennies .
If you ever want to save enough money to make your family proud , start earning some to begin with .
This includes :
Stop watching TV .
But everyone watches TV .
Yes , couch potato the third , that ’s why so few ever become millionaires .
While you are watching TV , your competition , the more successful and the people you envy are all making money .
Stop watching TV .
In fact , cancel it if you always give in .

Working smarter and harder at work –
If you have to choose between the two , please err on the side of being smart .
Be friendly and helpful to coworkers , know when you should work hard and when to say no to distractions .

Get a side job –
If you are earning less than $ 40,000 and trying to feed a family of four , you could probably write a book on money saving advice .
Stop reading up on frugal living and write about it instead .
Start your own business and earn more money ( here are 15 ways to do so ) .
2. Save Some of It
Alright , what I said in step one was misleading ( it would n’t be the first time so stop complaining ) .
After you have decent income coming in every month , you need to save at least some of it .
How much ?
It all depends on how fast you want to become a millionaire .
There ’s no right or wrong answer .
No pain , no gain my friend .
Alternatively , you can also save more by reducing your current expenses .
Do you still have your cable TV ?
You can try Netflix free with a one month free trial offer .
At the very least , look for the AT&T U - Verse promotions and the Verizon FiOS promotions that seem to be all over the web if you already use their services .
Extra :
What a tip ?
Start by resisting the temptation to improve your standard of living too quickly .
It ’s fun when you start going to fancier restaurants and living in bigger houses but there ’s no going back ( or at least without major pain ) .
You can always spend more later , and there is absolutely no rush .
3. Investing It in Diversified Index Funds
I keep telling everyone that I ’m becoming an index fund convert .
No , I ’m not those that liked index funds from the get go or someone who lost a bunch of money in the stock market betting on individual securities .
In fact , I made a small fortune in the stock market .
But it was risky , tiring , frustrating and stressful .
I wanted a life .
If you really want to be a millionaire , stick with index funds .
You do n’t need the crap and you do n’t want to buy tissues after you bought Bear Sterns based on rumors that it was good value .
Your Mindset is Important Too
What to have and keep more money ?
It pays to change your mindset .
Here are a few pointers to work on .
1 . Take the long view .
Millionaires hit obstacles , make mistakes , and have stretches of bad luck , just like the rest of us .
The difference is that someone who has made his own wealth has kept his eyes on the prize throughout all of those setbacks .
No matter what your particular goal is — whether it ’s to make partner , make your startup a success , or have a certain amount of money banked by the time you retire — making day - to - day decisions that will ensure that outcome keeps you from sabotaging yourself .
2 . Be willing to take risks .
Warren Buffett has famously advised individuals looking to get rich to avoid “ thumb - sucking ” .
What he means is that with every decision , there is an element of risk , and it can be easy to sit down and think about that decision before you jump in — in other words , sit and suck your thumb .
But great wealth is not built by simply thinking about it .
It ’s necessary to make decisions — and sometimes they are difficult ones — and keep going from there .
Without any risk , there can be no reward .
3. Embrace mistakes and learn from them .
Since you are taking risks , however , that does mean that sometimes you ’ll be wrong .
That happens to everyone , but millionaires learn from their mistakes .
Blindly assuming that doing the same thing that lost you money before will pay out this time is called gambling .
Recognizing that you made a mistake and deciding how it will affect your future decisions is a way to build wisdom and wealth .
4. Remember that money is a tool .
We all have very complicated and emotional relationships with money .
For some , it may seem like the gateway to a good life .
For others , it may be a security blanket that helps them feel like their life is under control .
But ultimately , money is just a tool , and millionaires recognize that fact .
If you have an over - inflated view of what money can and will do for you , you will never be happy , even if you do become a millionaire .
Money is a tool that you can use in order to live a productive life .
Having an overly emotional relationship with it will cloud your ability to be your best self .
WASHINGTON ( JTA ) —
More than three - quarters of the House of Representatives signed an AIPAC - backed letter to President Obama on Middle East peace .
The document , signed by 329 members of Congress , calls for " every effort " to be made to realize an Arab - Israeli peace while laying out certain " basic principles " to achieve it .
Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) and Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) spearheaded the letter since its introduction earlier this month .
A similar letter in the U.S. Senate garnered 76 signatures .
Among the principles laid out by the House letter is that " the parties themselves must negotiate the details of any agreement " and that the United States must " work closely with our democratic ally , who will be taking the greatest risks in any peace agreement . "
" The proven best way forward is to work closely and privately together both on areas of agreement and especially on areas of disagreement , " states the missive , adding that the U.S. must be both " a trusted mediator and a devoted friend to Israel . "
The letter also insists on an " absolute Palestinian commitment to end violence , terror and incitement " and urges " far greater involvement and participation by the Arab states both in moving toward normal ties with Israel and in supporting moderate Palestinians . "
Twenty - nine of the 31 Jewish members of the House signed the letter ; Reps. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) and Bob Filner ( D - Calif . ) were the two who did not .
Just look at how the following " historical facts " -- all complete bullshit -- have continued to show up in print for centuries after the subject has passed away .
Just ask anyone who 's ever run a nasty smear campaign ; a good , juicy lie or half - truth about someone can not only follow them to the grave , but can echo down through history long after .
The truth is like Silly Putty : you can stretch it , mold it and use it to destroy someone 's life .
6 Napoleon Was Really , Really Short
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Quick , let 's do word association .
When we say " Napoleon " you say the first word that comes to mind .
About 20 percent of you just said , " French ! " and the other 80 percent said , " short ! "
Yes , in a world where our hazy history education wo n't let most of us quote even five facts about the guy , what we all know is that he was a tiny , tiny little man .
Now , it 's true Bonaparte did n't tower over anyone .
For instance , he was shorter than the Imperial Guards he was often seen with ( who had a height requirement , since like all such guards through history part of their job was to look intimidating ) .
But most agree that Bonaparte was almost 5 ' 7 " , which was in fact just above average for the early 19th century ( and would n't exactly make him a freak even now ) .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
The French , however , used a slightly different system that listed the emperor at 5 ' 2 " .
And that appears to be the source of the whole " Napoleon as midget " image .
When word got back to England that the terror of France was only a tick taller than five baguettes , the British propaganda machine had a field day .
After all , it 's much easier to win a battle when you imagine the other guy 's Marty McFly and you 're Biff Tannen .
" Voulez - vous make like a tree and get outta here ? "
As we 'll see often on this list , if you repeat a lie often enough , it eventually becomes truth .
Fast forward 200 years and a man who at worst was a few inches shorter than average , and at best was exactly as tall any random dude at the time , is portrayed as a laughable cartoonish freak of a man .

The lesson ?
If you 're going to be a world leader , surround yourself with shorter people .
Maricela Castellanos sat at her desk , the telephone pressed to her ear , a chill running through her body .
A representative from her mortgage company was on the line with troubling information about the loan on Castellanos ’ Hesperia home .
No one at the company had previously been in contact with her , Castellanos recalled the man saying .
The bank had no record of a new loan agreement with her , he said , nor had it received cashier ’s checks for $ 2,260 and $ 1,408.23 she said she had sent .
Castellanos had been a victim of an alleged loan modification swindle -- a financial crime in which scammers pretend to help distressed borrowers renegotiate their mortgages with their banks but instead pocket the money and leave the homeowners in worse straits than before .
Advertisement
Law enforcement officials say the scams are becoming increasingly prevalent , especially in California , where the Department of Real Estate has reported an explosion from 10 open cases a year ago to more than 750 this spring .
Nationally , U.S. Atty .
Gen. Eric Holder has said that the FBI ’s “ rescue scam ” caseload is up 400 % from five years ago .
Some schemes advertise with hand - drawn signs on freeway ramps , while others target homeowners by name with carefully forged documents that appear to come from their lender .
The alleged scam artists to whom Castellanos paid more than $ 5,000 last fall were among the most sophisticated operating in California , authorities said , stymieing investigators with a thicket of bank accounts , 1-800 numbers and wire transfers to Mexico .
“ Trying to piece it together . . . was an incredibly difficult thing to do , ” said Deputy Atty .
Gen. Angela Rosenau .

Hours after Castellanos ’ conversation with her lender , an unfamiliar car paused in front of her house .
Sandy Birch , an investigator with the California Department of Justice , had arrived with a cashier ’s check Castellanos had sent to a post office box in the San Fernando Valley .
“ I want to know why you were sending money there , ” Castellanos recalled Birch asking her .
Castellanos told the investigator that she and her husband had bought their three - bedroom home on Manzanita Street in 2005 .
Their $ 280,000 loan had a monthly payment of about $ 1,700 -- manageable on her salary as an office manager and her husband ’s work at a golf course .
Then her husband got laid off .

In July 2008 , the mortgage fell into default .
In August , Castellanos received a letter that appeared to be from her lender , telling her she could enroll in a free program to save her home .
It even included a warning to beware of foreclosure rescue scams .
“ I really fell for it , ” she said , adding that she responded immediately .
Days later , a man phoned Castellanos to say she and her husband had been approved for a more affordable loan , with delinquency fees tacked onto the end .
This sounded reasonable , Castellanos recalled , so she did n’t question it when told to send her payments via money order or cashier ’s check to the “ Payment Processing Department ” at a postal box in North Hills .
Advertisement
But her bank had nothing to do with the purported new loan or the mail drop .
The California attorney general ’s office had been fielding complaints for months from homeowners who had fallen victim to what one prosecutor termed a “ brilliant scheme . ”
Representatives of this operation allegedly induced homeowners to send them as many as three consecutive mortgage payments .
More than $ 1 million flowed through a series of bank accounts , much of it eventually crossing the border to banks in Mexico , according to the attorney general ’s office .
In some cases , people lost their homes because they did nothing to head off foreclosure , believing they had made a deal with their bank .
Advertisement
Despite there being hundreds of victims , investigators found the trail confusing .
The operation did not register its phone lines in its own name .
Instead , investigators said , its 800 - numbers ran through Internet phone companies .
It was the same with the bank accounts .
Birch , Rosenau and a forensic auditor began working backward from the accounts where checks were deposited and postal boxes where victims sent their money .
They determined that much of the money seemed to go to Juan Jose Perez and Isuara Hernandez , a married couple with three children who had recently lived in San Bernardino County .
On Oct. 27 , the attorney general ’s office filed a 39 - count complaint charging Hernandez , Perez and several associates with grand theft , money - laundering and conspiracy .
Five of Hernandez and Perez ’s associates pleaded guilty ; but Hernandez and Perez , who authorities say are the ringleaders , have eluded capture .
Advertisement
Investigators suspect they went to Mexico .
On Oct. 29 , the trail led to Anna Santos , 22 , of North Hills .
Santos , who has three children , told investigators she had no idea she was involved in anything illegal .
She had answered a help - wanted ad to be the “ U.S. financial representative ” for a firm selling time - shares in Mexico , according to court papers and Santos ’ husband .
Santos told investigators that her employer , a woman she knew only as Laura , told her to open post office boxes and bank accounts in her own name .
Every few days , Laura would call Santos and tell her there was mail waiting for her .
Santos would retrieve it , deposit it , keep $ 100 for herself and wire the rest of the money to Laura in Mexico .
( Investigators believe Laura is Isuara Hernandez . )
Advertisement
Birch told Santos she had been involved in defrauding people .
She also warned her that other people who had worked for Hernandez in a similar capacity had recently been arrested .
Finally , Birch told Santos not to pick up any more checks from the post office box .
But two weeks later , Birch got a call from the manager of the North Hills Post Office .
Santos had signed for two packages , he said .
She then deposited checks at a bank and withdrew $ 5,963 in cash , according to court records .
Santos was arrested March 11 .
She pleaded guilty and on May 20 was sentenced to two years in prison .
Her husband , Dimas Santos , said his wife “ was only trying to feed her children . ”
He said it is not fair that his wife , who was told she was working for a time - share company , is in jail while Hernandez and Perez remain at large .
Advertisement
Castellanos , meanwhile , was able to work out a loan modification with her real bank , allowing her family to stay in their Hesperia home .
But authorities say that for every happy ending , there are plenty more people likely to fall victim , especially as the economy continues to sputter .
Officials at the Department of Real Estate said there were 230,000 foreclosures in California last year , with as many or more expected this year .
That makes a lot of potential victims , noted Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown .
“ People are desperate , ” he added .
“ Desperate people do desperate things . ”

Massachusetts , the first state to legalize same - sex marriage , is now the first state to challenge the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) in federal court .
The lawsuit , filed by Attorney General Martha Coakley , claims that DOMA “ violates the United States Constitution by interfering with the Commonwealth ’s sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents . ”
“ Despite these developments , same - sex couples in Massachusetts are still denied essential rights and protections because the federal Defense of Marriage Act [ DOMA ] interferes with the Commonwealth ’s authority to define and regulate marriage , ” the lawsuit said .
The suit said that more than 16,000 same - sex couples have married in Massachusetts since gay marriage became legal in the state in 2004 “ and the security and stability of families has been strengthened in important ways throughout the state . ”
“ In enacting DOMA [ the Defense of Marriage Act ] , Congress overstepped its authority , undermined states ’ efforts to recognize marriages between same - sex couples , and codified an animus towards gay and lesbian people , ” the state said in a lawsuit filed today in US District Court in Massachusetts .
Full press release below :
BOSTON – Today , Attorney General Martha Coakley filed a lawsuit in United States District Court ( D. Mass . ) challenging the constitutionality of Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( “ DOMA ” ) .
The law , which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman , unfairly excludes more than 16,000 Massachusetts married same - sex couples and their families from critically important rights and protections based on marital status .
The complaint alleges that DOMA , which affects more than 1,100 federal statutory provisions , violates the United States Constitution by interfering with the Commonwealth ’s sovereign authority to define and regulate the marital status of its residents .
The complaint also alleges that DOMA exceeds Congress ’s authority under the Spending Clause because Congress does not have a valid reason for requiring Massachusetts to treat married same - sex couples differently from all other married couples .
“ Today , the Commonwealth of Massachusetts takes an important step toward ensuring equality and fairness for its citizens and maintaining our authority as a sovereign state , ” said Attorney General Coakley .
“ DOMA affects residents of Massachusetts in very real and very negative ways by depriving access to important economic safety nets and other protections that couples count on when they marry and that help them to take care of one another and their families .
DOMA also directly and fundamentally interferes with Massachusetts ’s right as a state sovereign to determine the marital status of its residents . ”
The Commonwealth ’s complaint alleges that Section 3 of DOMA unlawfully creates separate and unequal categories of married individuals in Massachusetts , due to the fact that only different - sex married couples are considered married under federal law .
Among other things , DOMA prohibits married individuals in same - sex relationships from taking advantage of the ability to file a joint federal tax return , Social Security survivor benefits , guaranteed leave from work to care for sick spouses , flexible spending accounts for medical expenses of spouses , and gift tax and estate tax exemptions for spouses .
These rights and protections affect all facets of life from the workplace to healthcare to retirement , and every married person is affected significantly by these laws .
The Attorney General ’s Office further contends that Section 3 of DOMA unlawfully requires Massachusetts to disregard valid marriages in its implementation of federally funded programs .
The complaint focuses specifically on two programs , MassHealth and veterans ’ cemeteries .
“ It is unconstitutional for the federal government to discriminate , as it does because of DOMA ’s restrictive definition of marriage .
It is also unconstitutional for the federal government to decide who is married and to create a system of first - and second - class marriages .
The federal government cannot require states , such as Massachusetts , to further the discrimination through federal programs , either .
The time has come for this injustice to end . ”
The complaint specifically highlights two programs in Massachusetts that are impacted by DOMA .
The two programs are MassHealth , the Commonwealth ’s Medicaid program which offers healthcare coverage to low - and moderate - income residents of Massachusetts , and the burial of Massachusetts veterans and their spouses at cemeteries owned and operated by the Massachusetts Department of Veterans ’ Services ( DVS ) .
The Attorney General ’s Office is seeking an order that the federal government be prohibited from enforcing Section 3 of DOMA against Massachusetts .
Additionally , it seeks a declaration that Section 3 of DOMA , as applied to Massachusetts as well as MassHealth and DVS , is unconstitutional .
DOMA was enacted in 1996 in anticipation of the possibility that Hawaii might license marriages between same - sex couples .
Prior to the enactment of DOMA , the federal government honored the marriages recognized by the states for the purposes of any federal program or statute .
Section 3 of DOMA created , for the first time , a federal definition of marriage and , with it , a federal limitation on marriage .
In 2004 , following the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ’s decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health , Massachusetts became the first state to license marriages between individuals in same - sex relationships .
Since May 2004 , more than 16,000 same - sex couples have been married in Massachusetts .
Currently , six states – Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , Vermont , Maine and New Hampshire – permit , or will soon permit , qualified , committed same - sex couples to obtain marriage licenses .
In addition , California continues to honor the marriage licenses that were extended to over 18,000 same - sex couples prior to the passage of Proposition 8 .
Two other states , New York and Rhode Island , as well as the District of Columbia honor marriages between same - sex couples that are celebrated in Massachusetts .
Seven states – California , Nevada , Hawaii , New Jersey , Washington , Wisconsin and Oregon – recognize domestic partnerships or civil unions between same - sex couples .
Twenty - nine other states have enacted what are commonly called mini-DOMAs , which ban marriage between couples of the same sex .
This matter is being handled by Maura T. Healey , Chief of Attorney General ’s Civil Rights Division , and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan B. Miller , also of Attorney General Coakley ’s Civil Rights Division .
( CNN ) --
Two of the three Senate Republicans negotiating a bipartisan deal on health care reform said they consider an agreement out of reach before the Senate goes on its August recess .
President Obama stresses the urgency of health care reform at a town hall meeting in Raleigh , North Carolina .
That likely dashes the hopes of Democratic leaders and President Obama for a deal among the so - called Gang of Six negotiators that could deliver critical momentum for the stalled health care overhaul .
The announcement was in contrast to some degree of progress made earlier in the day in the House .
An agreement between four fiscally conservative House Democrats and the chamber 's Democratic leadership allowed committee debate to resume on their version of the health care bill .
However , the deal put off a vote by the full House on the president 's top domestic priority until after the recess .
Sen . Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , and Sen. Michael Enzi , R - Wyoming , dropped the bombshell Senate news to CNN and two other reporters in Capitol hallways Wednesday night .
They have spent weeks behind closed doors , trying to hammer out an agreement with their Democratic counterparts on the Senate Finance Committee but said too many issues remain unresolved , making it almost impossible for them to sign on to a deal before the break .
" There are a lot of tough decisions to make , and they are n't going to be made real quickly , " Grassley said late Wednesday when asked whether negotiators should kick their talks over to September .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , had already postponed Senate floor action on health care legislation until the fall , but Democrats had hoped the Senate Finance Committee could finish its work before the summer break .
In fact , one senior Democratic source said meeting that deadline was the central thrust of the president 's meeting with Reid and Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana , last Friday .
Grassley , the top Republican on the finance panel , briefed GOP senators on the state of the health care talks Wednesday .
He said his colleagues want more time to consider the emerging legislation and want Republican negotiators to resist pressure from Democrats for an early agreement .
" Most of our caucus feels that just simmering for people 's reflections would be a good thing to do , " he said .
Enzi , who spoke while leaving the Capitol on Wednesday night , echoed Grassley 's desire for more time before he 'd agree to a deal .
" We have huge parts that have not been discussed yet .
We have other parts that we asked questions on that we have n't gotten answer back yet .
I do n't know how we make decisions on those parts -- they 're pretty big issues , " Enzi said .
" You can't say you got to do it in a week , you got to do it in a month , " he said .
" You got to do it in the amount of time it takes . "
Enzi , a soft - spoken conservative , was furious about headlines Wednesday morning that suggested he was close to reaching a deal with the Democrats .
" I felt my reputation was in danger , " he said .
Back at the U.S. House , Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , of Maryland , announced that the Energy and Commerce Committee would begin debate on the health care bill and pass it by the end of the week .
It is the last of three House committees required to pass the House version of the bill before it goes to the full chamber .
The committee 's version would be merged during the August break , which begins Friday , with versions passed by two other House panels , according to the statement from Pelosi and Hoyer .
The final version would be debated by the full House when legislators return to Washington in September , the statement said .
Obama and Democratic leaders had wanted both the House and Senate to approve bills before the break .
The House deal with four of the so - called Blue Dogs , a group of fiscally conservative Democrats , was announced as Obama hit the road to build more public support for his health plan .
In a statement issued by the White House before the Senate developments , Obama thanked members of the House and Senate , including " some Blue Dogs on the Energy and Commerce Committee , " for " working so hard to find common ground . "
" Those efforts are extraordinarily constructive in strengthening this legislation and bringing down its cost , " Obama said .
Rep .
Mike Ross of Arkansas and the Blue Dogs had threatened to derail the bill in the committee because of concerns that it costs too much and fails to address systemic problems in the nation 's ailing health care industry .
The Blue Dogs had presented committee Chairman Henry Waxman with a list of 10 items that they wanted changed in health care reform proposals .
Neither side revealed what the 10 items were .
Ross said the deal between four Blue Dogs on the House committee , the House Democratic leadership and the White House lowers the cost of the House health care reform plan by $ 100 billion and also exempts businesses with payrolls below $ 500,000 from having to provide health coverage for workers .
He also said the bill 's government - funded public insurance option -- a key provision for Obama and Democratic leaders -- would be a choice for consumers instead of coverage forced on people without health insurance .
It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether any Blue Dogs beyond the four who made the agreement would sign on .
The announcement by the Blue Dogs came as Obama held a town hall meeting on health care in Raleigh , North Carolina .
Another town hall meeting took place later Wednesday in Virginia .
If Congress fails to act soon , Obama warned the Raleigh audience , health costs will double over the next decade , make millions more Americans uninsured and bankrupt government on both the state and federal levels .
He also brushed aside criticism that the plan is being rushed through Congress without adequate time for review and debate .
At a second town hall meeting Wednesday -- near the produce aisle in a Kroger supermarket in rural Bristol , Virginia , on the border with Tennessee -- the president repeated assurances that his health care plan wo n't change Medicare benefits for senior citizens .
But Sen Enzi insisted any deal he might ultimately sign onto would have to be preserved by Pelosi and Reid when it is merged with other more liberal legislation in the Senate and House .
" I 'm not interested in lending credibility to disaster , " Enzi said .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Evan Glass , Deirdre Walsh and Ed Henry contributed to this report .
All About Health Care Policy • Barack Obama
Make that belatedly .
America ’s previously neutered accountants — traditionally , green - visored chickenshit - cowards who have rolled over for their belly rubs from America ’s CEOs and CFOs , giving them all of the bullshit they asked for over the past 2 decades — seem to be developing a spine of sorts .
Recall that in the midst of the credit crisis , the Accounting Standards Board were knuckled under by Congress .
FASB now seems to be regretting their act of political cowardice .
Here ’s Jonathan Weil :
“ Turns out America ’s accounting poobahs have some fight in them after all .
Call them crazy , or maybe just brave .
The Financial Accounting Standards
Board is girding for another brawl with the banking industry over mark - to - market accounting .
And this time , it ’s the FASB that has come out swinging .
It was only last April that the FASB caved to congressional pressure by passing emergency rule changes so that banks and insurance companies could keep long - term losses from crummy debt securities off their income statements .
Now the FASB says it may expand the use of fair - market values on corporate income statements and balance sheets in ways it never has before .
Even loans would have to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value , under a preliminary decision reached July 15 .
The board might decide whether to issue a formal proposal on the matter as soon as next month . ”
The mere fact these gutless wonders are even considering Fair Value accounting is a massive improvement .
If the lobbyists and bought & paid for Congress do n’t interfere , we may actually expect to see significant changes :
“ The scope of the FASB ’s initiative , which has received almost no attention in the press , is massive .
All financial assets would have to be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet each quarter , under the board ’s tentative plan .
This would mean an end to asset classifications such as held for investment , held to maturity and held for sale , along with their differing balance - sheet treatments .
Most loans , for example , probably would be presented on the balance sheet at cost , with a line item below showing accumulated change in fair value , and then a net fair - value figure below that .
For lenders , rule changes could mean faster recognition of loan losses , resulting in lower earnings and book values .
The board said financial instruments on the liabilities side of the balance sheet also would have to be recorded at fair - market values , though there could be exceptions for a company ’s own debt or a bank ’s customer deposits . ”
That is a huge correction to a previous outrage .
Remember , mark to market accounting has n’t caused these problems —
It merely exposed them to bank investors .

' The prosecution wanted to the judge to deny bail , a la Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford , because the stolen code " could be use to manipulate the market in unfair ways . "
The judge , to his credit chose to disagree .
This was an alleged crime against GOLDMAN , not , presumably a crime against society .
Therefore it was a " garden variety " economic crime , meaning that the normal niceties of " free on bail " were available . '
-- Is the U.S. Government An Arm of Goldman Sachs ? - Graham and Dodd Investor -- Seeking Alpha .
Apologies for getting to this late -- I 'm on deadline on something else and have n't had much time to post -- but this just has to be posted , given the continued debate over Goldman Sachs .
Surely plenty of people followed the story last week of Sergey Aleynikov , a Russian computer whiz who , well , defected from the employ of Goldman Sachs , apparently taking with him the bank 's proprietary trading code .
There is a lot of backstory here that is key : if you 've followed Zero Hedge 's speculations dating back months about Goldman somehow manipulating program trading at the NYSE , this is connected to that , as the theory here is that Aleynikov stole the computer program that Goldman may have been using to manipulate the NYSE .
Such speculations until recently may have sounded like conspiracy theories , but then last week Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti stood up in court and let loose a whopper .
" The bank has raised the possibility that there is a danger that somebody who knew how to use this program could use it to manipulate markets in unfair ways , " he said .
Again , this is a federal prosecutor quoting Goldman Sachs , admitting in open court that it has been using a computer program that can be used to unfairly manipulate markets .
Take that information and couple it with the insane data about Goldman 's share of program trading volume since the beginning of the year and ... well , you can draw your own conclusions .
While I 'm here : a lot of people have been writing me asking me to respond to Megan McArdle 's bizarre freakout on the Atlantic website , where she lambasted my Goldman piece in curiously discombobulated fashion and then apparently spent the next couple of days jamming her feet in her mouth in the comments section ( Megan at 6:52 P.M. on July 10 : " No , his facts are wrong , his conclusions are wrong , and only his discomfort with Goldman Sachs ' role in our public life is correct . "
Megan three hours later : " Or perhaps a better way to say it is that the facts are right , but the mini narratives are ludicrously wrong . " ) .
I 'm reluctant to get into this , among other things because I 've already done two different too - long responses to critics of this piece , and I 'm also supposed to be writing something else right now , so ...
But I will get to her later in the week , when I have time , and I 'm going to need time , just going by one quick read - through of her piece .
One more side note : I 'm working on something right now and as part of that I 'm looking to interview anyone who is an employee of the state of New Jersey and holds a New Jersey state pension .
Anyone out there knows anyone like that , please let me know .

A family in Saudi Arabia is taking a " genie " to court , accusing it of theft and harassment , reports say .
They accuse the spirit of threatening them , throwing stones and stealing mobile phones , Al Watan newspaper said .
The family have lived in the same house near the city of Medina for 15 years but say they only recently became aware of the spirit .
They have now moved out .
A local court is investigating .
In Islamic theology , genies are spirits that can harass or possess humans .
' Get out of the house '
" We began to hear strange sounds , " the head of the family , who come from Mahd Al Dahab , told the Saudi daily .
He did not want to be named .
" At first we did not take it seriously , but then stranger things started to happen and the children got particularly scared when the genie started throwing stones . "
He added : " A woman spoke to me first , and then a man .
They said we should get out of the house . "
A local court says it is trying to verify the truthfulness of the claims " despite the difficulty " of doing so .
Many Westerners know the term genie from the tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp , or the 1960s American sitcom , I Dream of Jeannie .
But the BBC's Sebastian Usher says genies , or jinn , in Islamic theology can be a lot more sinister .
They are believed to be normally invisible but with the ability to assume human or animal form , and are often said to be motivated by revenge or jealousy .
There is a lingering belief in genies in the Muslim world that predates Islam , our correspondent says .
Arsenal have handed professional contracts to four members of their successful FA Youth Cup team , while confirming Portugal Under - 21 international Amaury Bischoff is one of eight players released .
Defenders Luke Ayling ( 17 ) , Craig Eastmond ( 18 ) , Cedric Evina ( 17 ) and 18 - year - old keeper James Shea have all been signed on by the Gunners following an impressive campaign which also saw the youngsters win the FA Premier Academy League under the guidance of former centre - half Steve Bould .
However , Bischoff will not be furthering his career at Emirates Stadium , with Rui Fonte - who had a spell on loan with Crystal Palace - also being released at the end of his contract .

Bischoff made just four Arsenal first - team appearances , all as substitute , following his move from Werder Bremen last summer - which came as the midfielder battled back to fitness after a long - standing groin injury and manager Arsene Wenger admitted was something of a " gamble " .
Wenger , meanwhile , is keen to add to his squad following the arrival of Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen .
Brazilian holding midfielder Felipe Melo has been linked with a switch from Serie A side Fiorentina .
However , the future of Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor is yet to be resolved one way or another - with AC Milan continuing their interest .

I expected Republicans to resort to race - baiting in their fruitless effort to stop the inevitable confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor .
The party of Pat Buchanan , Rush Limbaugh , and the old Dixiecrats simply can't help themselves .
That 's why only 7 percent of Latinos have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party .
More surprising has been the war on empathy .
We polled that question back in mid-June .

Same question as above :
Do you think empathy is an important characteristic for a Supreme Court Justice to possess or not ?
Yes No
Dem 73 12
GOP 18 56
Ind 54 28
Every demographic polled thought empathy was a good value to have except ...
Republicans , while whites were fairly evenly split ( not surprising given their heavy over - representation in the GOP ) .
It is this very question that ultimately holds the answer to the GOP 's current troubles .
Look closely at the crosstabs .
What are the three groups that have abandoned the GOP in droves , costing them hugely at the polls ?
Youth voters , Latinos , and independents .
And as Republicans spend the next weeks trashing the concept of " empathy " , keep in mind that it is further alienating those very groups ( as well as African Americans , Asians , and other rapidly growing non-white groups ) .
For the longest time , the GOP kept its hostility toward empathy fairly well - hidden .
In fact , it pretended otherwise for the sake of electoral viability , as Jonah Goldberd complained in the National Review when assessing the root causes of Bush 's failures :
But in the background there was an even larger problem : compassionate conservatism .
As countless writers have noted in National Review over the last five years , most conservatives never really understood what compassionate conservatism was , beyond a convenient marketing slogan to attract swing voters .
The reality -- as even some members of the Bush team will sheepishly concede -- is that there was nothing behind the curtain .
Sure , in the hands of Marvin Olasky and others , compassionate conservatism had some heft .
But Karl Rove 's translation of it into a political platform made it into a pseudo - intellectual rationale for constituent - pleasing and Nixonian " modern Republicanism . "
Got that ?
As conservatives themselves note , Bush and Rove wielded compassionate conservatism as an empty political ploy to win " swing voters " .
And " compassion " is no different than " emapthy " .
So , the last Republican to have electoral success ( even though he lost the popular vote ) was a Republican who pretended to be emphatic .
Now , his party has determined that Bush failed because he tried to be compassionate , and they 've resorted to openly sneering at the word .
STEELE : ... Crazy nonsense empathetic .
I ’ll give you empathy .
Empathize right on your behind .
Craziness .
Problem is , people want empathy in their government .
And if Republicans are n't going to provide it , they will cede the electoral battlefield to the one party who will .
And really , who are we to complain about that ?
Puzzle Quest and Aurora Feint are two very similar games .
In both , you have to match three or more square blocks with the same color horizontally or vertically by exchanging two neighboring blocks .
Those matched blocks are then eliminated from the board and the blocks above them fall down to take their place .
Both games have special pre-built maps which challenge the player to clear all blocks .
In Puzzle Quest the difficulty is that only moves which result in matched blocks are permitted , whereas Aurora Feint requires that the challenge be completed with a certain number of moves or less .
Being too lazy to think for myself I wrote a program to solve those maps for me .
I have set up a public Mercurial repository for it at http://hg.13thfloor.at/hg/puzzlequest/.
Here ’s how to solve an Aurora Feint puzzle with a maximum of two moves :

Capturing the heart of Kabukicho
TOKYO ( TR ) – Korean photo journalist Choul Kwon has spent much of his 15 years in Tokyo documenting the shadier aspects within its largest nightlife area of Kabukicho — the grungy , neon - lit quarter frequented by underworld types and the location of numerous salons of prostitution , hostess bars , and strip clubs .
Yet certainly one of the most eye - catching targets to cross his viewfinder was also one of the smallest : a four - year - old girl , named Kokoro , living homeless in front of the now - closed Koma Stadium theater .
“ Since she was n’t so dirty , I did n’t think she was homeless , ” remembers the 41 - year - old during an interview at a second - floor coffee shop within the district of his first encounter with the girl in September 2007 .
“ She was n’t there everyday .
I was later told that Kokoro and her father were hopping around from place to place , sometimes staying at hotels .
From that time , I started thinking about how I could help . ”
In addition to attempting to find her father a job and housing , he began snapping photos of Kokoro — a compilation of which appear in “ Kabukicho no Kokoro - chan ” ( Kodansha ) , a book published in late 2008 that not only provides a glimpse into the life of young girl in an unfortunate situation but also a peek at a darker aspect of Japan that often goes unseen .
The images , which were all shot within Kabukicho , just east of JR Shinjuku Station , are captivating .
On the cover , she is seen sucking on the bottom of an ice cream cone , her grimy feet next to pair of far - too - large sandals .
In an arcade , outfitted in a pink top , she kneels on a chair with her shoes clearly on the wrong feet while slipping coins into the Magical Poppins game .
Many frames feature her father , idly looking on and smoking as his daughter cavorts with birds and other homeless throughout the plaza fronting the theater .
The text of the book features a narrative that summarizes Kwon ’s six - month relationship with the girl .
He describes her love of hamburgers and the extended absences of her father and mother , who is apparently engaged in some kind of employment .
From the age of three , home for Kokoro had been the street .
The family moved from Saitama Prefecture , where she was born , to Shibuya , Ikebukuro , and eventually Kabukicho .
This past spring she entered school after being relocated to a shelter by her mother .
Her parents are separated and , as far as Kwon knows , still living a homeless existence .
Perhaps most odd is that the photos show Kokoro as being very comfortable , her ubiquitous smile revealing highly decayed teeth .
“ Kokoro thinks that Kabukicho is her kitchen or a playground inside her house , ” says Kwon , sporting a dark fleece jacket and black pants over his thin frame as he sucks on a cigarette .
“ Because she is a child and does n’t know anything , she believes that living on the street is normal .
She was four years old then .
She did n’t know what Japan was , what the U.S. was , or what anything was . ”
With his digital Canon camera always in his grasp , Kwon has over the years provided coverage on Hansen ’s disease patients and issues affecting minorities .
He has been highly influenced by the work of photojournalist Takashi Morizumi , who starting in the late 1990s took numerous photos in Iraq showing the horrific effects of depleted uranium on children following the Gulf War .
But Kabukicho is the part of Japan that is most exciting , so “ full of ‘ pink ’ elements and human desire , ” says Kwon , who since 2000 has contributed photos to such publications as the Mainichi Shimbun and Friday magazine .
“ There is nothing that you cannot find in Kabukicho .
Everything is here , and you can see everything . ”
The book “ Once Upon a Time in Kabukicho : 1996 - 2006 ” ( Wanimagazine ) features many shots by Kwon showing gang punch - ups and cops chasing felons .
For “ Kabukicho no Kokoro - chan , ” Kwon says that Kokoro ’s father gave him permission to do the project — an agreement that was a necessity .
“ I decided to make the book to let the public know the condition she was living in , ” he says .
“ I am known in the area for taking photos .
One day , Kokoro said to me , ‘ You are a photographer .
So take my photo !’
That ’s how it started . ”
The book also includes photos of other homeless sleeping under makeshift shelters and huddling or eating outside of shops closed for the night .
As of January , the number of homeless in Japan was 15,759 — roughly the same as the year before with Tokyo’s 23 wards accounting for roughly 70 percent of that figure — according to a report from the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare .
The survey , which began in 2003 , when the figure was 25,296 , has year by year shown a steady decline in the homeless population .
Yet the recent economic downturn has many experts predicting that Japan ’s streets will experience a reverse of that trend .
Kwon says that in spite being a wealthy country , Japan has a population that is a mix of rich and poor , much like the U.S. and Korea — a fact that is often overlooked .
“ Japan tends to hide the negative things within society and show only the positive aspects , ” Kwon believes .
“ I know that there are street children in Japan .
But the government does not want to acknowledge it .
To me , that is shameful . ”

The Mexican Navy says X - ray machines helped uncover the haul
The Mexican Navy says it has seized more than a tonne of cocaine hidden inside the carcasses of frozen sharks .
Armed officers found slabs of cocaine inside more than 20 sharks aboard a freight ship in the Gulf coast port of Progreso in Yucatan state .
Correspondents say cartels are coming up with increasingly creative ways of smuggling drugs into the US .
Shipments of cocaine have also been discovered hidden inside sealed beer cans , religious statues and furniture .
" We are talking about more than a tonne of cocaine that was inside the ship , " said Mexican Navy Commander Eduardo Villa .
He said X - ray machines and sniffer dogs had helped to uncover the haul .
" Those in charge of the shipment said it was a conserving agent but after checks we confirmed it was cocaine , " he said .
Methamphetamine
In another development on Tuesday , the Mexican Navy unveiled what it described as one of the largest methamphetamine labs ever found in the country .
When officers stumbled across the enormous holding tank in a remote part of the northern state of Sinaloa last week they thought it might be used to water a marijuana plantation .
Instead , the tank fed water into two enormous sheds where investigators found 12,905 gallons ( 49,640 litres ) of ephedrine , a chemical used to make methamphetamine .
Officials said it was enough to produce 40.2 tonnes of the drug , or about 309 million individual doses .
So far this year more than 2,700 people have died in drug - related violence in Mexico .
Last year about 6,300 were killed .
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has committed some 45,000 troops and federal police to try to crush the country 's powerful cartels .

2.7 MB Chorus recorded by Cluster 2 satellite from data collected on July 9 , 2001 .
Chorus consists of brief , rising - frequency tones that sound like the chorus of birds singing at sunrise , hence the name " chorus " or " dawn chorus " .
Chorus at Earth is generated by electrons in Earth 's Van Allen radiation belts .
Once generated , the chorus waves affect the motions of the electrons through a process called a wave - particle interaction .
Wave - particle interactions disturb the trajectories of the radiation belt electrons and cause the electrons to hit the upper atmosphere .

803 KB Short but spectacular whistler recorded by Cluster 3 and 4 satellites from data collected on Feb 4 , 2001 .
Whistlers are produced by lightning .
This energy is radiated as electromagnetic waves over a very broad spectrum of frequencies , from very low - frequency radio waves to visible light .
Some of these radio waves propagate upward into the ionized gas located above the Earth 's atmosphere guided along geomagnetic field , and often echo back and forth between the northern and southern hemispheres .
The waves travel faster at higher frequencies and slower at lower frequencies .
Therefore , a spacecraft will first detect the higher frequencies and later the lower frequencies .
The result is a whistling tone , hence the name " whistler " .

Whistle echo trains .
They result when the radio wave bounces back and forth between magnetic conjugate points .
Each time the signal bounces off the ionosphere , some of the energy leaks down in the lower atmosphere and is heard as a whistler .
All of the whistlers in the train are the result of a single lightning stroke .
Successive " hops " of the whistler are seen with increasing dispersion time as the distance travelled grows with each bounce .
Document IMAGE / INSPIRE .
1.3 MB Two - hop whistlers originated near the receiver site .
The signal that travels along the magnetic field line bounces off the ionosphere in the other magnetic hemisphere and returns to be heard as a whistler near where the original lightning stroke occurred .
Two - hop whistlers can be identified by the presence of a strong " local " sferic ( within 2000 km ) between one and two seconds before the whistler is heard .

313 KB Magnetosphere whistlers recorded on the nightside on March 26 , 1996 at 07:59 UTC by Don Gurnett from U.Iowa .
Initially the wideband receiver ( VLF ) was connected to the electric Eu antenna , but was switched to the Bu magnetic search coil antenna at 07:59:06 UTC .
A series of brief whistlers is evident throughout this interval below 1.5 kHz .
These sounds are audio frequency electromagnetic waves produced by lightning .
Once produced , these waves travel along closed magnetic field lines from one hemisphere to the other in the right - hand polarized , whistler mode of propagation .
The duration of the whistling tone is related to the length of the propagation path .
Because of anisotropies in the index of refraction , the wave energy is confined within a cone that makes an angle of 19°28 ' with respect to the local magnetic field .

Chorus emissions are electromagnetic widebands emissions propagating in the right - hand polarized whistler mode .
They are among the most intense plasma waves in the outer magnetosphere .
Chorus emissions are observed at intermediate invariant latitudes , between L=4 and L=10 , and over a wide range of local times with a peak in the distribution near local dawn .
This record was taken at daytime at latitudes just below the dayside auroral zone .
The receiver was connected to a magnetic loop antenna .

The third smallest sovereign nation in the world has just made an enormous contribution to relieving the world 's debt to the environment .
Singapore researchers at the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology ( IBN ) have discovered how to turn carbon dioxide into methanol ....
Double take :
They have found a way to make greenhouse gas green .
Triple take :
They took the biggest contributor to the world 's carbon footprint and converted it into a source of clean energy for the world .
Astounding .
In case you 're not jumping out of your skin yet , the IBN research was immediately sent to Angewandte Chemie , published by the German Chemical Society , and the prestigious journal called it a " hot paper , " and " very important . "
In layman 's terms , what IBN researchers discovered is that if they used N - heterocyclic carbenes ( NHCs ) , an organic catalyst , as opposed to heavy metal catalysts , carbon dioxide is activated , a state which it must be in to transform it into something useful .
Then , hydrosilane , a combination of silica and hydrogen , is added to the NHC - activated carbon dioxide and , by adding water into the solution through hydrolysis , the carbon dioxide transforms into methanol .
IBN principal research scientist , Dr. Yugen Zhang , explained : “ Hydrosilane provides hydrogen , which bonds with carbon dioxide in a reduction reaction .
This carbon dioxide reduction is efficiently
catalyzed by NHCs even at room temperature .
Methanol can be easily obtained from the
product of the carbon dioxide reaction .
Our previous research on NHCs has demonstrated
their multiple applications as powerful antioxidants to fight degenerative diseases , and as
effective catalysts to transform sugars into an alternative energy source .
We have now
shown that NHCs can also be applied successfully to the conversion of carbon dioxide into
methanol , helping to unleash the potential of this highly abundant gas . ”
I wonder when this will become front page news ....

The number of swine flu cases in Japan soared over the weekend , raising the likelihood that the World Health Organization will soon have to raise its pandemic alert level to 6 , the highest level .
On Sunday , the assistant principal of a school in Queens died after being hospitalized with swine flu .
It was the sixth flu - related death in the United States and the first in New York State .
In Japan , authorities ordered more than 1,000 schools and kindergartens in and near the cities of Kobe and Osaka to shut down .
There were no confirmed cases in Tokyo .
Until Friday , Japan thought it had contained the virus after finding four infected people who had visited North America and flown home .
It quarantined them and 50 other passengers , began sending medical workers to meet each flight arriving from North America to take temperatures of those on board and told visitors they would need to have their temperatures recorded daily .
In what essentially became a swap of free - agent forwards , the Lakers agreed to contract terms with former Houston Rockets forward Ron Artest while the Rockets reached an agreement with Trevor Ariza on a Thursday that proved to be as unpredictable and impulsive as , well , the Lakers ’ newest acquisition .
Artest , who will be 30 in November , is a formidable defender with scoring skills who enjoys the Los Angeles lifestyle almost as much as the Lakers took pleasure in bringing him into their fold .
He agreed to a three - year deal worth about $ 18 million , giving the Lakers two of the NBA ’s top defenders : Kobe Bryant was a first - team All - Defensive selection last season while Artest was second team .
Artest was a presence in the courtside seats for some of the Lakers ’ games in the NBA Finals , sticking out among the actors , producers and business moguls who will now presumably cheer for him when the Lakers resume play after winning the franchise ’s 15th championship a few weeks ago .

He averaged 17.1 points , 5.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists for the Rockets last season and did n’t seem upset about taking a pay cut after making $ 7.4 million last season .
“ I am very excited to finally be going to L.A. , ” Artest said in a statement .
“ For years now , the Lakers have expressed interest in having me play for them , but we could never get the stars to align .
I ’m finally a Laker and I can’t wait to get on the court with Kobe , Pau [ Gasol ] and the rest of the team , and play for Phil [ Jackson ] .
“ I look forward to helping the Lakers defend their championship , and it will be great to finally not get booed in the Staples Center . ”
Artest cannot officially sign the contract until the league ’s weeklong moratorium on announcing free - agent signings ends next Wednesday .

The Lakers ca n’t comment specifically on signing free agents until the moratorium ends , but the addition of Artest ended their pursuit of Ariza , who agreed to a five - year deal worth about $ 33 million with Houston a few hours after the Lakers came to terms with Artest .
“ I am happy with my decision , ” Ariza told The Times .
“ I ’m glad this all worked out .
The Rockets are going to give me a chance to improve my game and that ’s all you can ask for . ”
Ariza played in all 82 regular - season games and stepped up his game in the playoffs , averaging 11.3 points while shooting a stellar 47.6 % from three - point range .
He also had memorable steals of two inbounds passes late in Games 1 and 3 of the Western Conference finals against Denver .
Ariza ’s agent , David Lee , said the 24 - year - old forward passed up a more lucrative contract offer from another team to go to Houston .
That team was believed to be Toronto .

“ It was never about the money , ” Lee said .
“ It was about going someplace where you felt appreciated . ”
The courtship of Artest began with a phone call from Magic Johnson , continued over the phone with Jackson and ended during a seal - the - deal lunch Thursday with Lakers owner Jerry Buss .
Jackson has always admired Artest from afar and believes he can coach Artest despite the player ’s sometimes irregular behavior .
Artest offered mutual respect on Thursday .

“ I had a great talk today with Phil , ” Artest said .
“ I ’m a huge fan of his and I ca n’t wait to show him what I can do . ”
Bryant is a longtime supporter of Artest and even begged the Lakers to trade for him a few years ago , though the two had some brush - ups last season that demonstrated first - hand the unpredictability of Artest .
In Game 2 of the West semifinals between the Lakers and Rockets , Artest was called for an over - the - back foul , complained to the referee , ran across the court to Bryant and got in the face of the Lakers ’ guard .
Artest was angry that Bryant elbowed him while the two were jostling underneath the basket .
After they were separated , Artest pointed at Bryant and then pointed at his own neck , indicating where the blow had landed .

Artest was ejected from the game and said afterward , “ I told Kobe , ‘ You ’ve got to relax .
You ’re hitting the wrong person .
Do n’t you know you ’re hitting Ron Artest ? ’ ”
Two months before that , Artest began trash - talking to Bryant in a regular - season game .
Bryant responded by scoring 31 points in the second half of a 102 - 96 Lakers victory .
“ It was n’t much of a battle , ” Bryant said .
“ I kicked his [ butt ] ”
Artest answered by saying , “ We are not friends out there at all .
After the season , we might play pickup games or something like that .
Not now . ”

At the very least , Lakers practices should be more entertaining next season .
In case the Lakers had n’t shaken their lack - of - toughness image by winning the championship , adding the barrel - chested Artest wo n’t hurt .
He is 6 feet 7 , 260 pounds and afraid of practically no one .
He gained several years ’ worth of notoriety as the centerpiece of one of the NBA ’s darkest moments , the infamous brawl in 2004 that involved the Indiana Pacers , Detroit Pistons and numerous fans .
Artest , then with the Pacers , went into the crowd after a beverage was thrown at him and later punched a fan .
He was suspended for a total of 86 games , the longest penalty for a physical altercation in NBA history .
Off the court , he received a year ’s probation for pleading no contest to assault charges .

The Lakers have now allocated roughly $ 81.5 million toward 11 players on next season ’s payroll , which puts them roughly $ 10 million into luxury - tax territory .
The Lakers were conscious of the tax heading into the off - season , so it remains to be seen who else they pursue .
By getting Artest with the mid-level exception , a spending tool for teams that are over the salary cap , the Lakers have only a handful of possibilities remaining beyond a trade .
A large payday for free - agent forward Lamar Odom has all but disappeared , though he could still sign a one - year deal with the team and try free agency again next season when more teams will have money to spend .
The Lakers have also maintained contact with free - agent guard Shannon Brown and have agreed to talk again today .

PLANCK SPACE TELESCOPE
Planck is now the " coolest thing in space " Planck will survey the famous Cosmic Microwave Background
This ancient light 's origins date to 380,000 years after the Big Bang
It informs scientists about the age , shape and evolution of the cosmos Planck 's measurements will be finer than any previous satellite
Planck prepares to go super - cold Europe 's Planck observatory has reached its operating temperature , making it the coldest object in space .
The observatory 's detectors have been chilled to a staggering minus 273.05C - just a tenth of a degree above what scientists term " absolute zero . "
Launched in May , Planck will survey the " oldest light " in the Universe .
Its detectors , or bolometers , should see detail in this radiation that offers new insights into the age , contents and evolution of the cosmos .
Although laboratory set -ups have got closer to absolute zero than Planck , researchers say it is unlikely there is anywhere in space currently that is colder than their astronomical satellite .
This frigidity should ensure the bolometers will be at their most sensitive as they scan the sky for the target light .
The remarkable conditions are maintained , in part , by always pointing Planck away from the heat of the Sun .
Shields and baffling get the telescope down to about - 220C .
Three active refrigeration systems then lower the onboard environment at the heart of the observatory extremely close to the state of zero heat energy - when , theoretically , atoms would stop moving .
Planck has been sent to an observation position some 1.5 million km from Earth .
Its first data release is expected next year .
The European Space Agency mission was launched along with another telescope called Herschel .
This second observatory is sensitive to shorter wavelength radiation than Planck and will be studying the birth of stars and the evolution of galaxies .
It , too , carries bolometer technology , but operates at a slightly warmer temperature - just 0.3 of a degree above absolute zero .

Lock Your Livejournal , Raymond E. Feist !
Fantasy author Raymond E. Feist is losing his shit online for all the world to see !
He recently ended a relationship with a much younger woman who was only interested in him for his money , and not -- in fact -- for his stunning prose .
And now he wo n't stop writing about it on his author website .
Observe : Though he dated the woman for almost a year , Feist claims to have been completely bamboozled by her romantic gestures , and the death of the affair has crippled him emotionally and as a writer , causing him to blog on and on about " the little liar " and how he would like to " punch her out " if he ever sees her again .
When famous , well - paid fiction writers break - up with men or women who are forty years younger than they are , their friends and publishers have a solemn duty to protect them in their vulnerable state and ban them from blogging about their relationship publicly .
Narrative may be how writers solve problems ( unfortunately ) , but when it gets personal and vicious , the whole thing gets ugly , sad , and possibly libelous .
According to Feist , the woman in question lost her job as a result of this affair , and was " going after his kids " somehow , which has provided his justification for his endless , frothing rants .
Is his " revenge " to use his prestige as a well - known fantasy writer , with fans and admirers all over the world , to condemn his ex-lover on the public stage ?
If so , somebody fucking stop him before he gets sued and really does lose all his money !
He blames his " narrative mind " for the deception , arguing that he was manipulated as a writer , led by the woman to see an outcome of future sex and relations that she had no intention of providing : " Now , the thing about being inclined to the narrative is that while it 's a great gift to have if you 're writing fiction ( or a political PR spin doctor ) it can be a bitch in your real life .
For example , I 'm cruising down the freeway minding my own business and my mind turns to something , let me say the little liar , and before I know it I 'm pissed off again .
Why ?
Because I did n't just have a passing recollection of her , but before I could stop I launched off in an entire movie in my head , complete with dialogue , sound effects , back ground music , and no popcorn .
" Yes .
That happens .
It is called " regret . "
The movie is playing in your head so that you will learn from it before it turns into " remorse .
"
It is not the end of the world .
It is not even the end of the Riftworld , Midkemia , or Krondor .
Secret Service is yet another rogue that is spreading by using fake online scanners .
This rogue is like many others : it uses fake online scanners to lure the unsuspicious user into installing to remove threats that are not there .
The online scanner will present several security threats and then recommends installing the software .
Once installed , Secret Service will begin scanning the system and presents several threats .
To remove these threats , the user needs to license the software .

The Chapters of Cities
This is an especially American perspective of looking at the development of cities , but I think that the same basic evolution is generally true for cities around the world , even if they have n’t yet reached some of the later chapters .
Chapter 1 : Make - shift Slums
Tokyo slum during the US occupation years .
As Kevin Kelly rightly points out , “ every city begins as a slum … a seasonal camp with free - wheeling make - shift expediency . ”
Cities are founded on economic opportunity , spontaneous slums , and lawless saloons .
Eventually gender ratios equal out , churches move in , government takes shape , and urban planning is institutionalized .
Chapter 2 : Hegemony Rules
During the transition from slum to civic center some social group usually takes power and dictates policy .
It tends to be the ethnic majority though in the case of colonized countries that was almost never the case .
In most cities in the United States power lied among the WASP community .
Ethnic minorities were pushed out to the edges while the elite built Victorian homes around the downtown business districts and plazas .
Chapter 3 : White Flight and suburbanization
This is the chapter that takes on different manifestations depending on the ethnic and class make - up of a city , but the basic concept is still generally applicable .
During WWII in the United States there was an influx of black americans seeking work in urban centers .
After WWII four developments ( other than blatant racism ) led to white flight from urban centers to suburban communities .
First was population density .
After the war soldiers returned home to urban centers , but those who moved in while they were gone also remained .
Then there was the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision , which began the process of desegregating the country ’s public schools .
White parents felt that their children would receive a lower level of education in a desegregated school , and so they moved to suburbs where neighborhoods and their schools were all white .
Third , the Federal Aid Highway
Act of 1956 enabled the workday commute from suburb to city center .
Lastly , suburban developers had large returns to scale as they could purchase a single large plot of land and build hundreds or even thousands of nearly identical homes .
Chapter 4 : Urban Gentrification
White flight certainly continues today , often in new manifestations , but a far greater trend is urban gentrification .
While the majority of white Americans from my generation grew up in mostly white suburban neighborhoods , our schools and public institutions became increasingly integrated and multicultural .
Television and mass media brought the Cosby Show , The Jeffersons , Fresh Prince , and Family Matters into our living room .
And then came hip -hop .
All of a sudden there was nothing less cool than to have grown up in the suburbs .
Young people from affluent suburbs moved into lower - income urban neighborhoods where they opened coffee shops , art galleries , and cocktail bars .
Awkwardness and antagonism between the newly arrived affluent and the established lower - income population were inevitable .
In the worst of cases property prices increased and low - income renters were forced to move out to other neighborhoods .
However , there has also been an effort by young people across different classes in gentrified neighborhoods to shape a common aesthetic around hip - hop , indie rock , street art , and skateboarding .
This is where we are today , at least my generation , or at the very least , my group of friends .
We live in urban multicultural neighborhoods where the one thread that ties everyone together is pop culture and consumerism .
In fact , I mentioned to Chippla a few days ago that perhaps America has been able to achieve a higher degree of multiculturalism than Europe ( which favors assimilation ) because the entire country is unabashedly pro-consumerist whereas most European countries at least pretend to be anti-consumerist .
Chapter 5 : Increased urbanization or decentralization ?
Urban farms in China
The thing is , multiculturalism can be exhausting .
Identity politics become an ingrained part of daily life .
You are expected to know something – if not everything – about every cultural , ethnic , and sub-cultural group in your neighborhood .
There are few common bonds around music , art , religion , or culture because the choices become infinite .
Separate studies in the UK and the US have both found that as neighborhoods become more diverse the reported happiness and civic participation of their residents both decrease .
Though the trend has been occurring for decades , today more than ever we do n’t interact with – or even know the names of – our neighbors .
And yet the allure of hip multiculturalism still brings more affluent youth from suburban America , which increases the cost of rent , requiring a higher income and longer working hours .
Life in gentrified America may look like American Apparel advertisements when you upload those dinner party photos to Flickr , but work overload , economic debt , information overload , and cultural overload are also all parts of living in gentrified America .
I often wonder if my friends will soon give up on city life .
Paying $ 2,000 a month on rent while working 50 hours a week to bring home just enough to get by is n’t anyone ’s idea of the American Dream .
The escape fantasy of finding a cabin in the woods with a decent internet connection becomes more and more appealing .
I mentioned this to Ivan last week over an espresso macchiato and under a gloomy Amsterdam sky .
He tries to escape city life as often as possible , but he also wonders if the problem is n’t with cities , but rather cities as we know them .
Maybe we do n’t really desire the farm and forest as much as we desire a little farm and forest in our cities .
He reminded me of the community garden right outside of Revaz ’s apartment in Washington DC .
Ivan would love to get a plot and test out his green thumb , but the waiting list is over a year .
I think that , ultimately , whether my generation flees or embraces city life comes down to economics .
If city governments are able to make enough green space and agricultural land without raising already - high rent and property prices then multicultural gentrification might be here to stay .
Otherwise , I believe a new ( and environmentally harmful ) flight to the open countryside could soon be underway .

Fireworks traditionally mark US Independence Day Fourth of July celebrations will take place across US cities and states on Saturday to celebrate American independence day .
But they are likely to be subdued , with many cities cutting back or eliminating the elaborate firework displays that have been a key feature of the celebrations .
It is the latest sign of the fiscal crisis that is spreading across the nation as the recession has had a dramatic effect on state spending .
The state of California , with a GDP larger than most countries , has been among the hardest hit .
On Wednesday , it said it would start issuing IOUs rather than cash payments to its creditors after the state legislature failed to agree a budget deal .
State spending
The 50 US states play a much more important role in the US system than local authorities do in a European context .
Together they make up about one - third of all public spending , or 10 % of US GDP .
Detroit is to close 23 schools and lay off 600 teachers .
Most spending on schools , roads and welfare support is made at the state level .
And the states also have an important constraint that the Federal government does not - they have nearly all passed laws in the past 20 years requiring them to have a balanced budget , and forbidding them to borrow money to pay for current spending .
This has hit them very hard as the US recession starts to bite .
States rely on sales taxes and property taxes at the local level to fund much of their spending .
These revenues have plunged as the economy has gone into freefall .
At the same time , they have faced higher bills to pay for the casualties of the recession .
California dreaming California , the biggest and richest state in the US , has been particularly hard - hit .
It has an unemployment rate of 11.5 % , well above the US average , and has been at the centre of the sub - prime mortgage crisis , with more properties foreclosed than in any other state .
Several of its biggest banks , including IndyMac , have been taken over by the federal government , and its manufacturing sector has been hard - hit by the crisis .
It also has more poor people and immigrants than other states .
So California faces a $ 26bn ( £ 15 bn ) deficit on its general budget of $ 96bn .
But it is not alone .
According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) , a Washington think tank , 48 of the 50 states are facing budget deficits this year , with a total deficit of $ 166bn , or 24 % of their budgets .
And it projects an aggregate deficit of $ 311bn by 2011 .
Political deadlock
With the new fiscal year for most states beginning on 1 July , their state legislatures have been under pressure to agree and package of higher taxes and fees , and cuts in services to balance their budgets .
Some state workers have already seen their pay and hours cut Seven states have failed to reach agreement on a new budget - including many of the big industrial states such as Illinois , Ohio , and Pennsylvania , as well as Arizona , also hard - hit by the sub - prime crisis .
They are being forced to resort to measures such as asking banks to loan state workers their wages ( in Pennsylvania ) to a one - week temporary spending bill ( in Ohio ) .
The political deadlock is not surprising .
Few legislators would like to raise taxes in the recession , rejecting , for example , Arizona governor Jan Brewer 's request for a temporary increase in the state sales tax .
But about half of all states have raised taxes or increased fees already this year , according to research by the CBPP , while 12 are considering such measures .
The peculiarities of California 's political system have made the deadlock particularly difficult to break in that state .
Passing a budget bill requires a two - thirds majority .
But any compromise has been made more difficult because boundary changes have given most legislators in California safe seats with little chance of being unseated in an election - thus entrenching traditional party positions .
So far California Democrats have rejected the deep cuts in services and " revenue enhancements " ( higher taxes ) proposed by Republican governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and suggested $ 11bn in cuts instead , a plan the governor says he will veto .
And California voters rejected all the options for raising more revenue put to them in a recent referendum .
Impact on recession
But with no budget agreement , many states will have no choice but to reduce services and lay off government employees , as well as playing for time with temporary fixes .
Mr Schwarzenegger is struggling to solve California 's budget Already there is evidence from across the country suggest that services are being cancelled , from ending the summer school programmes for 14,000 children in Brevard County , Florida , to closing state parks in California , to reductions in eligibility for health care coverage in New York .
In California , its budget woes mean that : Hundreds of infrastructure projects - road repairs , water maintenance , etc - have been shelved , along with the thousands of jobs they promised
counties and state suppliers have not been paid for services they provide
thousands of Californians who were looking forward to tax refunds , have not received them and will not do so in the foreseeable future
20,000 state workers may be laid off and many more will be required to take unpaid leave
The reductions in state spending will also have a negative effect on the economy , deepening the recession in states where the cuts are most severe .
It was concern about such economic effects that led the Obama administration to include substantial aid to state budgets in its $ 787bn fiscal stimulus plan that was passed by Congress in February .
But relatively little of the promised money has arrived yet , and meanwhile the speed and scale of the downturn has made their fiscal position much worse .
According to Todd Haggerty , an analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures , there have not been so many states without budgets since 2003 , another recession year .
The schools superintendent in Brevard County , Florida , Richard DiPatri said he had no choice but to cut the summer school programme despite its academic benefits .
" Last year in Florida , our funding just went off the cliff , " Mr DiPatri told the New York Times .
With many economists predicting that any recovery in the US economy will be weak and slow , the budget woes and political problems of the states are likely to continue for some time .

Paul Krugman says he 's been getting hatemail calling him the new Thomas Malthus .
( Which actually strikes me as pretty thoughtful , high - minded hatemail . )
Paul responds by pointing out that Thomas Malthus was actually right for just about all of human history , and reprints a graph from Brad DeLong to prove it .
I have slightly different graph on this point , drawn from Gregory Clark 's fantastic A Farewell To Alms .
( IMHO the book really is worth a read . )
The graph is , quite simply , the economic history of the entire world :
For pretty much all of human history , population growth constrained growth in real standards of living .
( That 's the " Malthusian Trap " above : as standards of living improved , population increased , which put a strain on resources and drove down standards of living , which in turn drove down population growth , rinse & repeat . )
The industrial revolution broke this trap , although it 's worth pointing out the fairly obvious fact that this is not true for the entire world -- which is why the graph is labeled the " Great Divergence " and not the " Unmitigated Triumph . "
An interesting question about the history of economics is whether ( and why ) we should continue to assume the kind of rapid growth that has characterized western economies since 1800 .
It has n't been around forever .

Turkish manti is a food you have to taste !
The tiny homemade pastry filled with spicy ground beef , cooked in water and served with a yogurt sauce .
That butter sauce on manti dumplings is a to - die - for the final touch .
Dumplings in Turkish are called manti and it ’s one of those dishes everyone craves for every time .
It ’s not an easy dish for many people , so people may not prefer making it at home .
If you insist on eating Turkish manti , but have no time to make it , you can find it packaged at markets .
I find them tasteless though , they are no different from pasta and they have almost no filling inside .
There are some small bakery like shops producing and selling Turkish dumplings , which are better than market versions .
If the owner of these shops is an old lady and if she herself makes it , this is even better !
But still why not make it at home ?
Making Manti Food Together
Well , I admit that it ’s a bit time - consuming if you are making it alone , but I ca n’t say that it ’s a difficult dish .
It might take hours to make these small dumplings depending on the amount .
Time is the real concern here , so Turkish women come together at one of their homes and make it in a teamwork .
At least 3 women – sometimes more work together to make dumplings especially for special days like weddings , welcome or farewell parties or family unions .
One of them make dough and roll it out , another one cut it into squares , a third one put filling on each square and then they all start to close them up .
Making Turkish Dumplings Manti means more than making the dish itself .
Although they serve for one purpose , which is completing the dish , women never miss the chance of having some chat ; well , maybe a bit gossiping !
And this is absolutely the best solution for time problem !
They can hardly realize how time runs when they finally seal the last dumpling !
The best part of making dumplings with some friends is that you have lots of it in the end and you can freeze some for a future cooking !
It becomes an easy dish then !
Just boil them in water and enjoy with yogurt !
I think teamwork is definitely a must if you are planning to make Turkish Dumplings Manti for a large group of guests , but you can easily handle it yourself if you make it for two of you .
What Goes In Turkish Manti Recipe
You do n’t need many ingredients for Turkish Dumplings Manti dough .
Flour , egg , salt and water are what you need .
I made it with whole wheat flour , but you can use all purpose flour instead .
As for the filling , we need ground beef , onion , parsley and spices .
Optionally , we use very little pepper or tomato paste too .
As for the service , we need two kind of sauces .
First one is a yogurt sauce with garlic .
Second is a spicy butter sauce .
How To Make Turkish Manti Dumplings From Scratch
As you are making it in small amount , one cute dough ball will be enough .
I love my rolling pin !
I have only one and it ’s like the star of my kitchen !
Roll the dough ball out not very thin , about 2 mm .
Cut it first into strips and then into small squares .
So many dough squares waiting to be closed up !
If you double the ingredients , you feel that you need someone to help you at this stage !
Here starts the fun part !
First fold it into two .
Then combine all edges .
Then you have this bundle like shape .
It took me no longer than 15 - 20 minutes to finish them all !
Do n’t forget to serve it with a yogurt sauce and oil sauce on the top .
I also love to sprinkle a little sumac on it .
YUM !

Eastside succeeds by focusing on the students HIGH SCHOOL SUCCESS STORY
Seniors Alejandro Gutierrez ( from left ) talks with Victor Carranza and Andrew Cruz on the Eastside College Preparatory campus in East Palo Alto , Calif. , on Tuesday , June 9 , 2009 .

This is the kind of school Hollywood makes movies about - a seat - of - your - pants high school where the first class of students , all poor , gathered at an East Palo Alto picnic bench in 1996 for the lack of a classroom .
Today , Eastside College Preparatory School sits on nearly 6 acres nearby and for 10 years straight has had a 100 percent graduation rate , with every graduate heading to four - year colleges across the country , most of them the first in their families to make it .
It 's a Cinderella story with an academic record any school , public or private , would envy .
It also shows one way to set at - risk students squarely on the academic path to success , closing the seemingly unmovable achievement gap between poor and often minority students and their white , Asian and wealthier peers .
Yet public schools will have a hard time following Eastside 's recipe for success .
The private school 's price tag is $ 17,000 per year for each child , and that does n't include an additional $ 10,000 for each of the 30 students who participated this year in the school 's boarding program , which offers a stable living environment for those who need it .
The students do n't pay any of it .
Eastside is a nonprofit school , funded by foundations and individuals .
The school apparently appeals to deep - pocket donors : Eastside maintains an endowment and property portfolio of about $ 80 million .
State public schools get a little more than half of Eastside 's budget per child and post a graduation rate of about 68 percent .
At Eastside , 11 African American students graduated Wednesday , college - ready and university - bound .
Compare that with all six of the high schools in the neighboring Sequoia Union High School District , where 12 college - ready African Americans graduated last year .
State of the art
The Eastside facilities are expansive and state of the art , the teacher and staff unconditionally dedicated and certain that every student can and will succeed .
" It 's the full package , " said founder and Principal Chris Bischof , a former East Palo Alto public school teacher .
" I think that 's what it takes . "
The private school appears to brush aside any doubt that closing the achievement gap can be done .
Eastside 's 37 graduating seniors Wednesday received 267 college acceptance letters from 90 colleges across the country , according to the schools ' award - winning student newspaper .
College in Atlanta
Senior Shayla Bunch , 18 , started at Eastside as a ninth - grader and is headed to Emory University in Atlanta this fall .
She was raised by her single mother who never finished high school .
" She really wanted us to get a college education , " said Bunch , a star athlete with a 3.7 grade point average .
Without the pushing and prodding and academic peer pressure at Eastside , the East Palo Alto resident said she is n't sure what her future would have held .
" I probably never would have heard of Emory , " she said .
A key is believing that the students can make it , and that 's part of the recipe public schools can follow , said Phil Halperin , president of the Silver Giving Foundation , which has helped fund the school for the past 10 years .
" There are people out there who say these kids can't succeed and ( Eastside ) proves that wrong day in and day out , " Halperin said .
" This is a place where every adult in the building believes every kid can succeed .
I fully think half the secret sauce is the expectation piece . "
Bischof , a Stanford University graduate , planted the seeds of success with just eight students at that picnic bench , moved into a house a year later and has since pulled in enough support to build what the community calls an oasis in the middle of historically crime - ridden and poverty - plagued East Palo Alto .
Enrollment growing
This year the school enrolled 200 students in grades six through 12 , although that number is expected to continue to grow .
The dorms can hold up to 160 students .
Eastside boasts state - of - the - art science and media labs , art studios , a theater , a gymnasium , a cafeteria , study rooms , tutoring centers bordering manicured lawns and an ever - present staff .
Students are served two meals a day , three for those who live there .
Classes run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. , but the campus is open until 10 p.m. each day and also on weekends .
" It takes a really dedicated staff , " he said .
Teachers earn $ 45,000 to $ 90,000 annually , on par with public school salaries .
Various summer programs are mandatory , including an all - expenses - paid trip junior year to East Coast colleges - the first plane ride for many students .
Senior Orlando Pineda , 17 , took that trip last year .
This year , he 's New York City - bound to study engineering at Columbia University , where he received a full financial ride .
" It 's one of the top engineering schools in the whole country , " he said with a smile .
Someday , he said , he'd like to work in the automotive industry to help design better cars or maybe in aeronautics to help send people into space .
Arguably , the Eastside students are motivated and might have succeeded wherever they went to school .
But many of them started at the school performing academically well below their grade levels .
The admission process is selective , but it 's not about grades or test scores , although students do submit those too .
Motivation is key .
It 's a choice
" It 's really important the kids make the choice to be here , " Bischof said .
Bischof said the school 's first goal has always been to get the students into college , but it 's now improving the preparation to help them finish college .
Eastside students who are now college graduates have landed in a variety of careers , including banking , insurance and teaching .
To date 76 percent of alumni have a college degree or are still enrolled in a four - year university .
The national college completion rate is 60 percent for students given six years to finish .
Of the Eastside students who did n't stay at four - year colleges , half went back to enroll in community colleges , Bischof said .
Fred Carr , a 2008 Eastside graduate recently finished his freshman year with a 2.9 grade point average at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles .
The 18 - year - old , the first in his immediate family to go to college , said he always wanted to go to college , but Eastside " molded me into the kind of student I am now . "
The natural science major is thinking about teaching high school biology someday but is n't ruling out pediatric medicine .
This summer he 's a full - time Hewlett - Packard marketing intern during the day and taking a community college chemistry course four nights a week to stay on the pre-med track .
" I do n't want to close any doors , " he said .
Carr laughed when asked about summer fun .
" That 's what the weekends are for . "

BMW 's future in Formula 1 is in serious doubt amid mounting speculation that the German car manufacturer will announce its withdrawal from the sport at the end of this season , on Wednesday .
An emergency press conference has been called at BMW 's headquarters in Munich , where it is suggested that the car company may reveal that it has decided to end its involvement in F1 .
The invite to the press conference said it had been called because of ' current developments in motor sport . '
The press conference will be hosted by Dr. Norbert Reithofer , the chairman of the BMW board , Dr. Klaus Draeger , the director for development , and Mario Theissen , BMW motorsport director .
The presence of such senior management figures suggests that the announcement will be very significant .
Officials at BMW refused to comment about what the press conference was about , but they did confirm that it was ' important ' news .
BMW had hoped to fight for the world championship this year , but instead the F1.09 has fallen short of expectations .
Its struggles , allied to the abandonment of its KERS , that BMW had pushed hard for in F1 , are likely to have played a part in any decision about the future of the team .
Although BMW Sauber had a difficult start to the season , Theissen has made it clear on several occasions that the team 's form had not changed the BMW Board 's commitment to F1 .
" We analysed and evaluated the situation and the F1 programme with the board prior to the start of the season in February , " said Theissen in May .
" It was overall a very positive evaluation and judgement , and that has n't changed .
" Apparently everybody is disappointed about the sporting results , but other than that there is no news and we have not discussed it since . "
However , sources suggest that a review meeting was planned for July to decide the future of the team - and this may be behind any announcement planned for the morning .
Should BMW confirm it is pulling out of the sport , it will be the second car manufacturer to do so in eight months - with Honda having announced last December that it was to leave the sport .
The announcement will be more of a surprise , however , because BMW Sauber was on the verge of signing a Concorde Agreement that would have committed the team to F1 until the end of 2012 .
In a couple of recent posts , I argued that random patterns in Conway ’s Game of Life tend , on average , to live longest when they have an initial density of 37.5 % cells being alive .
In this post , rather than looking at the distribution of the average lifespan for various initial densities , I will fix the density at 37.5 % and look at the distribution of lifespans that results , and use that to estimate what the maximal lifespan of any small pattern is ( as in my previous posts , I will use 20 × 20 starting patterns ) .
As before , I will explore both the case when we simulate Life on a torus and when we simulate it on an infinite plane .
Lifespan Distribution on a Torus
After simulating 175000 random patterns on a 20 × 20 torus , the distribution of the lifespans was as follows :
The bins in the graph have a width of 10 , and the peak occurs in the lifespan 91 – 100 bin .
Some other interesting stats include :
Maximum observed lifespan : 2092
Minimum observed lifespan : 14
Average lifespan : 210
Median lifespan : 164
Standard deviation of lifespan : 159.3
In order to try to estimate the longest lifespan of any pattern on a 20 × 20 torus , I will assume that if the lifespan is above 100 , then it follows an exponential distribution , which appears to be a reasonable assumption given the above histogram .
Indeed , this leads to the following histogram , which has the exponential of best fit overlaid in black .
The equation of the exponential is y = 9088.7 ( 0.938 ) x , and the R2 value is 0.997 ( that ’s one heck of a good fit ) .
Now that we have our exponential of best fit , we can get an estimate of the maximal lifespan in this scenario by assuming that the lifespan of the 220* 20 different patterns are independent of each other ( this may not be a particularly good assumption , as two patterns , for example , will have the same lifespan if they are translations of each other — nonetheless it seems that the number of reductions that can be made by symmetry arguments like that is tiny compared to the total number of such patterns , so let ’s roll with it ) .
We then set
and solve for x to get a maximal lifespan of x = 4474 .
This seems believable and not particularly shocking to me given the statistics that I listed earlier .
Lifespan Distribution on a Plane
Typically , Life enthusiasts are more interested in results on the infinite plane than on a torus , as it leads to behaviour that is much more chaotic and unpredictable .
For example , even though we just saw that the longest - lived 20 × 20 pattern on a torus likely lives for less than 4500 generations , there is a known 9×15 pattern that lives on the plane for over 29000 generations .
We will now proceed analogously to the torus discussion above to see how much better we can reasonably expect to do .
We begin with the distribution of the lifespan based on 60000 initial 20 × 20 patterns :
The bins in the graph have a width of 50 , and the peak occurs in the lifespan 151 – 200 bin .
The other basic stats are listed below , and as we would expect , the average lifespan and the standard deviation of lifespans are both much greater on the plane than they are on the torus .
Maximum observed lifespan : 13612
Minimum observed lifespan : 15
Average lifespan : 678
Median lifespan : 368
Standard deviation of lifespan : 885.6
The main difference with the analysis in this situation is that instead of assuming the lifespan itself follows an exponential distribution , I will assume that some power of the lifespan follows an exponential distribution ; the reason for this is that the R2 is quite low if we try to fit an exponential to the distribution of the lifespans itself .
Fitting an exponential to lifespan0.75 seems to give the maximum R2 value ( 0.9857 ) , so this is what I will use .
The following histogram shows the curve of best fit , which has the equation y = 1854.6 ( 0.957 ) x , where this time x = lifespan0.75 .
Finally , we follow our method from before and set
and solve for x to get a maximal lifespan of x = 120795 .
Of course , this number should be taken with a grain of salt , because that pattern I mentioned earlier that has a lifespan of over 29000 generations was found during a simulation of a whopping 12 billion 20 × 20 patterns , while our equation of best fit tells us that after 12 billion patterns , we would expect only to see a pattern with lifespan 6206 ( when really it should only take about 400 patterns to see such a lifespan ) .
Similarly , in the longest - lived patterns found by the Online Life - Like CA Soup Search , a pattern has been found with lifespan 24389 .
According to our formula , we should have to look at roughly 9 million billion billion billion soups before finding such a pattern , but only 40 million soups have actually been searched .
This all seems to suggest that the longest - lived pattern in a 20 × 20 box may in fact live considerably longer than 120000 generations , which goes to show just how in the dark we are when it comes to some of these simple questions — since the search space is so unimaginably huge , we likely will never know for sure what the true upper limit is .

Zoo is the only collection in the UK to exhibit and now breed the rare Tufted deer .
The small male fawn was born on 16th June 09 and weighed 1.5 kg at birth which is smaller than a bag of sugar .
Mother “ Michelle ” and father “ Mitch ” have been exceptional at rearing their first offspring .
Looking vulnerable ...
SAN JOSE , CALIFORNIA — Cellphone entrepreneur Nathan Eagle has most of Kenya on call , waiting for a small job .
Millions of them , in fact .
Eagle , an MIT research scientist who has been living and teaching in East Africa since 2006 , hopes to enlist cellphone users in developing countries to perform small text - based tasks in return for micro-payments .
Think of it as the mobile phone equivalent of Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , which pays humans to do such things as transcribe audio and tag photos .
If successful , Txteagle could provide an important source of income to rural and low - income populations .
What Eagle needs now is for companies in the West to figure out how to use this literate but underemployed mass of people to take care of tedious tasks that humans are better at than computers .
" We have transformed the majority of phones in East Africa into a platform that people can use to make money , " Eagle told conference goers Tuesday at the O'Reilly Emerging Tech conference being held this week in San Jose , California .
" There are 15 million Africans ready to start working on their mobile phones . "
Mobile phones are the most - dominant modern technology in the developing world , and now the majority of cellphone subscribers live outside developed countries .
" This is their technology .
The mobile phone is theirs , " Eagle said .
" It has had a far greater impact on their lives than it has on ours . "
For instance , Safari Com in Kenya has a well - developed payment system called MPesa that can be used to pay for a taxi or water from a remote village 's well .
Electricity is sold on a pay - as - you - go basis in
Kenya , and a startup there lets people buy prepaid cards and authorize them using their phone .
Thirty percent of the population now pays that way , instead of standing in line .
Eagle 's system uses text messages or a low bandwidth , interactive protocol known as USSD
( typically used to check prepaid phone balances ) .
Participants get paid in small blocks of money or in chunks of airtime .
Kenyans in the trial — security guards , taxi drivers and high school students — have already translated more than 15 local languages into English for Nokia , which will use the results to make phone menus .
Now Eagle is in California trying to find tasks that can be broken down into small chunks and sent to people in Kenya .
He 's also got partnerships lined up to deploy Txteagle in the Dominican Republic and Rwanda .
He 's convinced that the platform will work and has algorithms that tell companies how they can be 95 percent sure their answers are right .
Still , he admits that the real challenge will be in finding work that can be broken into little chunks .
Cheap airtime would let Txteagle tap into the medical transcription market — estimated to be a more than $ 15 billion industry that is dominated by outsourcing to India .
Already , Txteagle has found some cheap time is letting Africans call and listen to targeted radio ads and be paid for it , Eagle said , adding that it was n't as bad as it sounds .

The National Rifle Association said Tuesday that it would actively oppose Supreme Court nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor ’s confirmation if she is hostile to senators who press her about gun rights .
The letter marks a slight step forward for the group , which has still yet to say whether it flat - out opposes her confirmation or will count Judge Sotomayor ’s Senate confirmation vote in its influential scorecard of lawmakers .
“ The cases in which Judge Sotomayor has participated have been dismissive of the Second Amendment and have troubling implications for future cases that are certain to come before the Court , ” NRA Executive Director Chris W. Cox wrote in a letter to senators Tuesday .
“ Therefore , we believe that America ’s 80 million gun owners have good reason to worry about her views . ”
Judge Sotomayor ’s supporters and opponents have stepped up their public efforts in the past week in preparation for the Senate confirmation hearings , which begin Monday .
The American Bar Association awarded Judge Sotomayor its highest rating Tuesday , continuing a string of endorsements from judicial and law enforcement groups .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy , Vermont Democrat , and a group of national police officials released an analysis of Judge Sotomayor ’s work on the appellate bench showing that she upheld criminal convictions in 92 percent of her rulings .
But on gun rights , advocates , including 14 members of the NRA board of directors , sent a letter outright opposing Judge Sotomayor ’s confirmation .
“ For the first time in the history of judicial confirmation fights , the Second Amendment community is playing a big role , ” said Curt Levey , executive director for the Committee for Justice .
“ Because it ’s the one community that can send red state Democrats running for cover , this letter and the grass - roots opposition to Sotomayor that it represents put her confirmation in doubt . ”
With its voting scorecard , which moderate to conservative Democrats frequently tout in tough campaigns , the NRA holds a large amount of sway .
Gun issues have been an area where moderate to conservative Democrats have been more than willing to side with the Republican minority .
Oklahoma Republican Sen . Tom Coburn ’s amendment to permit concealed - carry in national parks won with the help of 27 Democrats who crossed the aisle to support the measure .
As part of a three - judge panel last year , Judge Sotomayor ruled against a man possessing nunchakus ( or “ nunchucks ” ) in New York .
In the ruling , which was unsigned , the panel determined that while the Supreme Court struck down the D.C. gun ban , its rationale did not expressly extend the Second Amendment right to bear arms to the states .
Earlier this year , the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled comparably in a lawsuit seeking to strike down Chicago ’s ban on handguns .
The three - judge panel reached a similar conclusion as the Sotomayor panel , saying that the Supreme Court determined the Second Amendment right to bear arms is applicable only on federal land - including the nation ’s capital .
But a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled recently that the Second Amendment right to bear arms does extend beyond federal jurisdictions to the states , creating a “ circuit split ” among the federal appeals courts , which could lead to the Supreme Court reviewing any or all of the three cases in its next session .

Getafe get shirty : Spanish fans have beef with La Liga team 's new Burger King kit
Fast food fans will really relish Burger King 's new sponsorship deal with Spanish side Getafe .
The Madrid - based club has struck a whopper of a deal to have the burger chain 's logo splashed on the front of their shirts and a picture of the ' Burger King ' on the inside , too .
The headshot on the reverse of the shirt is for goalscorers to wear as a mask during elaborate celebrations - Ravanelli - style .
In reverse : Getafe 's new shirt ( left ) and in celebration mode ( right )
So , when star striker Roberto Soldado slams home a 30 - yard screamer and pulled the shirt over his head , the Getafe faithful will see the Burger King himself smiling back at them ...
And it gets better .
Hilarious instructions come with the shirts , on not just how to just score said screamer but on how to celebrate the goal afterwards , too .
Celebration time : Fabrizio Ravanelli reacts to a goal in his signature way against Liverpool in the Nineties
Elias Diaz of Burger King , in one of those marketing - babble - type speeches , said : ' Burger King 's values of fun , fidelity and authenticity identify with the spirit of Getafe and their unconditional passion . '
The shirts have received a mixed reaction from the fans but only time will tell if any player dares to pull the shirt over their head after scoring a goal .
If ever there was a celebration that deserved a yellow card , it will be this .
A canny trade by a small brokerage firm in two markets at the heart of the financial crisis has left some of the biggest players on Wall Street crying foul .
The trade , by Amherst Holdings of Austin , Texas , was particularly galling to the big banks because it turned what they believed was a sure - fire profit into a loss .
The burned banks include ...
The 72 - year old actor David Carradine , who starred in the TV Series “ Kung Fu ” and Quentin Tarantino ’s “ Kill Bill ” movies , was found dead in Bangkok , Thailand .
A local newspaper The Nation reported that Carradine was found hanaged in his hotel room and was believed to have committed suicide .
According to his manager Chuck Binder , a producer went to his hotel room Thursday morning and found Carradine dead .
Binder said that the actor ’s death was “ shocking and sad ” .
Carradine ’s cause of death is still under investigation
The bug that can blast away cancer : Drug made from virus extends patients ' lives
Andrew McManus says Reolysin has extended his life expectancy - see case study below
A common virus which causes stomach upsets is giving hope to cancer patients - by boosting their immune system and blasting away tumours .
Almost 80 patients with advanced forms of liver cancer , head and neck tumours and breast cancer are taking part in trials using a drug made from the reovirus .
A number , who have struggled to benefit from chemotherapy , have seen astonishing results , with tumours shrinking and in one case disappearing altogether .
Experts say it is too soon to say if Reolysin is the ' magic bullet ' that will kill off cancer , but they believe it may offer a way of extending the life of patients given a short time to live .
Reolysin appears to kill off cancer cells by rupturing their walls , creating a chain reaction of ' explosions ' which rip through tumours .
As the tumours shrink they become less harmful and more easily treatable by chemotherapy .
At the same time , Reolysin seems to ' wake up ' the immune system so it can recognise cancer cells as invaders , prompting the body to mount an attack on harmful cells .
One liver cancer patient , Andrew McManus , 65 , said last night : ' To put it bluntly , I could well be dead by now without this treatment . '
Reovirus infection occurs often in humans , but most cases are mild - causing a stomach upset .
Its role in human disease is uncertain .
Canadian firm Oncolytics Biotech Inc , which created Reolysin , is working on trials with researchers from St James 's Hospital in Leeds , the Royal Marsden Hospital in London and the Royal Surrey County Hospital .
The drug is administered intravenously via a drip , with a patient receiving eight fiveday courses of treatment spread over six months .
The only side - effects appear to be a flu - like ache and a raised temperature .
Case Study.jpg
Lead researcher Professor Alan Melcher said : ' We have had a few dramatic responses to Reolysin but we still have to be very cautious about getting up too much hope .
We can not say people have been cured .
However , it is exciting and has got real potential . '
One man , Henry Nelson , 74 , of Halifax , with cancer of the head and neck saw a lump the size of a tennis ball in his neck almost disappear after chemotherapy plus Reolysin .
Professor Melcher said : ' It is a completely different approach to treating cancer .
It is not just another drug .
It is a virus and it seems to be very well tolerated in combination with chemotherapy .
' There is no magic bullet with cancer , but these combinations seem to be working . '
Experts say larger trials are needed before Reolysin can be widely available to patients .
That could take up to five years .
In UK trials , 15 head and neck cancer patients have been treated so far .
Of 12 for whom results were available , five have had a partial shrinkage of their tumours and in four the disease stabilised for between two to six months .
Oncolytics also announced positive results from its other UK trials , for patients who have tumours which have failed to respond to standard therapy .
Of 17 , 15 experienced stable disease or better .
Liz Woolf , of Cancer Research UK , said ' If it proves successful in larger trials , the reovirus could one day become an effective new treatment to be used alongside chemotherapy , radiotherapy and surgery to benefit people with some types of cancer .
Last month a working group of the Dutch Parliament published a report in which they made various suggestions on how to deal with online piracy .
In their analysis they made several false accusations against the Dutch based BitTorrent site Mininova , who today announce that they will take legal steps if they do n't get a public rectification .
In common with most other European countries The Netherlands is trying to find a solution to the ever increasing use of file - sharing sites to share copyrighted material .
Presently , downloading movies and music for personal use in The Netherlands is seen as “ fair use ” and not punishable by law .
In their advice to the government , a working group consisting of four members of the Dutch parliament looked into the matter .
They suggested criminalizing downloading once the entertainment industry has come up with sufficient legal alternatives .
The conclusions of the report were widely debated in the Dutch press .
Worryingly , also some of the factual errors about Mininova that the parliamentarians dreamed up were recited in the media , which may hurt the BitTorrent site in the ongoing court case against the local anti-piracy outfit BREIN .
For instance , the report claims that Mininova ignores complaints form copyright holders and refuses to remove torrents from their site .
This nonsense of course , since the site has had a copyright policy for years and is known to follow up every complaint .
Another inaccuracy in the report is the claim that Mininova adds “ reviews ” to the torrents their users have uploaded , something we ’ve never heard before .
The rumors that they actually host copyrighted content and that they filter porn from their site pro-actively do n’t hold up either .
The Mininova staff are not happy with these allegations , especially since they are currently involved in a lawsuit against the entertainment industries that covers the same issues .
“ We are very displeased with the fact that the working group did n’t contact us prior to releasing this report , or even took a look at mininova.org , ” Mininova co-founder Erik Dubbelboer said .
“ We demand that the spreading of false information related to Mininova will be stopped .
In addition , we demand that the working group removes the name Mininova from the report and places a rectification on the website of the Dutch parliament and in several national newspapers , ” Dubbelboer added .
“ We take this very seriously , ” Erik Dubbelboer said .
“ If these demands are not met , we ’ll consider to take legal steps , ” he said to emphasize the seriousness of their demands .
Arda Gerkens , the head of the parliamentary working group pointed to her parliamentary immunity when she was confronted with the news .
However , legal experts said that parliamentarians do n’t have any immunity when they speak out in public , which she did .
Mininova demands that the rectifications are made before the verdict in their case against BREIN is due , so it wont influence the decision of the judges .
Apple is now releasing test builds via Software Update to developers with access to the latest test builds of Mac OS X 10.6 .
The latest build , 10A402 , includes a number of fixes and optimizations , as well as two new visual UI changes .
So far , some of the changes that have been uncovered in the 1.3 GB update include a fix for Expos ?
issues when used with multiple monitors as well as activation of third - party preference panes .
Reports also indicate that overall system performance has significantly improved , with notable increases in speed and responsiveness as well as decreases in startup and shutdown times .
It also appears that battery life indicators are showing much longer estimated running times , though as of yet no tests can confirm that the times are accurate .
A couple interesting UI changes accompanied the new build as well .
The most obvious visual change is that contextual menus in the Dock now use a semi- transperent black background with white text , much like that of the current Stacks view .
This is in contrast to the current contextual menus , or folders set to list view , which show a light gray background with black text .
The Quantum Byte speculates that it is part of the rumored " Marble " interface theme that is expected to be featured in Snow Leopard .
From left to right : 10.5 sliders , iLife '09 sliders , 10.6 sliders
Adding some credence to that idea is the new appearance of sliders in the newest test build .
" Marble " is said to be very similar to the overall UI look of iLife ' 09 , introduced this past January .
You 'll notice that the appearance of the new slider controls is the same as those in iTunes 8 and iPhoto '09 .
Apple still has just under three months left to ship Snow Leopard by its promised September release .
The tweaks and optimizations are a good sign that things are progressing on schedule , but the UI changes may be a sign that Apple is saving a few small things to wow us with when it finally hits store shelves .
LANSDALE , Pa. --
A math teacher at a suburban Philadelphia high school who 's accused of having sex with one of her students and sending sexually explicit messages to another has been ordered to stand trial .
Heather Lynne Zeo has been suspended from her job at North Penn High School in Lansdale .
Both of the students are 17 - year - old boys .
A Montgomery County prosecutor said at Wednesday 's hearing for the 36 - year - old teacher that Zeo engaged in a " calculated seduction . "
Defense lawyer Marc
Neff says the boys were the aggressors .
Zeo is charged with endangering the welfare of a child and four counts of corruption of minors .
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday blocked an effort by major media companies to quash a technology that threatens their already deteriorating advertising business .
Plaintiffs including CBS , Fox , NBC Universal , Turner , Viacom and Walt Disney had asked the justices to reverse a lower - court ruling that allowed Cablevision Systems Corp .
to offer a so - called remote - storage DVR , which enables viewers to record and store shows on the operator ’s computers rather than on a set - top box in subscribers ’ homes .
By rejecting the case , the court left the previous decision intact and cleared the way for Cablevision , a New York - based cable operator with 3.1 million subscribers , to launch the service by late summer .
The decision is likely to lead to an increase in the number of viewers who fast - forward through commercials , undermining the ad - based business model on which networks rely .

“ The content owners are probably very agitated right now , ” said Derek Baine , senior entertainment analyst with research firm SNL Kagan Associates .
“ It ’s one more knife in the back . ”
As soon as Cablevision announced plans in March 2006 to introduce the service , it was challenged in court by a consortium of networks and Hollywood studios that argued that remote - storage digital video recorders constituted new on - demand programming for which the cable operator should pay a license fee .
A federal judge in New York briefly blocked Cablevision from moving ahead , but last year the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling .
Though Cablevision ’s largest competitors , Comcast and Time Warner Cable , are not planning to start offering remote - storage DVRs immediately , the high court ’s decision hastens the ongoing decline of live TV viewing for entertainment programs .
More than a third of consumers have DVRs in their homes , according to Leichtman Research Group .

That will probably add to the headaches of networks reeling from the declining ad market , especially if Cablevision ’s bigger competitors follow suit .
A spokesperson for Time Warner Cable , the nation ’s second - biggest cable operator , said the company would consider offering remote - storage DVR service once it was certain there would be no further legal challenges .
Almost all of Cablevision ’s subscribers -- 2.9 million -- would have access to the virtual DVR without needing new equipment .
Although it has n’t announced specific plans , Cablevision could offer the service at a lower price or with features not available with current DVRs , such as unlimited storage or the ability to record numerous channels at once .
The proliferation of DVRs enables consumers to watch shows whenever they want , not on networks ’ timetable .
Although network schedules would have diminishing importance as a result , some industry experts say prime - time slots would continue to hold value in an on - demand world .

“ Without a linear lineup , people would not know how to find the best content to watch on demand , ” said Dan Brenner , a partner at law firm Hogan & Hartson and a former head of regulatory and legal affairs for the National Cable and Telecommunications Assn .
Prime time “ would remain a way to create marquee content . ”
In the wake of the ruling , content companies could choose to work with cable operators to try new forms of advertising within recorded programs .
Cablevision Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge said in a statement that his company wanted to work with programmers to “ deliver real benefits to advertisers . ”
Tim Hanlon , executive vice president of Viva Ki Venture , the digital investment arm of ad giant Publicis Groupe , said marketers could use DVRs to deliver targeted spots that consumers might choose to view .
“ From an advertiser ’s perspective , opt - in environments are a much more palatable targeted advertising environment than anything that ’s not , ” Hanlon said .

It was n’t immediately clear , however , whether big media companies would use Monday ’s decision as a prompt to adapt to the technology or take a new stab at combating it in court .
“ We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the legal rights of our members with regard to their content , and look forward to the continued development of the law in this area in future cases , ” said Daniel Mandil , chief of legal affairs for the Motion Picture Assn. of America .
Brenner noted that the studios had several paths to pursue , in or out of court .
“ This could get resolved at the negotiating table now that the parties have a clearer sense of where they stand , or they could take on the outstanding legal question of secondary liability , ” said Brenner , referring to a theory used successfully against file - sharing networks in which a company is held liable for enabling customers to engage in piracy even if it does n’t violate copyrights itself .

“ They could also try to get Congress to address this , ” he added .
“ Content owners have been pretty successful when they go to Congress . ”

June 30 , 2009 — Alderson Warm - Fork
‘ Tyranny of the majority ’ is an interesting phrase .
I ’m going to throw out my thoughts on it , without saying anything particularly profound or complex .
In particular , I ’m going to talk about the role this concept sometimes plays in anti-democratic ideologies or in suspicions of democracy – where ‘ democracy ’ is defined as the ideal of collective self - rule that representative political systems such as are now fashionable claim to offer but do n’t .
So I think there are two sorts of things that people often have in mind when they speak of majoritarian tyranny , two sorts of ‘ victims ’ .
One sort is the ‘ deviant ’ , those who are , for whatever reason , in violation of society ’s norms , such as nudists , schizophrenics , asylum - seekers , transsexuals , baha ’is , etc .
The other sort is the rich person who falls foul of ‘ the mob ’ , and has their ‘ freedom ’ taken away when the baying crowd strip them of their property .
Now I think the first of these is a valid fear , while the second is not – but that the first , valid , fear , does n’t require democracy and indeed thrives on its opposite .
The second fear is of what has been called , first by its opponents and then later also by its defenders , ‘ the dictatorship of the proletariat ’ – or rather , the dictatorship of the proletariat is the full expression of this tendency , which is that when political power is distributed differently from economic power ( say , equally for one , unequally for the other ) , an instability results in which either the economically powerful reduce the political power of the masses ( e.g. by persuading them to alienate it to a group of representatives from wealthy backgrounds who can be lobbied and hobnobbed with ) , or the masses strip the economically powerful of their power – a process which seems ‘ tyrannical ’ because it means using political power ( of whatever sort ) to interfere sharply with the supposedly ‘ non- political ’ realm of ‘ individual freedom ’ .
In such a case , the label ‘ majority tyranny ’ is a fairly simple piece of propaganda , the truthfulness of which could be preserved by simply saying ‘ the majority ceasing to be weak and to play nice ’ .
And one ’s attitude to this is very much a political one – since I value democracy more than I value capitalism , I heartily endorse this sort of ‘ majority tyranny ’ .
The other fear , the valid one , is that genuine individual freedoms will be taken away with majority support .
I focus on the threat to ‘ deviants ’ because that ’s the main form I think this would take – I do n’t actually think that , for example , a direct democracy would impose strict limits on ‘ normal people ’ , because it would be precisely ‘ normal people ’ making the decision , and so without the comfort and security of a superior position , they ’d be very reluctant to strike such a blow at ‘ themselves ’ .
Now as I said , this kind of ‘ majority tyranny ’ is a perfectly real risk , and anyone of a libertarian persuasion ( left - or right - ) should be concerned about it as well as about the state more narrowly .
However , this concern is no argument against democracy relative to any other decision - making system .
The persecution of minority races , or sexualities , or neurotypes , or religions , etc. – this has never been any less common in monarchies , military regimes , oligarchies , etc. than in democracies , representative or direct .
Indeed , it has often been more common under them , because whipping up public hatred against a scapegoat is a useful tool for rulers to divert the resentment or rebelliousness that their own rule produces .
So while this is a problem that may remain after power is democratised , it is also a problem that is present just as strongly and usually more strongly in less democratic systems .
So it ’s no argument against democracy – simply in favour of liberty .
The move by which anti-democratic writers whose real concern is with ‘ the dictatorship of the proletariat ’ employ this legitimate fear of conformity and persecution in their opposition to democracy is to equivocate over ‘ individual ’ , blurring between the individual who is against society because they have appropriated a large chunk of society ’s wealth , and the individual who is against society because society has appropriated their right to self - definition .
But the two groups are quite different .
First there was the USB Humping dog that made it from overseas to our local Spencer ’s shops .
It made us laugh and wonder , “ who would buy such a thing ? ”
And now we get this .
Out of all the humanly possible positions and all possible areas to place the USB port , why do this ?
If this was for intentional , luls , then congrats .
Cause you got luls out of me .
MORONI ( Reuters ) -
An airliner with 150 people on board belonging to Yemeni state carrier Yemenia crashed into choppy seas as it came in to land on the Indian Ocean archipelago of Comoros on Tuesday , officials said .
An airliner with 150 people on board belonging to Yemeni state carrier Yemenia crashed in the Indian Ocean archipelago of Comoros Tuesday , a senior government official said .

“ The plane has crashed and we still do n’t know exactly where .
We think it ’s in the area of Mitsamiouli .
There were 150 passengers on board , ” Comoros Vice - President Idi Nadhoim told Reuters from the airport at the main island ’s capital Moroni .
A Paris Airport spokeswoman said a Yemenia flight left Paris on Monday morning before landing in Yemen and then taking off for Moroni .
Ibrahim Kassim , a representative from regional air security body ASECNA , said the plane had probably come down 5 to 10 km ( 3 to 6 miles ) from the coast , and civilian and military boats had been mobilized to start searching .
“ We think the crash is somewhere along its landing approach , ” Kassim told Reuters .
“ The weather is really not very favorable .
The sea is very rough . ”
ASECNA -- the Agency for Aviation Security and Navigation in Africa and Madagascar -- covers Francophone Africa .
The town of Mitsamiouli is on the main island Grande Comore .
“ There is a crash , there is a crash in the sea , ” said an unnamed official who answered the phone in the Yemenia office in Moroni .
He declined further comment .
An airline official in Yemen declined to comment .
COMING TO LAND
Interior Minister Hamid Bourhane told Reuters the army had sent small speedboats to an area between the village of Ntsaoueni and the airport .
“ At the moment we do n’t have any information about whether there are any survivors , ” he told Reuters .
A medical worker in Mitsamiouli said he had been called in .
“ They have just called me to come to the hospital .
They said a plane had crashed , ” he told Reuters .
A United Nations official at the airport , who declined to be named , said the control tower had received notification the plane was coming into land , and then lost contact with it .
Yemenia , which is 51 percent owned by the Yemeni government and 49 percent owned by the Saudi Arabian government , flies to Moroni , according to flight schedules on its Web site .
Yemenia ’s fleet includes two Airbus 330-200s , four Airbus 310-300s and four Boeing 737-800s , according to the site .
The Comoros covers three small volcanic islands , Grande Comore , Anjouan and Moheli , in the Mozambique channel , 300 km ( 190 miles ) northwest of Madagascar and a similar distance east of the African mainland .
A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767 crashed into the sea off the Comoros islands in 1996 , killing 125 of 175 passengers and crew .
John Koller is the Director of Hardware Marketing for Sony , and he has brought three PSP
Go units to our meeting : two black , and one white .
Both colors will be available the first day of release , October 1 .
It 's hard to concentrate on the interview when the hardware is sitting on the table , but I hold off on picking one up until I get a few answers .
The good news is that Koller understands the concerns people have about the system , and the PSP Go may be much more consumer — and retail — friendly than many have assumed .
Of course , first you have to get past that price : $ 250 , coming on October 1 .
" We have a two - model strategy now , we 're still in the UMD business long - term , we 're still in the 3000 business long - term , that 's the lower - end SKU . "
Koller says .
The PSP
Go is marketed to the " digitally savvy " male tech adopter .
Koller compares the price to the 16GB iPod Touch , or the Zune .
" No one has really done this , in terms of large , full games digitally .
We 've seen the trend lines increase significantly and that 's why we 're doing this .
People are looking for ways to leave their discs behind . "
With direct access to the video store and 16GB of internal memory , the PSP
Go is seemingly being positioned as a digital , online entertainment device , not simply a games machine .
The problem is that many Sony fans already have stacks of UMDs , and the PSP
Go has no way to play the games ; the system is purely digital .
So what does one do with all their physical media ?
" It does n't make sense to leave [ PSP owners ] behind .
We 're going to have a program put into place that will allow that person to become part of the digital lifestyle .
We 'll have details closer to launch . "
In other words , Sony does n't want your UMD collection to keep you from upgrading to the PSP Go , but it 's not ready to announce its plans .
It 's possible you 'll be able to mail in your games for download vouchers , or send in UPC codes , or Sony will come up with some other way for you to play your games on the Go while keeping you honest .
Koller promises that before launch gamers will know exactly what to do with their older titles .
Retail is on board , and there will be plenty of content for the system
The problem is , with no physical games to sell for the PSP Go , why would retailers want to stock the system ?
" We still need retail , we need them for the 3000 , we need them for the UMDs , we need them for this model , " Koller says .
He claims that some retailers gave Sony a standing ovation when they heard the details of the PSP Go 's business model : retailers will be selling PlayStation Network cards , and they 'll be selling the hardware .
Also , here 's an interesting tidbit that Koller revealed : " We 've changed the model from a margin perspective from the 3000 , so there are changes throughout , " he explained .
" We 've made it very worth their while to carry the PSP Go . "
In most cases with hardware , retail stores make a tiny profit , if not a tiny loss , on sales .
The profit comes from selling games , warranties , and accessories .
If Sony adjusted pricing so retailers make a profit on selling just the hardware , stores could warm up to the PSP Go very quickly .
Sell a point card — cheap to ship and wo n't take up much wall space — for game downloads with the system , and the business model looks even more attractive .
And of course customers will want a new case and memory stick for their hardware ... you begin to see that the PSP
Go may be very retail - friendly .
As for games , you 'll be taken care of .
" We 're going to have about 300 - 350 of the legacy and catalog games that we 're going to be bringing to digital , we 're going to do that prior to or at launch ... there 's going to be a lot of content . "
There will also be 30 to 50 classic
PSone games coming to the store in the near future .
With all future PSP releases hitting both UMDs and digital downloads , and so many catalog titles being released , it does n't seem like content will be an issue .
Piracy , and the ability to share your games
The one thing you lose with a purely digital product is the ability to share your games ; the title is typically locked down to the system it was downloaded onto , but if you have multiple systems , that can be a pain in the butt .
" We need to work out the usage rights , that 's a development that we 'll have to talk to as we get closer to launch .
We have a plan in place , we just have n't made that public . "
He seems to understand the importance of being able to share content in the home with multiple consoles .
" It 's a good point , if you have a UMD you can pass it around .
We need to come out publicly with the plan on that as we get closer .
We 'll have a lot of announcements as we get closer to launch . "
The PSP is a system that has been plagued with piracy issues , but Sony is starting to get a grasp on the problem .
" We 've had a lot of success with the 3000 , " Koller says when I bring up the issue .
While the earlier models of the PSP were incredibly easy to use with ripped or downloaded games , the PSP Go is going to make things tougher on the pirates .
" You wo n't be able to rip your games and play them on the system , the firmware precludes that , " Koller explained .
" There 's no external battery , so there 's a number of protections put into place on the system . "
So how is the hardware ?
When an executive hands you a piece of hardware , it 's usually a good idea to see what 's on the memory stick .
I found a demo of LittleBigPlanet on Koller 's PSP Go , and happily began playing .
The PSP
Go is a striking piece of hardware : both thin and light , but it feels neither cheap nor fragile .
The screen is noticeably smaller than the original PSP , but the picture is razor sharp and bright .
I 'm impressed by the sound coming out of the speakers as well — it 's very loud and clear .
The hardware features a built - in microphone so Skype will continue to work , and the built - in Bluetooth capabilities also means that you 'll be able to use a Bluetooth headset for making calls or chatting online ; that 's quite the nice touch for people who use a headset for their PS3 online play .
The buttons likewise feel good , and the analog nub seems smaller than what we 're used to from the older hardware .
Is it too close to the face buttons ?
I played the game for about five minutes , and I got used to the placement very quickly .
Without having the time to put in a marathon session however , it 's hard to know if it will cause hand cramps .
The hardware looks and feels impressive in person .
This is a serious device .
We 'll be learning much more about the PSP
Go in the coming months before launch , but the interview showed that Sony knows what you 're worried about , and it 's working on making the digital aspects of the device as painless as possible for existing customers .
Or they 're blowing smoke .
We 'll have to wait until we know exactly what we 'll be doing with our old UMD - based games , and see how locked down the content is once downloaded .
The PSP Go is something of a gamble for Sony , now matter how confident a mien the company adopts .
The price is high .
Digital is still largely unproven as a primary delivery device for full - sized games on portables , not to mention consoles .
It 's certainly a bold move , and the hardware looks and feels attractive and high - quality in person .
It also launches alongside a new Gran Turismo title , a not insignificant way to get people 's attention .
Koller tells
Ars that having Gran Turismo ready for launch is important , and gamers can also expect some content to ship on the portable , most likely game demos or video .
One thing is for sure : the PSP is an exciting platform again .
The PSP Go releases on October 1 , for $ 250 .

More than 4,300 knives have been taken off the streets since May 2008 An MPs ' committee says a knife - crime " arms race " has developed with young people carrying knives because they fear others may do so too .
The Home Affairs Committee said knife carrying was driven by teenagers lacking faith in police and parents .
The MPs said knife crime plans should target complex root causes in deprived inner cities in England and Wales .
They also called on the government to ban violent video games from secure units and young offender institutions .
Fatal stabbings comprise a tiny minority of all knife offences and over the last decade they have accounted for roughly a third of all homicides .
But there was a significant rise in deaths in 2007 and 2008 - leading to more high profile media reporting of knife crime .
It is still unclear whether this jump was significant .
In their wide - ranging and detailed report , the Commons Home Affairs Committee said that the vast majority of those who were carrying a weapon were doing so for their own protection .
We need a new tack here , at least partly based on making young people feel safer and reducing the exposure to violence in their lives
Keith Vaz , committee chairman
Mapping UK 's teen murder toll
In some deprived areas knife carrying was almost becoming normal , said the report .
It said this " arms race " was partly worsened by sensationalist media coverage The MPs backed police tactics of increasing the number of stop - and - searches - but also called for a broader strategy to target root causes .
Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said : " Young people carry knives because they fear that others are carrying knives .
" This spiralling of knife possession puts all young people at risk .
Too many tragic deaths have occurred because of this .
We have to stop this arms race .
" We need a new tack here , at least partly based on making young people feel safer and reducing the exposure to violence in their lives .
" We were impressed by the work of the ' gang exit ' groups we spoke to , and by the success of Youth Inclusion Programmes . "
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said : " This report recognises the hard work taking place up and down the country .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It is also encouraging to see that the latest statistics show that the number of deaths from stabbings fell from 59 in the last quarter of 2007 to 52 in the last quarter of 2008 . "
Shadow home secretary Chris Grayling said : " The committee is absolutely right to say that we need to tackle the root social causes of knife crime .
" But we 've also got to be much tougher on those committing acts of anti-social behaviour to prevent them from going on to commit more serious offences , like knife crime , later in life . "
And Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " This report rightly suggests that knife crime is far too complicated a social problem to be solved with threats of prison alone .
" We need to move away from political posturing towards what we know works to combat knife crime .
" The best place to start is to ensure that every hospital shares data with their local police force to map knife crime hot - spots and police them intensively . "

In the words of Swiss journalist and author , Roger Du Pasquier “ The West , whether Christian or dechristianised , has never really known Islam .
Ever since they watched it appear on the world stage , Christians never ceased to insult and slander it in order to find justification for waging war on it .
It has been subjected to grotesque distortions the traces of which still endure in the European mind .
Even today there are many Westerners for whom Islam can be reduced to three ideas : fanaticism , fatalism and polygamy .
Of course , there does exist a more cultivated public whose ideas about Islam are less deformed ; there are still precious few who know that the word islam signifies nothing other than ‘ submission to God ’ .
One symptom of this ignorance is the fact that in the imagination of most Europeans , Allah refers to the divinity of the Muslims , not the God of the Christians and Jews ; they are all surprised to hear , when one takes the trouble to explain things to them , that ‘ Allah ’ means ‘ God ’ , and that even Arab Christians know him by no other name . “
10 Muslims are Arabs
Misconception : All Muslims are Arabs
The common image of a Muslim is a turbaned dark Arab man with a long beard .
However this image is part of the minority of Muslims .
Arabs make only 15 % of the world ’s Muslim population .
As a matter of fact the Middle East comes in third with East Asia coming in at first ( 69 % ) and Africa ( 27 % ) coming in at second .
Another common misconception is that all Arabs are Muslims .
While the vast majority of Arabs are Muslims ( 75 % ) , there are many other religions that Arabs practice including Christianity and Judaism .
9 Muslims and Jesus
Misconception : Muslims Hate Jesus
There are many similarities between the historical references of Christianity and Islam .
Many people are amazed to find out that according to Muslim belief , Jesus is one of the greatest messengers of God .
One can not be a Muslim without believing in the virgin birth and the many miracles of Jesus Christ .
Jesus is also mentioned in many verses of the Quran and is often used as an example of good virtue and character .
However , the main difference between Christianity and Islam is that Muslims do not believe that Jesus was God.
Pictured above is Jesus in an Islamic portrayal of the last judgement .
8 Children ’s Rights
Misconception : Children have no rights
Children , according to Islamic law , have various rights .
One of these is the right to be properly brought up , raised , and educated .
Islam encourages children to be brought up well because it is the responsibility of an adult to raise his child to become a moral and ethical adult .
Children must also be treated equally .
When giving financial gifts they should all be the same amount and there should be no preference among them .
Children are even permitted to take moderately from their parent ’s wealth to sustain themselves if the parent declines to give them proper funds for living .
A child is also not allowed to get hit in the face or hit by anything larger than a pencil .
7 Religious Intolerance
Misconception : Islam is intolerable to other religions
‘ Kill the infidel ’ is the phrase many people believe is the ideology that Muslims have towards the non Muslims .
This , though , is not a correct portrayal of Islamic law .
Islam has always given respect and freedom of religion to all faiths .
In the Quran it says “ God does not forbid you , with regards to those who fight you not for religion nor drive you away out of your homes , from dealing kindly and justly with them , for god loves those who are just . ”
There are many historical examples of Muslim tolerance towards other faith .
One such example was when the caliph Umar was ruler of Jerusalem from 634 to 644 AD .
He granted freedom to all religious communities and said that the inhabitants of his city were safe and that their places of worship would never be taken away from them .
He also set up courts that were designated to the non Muslim minorities .
Whenever he would visit holy areas he would ask for the Christian patriarch Sophronius ( pictured above ) to accompany him .
6 Islamic Jihad
Misconception : Jihad means to fight for the sake of god
The true Arabic meaning of the word jihad is struggle .
However in Islam it is often used to describe the striving in the way of god .
There are many forms of jihad but the most important ones are Jihad al - nafs ( jihad against ones self ) , jihad bil - lisan ( jihad by being vocal ) , jihad bil yad ( jihad by using action ) , and Jihad bis saif ( jihad by using the sword ) .
Each jihad is ranked differently and it was reported that Muhammad returned from a battle and said “ We have returned from the lesser jihad ( going into battle ) to the greater jihad ( the struggle of the soul ) . ”
This means that a Muslim struggling against himself and his soul is more important than the jihad of going into war .
Another misconception is that only when a person dies in war does that person becomes a martyr .
This is , however , false and it is believed that anyone doing anything for the sake of god and is killed becomes a martyr .
A person who dies while performing pilgrimage in Mecca , a woman who dies while giving birth , or even someone who dies in a car crash while he was on his way to the mosque are all considered martyrs .
5 Child Bride
Misconception : The Prophet Muhammad was a pedophile
While it is true that he married a girl that was at the age of nine that does not constitute pedophilia .
Historically , the age at which a girl was considered ready to be married has been puberty .
This was the case in Biblical times , and is still used today to determine the age of marriage in many parts of the world .
This was part of the norm and is not something that Islam invented .
The girl he got married to had reached puberty 3 years before marriage .
It is upon reaching the age of puberty that a person , man or woman , becomes legally responsible for their actions under Islamic law .
At this point , they are allowed to make their own decisions and are held accountable for their actions .
It should also be mentioned that in Islam , it is unlawful to force someone to marry someone that they do not want to marry .
There is no indication that the society at that time criticized this marriage due to the girl ’s young age .
On the contrary , the marriage was encouraged by the girl ’s family and was welcomed by the community at large .
4 Muslim Savages
Misconception : Muslims are savages and barbaric during war
Quite the contrary , when it comes to the conduct of war there are ten rules that every Muslim army must obey :
1 . Do not commit treachery
2 . Do not deviate from the right path
3 . Do not mutilate dead bodies
4 . Do not kill children
5 . Do not kill women
6 . Do not kill aged men
7 . Do not harm or burn trees
8 . Do not destroy buildings
9 . Do not destroy an enemy ’s flock , unless you use it for your food
10 .
When you pass people who have devoted their lives to monastic services leave them alone
During the crusades when Saladin defeated the franks he honored the defeated Frankish army and supplied them with food and during the third crusade when Saladin ’s enemy king Richard fell sick , Saladin sent him a gift of fruits and horses .
3 Women ’s Rights
Misconception : Women have no rights
The image of a woman wearing a veil from head to toe , a woman who gets unfair justice or a woman who is not allowed to drive is an all too familiar notion when it comes to women treatment in Islam .
And while there are Muslim countries in the world that do implement many harsh rulings against women , this should not be portrayed as Islamic law .
Many of these countries have cultural differences that go against the teachings of Islam .
It should be noted that during pre-Islam Arabia women were used for fornication only and had no independence .
The birth of a daughter in a family was considered humiliating and the practice of female infanticide was uncontrolled .
When Islam came to being , verses in the Quran condemned the practice of female infanticide .
Islam gave back many human rights to the woman and Muhammad(s ) was even reported saying that “ women are the twin halves of men . ”
A Muslim woman is allowed to reject and accept any suitor for marriage and has the right to seek divorce .
There is nothing in Islam that forbids a Muslim woman from exiting her house and is allowed to drive .
Also in regards to education , a woman is obligated to seek knowledge and it is considered a sin if she refuses .
2 By the Sword
Misconception : Islam was spread by the sword
Historian
De lacey O’Leary states “ History makes it clear however , that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated . ”
There is no record in history that shows people being forced by sword point to convert to Islam .
When Islam spread through countries they would set up private churches and synagogues for the non Muslims they were governing and because of the good treatment they had received they themselves would convert .
If one considers the small number of Muslims who initially spread Islam to the west all the way from Spain and Morocco and into east from India and China one would realize that such a small group of people could not force others to be members of a religion against their will .
It is also interesting to note that when the Mongols invaded and conquered large portions of the Islamic empire , instead of destroying the religion they adopted it !
1 Islamic Terrorism
Misconception : Muslims are terrorists
This is by far the biggest misconception of Islam , given unfairly by stereotyping and the public image that the media gives .
Has anyone else noticed how when a specific group of people attack another group of people it is labeled as a ‘ hate crime ’ , but when a Muslim opens fire on anybody it is quickly regarded as ‘ terrorism ’ .
Many political dictators and officials or extremist groups use the name of Islam as a strategy to garner followers and attention when many of their practices go against the true basis of Islam .
The media has also portrayed Islam as a cult or a club where if you join you become a terrorist and that is now part of your agenda .
However all over the world people practice Islam in the true form and use it as a way of life .
There are many verses in the Quran that go against the idea of terrorism .
Some of these verses include “ fight in the way of Allah those that fight you but do not transgress limits for god does not love transgressors . ”
This basically means do not fight except in self defense and even in doing so do not go beyond defense .
Another verse states “ if they seek peace , then you seek peace , ” which means do not attack people for no reason or kill innocent people .
There is nowhere in Islam , whether it be in the Quran or the teachings of Muhammad , that promotes the killing of innocent people .
Pictured above is a conference of Muslims against Terrorism .
Selig upset with steroid leaks
According to Phil Rogers of the Chicago Tribune , baseball commissioner Bud Selig is upset that names from the 2003 list of players who tested positive for banned substances are being leaked to the media .
Apparently Selig and others around Major League Baseball believe that a lawyer with the U.S. Attorney ’s office ( either past or present ) ignored a court seal in order to give Sammy Sosa ’s name to Michael S. Schmidt of the New York Daily News , who reported yesterday that the slugger was on the ’03 list .
I do n’t blame Selig for being peeved that someone is leaking names that were supposed to be kept anonymous .
After all , the only reason the player ’s union agreed to the ’03 drug testing was because the players who tested positive would n’t be punished and because their names would never be released .
That said – give … me … a … break .
If Selig wants to be upset with anything , how about he get upset with himself , the owners and the player ’s union that allowed us to get to this point .
He turned a blind eye to the steroid issue and now he wants to play victim .
I guess he has to put on this little front about being mad about the leaks in efforts to settle down the player ’s union , but he has nobody to blame but himself for this mess .
What Selig should do is go back on his word to the player ’s union and release the rest of the 104 names on that 2003 list before the media does .
A - Rod and Sosa ’s names have already been released – how much longer until more names are announced ?
If Selig thinks that the media is going to stop digging , he has another thing coming .
He may anger the players and the union by releasing the names , but it ’s well past time for people to start taking responsibility for what has happened to the game of baseball .
TORONTO ( Hollywood Reporter ) - A day after announcing plans to cut as many as 800 jobs , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said Thursday it will cancel “ The Simpsons ” and “ The Martha Stewart Show ” in a cost - cutting maneuver .
The public broadcaster also said it will lower license fees and order fewer episodes of such popular Canadian TV series as “ The Border , ” “ Being Erica , ” and “ Little Mosque on the Prairie ” to deal with a growing advertising downturn .
Other savings will come from the cancellation of daytime lifestyle series , a cut in expenditures on daytime kids ’ programing and the end of some sports programing , including Toronto Blue Jays games .
The CBC also will cut 80 jobs at its CBC News division .
On the radio side , the national broadcaster will cancel some popular radio shows as well as reduce regional radio noontime shows to one hour and live music recordings by half .
The Republican Party 's Lost Six Months GOP still searching for identity after half year in political wilderness .
WASHINGTON , July 9 , 2009 -- First they lost control of Congress .
Then went the White House .
And then things got really bad for the Republican Party .
The first six months of 2009 have been a grand old wipeout for the Grand Old Party .
The party has no real power in Washington , and few obvious national spokespeople .
An array of potential presidential candidates have created their own political messes in recent weeks .
Democrats this week took hold of their 60th Senate seat -- removing , at least in theory , the last procedural check Republicans had to guard against Democratic dominance .
All this while fewer Americans consider themselves Republicans than at any time in a generation -- and while President Obama continues to enjoy sky - high popularity ratings .
Only 22 percent of respondents considered themselves Republicans in last month 's ABC News / Washington Post poll ; the figure had n't been that low since 1982 .
Worse than the numbers , party insiders say , is the sense that positive flickers have been extinguished by a series of tabloid - ready storylines .
Work that 's going on behind the scenes has been eclipsed by scandals that have virtually nothing to do with the task of building up a party from the ashes .
" It 's Lucy pulling the football away from Charlie Brown , " said Ron Bonjean , a veteran Republican strategist and former Capitol Hill leadership aide .
The difficulties of the last few months reflect a larger problem for the Republican Party : Even after two straight losing elections , the party remains deeply divided about how to proceed in an era of Democratic dominance .
Gov. Sarah Palin 's bombshell announcement that she 's resigning from office left many Republicans mystified -- by Palin 's motives , and also by the fact that the party can't seem to drag itself from the woes of its recent past .
Palin 's announcement came on the heels of admissions of extramarital affairs of two rising party stars , Gov. Mark Sanford , R - S.C. , and Sen. John Ensign , R - Nev .
Those storylines have contributed to a sense of drift inside the GOP .
" Any time that your message appears to be Sanford - or Palin - like , it diminishes what you 're trying to accomplish , " said Tony Fabrizio , a veteran Republican pollster .
" It 's been sometimes chaotic , bumpy , but after two elections where we basically got our heads handed to us , not surprising . "
The disarray has some Republicans calling for a more extensive housecleaning .
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif. , raised eyebrows this week when he told a group of conservative bloggers that it is time for the party to " throw everything we did wrong under the bus " -- even if that means a full accounting of missteps under Republican control of the White House and Congress .
" You do n't get redemption without confession , " Issa said .
Issa , the ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , told ABCNews.com that many of his Republican colleagues still wo n't accept responsibility for runaway spending and expansions of government programs -- key reasons , Issa said , that Republicans have lost standing with the public .
" It 's important that we own up to some of the areas where we did n't do a good job , " he said .
Among the ironies of the Ensign - Sanford - Palin stories is that they have obscured what some party leaders see as positive signs inside the GOP .
The party held together to win an early national - security skirmish , forcing Obama to change course on his plans for prisoners in Guantanamo Bay .
Republicans stayed unified during the debate over a stimulus package that 's growing less popular with the public , and GOP leaders are gearing up for a defining fight over health care reform .
A younger generation of Capitol Hill leaders has begun to emerge .
Task forces are producing GOP policy alternatives .
Republicans have also had a series of recruiting successes in 2010 races , nabbing top - tier Senate challengers just this week in New Hampshire and Illinois , for example .
" There 's two different worlds going on , " Bonjean said .
National figures such as Palin , Rush Limbaugh and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich are " causing all kinds of news that is n't necessarily good for Republicans .
On the other side you have Republican members of Congress who are working on cohesive messaging , " he said .
One recurring problem for Republicans , however , is how to frame that messaging .
Some in the party have responded to calls for Republicans to put forward ideas with white papers and new legislation ; others have greeted such efforts with eye - rolls , since they are extremely unlikely to have an impact on policies .
" I'm one of those who believe that saying ' no ' is enough , " said GOP strategist Carl Forti .
" And that Republicans should be the ' party of no ' and oppose everything that President Barack Obama is doing .
And that 's enough . "
In the ongoing search for bright spots , emerging debates over health care and energy may give the GOP a chance to find new footing .
" I think people are beginning to pay more attention to us , " Sen. Lamar Alexander , R - Tenn. , a former two - time Republican presidential candidate , said on ABCNews.com 's " Top Line " Wednesday .
" The Republican Party is down .
We 've been sent to the woodshed , " he said .
" We 're rethinking our positions .
We 're not changing our policies , but we 're trying to apply our principles to the situation that exists today .
And when you look at our plan for nuclear power , for housing , our various health care plans , our attitude on national defense , I think people in this country are growing much more comfortable with a check and balance .
...
And that means more Republicans elected next year . "
There is an even brighter spot :
The knowledge that the 2010 elections are still more than a year away .
" You 're going to have the best voices of the Republican Party emerge , " Bonjean said .
" But we 're in for a roller - coaster ride . "
" We 're going to peak in November of 2010 , " Issa said .
A incredibly insightful woman once said , “ Encourage your community to take time to step back and enjoy their work . ”
And since I just read her saying that today , I thought I would stop for a second to emphasize just how lucky we are to have the community we do .
We ’ve got events going every night and practically every weekend .
We ’ve got good chatter online and off .
And we ’re creating and building a lot of cool stuff — sometimes purely through volunteer efforts .
Two of those amazing volunteer projects are Calagator and Open Source Bridge .
And two of the awesome people behind those efforts are Selena Deckelmann and Audrey Eschright .
Why highlight Selena and Audrey today ?
Well , a couple of reasons .
First off , they both just got published in the Open Source Business Resource .
Selena ’s article , entitled “ Offline : Where Tech Communities Succeed With Women ” focuses on the importance of events and conferences for drawing women into the tech scene .
Conferences are one way that women can be drawn into the free / libre and open source software ( F / LOSS ) ecosystem .
Many different approaches are needed to increase women ’s participation in F / LOSS , but face - to - face interaction has proven to be a critical part of the way the technology community in Portland , Oregon has thrived .
This article describes the successes of this community , and suggests how other communities could benefit from Portland ’s experience .
Audrey covered Calagator in her article entitled “ Community - Built Software : What I Learned from Calagator . ”
In it , she offers a series of guidelines for getting the most out of your volunteer - run projects .
Building anything from scratch is an act to be proud of , and doubly so if it turns into a community effort .
Encourage your community to take time to step back and enjoy their work .
Community - built software requires equal parts technical and social contribution .
The reward is not just a piece of useful software , but the social connections made , and the benefit to the community the software serves .
Technology is created for people , to solve real human needs , and community - built software provides an opportunity to put that idea to work .
Tangentially , we ’re mere weeks away from the launch of Open Source Bridge , the entirely volunteer run conference Audrey and Selena have been working to bring together .
So as luck would have it , they both also just appeared on Portland ’s leading tech podcast Strange Love Live .
[ HTML1 ]
Again , there are tons of amazing people in the Portland tech community — and tons of amazing people in whichever subsegments of that community in which you choose to participate .
Take some time to recognize their efforts and be thankful for what you ’ve got .
I know I ’m thankful we ’ve got Selena and Audrey doing what they do .
And Portland is all the better because of it .

Much of the art stolen by Nazis has already been returned to its owners
Jewish groups and representatives of 49 countries are gathering in Prague for talks on returning art and possessions stolen by the Nazis .
The five - day conference in the Czech capital will also aim to increase Holocaust awareness and education .
The Nazis stole an estimated 650,000 religious items and works of art from European Jews during World War II .
While much of the art been returned , a great deal remains in museums and private collections .
The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says there has often been considerable reluctance on the part of those in possession of the looted art to return it .
Steps have been taken in countries such as Austria to make it easier for owners to claim back looted art .
But the US Special Envoy for Holocaust Issues , Christian Kennedy , attending the conference , said many central and eastern European countries had not yet found a way to implement a restitution process .
He said any such process would have to be consistent with national law while also ensuring non-citizens seeking to reclaim property were given equal treatment .
Delegates from the 49 states will be asked what progress they have made in returning looted Jewish property since the 1998 conference in Washington .
That meeting introduced ground - breaking principles for dealing with such items .
The Prague conference , the last major event of the Czech Republic 's European Union presidency , is aimed at reinvigorating that process , says our correspondent .
An ancient ecosystem that has thrived in isolation for millions of years has been discovered in a pool of dark , salty water beneath half a kilometre of ice in Antarctica .
Microorganisms in the pool evolved to live without light or oxygen after being covered by the Taylor glacier on the East Antarctic ice sheet up to two million years ago .
Scientists estimate the pool 's temperature to be around - 10 C , but the water does not freeze because it contains so much salt – around four times as much as seawater .
The discovery of simple organisms in the unmapped reservoir provides further evidence of the extreme conditions that life might be able to endure on other planets .
" This briny pond is a unique time capsule from a period in Earth 's history , " said Jill Mikucki , who led the research at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , US .
" I do n't know of any other environment quite like this on Earth . "
Scientists made the discovery while analysing water samples from Blood Falls , a curious blood - red stain on the face of the Taylor glacier .
Explorers in the early 20th century thought the stain was caused by red algae , but subsequent investigations have revealed that the colour comes from rust in the water .
While the glacier is made of frozen fresh water , water samples from Blood Falls are exceptionally salty and rich in iron and sulphur , but contain no oxygen .
Water from the subterranean pool , which is thought to be around 5 km wide , seems to be drawn up into the glacier before seeping from a tiny outlet in its face four kilometres away .
Because water flows only erratically out of the glacier , it took the researchers years to get enough samples to analyse .
In the water eventually collected by the team , Mikucki found 17 different types of marine microbe , including a bacterium called Thiomicrospira arctica , though she suspects around 30 types might live in the pool .
The study is reported in the journal Science .
" When I started running the chemical analysis on it , there was no oxygen .
That was when this got really interesting .
it was a real eureka moment , " said Mikucki .
The scientists believe the pool 's microbes eke out a living by " breathing " iron leached from the bedrock beneath the glacier , using sulphur as a catalyst .
With no sunlight to power photosynthesis , the microbes are thought to feed on organic matter that was trapped in the pool with them .
Despite their lengthy spell in isolation , Mikucki was able to culture the bacteria and extract DNA from them .
Tests showed they were remarkably similar to modern marine microbes , suggesting the population living beneath the glacier was once part of a larger population living millions of years ago in the surrounding area or in an open fjord .
Studying the microbes might help to explain how life survived a period of our planet 's history known as " Snowball Earth " , when ice sheets encroaching from both poles met at the equator , encasing the world in ice .
" It 's a bit like finding a forest that nobody has seen for 1.5 million years , " said Ann Pearson , a co-author of the report at Harvard Univeristy in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
" Intriguingly , the species living there are similar to contemporary organisms , and yet quite different – a result , no doubt , of having lived in such an inhospitable environment for so long . "
While Americans are reinventing endurance racing in a dadaist manner , Europeans are still doing their thing at Le Mans , 86 years after the first race .
And it was Audi vs. Peugeot yet again .
Warning : spoilers .
Audi has won every race at La Sarthe since 1999 , the sole exception being the 2003 event — which was n’t really an exception at all , as the winning Bentley Speed 8 was nothing but Audi ’s all - conquering R8 with a roof and a can of British Racing Green paint .

After retiring the R8 , Audi returned in 2006 with the R10 , the first modern diesel - engined endurance racecar , powered by a V12 TDI engine , which duly took victory at its first outing at Le Mans .
In 2007 , Peugeot stepped up to the plate with a similar design , the 908 HDi FAP , which came in second on its inaugural race , retained this position for 2008 , then roared back for a 1 – 2 finish this Sunday against Audi ’s all - new R15 .
This marks Peugeot ’s third win at their home race , after the Peugeot 905 ’s back - to - back wins in 1992 and 1993 .

Signs You May Be a Fundamental Atheist ...
1 . You became an atheist when you were 10 years old , based on ideas of God that you learned in Sunday School .
Your ideas about God have n't changed since .
2 . You think that the primary aim of an omni-benevolent God is for people to have FUN .
3 . Although you 've memorized a half a dozen proofs that He does n't exist , you still think you 're God 's gift to the ignorant masses .
4 . You believe the astronomical size of the universe somehow disproves God , as if God needed a tiny universe in order to exist .
5 . You spend hours arguing that atheism actually means " without a belief in God " and not just " belief that there is no god " , as if this is a meaningful distinction in real life .
6 . You can make the existence of pink unicorns the center - piece of a philosophical critique .
7 . You 're a spoiled fifteen year old boy who lives in the suburbs and you go into a chat room to declare that , " I know there is no God because no loving God would allow anyone to suffer as much as I ... hold on .
My cell phone 's ringing . "
8 . You believe that if something cannot be touched , seen , heard , or measured in some way , then it must not exist , yet you fail to see the irony of your calling Christians " narrow - minded " .
9 . You believe that priests are only in it for the money , despite the fact that they make less than almost anyone else with their level of education .
10 .
Your only knowledge of The Bible comes from searching ' bible contradictions ' in Google .
11 . You believe the movie Dogma gives the most accurate portrayal of Christian theology .
12 . You refuse to eat at Church 's Chicken , and it's NOT because the chicken 's too greasy .

The uncle of a five - year - old girl who lost her limbs to meningitis has been quizzed on suspicion of stealing up to £ 200,000 from her trust fund .
Banker Darren Pease , 33 , has been arrested and bailed by police while investigations continue .
Ellie May Challis 's trust fund was set up after the Daily Mirror told of her brave fight against meningitis , and appealed for donations .
Darren Pease had the total trust of the family and was one of just two people with authority to take cash from the fund .
Scotland Yard said : " A 33 - yearold man was arrested by Romford CID on allegations of theft . "
A source close to the family from Romford , Essex , added : " Ellie May 's parents Paul and Lisa are distraught .
It seems the fund has been pretty much cleaned out .
" To make matters even worse the accused is someone they completely trusted and someone Ellie May adores . "
Ellie May had her arms amputated below the elbows and her legs above the knees in 2005 after a near - fatal meningitis attack .
Her unsuitable NHS legs were swapped for private ones after £ 20,000 was raised from donations .
Then , in a hammer blow , Havering Primary Care Trust announced it was withdrawing Ellie May 's weekly physiotherapy , claiming she was a private patient and no longer eligible for free NHS treatment .
The Mirror took on the case and Havering U - turned , agreeing she could have NHS treatment .
Ellie May quickly asserted her independence , dressing herself , climbing the stairs and even brushing her teeth herself .
The brave way she has risen to the challenge of life has touched many hearts and money has rolled into her fund .
Antonio Salieri believes that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's music is divine and miraculous .
He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing .
He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God 's rewards for his piety .
He 's also content as the respected , financially well - off , court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II .
But he 's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature , and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument .
Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart .
He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical mediocrity .

Last year , Pentagon mad science arm Darpa was working on one of its wildest projects yet : a microchip - sized nuclear reactor .
The program is now officially done , the agency says .
But these sorts of far - out projects have a habit of being reemerging under new managers and new names .
The project , known as the “ Chip - Scale High Energy Atomic Beams ” program , is an effort aimed at working on the core technologies behind a tiny particle accelerator , capable of firing subatomic particles at incredible speeds .
It ’s part of a larger Darpa plan to reduce all sorts of devices to microchip - scale — including cryogenic coolers , video cameras and multi-purpose sensors .
All of the projects are ambitious ( this is Darpa , after all ) .
But this had to be the most ambitious of the lot .
Here ’s how Darpa ’s plans for fiscal year 2009 described it :
“ Chip - scale integration offers precise , micro actuators and high electric field generation at modest power levels that will enable several order of magnitude decreases in the volume needed to accelerate the ions .
Furthermore , thermal isolation techniques will enable high efficiency beam to power converters , perhaps making chipscale self - sustained fusion possible . ”
Achieving controlled nuclear fusion – the reaction that powers the sun – has been a dream for more than sixty years .
Currently hopes are focused on the $ 13 billion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) .
This is a giant “ Tokamak ” device , containing high - temperature plasmas inside donut - shaped magnetic fields .
Construction started last year at Caradache in France ; the plan is for ITER to produce its first plasma in 2018 , and generate significant amounts of power ( the target is five hundred megawatts ) by 2026 .
In contrast , the Chip - Scale High Energy Atomic Beams project had a budget of just $ 3 million , and rather shorter timescales ; the plans for fiscal year 2009 include : “ Develop 0.5 MeV [ mega electron - volt ] proton beams and collide onto microscale B - 11 target with a fusion Q ( energy ratio ) > 20 , possibly leading to self - sustained fusion . ”
The energy ratio is the amount of power you get out compared to how much you put in .
ITER has a design Q of 10 , producing its output with a fifty megawatt input .
The Darpa scheme would be twice as efficient .
And much smaller .
The electromagnet for ITER alone weighs 925 tons , so it ’s not likely to be made small enough for a vehicle or any other mobile application , Darpa , on the other hand , cheerily indicates that its project will go on to produce “ handheld power sources . ”
No further information is available .
A few months ago , a Darpa media contact told Danger Room : “ At the point we ’re way too early in programmatics to have anything to talk about ” — and promised to get in touch as soon as there was anything to discuss .
Later , the budget for fiscal year 2010 came out ; Chip - Scale High Energy Atomic Beams are gone .
Where did the project go ?
No one at the agency seems to know .
“ I ’m afraid that if the program ’s not in the budget request then we ’re not pursuing it anymore and are therefore not tracking that activity any longer — we also do n’t keep any information on things we ’re doing , ” Darpa rep .
Darpa cancels research programs all the time for failing to meet strict performance goals .
The agency is also sensitive to the perception that its veering from the world of hard - to - reach science … and into the realm of science fiction .
Take that Danger Room favorite , nuclear isomer triggering .
It ’s a process so controversial that it has been labeled pseudoscience .
Darpa dropped their funding of research in this area after it was revealed by New Scientist magazine in 2003 .
But the military research into isomers still continues .
Both the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the U.S. Army continue to fund isomer studies .
So perhaps the military has dropped its handheld nuclear reactor completely .
Or maybe we ’ll find out soon that the studies continue quietly elsewhere , in another corner of the vast military research complex .

Circumcising men who are infected with HIV does not protect their female partners from the deadly virus , researchers have found .
The Uganda - based study was stopped early due to " futility , " the researchers wrote in a study published in The Lancet , when it became clear that the women were not benefiting .
The outcome was disappointing because circumcision has been shown to drastically reduce infection rates in men .
But the researchers said that wide - scale
circumcision is so effective in protecting men that [ it ] will still likely benefit women indirectly by reducing circulation of the virus in general [ Reuters ] .
In 2007 , the World Health Organization concluded that circumcising males reduced female - to - male transmission of the HIV virus by about 60 percent .
The foreskin of the penis , which is removed during circumcision , is rich in cells that are particularly easy for the virus to infect .
The theory is that removing this source of vulnerable cells makes infection more difficult [ Reuters ] .
While the new research showed that the circumcised men in the study did not protect their female partners from contracting the virus , experts
say HIV - positive men should still be offered circumcision , but also warned to use condoms .
The US researchers ... say not offering the procedure to men with HIV would stigmatise them .
Other experts say it could become a " sign " of whether a man was HIV positive or not [ BBC News ] .
Circumcision has become an important tactic in the fight against HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa , because the quick procedure can have such drastic benefits for men .
Some other African nations are championing the procedure and bringing it to thousands .
But in South Africa , the powerhouse country at the heart of the epidemic , the government has been notably silent , despite the withering international criticism the country has endured for its previous foot - dragging in fighting and treating AIDS [ The New York Times ] .
The South African government does n't offer circumcision at its public hospitals , as the neighboring Botswana does , nor does it educate the public about the benefits of the procedure .

Driving while texting , “ amusingly dubbed DWT , ” is more dangerous than driving drunk , said Lance Whitney in CNET News .
Or at least that ’s the upshot of a road test by Car and Driver editors ( watch road tests ) .
Two test drivers took a Honda Pilot for a spin while reading a text message , writing one , and while legally drunk — and the results are sobering .
Here 's one particularly “ sobering nugget ” from the report , said Joseph Rose in The Oregonian .
Texting drivers are four times slower to hit the brakes than those impaired by alcohol , yet “ 20 percent of drivers regularly send texts or e-mails on the road . ”
Perhaps states should n’t be “ playing babysitter , ” but the Car and Driver study should make Oregonians feel better about becoming the 15th state to ban DWT .
The results are bad for the older driver , 37 - year - old editor in chief Eddie Alterman , said David Thomas in Cars.com , but the younger driver — 22 - year - old intern Jordan Brown — had much better braking times , and “ barely a variance ” between the three tests .
That said , “ even a slight delay in reaction time ” could cause an accident , so keep the phone closed behind the wheel .

If this were the democracy that the Founding Fathers thought they were creating , word from CIA Director Leon Panetta that his agency had lied to Congress and specifically that it had lied repeatedly from 9-11-2001 through the end of 2008 concerning an as - yet undisclosed secret program , would have virtually every member of Congress in a state of rebellion , demanding answers .
After all , the CIA is required by law to report to at least the majority and minority leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and to the majority and minority leaders of both houses of Congress about such things .
But not only did the spy agency not report on what it was up to ; it lied about what it was up to .
Now , given what we do know about the Bush / Cheney administration - that it initiated a massive campaign of spying on Americans by the Defense Department , the FBI , and the National Security Agency , as well as other intelligence agencies , that it initiated a campaign of torture of captives , including American citizens , while asserting that the President did n't even need to notify the courts or the public about the arrest , detention , torture or even execution of an American citizen if he , acting on his own , deemed that person to be an " enemy combatant , " and given that we also know that Bush and Cheney lied repeatedly about the justification for their invasion of Iraq , and refused to be put under oath in their " interviews " by the 9 - 11 Commission , you would think the members of Congress , which was railroaded into supporting everything from the USA PATRIOT
Act to the Iraq War invasion based on all these lies and deceptions , would be demanding answers regarding this mysterious program .

China 's three biggest power firms produced more greenhouse gas emissions last year than the whole of Britain , according to a Greenpeace report published today / yesterday .
The group warned that inefficient plants and the country 's heavy reliance on coal are hindering efforts to tackle climate change .
While China 's emissions per capita remain far below those of developed countries , the country as a whole has surpassed the United States to become the world 's largest emitter .
Greenpeace said the top 10 companies , which provided almost 60 % of China 's total electricity last year , burned 20 % of China 's coal — 590 m tonnes — and emitted the equivalent of 1.44 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide .
The efficiency of Chinese power generation compares unfavourably with other countries .
In Japan , 418 grams of carbon dioxide are emitted per kilowatt hour and in the US , the equivalent figure is 625 grams .
But most of the top 10 firms in China produce 752 grams of CO2 .
" China is suffering the pains of extreme weather events such as droughts , heat waves , typhoons and floods , worsened by climate change .
These power companies can and must help China to prevent climate disaster by rapidly increasing efficiency and the share of renewable energy such as wind and solar , " said Yang Ailun , Greenpeace 's climate campaign manager , at the launch in Beijing of the Greenpeace report , Polluting Power : Ranking China 's Biggest Power Companies .
The report says that in 2008 , Huaneng , Datang and Guodian — the top three firms — emitted more greenhouse gases than the whole of the United Kingdom .
But Yang added : " China is ideally placed to …[ become ] the world 's superpower in terms of smart energy and renewable energy . "
The group said China closed down 54.07 gigawatt of the least efficient coal - fired plants over the last three and a half years — more than the total electricity installed capacity of Australia .
It urged power firms to phase out all inefficient coal - fired plants under 100 megawatt by 2012 , saving 90 m tonnes of coal consumption and 220 m tonnes of carbon dioxide annually .
Firms are already turning to renewable energy and by the end of last year Guodian had installed 2.88 gigawatt of wind power ; almost 24 % of China 's total and enough to make it the biggest wind energy firm in Asia .
But Greenpeace said only three of the top 10 produced 10 % or more of their energy from renewable sources .
The vast majority relied heavily on hydropower — with eight of the firms not even halfway to their legal obligation to produce 3 % of energy from other renewable sources by 2010 .
Greenpeace urged the Chinese government to impose energy and environment taxes on coal , encouraging increased efficiency and a move to renewable sources .
It also called for a doubling of the national renewable energy target to 30 % by 2020 and for stricter efficiency standards for coal - fired power stations .
The State Council , China 's cabinet , is currently drawing up plans for a massive " new energy " programme to cut emissions and ensure energy security .
Reports in the domestic media and from foreign diplomats suggest the next decade could see between 1.4 trillion ( US $ 200 bn ) and 4.5 trillion yuan ( US $ 600 bn ) investment in projects ranging from nuclear power , low carbon transport and clean coal technology to super - efficient electric grids .
This huge expansion is already causing problems .
Manufacturing capacity is outstripping supply and the country 's under - invested power grid networks were not ready for large - scale wind power input .
Some wind farms have been unable to start operating because of a lack of grid connection or were operating at levels lower than planned .
But experts warn that de-carbonising the energy supply must happen fast , given the massive toll on China 's environment .
State news agency Xinhua reported yesterday that the country 's largest desert lake could vanish in decades due to climate change and human activities .
" Just 10 years ago , one could n't see the other bank of the Hongjiannao even through a telescope .
Today , it 's visible with the naked eye , " said He Fenqi , a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
The Hongjiannao , sandwiched between the Muus Desert in Shaanxi Province and the Erdos Plateau in Inner Mongolia , has shrunk by at least 30 % in the past two decades , Xinhua reported .
It now covers 4,600 hectares and its water level is declining by 20 centimetres annually .
WASHINGTON , June 24 ( Reuters ) - The Federal Reserve sought to hide its extensive involvement and concerns about Bank of America Corp 's BAC.N acquisition of Merrill Lynch amid the latter 's worsening financial condition , a top Republican congressman said on Wednesday .
“ The committee has already learned that Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve made inappropriate threats to fire Bank of America management unless they went ahead with the ‘ shotgun wedding ’ that was the Merrill Lynch acquisition , ” Rep. Darrell Issa of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a statement released to Reuters .
“ The Federal Reserve also engaged in a cover - up and deliberately hid concerns and pertinent details regarding the merger from other federal regulatory agencies , ” the statement said .
The committee has obtained a number of emails and documents from the U.S. central bank about its behind - the - scenes role in the merger , according to sources familiar with documents .

As a business owner , you have many ways to get your message out to potential customers , and you ’ve probably tried most of them with not much to show for your hard - earned dollars .
But there is a low - cost and effective method you need to consider , especially if you own a brick - and - mortar establishment .
The National Association of Advertisers has concluded that the most effective form of advertising is that which is on - premises , beating out newspapers , radio , and television .
On - site signage has been proven to increase foot traffic by as much as fifty percent .
You can attract customers to your business by installing a custom feather flag at eye level in front of your store .
There are plenty of reasons to consider ordering a quantity of custom flags .
Now , remember that a custom flag wo n’t do you any good without a quality logo design .
Why Choose a Custom Feather Flag ?
These attractive outdoor flags are referred to as feather flags because their graceful shape is reminiscent of a bird ’s feather .
They stand twelve to fifteen feet tall , and are two - sided , so your message can be seen by people coming and going from your establishment .
Unlike a traditional flag , which relies on a stiff breeze to unfurl itself , a feather flag is always open to showcase your custom message .
A slight breeze is all it takes for the flag to flutter and wave , drawing even more attention to it .
These high - quality flags are made from materials designed for outdoor use .
You can work with an in - house designer to come up with a quality product in your company colors and including your company logo that will attract new customers .
How to Install a Custom Feather Flag
The best part about a feather flag is its versatility and ease of use .
The kit will arrive in four pieces .
Pound the anchor spike into the ground , assemble the pole , and feed the flag onto the pole before attaching it to the anchor .
That ’s all there is to it .
No special tools are needed , and in a short amount of time , your custom flag will be working for you .
You can order additional flags to highlight various times of the year , or special sale events , since the flag manufacturer always carries in - stock items for generic use .
If you want to use the flag in an indoor setting , such as a trade show or other special event , simply replace the anchor spike with a weighted donut and you ’ll be set .
Do n’t spend another day letting customers stroll by your business and not venture inside .
Capture foot traffic by using custom flags .
A lack of sunlight is associated with reduced cognitive function among depressed people .
Researchers writing in BioMed Central 's open access journal Environmental Health used weather data from NASA satellites to measure sunlight exposure across the United States and linked this information to the prevalence of cognitive impairment in depressed people .
Shia Kent , from the University of Alabama at Birmingham , led a team of US researchers who used cross-sectional data from 14,474 people in the NIH - NINDS - funded REGARDS study , a longitudinal study investigating stroke incidence and risk factors , to study associations between depression , cognitive function and sunlight .
He said , " We found that among participants with depression , low exposure to sunlight was associated with a significantly higher predicted probability of cognitive impairment .
This relationship remained significant after adjustment for season .
This new finding that weather may not only affect mood , but also cognition , has significant implications for the treatment of depression , particularly seasonal affective disorder " .
Kent and his colleagues speculate that the physiological mechanisms that give rise to seasonal depression may also be involved in sunlight 's effect on cognitive function in the context of depressive symptoms .
Cognitive function was assessed by measurement of short - term recall and temporal orientation .
As well as regulating the hormones serotonin and melatonin , light has been shown to also affect brain blood flow , which has in turn been linked with cognitive functions .
The researchers write , " Discovering the environment 's impact on cognitive functioning within the context of seasonal disorders may lead not only to better understanding of the disorders , but also to the development of targeted interventions to enhance everyday functioning and quality of life " .

State Tax Incentives a Bad Business
By Phred Barnet
Giving a tax incentive to a business to encourage economic development sounds like a great idea , but it is not .
Tax breaks for businesses are little more than corporate welfare at the expense of hard - working Georgians .
They amount to subsidies favoring a select few businesses over Georgia ’s residents and existing businesses .
Proponents of tax breaks for new businesses argue the increase in jobs will make up for the reduction in revenue , but tax breaks for businesses rarely pay for themselves and often end up costing the state a great deal of money .
That shortfall must be paid for by Georgia ’s taxpaying citizens and business , which do n’t have the benefit of that break .
Giving a business a tax incentive to move here may help that business in the short term , but in the long term the people who pay for that tax break also happen to be the employees and the customers of that company .
Plus , it sends the wrong message to existing Georgia businesses : “ If you stay in the state , we will use your tax dollars to subsidize your competitors . ”
In June , after the North Carolina Legislature approved a $ 46 million tax break designed to induce Apple , Inc. to build data warehouses in the Tar Heel State , Scott Hodge , president of the Washington , D.C. - based Tax Foundation , had this response : “ Too many legislators confuse targeted business incentives with policies that truly create a better business climate . ”
“ They are not .
They only provide an excuse for lawmakers to avoid real tax reform .
Targeted incentives are to a state ’s economy what steroids are to the human body – short - term results that eventually weaken the bones , cause heart failure , or worse , impotency .
Tax systems should not be used to pick winners and losers or micromanage the economy .
Data farms in North Carolina might be a good thing , but it is much better for the marketplace to decide that , not government .
The key to a prosperous economy is a tax system that provides a level playing field for all businesses and all industries . ”
In Georgia , a new law gives the entertainment industry tax credits for up to 30 percent of production and post - production expenditures .
Proponents argue that if Georgia does not do so , it will lose out to other states .
This mentality leads to bidding wars that end up offering more and more incentives to the entertainment industry .
Former North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Bob
Orr recently complained that “ the industry has been able to play off North Carolina against South Carolina against Louisiana against Georgia .
Louisiana raises its incentives , and it puts pressure on South Carolina , North Carolina and other states to do likewise . ”
In fact , only weeks after losing the new Miley Cyrus film to Georgia , North Carolina ’s State Senate moved to increase their tax breaks for entertainers from 15 percent to 25 percent .
The chief economist for Louisiana ’s legislative fiscal office , Greg Albrecht , estimates that in 2006 , Louisiana gave the entertainment industry about $ 121 million in tax credits , but that only around 18 percent of that money was ever recovered in economic activity and taxes .
He denounced the programs as “ an expensive way to create jobs , ” maintaining that “ there ’s no way you can say this makes money for the public . ”
At best , these incentives can create temporary increases in economic activity .
Yet these temporary increases do not pay for the costs of the programs themselves .
There is no logic in Georgia subsidizing the enormous salaries of Hollywood actors , directors and producers while many of our own residents struggle to get by in this tough economy .
The most equitable tax incentive that Georgia could offer would be to cut taxes on individuals as well as corporations to make Georgia more attractive to individuals and businesses – both old and new .
This would lead to investment and job creation , encourage more businesses to move to Georgia and send the correct message to Georgia ’s current businesses .

The subway train that plowed into another , causing a crash that killed seven and injured scores of others in Washington , was part of an aging fleet that federal regulators had recommended three years ago be phased out or retrofitted , a safety investigator said today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Debbie Hersman of the National Transportation Safety Board said the Metrorail transit system " was not able to do what we asked them to do . "
The rush - hour crashed sent more than 70 people to area hospitals and killed at least seven people .
The three - decades - old Metro system shuttled tourists and local commuters from Washington to Maryland and Virginia suburbs .
There was conflicting information about the number of fatalities .
Mayor Adrian Fenty announced Tuesday that seven had died in the crash along a part of Metro system track that carries passengers from the District of Columbia into suburban Maryland .
The District of Columbia Fire Department
Web site announced early Tuesday morning that three bodies had been found in addition to the six fatalities reported earlier .
Fenty said two victims were hospitalised in critical condition .
Hersman said investigators expect to recover recorders from the train was struck , providing valuable information that might help determine why the crash occurred .
However , the train triggered the collision was part of an old " thousand - series " fleet that was not equipped with the devices , she said at a news conference .

Dark matter and antimatter are separate but similarly mysterious concepts in physics which each present their own vexing questions for scientists .
Perhaps the most fundamental difference between the two is that much of what we know about dark matter comes from observations of the very large , while much of what we know about antimatter comes from observations at the particle level .
Dark matter
Scientists believe dark matter exists throughout the universe because based on our best calculations using Einstein 's equations of gravity , the universe should be much more massive than what all the observable stars and other bright objects would weigh ; therefore , scientists believe that there must be more matter out there , we just can't see it .
Thus the name dark matter , and its mysterious nature , since our only tool for observing distant matter is light , so if matter does not emit light , we can only make indirect observations and inferences about its properties .
One specific way we 've observed dark matter is through a phenomenon called gravitational lensing , in which large gravitational forces actually bend light as it travels through space - we can observe this happening throughout the universe and therefore infer the existence of matter which is creating the large gravitational forces .
How much of the universe is comprised of dark matter ?
Scientists estimate that we can only see 4 % of the real mass and energy in the universe .
Also , 22 % of the universe 's mass and energy is estimated to be dark matter , while the remaining 74 % is thought to be a related concept , dark energy .
Similar to dark matter , dark energy 's existence is inferred from indirect observation , but dark energy is thought to contribute to the outward pushing force which is causing the universe to expand .
Antimatter
Antimatter is another strange concept in physics - but unlike dark matter , it 's one which we 've actually observed in labs .
In a nutshell , antimatter is matter that has the opposite charge of matter .
For example , an electron is a matter particle which has a negative charge , while a positron ( also called an antielectron ) is an anti-matter particle which has a positive charge .
The cool part about this is that when these two things come into contact with each other , they annihilate each other and release massive amounts of energy .
In fact , this interaction is the pure conversion of matter into energy .
It is estimated that energy created from matter / anti-matter annihilation would yield 10,000,000,000 times the maximum energy created by chemical energy and 100 times the energy possible through nuclear fusion .
The potential applications for antimatter energy are exciting , although far off in terms of feasibility .
For example , it would take only a few grams of antimatter to propel a rocket ship from Earth to Mars and it would only take a few minutes .
Scientists and fiction writers alike have high hopes for possibilities in interplanetary and interstellar travel based on antimatter energy .
Scientists at CERN and Fermilab have created minute amounts of anti-matter in particle accelerators - but with current technologies it takes vastly more energy to create anti-matter than the energy that would be produced by it .
So dark matter exists at the large scale , beyond what we can see with our telescopes , while antimatter we know exists based on antimatter particles we 've created and observed in labs .
There is no direct relationship between the two that we know of .

One of the more neat things you can do with the versatile utility lsof is use it to recover a file you 've just accidentally deleted .
Tip of the Trade : Accidentally deleted files are easily recovered with lsof .
A file in Linux is a pointer to an inode , which contains the file data ( permissions , owner and where its actual content lives on the disk ) .
Deleting the file removes the link , but not the inode itself – if another process has it open , the inode is n't released for writing until that process is done with it .
To try this out , create a test text file , save it and then type less test .
txt .
Open another terminal window , and type rm testing .
txt .
If you try ls testing .
txt you 'll get an error message .
But ! less still has a reference to the file .
So :
> lsof | grep testing .
txt less 4607 juliet 4r REG 254,4 21 8880214 /home/juliet/testing.txt ( deleted )
The important columns are the second one , which gives you the PID of the process that has the file open ( 4607 ) , and the fourth one , which gives you the file descriptor ( 4 ) .
Now , we go look in / proc , where there will still be a reference to the inode , from which you can copy the file back out :
> ls -l / proc/4607/fd/4 lr-x------ 1 juliet juliet 64 Apr 7 03:19 / proc/4607/fd/4 -> /home/juliet/testing.txt ( deleted ) > cp / proc/4607/fd/4 testing.txt.bk
Note : do n't use the - a flag with cp , as this will copy the ( broken ) symbolic link , rather than the actual file contents .
Now check the file to make sure you 've got what you think you have , and you 're done !
In part 1 , we discussed why PHP namespaces are useful and the namespace keyword .
In this article , we examine the use command and the way PHP resolves namespace names .
For the purposes of this example , we will define two almost identical code blocks ; the only difference is their namespace :
lib1.php :
<? php // application library 1 namespace App\Lib1 ; const MYCONST = ' App\Lib1 \MYCONST ' ; function MyFunction ( ) { return __FUNCTION__ ; } class MyClass { static function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } ?>
lib2.php :
<? php // application library 2 namespace App\Lib2 ; const MYCONST = ' App\Lib2\MYCONST ' ; function MyFunction ( ) { return __FUNCTION__ ; } class MyClass { static function WhoAmI ( ) { return __METHOD__ ; } } ?>
There is a little PHP terminology to understand before we begin …
Fully - qualified name
Any PHP code can refer to a fully - qualified name — an identifier starting with the namespace backslash separator , e.g. AppLib1MYCONST , AppLib2MyFunction ( ) , etc .
Fully - qualified names have no ambiguity .
The initial backslash operates in a similar way to a file path ; it signifies the ‘ root ’ global space .
If we implemented a different MyFunction ( ) in our global space , it could be called from lib1. php or lib2.php using MyFunction ( ) .
Fully - qualified names are useful for one - off function calls or object initialization .
However , they can become impractical when you are making lots of calls .
As we will discover below , PHP offers other options to save us from namespace typing cramps .
Qualified name
An identifier with at least one namespace separator , e.g. Lib1MyFunction ( ) .
Unqualified name
An identifier without a namespace separator , e.g. MyFunction ( ) .
Working Within the Same Namespace
Consider the following code :
myapp1.php :
<?php namespace App\Lib1 ; require_once ( ' lib1.php ' ) ; require_once ( ' lib2.php ' ) ; header ( ' Content - type : text / plain ' ) ; echo MYCONST . "
" ; echo MyFunction ( ) . "
" ; echo MyClass : : WhoAmI ( ) . "
" ; ?>
Although we include both lib1.php and lib2.php , the identifiers MYCONST , MyFunction , and MyClass will only reference code in lib1. php .
This occurs because the myapp1. php code is within the same AppLib1 namespace :
result :
App\Lib1\MYCONST App\Lib1 \MyFunction App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI
Namespace Importing
Namespaces can be imported with the use operator , e.g .
myapp2.php :
<? php use App\Lib2 ; require_once ( ' lib1.php ' ) ; require_once ( ' lib2.php ' ) ; header ( ' Content - type : text / plain ' ) ; echo Lib2\MYCONST . "
" ; echo Lib2 \ MyFunction ( ) . "
" ; echo Lib2 \ MyClass :: WhoAmI ( ) . "
" ; ?>
Any number of use statements can be defined or you can separate individual namespaces with a comma .
In this example we have imported the AppLib2 namespace .
We still cannot refer directly to MYCONST , MyFunction or MyClass because our code is in the global space and PHP will look for them there .
However , if we add a prefix of ‘ Lib2 ’ , they become qualified names ; PHP will search through the imported namespaces until it finds a match .
result :
App\Lib1\MYCONST App\Lib2 \MyFunction App\Lib2 \MyClass :: WhoAmI
Namespace Aliases
Namespace aliases are perhaps the most useful construct .
Aliases allow us to reference long namespaces using a shorter name .
myapp3.php :
<? php use App \Lib1 as L ; use App\Lib2 \MyClass as Obj ; header ( ' Content - type : text / plain ' ) ; require_once ( ' lib1.php ' ) ; require_once ( ' lib2.php ' ) ; echo L\MYCONST . "
" ; echo L\MyFunction ( ) . "
" ; echo L\MyClass : : WhoAmI ( ) . "
" ; echo Obj : : WhoAmI ( ) . "
" ; ?>
The first use statement defines AppLib1 as ‘ L ’ .
Any qualified names using ‘ L ’ will be translated to ‘ AppLib1 ’ at compile - time .
We can therefore refer to LMYCONST and LMyFunction rather than the fully - qualified name .
The second use statement is more interesting .
It defines ‘ Obj ’ as an alias for the class ‘ MyClass ’ within the AppLib2 namespace .
This is only possible for classes — not constants or functions .
We can now use new Obj ( ) or run static methods as shown above .
result :
App\Lib1\MYCONST App\Lib1 \MyFunction App\Lib1 \MyClass :: WhoAmI App\Lib2 \MyClass :: WhoAmI
PHP Name Resolution Rules
PHP identifier names are resolved using the following namespace rules .
Refer to the PHP manual for more information .
1. Calls to fully - qualified functions , classes or constants are resolved at compile - time .
2. Unqualified and qualified names are translated according to the import rules , e.g. if the namespace ABC is imported as C , a call to CDe ( ) is translated to ABCDe ( ) .
3 . Inside a namespace , all qualified names not already translated according to import rules have the current namespace prepended , e.g. if a call to CDe ( ) is performed within namespace AB , it is translated to ABCDe ( ) .
4. Unqualified class names are translated according to current import rules and the full name is substituted for short imported name , e.g. if class C in namespace AB is imported as X , new X( ) is translated to new ABC ( ) .
5 . Unqualified function calls within a namespace are resolved at run-time .
For example , if MyFunction ( ) is called within namespace AB , PHP first looks for the function ABMyFunction ( ) .
If that is not found , it looks for MyFunction ( ) in the global space .
6. Calls to unqualified or qualified class names are resolved at run-time .
For example , if we call new C ( ) within namespace AB , PHP will look for the class ABC .
If that is not found , it will attempt to autoload ABC .

In tomorrow ’s final article we will cover autoloading and other advanced options .
It is so much easier to demand change from the outside than to challenge convention from within .
Lubna Hussein was among a group of 13 Sudanese women arrested in a popular cafe in Khartoum for wearing trousers .
All but three were flogged two days later , but Ms Hussein decided to have her day in court .
She refused a plea bargain that would have limited her punishment to 10 lashes , and resigned from her job as a journalist working for the UN mission in Sudan , which would otherwise have granted her immunity from prosecution .
She did so knowing that if she lost her case the penalty could be 40 lashes .
She makes her stand not merely over the right for women to wear trousers or as a protest against a punishment she regards as an act of humiliation .
She wants to annul the article of Sudanese law that addresses women 's dress code under the title of indecent acts .
Sudan 's interpretation of Islamic law , she argues , is not just unconstitutional but un -Islamic .
Sharia law is imperfectly enforced in Sudan , especially in its increasingly affluent and cosmopolitan capital .
It is , however , used to crack the whip , making Islam a proxy for the regime 's authoritarianism .
The government may well be embarrassed by Ms Hussein 's trial , as much as it is annoyed by her status as a cause celebre .
Ms Hussein may not win her case , but in defeat she could prove stronger than in victory .
Her example should be a spur to independent - minded women wherever they are in the world .
Robert I. Lappin used to be a familiar sight on Lafayette Street in Salem , where he would rollerblade to work from his home in Swampscott .
The ponytail made him unmistakable .
But Lappin is 87 now , and gave up the skates about a year and a half ago .
The former vacuum cleaner maker now drives a 21 - year - old Mercedes to his office in Shetland Park , an old mill he converted into a bustling business center that transformed the Salem waterfront .
This week , Lappin honored a promise .
He and his family donated $ 5 million to restore the retirement savings of about 60 employees of various family enterprises , including the Robert I. Lappin Charitable Foundation .
The charity was almost wiped out when the Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff collapsed .
Lappin and his family had invested all of their employees ’ 401 ( k ) retirement plans with Madoff more than a decade ago .
“ I am absolutely thrilled , ’’ said Amy Powell , a former publicist for the foundation and one of the employees whose savings were restored .
“ I really knew in my heart , all my heart , that Mr. Lappin would do all he could do for his em ployees . ’’
Lappin had invested so heavily with Madoff that it cost him much of his personal fortune .
The foundation lost $ 8 million when Madoff ’s assets were frozen last December , and for a time was forced to shut its doors .
Lappin said that now , after Madoff and the payment to employees , his personal net worth is less than $ 5 million , about a tenth of what it was before the scandal broke .
Yet giving his own money to the employees was simply the right thing to do , he said .
“ At least from the feedback , they feel very grateful and happy , which makes me feel very happy , ’’ said Lappin .
“ So far no kisses , but I have had some hugs . ’’
Family and friends said Lappin feels an imperative to give .
Over the years , that led him to sponsor 17 education , interfaith outreach , and family development programs under the umbrella of his namesake foundation .
He has given more than $ 30 million to Jewish causes on the North Shore .
After the Madoff scandal , he raised $ 450,000 to restore the foundation ’s Youth To Israel travel program .
It sent 82 Jewish teens on pilgrimages to Israel just last Sunday .
“ He ’s among moral giants , ’’ said Rabbi Yossi Lipsker of Swampscott , director and founder of Chabad - Lubavitch of the North Shore , which runs Hebrew schools and other programs .
Lappin , who helped the rabbi fund his center , “ embodies the highest ideals of our traditions , ’’ said Lipsker .
“ He ’s a lover of his people .
He ’s a lover of the land of Israel . ’’

Well , it really seems as if Psystar is committed to continue its business , no matter what .
The company entered chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May , and many wondered if this meant the end of the clone maker and the legal case between Apple and Psystar .
Well , today the clone maker announced that it is emerging from chapter 11 , and while they ’re at it , they also introduce a new “ Mac ” .
The fact that the company is emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is probably the biggest surprise .
Many thought that this would mean the end of the small company ; not an odd thing considering the costs of litigation and company operation .
“ As you all may already be aware in late May , Psystar filed for Chapter 11 protection .
Although this was critical to our continued daily operations , we now are ready to emerge and again battle Goliath , ” the company states , “ More information will be available in the coming days when we will be formally discharged by the Bankruptcy court . ”
“ When life gives you apples , make applesauce , ” they add cheekily .
The company also introduces two new products , one of which is a new Mac clone .
The Open ( 7 ) sports a quad core Nehalem processor , a maximum of 12 GB of RAM , and lots of other configuration options , coming in at 1499.99 USD for the base configuration .
Mac OS X Leopard comes pre-installed at no additional cost .
I guess we also got an answer to the question to what Psystar was referring when it said it had Intellectual Property of its own : the Darwin Universal Boot Loader .
This is a graphical bootloader that looks similar to Chameleon 2.0 , of course with full Mac OS X and XNU support .
Existing Psystar customers will get this new fancy bootloader as well , and they promise it will be released as open source shortly .

You were killed yesterday Xmas a .m.. in Richmond , CA .
You were the coolest cabbie I ever met .
Plus you had icy cool Indian sapphire blue eyes .
You were impressed that an American chick like me could speak a little Hindi , and I always greeted you like " Sastree Kahl , keelahleeeey !!!!! "
You let me slide when I was a little short between paychecks , and I always tipped you well .
You told me that money meant nothing to you , and unlike most folks who say that , you meant it .
I remeber when you almost got a ticket by CHP for speeding to get me to BART on time , and when i gave the CHP guy a dirty look , he backed off of you , and did n't give you a ticket .
You said I was your good luck charm .
You went back to India to get your wife last summer .
I met her , and she was really sweet .
You used to wait to make sure that I made it in the house safely .
when I sent you to pick up friends of mine , my friends told me that you spoke highly of me , and you told them what a good person I was .
Maybe this note means nothing to anybody else reading this , but you did n't deserve to die like that .
Shot in the shithole streets of Richmond for a few dollars .
all you went thru to get to this country for a better life , and you died like a dog in the streets of the ghetto .
At the hands of two young women , no less .
Goodbye , my friend .
You will be missed .
