So , if I told you that an 84 - year old Senator was on trial for seven felony counts of failure to disclose gifts and home renovations on his Senate financial disclosure forms , and then I told you that he wore a panda tie to the trial , and then I told you that his estranged best friend , now turned key witness for the prosecution , told a wistful story about how the two of them used to go to “ boot camp ” together in the desert southwest , and walk around eating hardly anything but drinking wine as a weight loss strategy ….
you ’d probably have to do a mental rewind .
You ’d ask me to repeat myself , and you ’d listen again and then start to think I ’d been hitting the wine myself , or at the very least was relating a weird dream in that way you do when you first wake up .
But , you ’d be wrong on both counts .
This is all very , strangely true .
The witness in question is none other than former oil services company Veco ’s former CEO , Bill Allen .
And Bill and Ted ’s excellent adventure really did happen .
“ Allen described meeting Stevens for the first time in the early 1980s at fundraisers and events for Republican Frank Murkowski , who was running for the U.S. Senate and went on to a term as Alaska governor .
Allen spoke wistfully of their former “ close , personal friendship ” and how they used to go to “ boot camp ” in the desert Southwest – where they would walk around , eating little and drinking only wine , “ trying to get some pounds off . ”
While Allen testified , Stevens looked down at the table , writing .
It did n’t appear the two former friends ever made eye contact . ”
I do n’t know that wandering in the desert drinking wine is the most effective weight loss strategy , but it does get points for creativity …. unless the dehydrated alcoholic heat stroke gets you .
Ah , the hazards of “ boot camp . ”
And the panda tie ?
I ca n’t explain it .
Stevens has been infamous in the past for wearing another tie , featuring the Incredible Hulk ( no I ’m not kidding ) , on the Senate floor .
That ’s when many Alaskans collectively sink down in their chairs with a hand over their faces trying to act like he ’s not our Senator .
Stevens even has a collection of Incredible Hulk memorabilia in his Senate office .
The Hulk is his totem animal .
Maybe the panda was meant to metaphorically show the court that deep down he ’s just a big ol ’ teddy bear ?
The Hulk can be a bit intimidating , and you could imagine him being in shackles … but a panda ?
No jury could be that cruel .
Most of the rest of the Stevens trial has been all about …home renovations .
Electricians , photos of plugs , blueprints , telephone lines , contractors …. kind of a snooze .
But Bill Allen definitely spiced things up a bit .
The conversation also turned to some of the unreported gifts that Stevens has received from Allen and Veco : gift baskets , a $ 30,000 fish sculpture , engraved guns , a sled dog puppy , a generator to save the Stevens ’ chalet from potential Y2 K issues , and a foot - sewn doll .
If you are more convinced than ever that I ’m making this up , feel free to check HERE , where they are live blogging the Stevens trial .

This CNN's Rick Sanchez reported on a church marquee that reads " America we have a Muslim president .
This is a sin against the Lord . "
Mark Holick is pastor of The Spirit One Christian Center in Wichita , Kansas where the sign is being displayed .
Holick told KSNW , " The main point of the marquee is to cause the Christians to understand he is not a Christian , Again , they will call me and they will tell me that he 's not a Muslim because he is a Christian .
That 's not the point .
The point is he 's not a Christian . "
Sanchez talked to Wayne Slater who is the Sr. political write for the Dallas Morning News .
" It 's absolutely not true .
He was born in the United States .
Barack Obama .
He is not a Muslim .
Yet , there are people who hold on to this and part of this , i think , is an intent to believe what people want to believe about their environment because their environment is changing , " said Slater .

Sign the petition today and demand that the Senate once again REJECT political lackey , John Ratcliffe !
Demand an Investigation into Roger Stone ’s Sentencing Recommendation !
Following a lengthy investigation and conviction of President Trump ’s right - hand man , Roger Stone , Trump publicly and vociferously criticized the sentencing recommendation made by career Department of Justice officials after which DOJ leaders withdrew the recommendations and called for a more lenient sentence .
The Department of Justice ’s Inspector General should investigate this matter and the House Judiciary Committee should demand answers from the Department of Justice as well .

Trump ’s fake " national emergency " declaration is an unlawful and unconstitutional assault on the checks and balances our democracy relies on .
But Congress can pass a resolution to stop Trump and his fake emergency !
Tell the Senate : Oppose Neomi Rao !
President Trump ’s nominee for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals , Neomi Rao , is -- unsurprisingly -- another extreme , out - of - touch nominee .
Rao has a disturbing record on LGBTQ , race , and sexual assault .

Sign the petition and urge the senate to oppose Rao 's nomination .
Urge your Congressperson to Support the Equality Act to Protect the LGBTQ Community !
Our nation ’s civil rights laws protect people on the basis of race , color , national origin , and in most cases , sex , disability , and religion .

Sign the petition urging your incoming member to support H.R. 1 today !
Tell Congress to Protect the Mueller Investigation !
Just after the midterm elections , President Trump FIRED Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General and appointed one of his political lackeys , Matt Whitaker , as interim AG .
Now that Sessions has been fired , Whitaker has taken the lead on overseeing Robert Mueller 's Russia investigation -- clearly an attempt to put a strangle on the investigation before it proceeds any further .
Members of both parties need to co-sponsor and publicly support passage of the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act !
Vote NO on Trump nominee Thomas Farr !
Trump and the Far - Right are winning in their efforts to pack our federal courts with extreme narrow - minded elitist judicial nominees .
Nominated by Trump to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina , Thomas Farr is much more than just a run -of - the - mill advocate of voter suppression -- his history of disenfranchising voters of color is long .
Tell your Senators to vote NO Thomas Farr for a lifetime appointment !
Tell the Senate : OPPOSE Trump ’s Extreme Supreme Court Nominee !
Trump has nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court .
Kavanaugh is a narrow - minded elitist who would drag the Court far , far to the Right and take a sledge hammer to the fundamental rights of countless Americans .

The solution to the child care crisis in America is the Child Care for Working Families Act -- a bold new bill that not only provides direct financial assistance for child care and early learning expenses , on a sliding scale based on household income , but takes a comprehensive approach -- addressing child care challenges like the quality , availability , and flexibility of care .
Sign now :
Ask your members of Congress to support the Child Care for Working Families Act !
Sign Now :
It ’s time for Congress to investigate the Trump administration for repeated ethics violations .
Since his first day in office , President Donald Trump has flouted ethical norms by not divesting himself from his family ’s business , nor fully divulging the sources of his income .
And the example he has set has trickled down throughout his administration .
The ethics violations on the Trump administration ’s watch need to be reined in -- NOW .
Sign the petition and demand Congress immediately investigate Trump administration officials for repeated ethics violations .

These election officials need to be forced to take a computer and networking security class to put a little scare in them .
Sheesh .
They just do n't seem to understand it only takes one security hole to change the results of the entire election ; just one .

One thing I think would be an excellent extension to this process is the ability to check if your envelope has been received via the web and / or email , not just by phone .
( To those that have n't watched the video :
In Oregon you place your ballot in a " secrecy envelope " which has no identifying information .
You then place the secrecy envelope in an outer envelope .
The outer envelope has your name , address , a bar code , and a place where you sign .
When the county receives your envelope , the bar code is scanned to record that your envelope was received , and the signature is verified .
Some time after verification , the inner secrecy envelope is separated from the outer envelope , making the ballot completely anonymous . )
To me , there is a " confidence " hole in the system ... many people do n't know they can call their elections office to make sure the envelope was received and that there were no signature verification or registration problems , so they have an uneasy feeling after mailing their ballot , wondering if it ever got where it was supposed to go .
That 's why a lot of folks prefer to use the drive - up boxes near election day .
Educating people that they can call is n't a fantastic solution , because the counties are not equipped to take calls from hundreds of thousands of voters .
But who did or did not vote is already a matter of public record , so it should n't be too difficult to make a web - based interface where people can check for problems .
Every registered voter already has a unique number ( that 's the bar code on the outer envelope ) .
You could use this number as a way to access a state web site which could tell you A ) envelope received , B ) registration problems , C ) signature problems , D ) envelope mangled , etc .
For people who vote early , this would be a great way to spot trouble in time to correct problems or at least vote provisionally , and would add confidence to the system .
Note that this proposal is not the only thing we could use to strengthen the system --- but it requires no significant changes to existing procedures and makes the whole system more transparent and accessible to voters .

Regarding tampering with counting machines and networks , this is a finite practical possibility .
However , a new Oregon law mandates that every county elections office perform an administrative recount , by hand , of three randomly chosen precincts , as well as three races also chosen at random .
These random recounts create a risk to those who would tamper with machines --- a mandated random recount would catch a significant difference in vote totals , either at the precinct level or at the race level .
The key here , of course , is that the chosen recount precincts and races are truly " random " .
I 'm unfamiliar with the procedure for picking the " random " recounts --- this _must_ be transparent and non-machine , or the whole safety net collapses .
One more thing regarding my idea for online envelope - receipt checking :
This also provides voters a mechanism to discover if someone _else_ has inappropriately voted in their name .
I know of at least one person who has been contacted by phone by their county because there was a problem with their signature --- this is good --- but the self - service web method provides greater confidence in case there is some question about whether voters are contacted in a timely manner ( or at all ) in the event of problems .

Voting machines suck !
Optical scan is n't much better than touchscreen because of network connections and central tabulation ( the most likely source of monkey business ) .
Hand counted paper ballots always match the exit polls .
Electronic voting machines often times do not for some reason .
You can live in your soft cozy fantasyland if you want to , but most computer security experts do not like computerized voting .

Hey peoples .
I found this very interesting article on " Benford 's Law " .
Yes it has applications in combating election fraud .
it 's a short article , go read it article explaining how Benford 's law can be applied to precinct data to catch fraud .
Very fascinating .
Then go over to Wikipedia for more info if you are interested here for wikipedia : Benford 's Law
It has to do with counting the number ones , twos , threes , etc. that are the very first digit in the precinct data .
There should be this many ones , this many twos , etc .

I watched this clip , and I watched this one too :
http://rawstory.com/news...election_raise_1121.html
The Washington State clip makes me think this : would you trust an ad hoc bank ?
I mean , these folks ( volunteers mostly ) throw together an ad hoc branch bank for a day and expect to be secure , accurate , prompt and courteous , and auditable to a tee .
It is n't that they do n't or can't do a great job .
It is that the task in all out of proportion to the skills and training and policies .
I know they train and I know they have dedicated people --- but it 's like an ad hoc bank .
And I fail to see why we should bank there with confidence .

You 'll either have to trust them ... or a dedicated ( and paid ) vote - counting caste ... or diebold ...
The problem is that they ( and we ) are dealing with a concept that is inherently trouble - prone , and one in which any fact - based operational norms are under constant pressure by various parties to shift to " norms " that are not fact - based ... but suit the various parties own interests .
As for the folks in Oregon ?
You gots e-voting being mandated as intrinsically secure .
You gots hidden vote counting by software being mandated as " open and transparent " .
You gots secret vote - counting software being mandated as secure because the corporations said so .
You gots an insecure chain of custody for the ballots being mandated as secure ... ... so what more can you expect these people to do when they have been forced to accept those kinds of starting premises ?

Hi John !
Thanks for posting this .
Shawn contacted us at the Oregon Voter Rights Coalition to let us know about his documentary and we were glad to post both his video and his report called Vote By Mail Election Day : An Interloper 's Journey at our site .
So if you 'd like to check that out please do .
He laments not having a copy of the " Everest " Report on hand to help some of these officials and election workers " get it . "
You may want to post his written report in this blog post to go along with the video to help give context .
( Side note for citizen vloggers --- when you can't get it done via Youtube due to their draconian " 10 min. rule " try out http://www.blip.tv.
Good service and large files are allowed .
I turned Shawn on to Blip.tv and hopefully we will be seeing more democra-mentaries from him again soon ! )

Bob R. ,
The key here , of course , is that the chosen recount precincts and races are truly " random " .
I 'm unfamiliar with the procedure for picking the " random " recounts --- this _must_ be transparent and non-machine , or the whole safety net collapses .
Unfortunately for us , the key is not merely the issue of randomness or not .
They actually have a pretty good system to select the precincts .
The problem is that the so - called audit is a mere placebo and does nothing to actually verify the outcome of the race .
The new mandatory audit became law in Oregon by virtue of HB 3270 , a bill we at first supported ( when it provided for an outcome verification for statewide races ) and then adamantly opposed ( when it was gut and stuffed at the end of the session by our DOE and remade into a mere random check of a sample of machines . )
Those interested can read the history here .
Needless to say , the large vendors ES&S and Sequoia apparently wield a lot of clout among election officials here and they were convinced that a relatively meaningless audit with a low confidence of exposing an incorrect result was apparently good enough .
We have a new Secretary of State and we still have hope for implementing a real verification of machine results in statewide races , but we 'll see .
We will continue the battle against secret vote counting until we take back our elections from private vendors and return them to the citizens of Oregon .

Outstanding work , K. Shawn and Shawn !
I just learned a TON about VBM thanks to your video -- so helpful / thank you so much .
Despite my skepticism of the process , I 'm delighted to see the Oregon Elections Staff so willing to show you around the elections office , answer your questions , allow you full ' back - stage pass ' access .
( What a night / day difference from Florida , where election observers are now being arrested for trying to do just that . )
If only every citizen in every county in the country would make videos just like this , we could get a much better idea of how / where our efforts are most needed .
Great educational tool for less - savvy election enthusiasts , too .
Fantastic last frame / the look on your face as voter confidence is being discussed -- priceless .

Further to my comment # 4 about vbm ballot tracking systems --
Suppose the system tells the voter his / her ballot has not been received ?
counted ?
What can she / he do ?
Ask the staff to check ?
Are n't they in the same bind ?
If they query the system and confirm that it does not have the ballot listed , then what ?
Or , if it tells them that the ballot HAS been received and counted , how can they be sure ?
and how can they convince the voter that all is well ?

When you can and cover all the steps , you may understand the cost and complexity of the Vote by Mail processing .... and then look at the weak points in security .. go ahead and try it .......

We already know for a fact that VBM is far less expensive than many other forms of voting .
As for the " weak points in security " most of these weak points are not " caused " by VBM but are part of all voting processes .
All voting processes MUST have appropriate tracking , chain of custody and oversight as part of the checks and balances .
VBM does not claim to provide these checks and balances , the state election officials , appropriately dogged by citizen patriots , must provide this oversight and set up procedures for a reviewable , transparent and secure processing of ballots .
The pros of VBM , in our state with our set of checks and balances and oversight , vastly outweigh the cons when all is said and done .
Our main and most serious problem is secret , unreviewed , and unverified counting of all elections by private corporations .
Absolutely unacceptable and far worse than any problems related to VBM per se .

Phillip Chavez , the motorist who repeatedly pummeled Glenn Ryburn after Ryburn plowed into the back of Chavez ’s car — killing his two stepchildren , pleaded guilty today to reckless manslaughter .
Ryburn , 62 , died two months after being severely beaten following the March 8 car accident on northbound Interstate 25 near 104th Avenue .
Adams County District Attorney Don Quick said the sequence of events that night was “ horrifying . ”
Killed in the wreck were Damien Noyes , 14 , and Angela Noyes , 13 .
Quick said that after the accident , Chavez went to Ryburn ’s Chevy Blazer and “ hit Ryburn as many as 50 to 150 times . ”
“ He ( Ryburn ) was seat - belted , ” said Quick .
“ It was a repeated beating . ”
Bystanders pulled Chavez off Ryburn , only to have Chavez return and continue the beating , said the Adams County district attorney .
When he is sentenced early next year , Chavez could receive up to six years in jail , said Quick .
However , if the judge finds aggravating circumstances , Chavez could receive a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison .
“ We ca n’t have people taking the law into their own hands , ” said Quick .
Chavez originally was charged with second - degree murder .
The Colorado reckless - manslaughter law states a person is guilty of the crime if he or she “ recklessly causes the death ” of another person .
Chavez was driving the family ’s Ford Escort when the accident occurred .
The group was heading back to their home in Loveland after watching the Denver Nuggets defeat the San Antonio Spurs .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
For years , conservatives have grumbled about voter registration efforts aimed at low - income citizens , particularly those mounted by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) , claiming these campaigns are rampant with fraud and corruption that benefits Democrats .
On Tuesday , this low - grade battle became a headline - making clash , as the McCain - Palin campaign blasted ACORN and the Obama - Biden campaign and ACORN responded in kind .
At a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington , the McCain campaign put the chairmen of its “ Honest and Open Election Committee , ” former Republican Senators John Danforth and Warren Rudman , front and center before the national media .
The pair asserted that the election is in danger of being compromised , accusing ACORN of submitting thousands of phony voter registrations nationwide .
They noted that they had sent a letter to the Obama campaign , Democratic Party chairman Howard Dean , and top state election officials proposing the creation of joint election observation teams .
“ Each campaign would list every precinct where either fears there is a potential for voter intimidation , fraud , or mistrust of the tabulation process on Election Day , ” the letter reads .
“ Each campaign would be responsible for recruiting a volunteer for each named precinct .
The Republican and Democratic volunteers would work jointly as an observation team . ”
( It is already routine for campaigns and parties to send election observers , often trained lawyers , to polling locations on Election Day .
Representatives of local media outlets are commonly on hand as well . )
Danforth and Rudman ’s letter ends , “ Let ’s talk . ”
The Obama campaign is n’t interested .
It points out that the campaigns already dealt with this issue in an exchange of letters in September that generated little media attention .
At that time , the McCain folks notified the Obama campaign of its joint observation teams idea and a week later the Obama campaign responded harshly : “ This seems a starkly political maneuver to deflect attention from the reality of the suppression strategies pursued by national , state and Republican party committees . ”
Nothing further occurred .
At the press conference , Danforth and Rudman suggested that ACORN was engaging in fraudulent voter registration on a massive scale — they mentioned 5,700 rejected ACORN registrations in Philadelphia , 1,400 more in New Mexico , reports of individuals registering to vote dozens of times , and so on .
Senator Rudman said that he does not know what ACORN , which works with low - income communities and is a known sympathizer with liberal causes , hopes to accomplish , but that their actions call the integrity of the election into question .
They repeated the charges on the cable news networks after the press conference .
The Senators did n’t quite accuse Barack Obama of orchestrating massive voter fraud , but they came close .
“ Senator Obama has a special responsibility to rein in ACORN , ” said Danforth .
The campaign pointed to Obama ’s connections to the group : Obama worked with ACORN briefly while a community organizer , did minor legal work for it after law school , and distributed funds to it while a board member of the Chicago - based Woods Fund .
Further , the Obama campaign paid a subsidiary of ACORN over $ 800,000 to help with get - out - the - vote efforts ( not voter registration ) in the Democratic primary .
ACORN takes pride in primarily registering low - income people , people of color , and young people .
All three groups are major parts of Obama ’s coalition .
Together , these facts are enough for many on the right to claim a nationwide conspiracy to steal the election .
Practically every conservative group with a mailing list , from the Republican National Committee to the pro-life Family Research Council , has sent an email alerting its supporters to the grave threat ACORN supposedly represents .
Shortly after the McCain press conference ended , ACORN had an opportunity to defend itself .
Renting a room just down the hall from the McCain campaign press conference , the group admitted to the press that in the process of registering 1.3 million new voters with the help of 13,000 mostly part - time canvassers , problems have occurred .
Most commonly , its representatives said , workers seeking to make a quick buck have inflated their registration totals with duplicate or fictional registrations — thus the report that the Dallas Cowboys roster has allegedly been registered to vote in Nevada .
But there is no institutionalized attempt to steal the election , they maintained .
In fact , problematic registration forms are flagged by ACORN before they are sent to election officials , who frequently require all forms , legitimate or not , to be handed over to the state in which they were filed .
In many of the cases where hundreds or thousands of problematic registration forms were found , ACORN was the first to identify the problem .
And , the organization pointed out , those responsible for submitting phony registrations have been fired and in some cases , reported to authorities for possible criminal action .
ACORN officials also pointed out that fraudulent voter registrations do not equal fraudulent votes .
Someone registered to vote 72 times can only cast one vote at the polls .
( In response , the McCain campaign pointed to vulnerabilities in the absentee voting system , but offered few details . )
On this front ACORN was echoed by Demos , a think tank , and Common Cause , a good government advocacy group .
The heads of both groups cited studies indicating that very few people try to use a fake name to vote .
Voter fraud at the polls , they said , is a minor problem compared to voter intimidation , intentional voter misinformation campaigns , and barriers to voting commonly set up in conservative states , such as Voter ID laws .
The Obama campaign , in a conference call held hours after the dueling press conferences , reiterated these points .
Campaign manager David Plouffe called the McCain campaign ’s focus on ACORN a “ strategic and cynical ploy … to sow confusion in a deliberate attempt to decrease turnout .
”
ACORN ’s leadership has sent a letter to Senators Danforth and Rudman requesting a sit - down meeting to address the controversy .
It mirrored the letter Danforth and Rudman sent to the Obama campaign .
The McCain campaign has a political interest in declining the invitation .
After all , why would it put to bed a controversy that has the ability to energize its base in the final weeks of the election ?
Barack Obama will skip two campaign rallies scheduled Thursday , and fly to Hawaii to see his seriously ill grandmother .
Politico has the late breaking news .
“ In the last few weeks her health has deteriorated to the point where her situation is very serious , ” Gibbs told reporters aboard Obama ’s campaign plane .
Update beneath the fold …
The change of plans means Obama will scrap scheduled rallies Thursday in Des Moines , Iowa , and Madison , Wisc .
He will instead head to Indianapolis , Ind. , for a morning event , leave for Hawaii and return to the campaign trail Saturday , making stops in the West .
His grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , “ has always been one of the most important people in his life , ” Gibbs said .
“ Along with his mother and his grandfather , she raised him in Hawaii from the time he was born to the moment he left for college . ”
“ The decision that Sen . Obama is making to go to Hawaii underscores the seriousness of the situation , ” Gibbs said
You know what these are , the videos of people running , fighting , and rioting on Black Friday , all trying to score a deal on some crappy piece of merchandise .
Please do n’t be like these people , just buy your stuff online .

He must be Australian .
He wants to paint the white house in the colors of the Australian flag ...
He wants to make the Koala bear the national symbol instead of the bald eagle .
He wants to surrender America to the Australians .
Sounds pretty silly , huh ?
No sillier than the same nonsense when it is said about Obama .

The Right - Wing in this country uses fear and hate to win public support for their ideas .
This cannot be disputed , and was even studied by Associate Professor Jonathan Haidt ( “ What Makes People Vote Republican ? ) .
In a nutshell , when our fears and emotions are tapped , we tend to react first and rationalize what we did later , even if our “ rationale ” is in conflict with the facts .
Rather than appeal to our intellect and ability to reason our way to a solution , the Right - Wing stokes fear and hate and then tells you who to fear and who to hate .
The reason why you should fear and hate becomes completely irrelevant once they have tapped into your emotions , for any kind of “ reasoning ” will make sense if it makes you feel justified in doing what you did , even if you normally would have thought that what you were doing was wrong .
Without this tactic , they could not win support for their arguments on the facts alone .
( And when I talk about “ facts ” , I ’m talking about things that are actually true , not what many people might believe to be the truth . )
Whether they want to admit it or not , this attribute in humans to have our sense of fear and hate be easily tapped comes from our evolutionary survival skills .
Our ancestors needed to be able to spot danger by seeing who or what was different around them .
If they came across another human - like creature that looked different from themselves , they would know he was not from their own clan / tribe / collective / village , and that he might pose a danger .
A good place to grow food , hunt animals , and live peacefully was worth defending from those who would take it by force .
But we have evolved beyond the need to immediately be fearful of someone who looks different .
And we have learned that cooperation benefits everyone when resources are plentiful .
The key to advancement as a society and a civilization is cooperation , not division .
The Right - Wing tries to make you fear or hate someone or something , and then gives you a plausible - sounding ( but usually illogical ) argument for doing so , and tells you what to do about it .
You rarely ever hear them give a rational explanation for supporting what they want you to do .
Rush Limbaugh has been big on labeling the current economic mess as “ The Obama Recession ” .
It ’s stupid because the economic problems began more than a year ago and Obama is not yet the president .
But they have given the situation a Label , and then they will define for you what it means .
And they will make you afraid of what Obama might do ( based on nothing but their own personal fears and imaginations ) , and tell you that you have to stop him before it ’s too late .
I know , because I ’ve already seen them doing this .
But they will never explain why they are right in the first place .
And do you know why ?
It ’s not simply because of their anti-intellectual attitude .
It ’s because they do n’t have one .
The Right - Wing Label

Look for the Right - Wing label
When they are smearing the things they despise .
Remember somewhere their hatred ’s growing ,
It ’s really showing their evil side and all their lies .
They work hard at their complaining .
Thanks to the media they ’re getting their way .
So always look for the Right - Wing label ,
It says they ’re able to fake it in the U.S.A .

Details on the airing of the next season of Slayers Revolution , cunningly titled Slayers Evolution - R , have been announced ; we hear that the first broadcast will be 9 PM on the 12th of January , 2009 , on AT - X .
It ’s yet not clear whether other stations will carry the series .
It looks as if Slayers enjoys something of a blessed fate , for despite disappointing ratings and DVD sales cancellation seems to have been off the cards from the start .
Slayers fans will doubtless be hoping for a resurgence in popularity , although the difficult line the series has to walk between garnering new fans and maintaining its old base seems to suggest this may be difficult .

Daily Show : Did October surprise turn out to be ' sickly '
Cheney tape ?

In 2004 , a bin Laden video tape denouncing George Bush , which was released just four days before the November election , was credited with helping Bush eke out a narrow victory .
Some observers even wondered if the effect had been deliberate .
Now The Daily Show's Jon Stewart believes something similar may be in play in 2008 .
" The evil mastermind has resurfaced to release another grainy , disturbing videotape featuring his sickly image , " Stewart began .
He then showed Vice President Dick Cheney saying on November 1 , " I believe the right leader for this moment in history is Senator John McCain . "
" Clearly trying to influence the American election , " Stewart commented .
" But which way ? "
Stewart then ran an extended version of the same clip to show the unhealthy - appearing Cheney coughing immediately after saying McCain 's name , then repeated the cough again in slow motion .
" Dick Cheney coughing in slow motion may be the unhealthiest thing you will ever watch on television , " Stewart commented .
In Cleveland the next day , Barack Obama told a crowd , " John McCain worked hard to get Dick Cheney 's support . "
He also pointed out that it had just begun raining and suggested , " You notice what happened when I started talking about Dick Cheney . "
" Talking about Dick Cheney made God cry ? "
Stewart wondered .

The Fallacy That May Never Die …
From this Sunday ’s Boston Globe “ Ideas ” section : Natural Disasters Help
“ Natural disasters can give a boost to the countries where they occur – and sometimes , the more the better ”
“ … When something is destroyed you do n’t necessarily rebuild the same thing that you had .
You might use updated technology , you might do things more efficiently .
It bumps you up , ” says Mark Skidmore , an economics professor at Michigan State University .
“ Disasters help people think about things differently . ”
As J. Henderson has remarked : , “ Using this logic , the federal government should spur greater growth and technological development by regularly and frequently bulldozing random homes and businesses across the country . ”
The seminal essay on the subject published in 1850 : That Which is Seen , and That Which is Not Seen by Frederic Bastiat .
Introduction
The Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix ( VDPAU ) provides a complete solution for decoding , post - processing , compositing , and displaying compressed or uncompressed video streams .
These video streams may be combined ( composited ) with bitmap content , to implement OSDs and other application user interfaces .
API Partitioning
VDPAU is split into two distinct modules :
The intent is that most VDPAU functionality exists and operates identically across all possible Windowing Systems .
This functionality is the Core API .
However , a small amount of functionality must be included that is tightly coupled to the underlying Windowing System .
This functionality is the Window System Integration Layer .
Possibly examples include :
Creation of the initial VDPAU VdpDevice handle , since this act requires intimate knowledge of the underlying Window System , such as specific display handle or driver identification .
Conversion of VDPAU surfaces to / from underlying Window System surface types , e.g. to allow manipulation of VDPAU - generated surfaces via native Window System APIs .
Object Types
VDPAU is roughly object oriented ; most functionality is exposed by creating an object ( handle ) of a certain class ( type ) , then executing various functions against that handle .
The set of object classes supported , and their purpose , is discussed below .
Device Type
A VdpDevice is the root object in VDPAU 's object system .
The Window System Integration Layer allows creation of a VdpDevice object handle , from which all other API entry points can be retrieved and invoked .
Surface Types
A surface stores pixel information .
Various types of surfaces existing for different purposes :
VdpVideoSurfaces store decompressed YCbCr video frames in an implementation - defined internal format .
VdpOutputSurfaces store RGB 4:4:4 data .
They are legal render targets for video post - processing and compositing operations .
VdpBitmapSurfaces store RGB 4:4:4 data .
These surfaces are designed to contain read - only bitmap data , to be used for OSD or application UI compositing .
Transfer Types
A data transfer object reads data from a surface ( or surfaces ) , processes it , and writes the result to another surface .
Various types of processing are possible :
VdpDecoder objects process compressed video data , and generate decompressed images .
VdpOutputSurfaces have their own rendering functionality .
VdpVideoMixer objects perform video post - processing , de- interlacing , and compositing .
VdpPresentationQueue is responsible for timestamp - based display of surfaces .
Data Flow
Compressed video data originates in the application 's memory space .
This memory is typically obtained using malloc , and filled via regular file or network read system calls .
Alternatively , the application may mmap a file .
The compressed data is then processed using a VdpDecoder , which will decompress the field or frame , and write the result into a VdpVideoSurface .
This action may require reading pixel data from some number of other VdpVideoSurface objects , depending on the type of compressed data and field / frame in question .
If the application wishes to display any form of OSD or user - interface , this must be created in a VdpOutputSurface .
This process begins with the creation of VdpBitmapSurface objects to contain the OSD / UI 's static data , such as individual glyphs .
VdpOutputSurface rendering functionality may be used to composite together various VdpBitmapSurfaces and VdpOutputSurfaces , into another VdpOutputSurface " VdpOutputSurface " .
Once video has been decoded , it must be post - processed .
This involves various steps such as color space conversion , de- interlacing , and other video adjustments .
This step is performed using an VdpVideoMixer object .
This object can not only perform the aforementioned video post - processing , but also composite the video with a number of VdpOutputSurfaces , thus allowing complex user interfaces to be built .
The final result is written into another VdpOutputSurface .
Note that at this point , the resultant VdpOutputSurface may be fed back through the above path , either using VdpOutputSurface rendering functionality , or as input to the VdpVideoMixer object .
Finally , the resultant VdpOutputSurface must be displayed on screen .
This is the job of the VdpPresentation Queue object .
Entry Point Retrieval
VDPAU is designed so that multiple implementations can be used without application changes .
For example , VDPAU could be hosted on X11 , or via direct GPU access .
The key technology behind this is the use of function pointers and a " get proc address " style API for all entry points .
Put another way , functions are not called directly via global symbols set up by the linker , but rather through pointers .
In practical terms , the Window System Integration Layer provides factory functions which not only create and return VdpDevice objects , but also a function pointer to a VdpGetProcAddress function , through which all entry point function pointers will be retrieved .
Philosophy
It is entirely possible to envisage a simpler scheme whereby such function pointers are hidden .
That is , the application would link against a wrapper library that exposed " real " functions .
The application would then call such functions directly , by symbol , like any other function .
The wrapper library would handle loading the appropriate back - end , and implementing a similar " get proc address " scheme internally .
However , the above scheme does not work well in the context of separated Core API and Window System Integration Layer .
In this scenario , one would require a separate wrapper library per Window System , since each Window System would have a different function name and prototype for the main factory function .
If an application then wanted to be Window System agnostic ( making final determination at run- time via some form of plugin ) , it may then need to link against two wrapper libraries , which would cause conflicts for all symbols other than the main factory function .
Another disadvantage of the wrapper library approach is the extra level of function call required ; the wrapper library would internally implement the existing " get proc address " and " function pointer " style dispatch anyway .
Exposing this directly to the application is slightly more efficient .
All VDPAU functionality is fully thread - safe ; any number of threads may call into any VDPAU functions at any time .
VDPAU may not be called from signal - handlers .
Note , however , that this simply guarantees that internal VDPAU state will not be corrupted by thread usage , and that crashes and deadlocks will not occur .
Completely arbitrary thread usage may not generate the results that an application desires .
In particular , care must be taken when multiple threads are performing operations on the same VDPAU objects .
VDPAU implementations guarantee correct flow of surface content through the rendering pipeline , but only when function calls that read from or write to a surface return to the caller prior to any thread calling any other function (s ) that read from or write to the surface .
Invoking multiple reads from a surface in parallel is OK .
Note that this restriction is placed upon VDPAU function invocations , and specifically not upon any back - end hardware 's physical rendering operations .
VDPAU implementations are expected to internally synchronize such hardware operations .
In a single - threaded application , the above restriction comes naturally ; each function call completes before it is possible to begin a new function call .
In a multi - threaded application , threads may need to be synchronized .
For example , consider the situation where :
Thread 1 is parsing compressed video data , passing them through a VdpDecoder object , and filling a ring - buffer of VdpVideoSurfaces
Thread 2 is consuming those VdpVideoSurfaces , and using a VdpVideoMixer to process them and composite them with UI .
In this case , the threads must synchronize to ensure that thread 1's call to VdpDecoderRender has returned prior to thread 2's call (s ) to VdpVideoMixerRender that use that specific surface .
This could be achieved using the following pseudo - code :
Finally , note that VDPAU makes no guarantees regarding any level of parallelism in any given implementation .
Put another way , use of multi- threading is not guaranteed to yield any performance gain , and in theory could even slightly reduce performance due to threading / synchronization overhead .
However , the intent of the threading requirements is to allow for e.g. video decoding and video mixer operations to proceed in parallel in hardware .
Given a ( presumably multi- threaded ) application that kept each portion of the hardware busy , this would yield a performance increase .
Surface Endianness
When dealing with surface content , i.e. the input / output of Put / GetBits functions , applications must take care to access memory in the correct fashion , so as to avoid endianness issues .
By established convention in the 3D graphics world , RGBA data is defined to be an array of 32 - bit pixels containing packed RGBA components , not as an array of bytes or interleaved RGBA components .
VDPAU follows this convention .
As such , applications are expected to access such surfaces as arrays of 32 - bit components ( i.e. using a 32 - bit pointer ) , and not as interleaved arrays of 8 - bit components ( i.e. using an 8 - bit pointer . )
Deviation from this convention will lead to endianness issues , unless appropriate care is taken .
The same convention is followed for some packed YCbCr formats such as VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y8U8V8A8 ; i.e. they are considered arrays of 32 - bit pixels , and hence should be accessed as such .
For YCbCr formats with chroma decimation and / or planar formats , however , this convention is awkward .
Therefore , formats such as VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_NV12 are defined as arrays of ( potentially interleaved ) byte - sized components .
Hence , applications should manipulate such data 8 - bits at a time , using 8 - bit pointers .
Note that one common usage for the input / output of Put / GetBits APIs is file I/O. Typical file I/O APIs treat all memory as a simple array of 8 - bit values .
This violates the rule requiring surface data to be accessed in its true native format .
As such , applications may be required to solve endianness issues .
Possible solutions include :
Authoring static UI data files according to the endianness of the target execution platform .
Conditionally byte - swapping Put / GetBits data buffers at run -time based on execution platform .
Note : Complete details regarding each surface format 's precise pixel layout is included with the documentation of each surface type .
For example , see VDP_RGBA_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8 .
Video Decoder Usage
VDPAU is a slice - level API .
Put another way , VDPAU implementations accept " slice " data from the bitstream , and perform all required processing of those slices ( e.g VLD decoding , IDCT , motion compensation , in - loop deblocking , etc. ) .
The client application is responsible for :
Extracting the slices from the bitstream ( e.g. parsing / demultiplexing container formats , scanning the data to determine slice start positions and slice sizes ) .
Parsing various bitstream headers / structures ( e.g. sequence header , sequence parameter set , picture parameter set , entry point structures , etc. )
Various fields from the parsed header structures needs to be provided to VDPAU alongside the slice bitstream in a " picture info " structure .
Surface management ( e.g. H.264 DPB processing , display re-ordering )
It is recommended that applications pass solely the slice data to VDPAU ; specifically that any header data structures be excluded from the portion of the bitstream passed to VDPAU .
VDPAU implementations must operate correctly if non-slice data is included , at least for formats employing start codes to delimit slice data .
However , any extra data may need to be uploaded to hardware for parsing thus lowering performance , and / or , in the worst case , may even overflow internal buffers that are sized solely for slice data .
The exact data that should be passed to VDPAU is detailed below for each supported format :
MPEG - 1 and MPEG -2
Include all slices beginning with start codes 0x00000101 through 0x000001AF .
The slice start code must be included for all slices .
Include all NALs with nal_unit_type of 1 or 5 ( coded slice of non-IDR / IDR picture respectively ) .
The complete slice start code ( including 0x000001 prefix ) must be included for all slices , even when the prefix is not included in the bitstream .
Note that if desired :
The slice start code prefix may be included in a separate bitstream buffer array entry to the actual slice data extracted from the bitstream .
Multiple bitstream buffer array entries ( e.g. one per slice ) may point at the same physical data storage for the slice start code prefix .
VC - 1 Simple and Main Profile
VC - 1 simple / main profile bitstreams always consist of a single slice per picture , and do not use start codes to delimit pictures .
Instead , the container format must indicate where each picture begins / ends .
As such , no slice start codes should be included in the data passed to VDPAU ; simply pass in the exact data from the bitstream .
Header information contained in the bitstream should be parsed by the application and passed to VDPAU using the " picture info " data structure ; this header information explicitly must not be included in the bitstream data passed to VDPAU for this encoding format .
VC - 1 Advanced Profile
Include all slices beginning with start codes 0x0000010D ( frame ) , 0x0000010C ( field ) or 0x0000010B ( slice ) .
The slice start code should be included in all cases .
Some VC - 1 advanced profile streams do not contain slice start codes ; again , the container format must indicate where picture data begins and ends .
In this case , pictures are assumed to be progressive and to contain a single slice .
It is highly recommended that applications detect this condition , and add the missing start codes to the bitstream passed to VDPAU .
However , VDPAU implementations must allow bitstreams with missing start codes , and act as if a 0x0000010D ( frame ) start code had been present .
Note that pictures containing multiple slices , or interlace streams , must contain a complete set of slice start codes in the original bitstream ; without them , it is not possible to correctly parse and decode the stream .
The bitstream passed to VDPAU should contain all original emulation prevention bytes present in the original bitstream ; do not remove these from the bitstream .
MPEG - 4 Part 2 and DivX
Include all slices beginning with start codes 0x000001B6 .
The slice start code must be included for all slices .
H.265/HEVC - High Efficiency Video Codec
Include all video coding layer ( VCL ) NAL units , with nal_unit_type values of 0 ( TRAIL_N ) through 31 ( RSV_VCL31 ) inclusive .
In addition to parsing and providing NAL units , an H.265/HEVC decoder application using VDPAU for decoding must parse certain values of the first slice segment header in a VCL NAL unit and provide it through VdpPictureInfoHEVC .
Please see the documentation for VdpPictureInfoHEVC below for further details .
The complete slice start code ( including the 0x000001 prefix ) must be included for all slices , even when the prefix is not included in the bitstream .
Note that if desired :
The slice start code prefix may be included in a separate bitstream buffer array entry to the actual slice data extracted from the bitstream .
Multiple bitstream buffer array entries ( e.g. one per slice ) may point at the same physical data storage for the slice start code prefix .
Video Mixer Usage
VdpVideoSurface Content
Each VdpVideoSurface is expected to contain an entire frame 's - worth of data , irrespective of whether an interlaced of progressive sequence is being decoded .
Depending on the exact encoding structure of the compressed video stream , the application may need to call VdpDecoderRender twice to fill a single VdpVideoSurface .
When the stream contains an encoded progressive frame , or a " frame coded " interlaced field - pair , a single VdpDecoderRender call will fill the entire surface .
When the stream contains separately encoded interlaced fields , two VdpDecoderRender calls will be required ; one for the top field , and one for the bottom field .
Implementation note :
When VdpDecoderRender renders an interlaced field , this operation must not disturb the content of the other field in the surface .
VdpVideoMixer Surface List
An video stream is logically composed of a sequence of fields .
An example is shown below , in display order , assuming top field first :
t0 b0 t1 b1 t2 b2 t3 b3 t4 b4 t5 b5 t6 b6 t7 b7 t8 b8 t9 b9
The canonical usage is to call VdpVideoMixerRender once for decoded field , in display order , to yield one post - processed frame for display .
For each call to VdpVideoMixerRender , the field to be processed should be provided as the video_surface_current parameter .
To enable operation of advanced de-interlacing algorithms and / or post - processing algorithms , some past and / or future surfaces should be provided as context .
These are provided in the video_surface_past and video_surface_future lists .
In general , these lists may contain any number of surfaces .
Specific implementations may have specific requirements determining the minimum required number of surfaces for optimal operation , and the maximum number of useful surfaces , beyond which surfaces are not used .
It is recommended that in all cases other than plain bob / weave , at least 2 past and 1 future field be provided .
Note that it is entirely possible , in general , for any of the VdpVideoMixer post - processing steps other than de-interlacing to require access to multiple input fields / frames .
For example , an motion - sensitive noise - reduction algorithm .
For example , when processing field t4 , the VdpVideoMixerRender parameters may contain the following values , if the application chose to provide 3 fields of context for both the past and future :
current_picture_structure : VDP_VIDEO_MIXER_PICTURE_STRUCTURE_TOP_FIELD
past : [ b3 , t3 , b2 ] current : t4 future : [ b4 , t5 , b5 ]
Note that for both the past / future lists , array index 0 represents the field temporally closest to current , in display order .
The VdpVideoMixerRender parameter current_picture_structure applies to video_surface_current .
The picture structure for the other surfaces will be automatically derived from that for the current picture .
The derivation algorithm is extremely simple ; the concatenated list past / current / future is simply assumed to have an alternating top / bottom pattern throughout .
Continuing the example above , subsequent calls to VdpVideoMixerRender would provide the following sets of parameters :
current_picture_structure : VDP_VIDEO_MIXER_PICTURE_STRUCTURE_BOTTOM_FIELD
past : [ t4 , b3 , t3 ] current : b4 future : [ t5 , b5 , t6 ]
then :
current_picture_structure : VDP_VIDEO_MIXER_PICTURE_STRUCTURE_TOP_FIELD
past : [ b4 , t4 , b3 ] current : t5 future : [ b5 , t6 , b7 ]
In other words , the concatenated list of past / current / future frames simply forms a window that slides through the sequence of decoded fields .
It is syntactically legal for an application to choose not to provide a particular entry in the past or future lists .
In this case , the " slot " in the surface list must be filled with the special value VDP_INVALID_HANDLE , to explicitly indicate that the picture is missing ; do not simply shuffle other surfaces together to fill in the gap .
Note that entries should only be omitted under special circumstances , such as failed decode due to bitstream error during picture header parsing , since missing entries will typically cause advanced de-interlacing algorithms to experience significantly degraded operation .
Specific examples for different de-interlacing types are presented below .
Weave De-interlacing
Weave de-interlacing is the act of interleaving the lines of two temporally adjacent fields to form a frame for display .
To disable de-interlacing for progressive streams , simply specify current_picture_structure as VDP_VIDEO_MIXER_PICTURE_STRUCTURE_FRAME
; no de-interlacing will be applied .
Weave de-interlacing for interlaced streams is identical to disabling de-interlacing , as describe immediately above , because each VdpVideoSurface ; Video Surface object already contains an entire frame 's worth ( i.e. two fields ) of picture data .
Inverse telecine is disabled when using weave de-interlacing .
Weave de-interlacing produces one output frame for each input frame .
The application should make one VdpVideoMixerRender call per pair of decoded fields , or per decoded frame .
Weave de-interlacing requires no entries in the past / future lists .
All implementations must support weave de-interlacing .
Bob De-interlacing
Bob de-interlacing is the act of vertically scaling a single field to the size of a single frame .
To achieve bob de-interlacing , simply provide a single field as video_surface_current , and set current_picture_structure appropriately , to indicate whether a top or bottom field was provided .
Inverse telecine is disabled when using bob de-interlacing .
Bob de-interlacing produces one output frame for each input field .
The application should make one VdpVideoMixerRender call per decoded field .
Bob de-interlacing requires no entries in the past / future lists .
Bob de-interlacing is the default when no advanced method is requested and enabled .
Advanced de-interlacing algorithms may fall back to bob e.g. when required past / future fields are missing .
All implementations must support bob de-interlacing .
Advanced De-interlacing
Operation of both temporal and temporal - spatial de-interlacing is identical ; the only difference is the internal processing the algorithm performs in generating the output frame .
These algorithms use various advanced processing on the pixels of both the current and various past / future fields in order to determine how best to de-interlacing individual portions of the image .
Inverse telecine may be enabled when using advanced de-interlacing .
Advanced de-interlacing produces one output frame for each input field .
The application should make one VdpVideoMixerRender call per decoded field .
Advanced de-interlacing requires entries in the past / future lists .
Availability of advanced de-interlacing algorithms is implementation dependent .
De-interlacing Rate
For all de-interlacing algorithms except weave , a choice may be made to call VdpVideoMixerRender for either each decoded field , or every second decoded field .
If VdpVideoMixerRender is called for every decoded field , the generated post - processed frame rate is equal to the decoded field rate .
Put another way , the generated post - processed nominal field rate is equal to 2 x the decoded field rate .
This is standard practice .
If VdpVideoMixerRender is called for every second decoded field ( say every top field ) , the generated post - processed frame rate is half to the decoded field rate .
This mode of operation is thus referred to as " half - rate " .
Implementations may choose whether to support half - rate de-interlacing or not .
Regular full - rate de-interlacing should be supported by any supported advanced de-interlacing algorithm .
The descriptions of de-interlacing algorithms above assume that regular ( not half - rate ) operation is being performed , when detailing the number of VdpVideoMixerRender calls .
Recall that the concatenation of past / current / future surface lists simply forms a window into the stream of decoded fields .
To achieve standard de-interlacing , the window is slid through the list of decoded fields one field at a time , and a call is made to VdpVideoMixerRender for each movement of the window .
To achieve half - rate de-interlacing , the window is slid through the* list of decoded fields two fields at a time , and a call is made to VdpVideoMixerRender for each movement of the window .
Inverse Telecine
Assuming the implementation supports it , inverse telecine may be enabled alongside any advanced de-interlacing algorithm .
Inverse telecine is never active for bob or weave .
Operation of VdpVideoMixerRender with inverse telecine active is identical to the basic operation mechanisms describe above in every way ; all inverse telecine processing is performed internally to the VdpVideoMixer .
In particular , there is no provision way for VdpVideoMixerRender to indicate when identical input fields have been observed , and consequently identical output frames may have been produced .
De-interlacing ( and inverse telecine ) may be applied to streams that are marked as being progressive .
This will allow detection of , and correct de-interlacing of , mixed interlace / progressive streams , bad edits , etc .
To implement de-interlacing / inverse - telecine on progressive material , simply treat the stream of decoded frames as a stream of decoded fields , apply any telecine flags ( see the next section ) , and then apply de-interlacing to those fields as described above .
Implementations are free to determine whether inverse telecine operates in conjunction with half - rate de-interlacing or not .
It should always operate with regular de-interlacing , when advertized .
Telecine ( Pull - Down ) Flags
Some media delivery formats , e.g. DVD - Video , include flags that are intended to modify the decoded field sequence before display .
This allows e.g. 24 p content to be encoded at 48i , which saves space relative to a 60i encoded stream , but still displayed at 60i , to match target consumer display equipment .
If the inverse telecine option is not activated in the VdpVideoMixer , these flags should be ignored , and the decoded fields passed directly to VdpVideoMixerRender as detailed above .
However , to make full use of the inverse telecine feature , these flags should be applied to the field stream , yielding another field stream with some repeated fields , before passing the field stream to VdpVideoMixerRender .
In this scenario , the sliding window mentioned in the descriptions above applies to the field stream after application of flags .
Extending the API
Enumerations and Other Constants
VDPAU defines a number of enumeration types .
When modifying VDPAU , existing enumeration constants must continue to exist ( although they may be deprecated ) , and do so in the existing order .
The above discussion naturally applies to " manually " defined enumerations , using pre-processor macros , too .
Structures
In most case , VDPAU includes no provision for modifying existing structure definitions , although they may be deprecated .
New structures may be created , together with new API entry points or feature / attribute / parameter values , to expose new functionality .
A few structures are considered plausible candidates for future extension .
Such structures include a version number as the first field , indicating the exact layout of the client - provided data .
When changing such structures , the old structure must be preserved and a new structure created .
This allows applications built against the old version of the structure to continue to interoperate .
For example , to extend the VdpProcamp structure , define a new VdpProcamp1 and update VdpGenerateCSCMatrix to take the new structure as an argument .
Document in a comment that the caller must fill the struct_version field with the value 1 .
VDPAU implementations should use the struct_version field to determine which version of the structure the application was built against .
Note that you cannot simply increment the value of VDP_PROCAMP_VERSION because applications recompiled against a newer version of vdpau.h but that have not been updated to use the new structure must still report that they 're using version 0 .
Note that the layouts of VdpPictureInfo structures are defined by their corresponding VdpDecoder Profile numbers , so no struct_version field is needed for them .
This layout includes the size of the structure , so new profiles that extend existing functionality may incorporate the old VdpPictureInfo as a substructure , but may not modify existing VdpPictureInfo structures .
Functions
Existing functions may not be modified , although they may be deprecated .
New functions may be added at will .
Note the enumeration requirements when modifying the enumeration that defines the list of entry points .
Display Preemption
Please note that the display may be preempted away from VDPAU at any time .

LOS ANGELES -- Microsoft Corp. gave the first extensive public demonstration of the next release of its Windows operating system as it seeks to avoid some of the stumbles that occurred with the last version , Windows Vista .
At a technical conference here , the Redmond , Wash . , company also provided programmers with a test version of the software , dubbed Windows 7 .
The move is an important step to drum up support among independent developers .
Microsoft said it would also further embrace a growing shift towards online software by making a future Web - based version of its Office suite of productivity applications available free .
It is a move to counter efforts by Google Inc. and others to encroach on Microsoft 's turf with free word processing , spreadsheet and other programs .
Microsoft 's Windows Vista received a critical drubbing when it was released nearly two years ago .
Vista was criticized for the sluggish performance of the software and initial incompatibilities with digital cameras and some other devices .
Microsoft says the incompatibilities have largely been corrected with updates to Windows Vista .
At the same time , Windows Vista endured attacks from rival Apple Inc. in a long - running advertising campaign for Apple 's Macintosh computers .
Microsoft recently began an ad campaign for Windows , partly to correct the negative perception of the software .
Flash Storage and Servers
In the comments on my post about the Dell PowerEdge T105 server [ 1 ] there is some discussion of the internal USB port ( which allows the use of a USB flash device for booting which is connected inside the case ) .
This is a really nice feature of the Dell server and something that would be useful if it was in more machines .
However I believe that it would be better to have flash storage with a SATA interface on the motherboard .
The cost of medium size flash storage ( eg 4G ) in the USB format is not overly great , if soldered to the motherboard or connected to a daughter - board the incremental price for the server would be very small .
Dell servers shipped with a minimum of an 80G SATA disk last time I checked , it seems quite likely to me that Dell could reduce the prices of their servers by providing flash storage on the motherboard and having no hard disk .
It seems likely to me that there is a significant number of people who do n’t want the default hard drive that ships with a Dell server .
The 80G disk that came with my PowerEdge is currently gathering dust on a shelf , it was far to small to be of any use in that machine and Dell ’s prices for bigger disks were outrageous so I replaced the default disk with a pair of big disks as soon as the server had passed some basic burn - in tests .
Most servers that I run fall into one of two categories , machines which primarily do computation tasks and need little storage space or IO capacity ( in which case 4G of flash would do nicely ) and machines which have databases , backups , virtual machine images , and other big things ( in which case anything less than 160G is silly and less than 500G makes no economic sense in today ’s market ) .
Note that for a machine with small storage requirements I would rather have a 4G flash device than an 80G disk , I am inclined to trust flash to not die but not trust a single disk , two 80G disks means more noise , heat dissipation , and expense .
According to comments on my previous post VMWare ESX requires a USB boot device , so if VMWare could be booted with a motherboard based flash device then that would be an ideal configuration for VMWare .
In some mailing list discussions I ’ve seen concern raised about the reliability of permanently connected USB devices , while I ’ve only encountered USB problems related to buggy hardware and drivers other people have had problems with the electrical connection .
So it seems that motherboard based flash could be expected to increase the reliability of VMWare servers .
The down - side to having flash permanently attached to the motherboard is of course the impossibility of moving the boot device to different hardware .
In terms of recovering from failure restoring a few gig of flash storage from backup is easy enough .
The common debugging option of connecting a hard drive to another machine to fix boot problems would be missed , but I think that the positive aspects of this idea outweigh the negative – and it would of course be an option to not boot from flash .
If anyone knows of a tower server that is reasonably quiet , has ECC RAM and a usable amount of flash storage on the motherboard ( 2G would be a bare minimum , 4G or 8G would be preferred ) then please let me know .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Mice fed junk food for nine months showed signs of developing the abnormal brain tangles strongly associated with Alzheimer ’s disease , a Swedish researcher said on Friday .
A meal consisting of a Quarter Pounder hamburger , french fries and soft - drink is pictured at a McDonald 's restaurant in Los Angeles , California July 23 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Prouser
The findings , which come from a series of published papers by a researcher at Sweden ’s Karolinska Institutet , show how a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol could increase the risk of the most common type of dementia .
“ On examining the brains of these mice , we found a chemical change not unlike that found in the Alzheimer brain , ” Susanne Akterin , a researcher at the Karolinska Institutet ’s Alzheimer ’s Disease Research Center , who led the study , said in a statement .
“ We now suspect that a high intake of fat and cholesterol in combination with genetic factors ... can adversely affect several brain substances , which can be a contributory factor in the development of Alzheimer ’s . ”
Alzheimer ’s disease is incurable and is the most common form of dementia among older people .
It affects the regions of the brain involving thought , memory and language .
While the most advanced drugs have focused on removing clumps of beta amyloid protein that forms plaques in the brain , researchers are also now looking at therapies to address the toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build - up of the protein tau .
In her research , Akterin focused on a gene variant called apoE4 , found in 15 to 20 percent of people and which is a known risk factor for Alzheimer ’s .
The gene is involved in the transport of cholesterol .
She studied mice genetically engineered to mimic the effect of the variant gene in humans , and which were fed a diet rich in fat , sugar and cholesterol for nine months -- meals representing the nutritional content of fast food .
These mice showed chemical changes in their brains , indicating an abnormal build - up of the protein tau as well as signs that cholesterol in food reduced levels of another protein called Arc involved in memory storage , Akterin said .
“ All in all , the results give some indication of how Alzheimer ’s can be prevented , but more research in this field needs to be done before proper advice can be passed on to the general public , ” she said .
MOSCOW — A new chill is spreading among Russian bloggers following the death of the journalist - owner of an opposition website .
While opposition viewpoints are rarely presented in Russian newspapers these days ( and even less frequently on television ) , the Internet has remained a place where Russians of all ideological stripes are able to express themselves .
But following the mysterious death of Web journalist Magomed Yevloyev and the prosecution of disaffected bloggers , there are fears that authorities are trying to squeeze shut that remaining outlet for freewheeling debate .
The issue came sharply into focus with the August 31 killing of Yevloyev , the founder of a popular site called Ingushetia.org that reports on human rights abuses in the restive southern Russian region of Ingushetia .
After he landed at the airport in the Ingushetian town of Nazran , a police convoy picked him up .
Less than an hour later , he was delivered to the hospital with a fatal bullet wound to his head .
Prosecutors have suggested the shooting was an accident , perhaps the result of Yevloyev trying to grab an officer 's gun , though his supporters say it was punishment for his muckraking site .
" It was a premeditated murder , " concludes Musa Pliyev , a lawyer for Ingushetia.org .
Russians have enjoyed unfettered freedom of speech on the Internet — the news site run by opposition head Garry Kasparov serves up stinging criticism of the state , while Russian bloggers of every political persuasion congregate on LiveJournal .
And there have been grand promises that the Internet will remain unrestricted , such as a June pronouncement by President Dmitry Medvedev that it should be protected from interference by authorities .
But according to activists , interference is already a fact .
Andrei Richter , head of Moscow 's Media Law and Policy Institute , says there is no nationwide offensive such as China 's Golden Shield Project , sometimes called the Great Firewall of China , which blocks access to a raft of news and blogging sites .
However , Russia 's regional administrations are taking the initiative and charging bloggers who criticize the regime .
They 're " testing the waters , seeing which statutes work better in regulating the Internet , " Richter says .
" It 's a very dangerous trend . "
Russia 's rulers ostensibly have little reason to worry about Net users .
United Russia , the political party of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Medvedev , overwhelmingly dominates parliament and the country 's political discourse , and Russians are happy with their increased affluence under Putin .
Still , that support could fade if , say , Russia 's economy were to falter .
" Now the government is realizing that the Internet is becoming political , " says Clothilde le Coz , head of the Internet desk at Reporters Without Borders in Paris .
" It 's a means for people to gather and spread a message , for example against the government , and that 's a problem . "
Ingushetia.org , founded in 2001 , documents abuses that rights organizations say are endemic in Ingushetia , in particular graft , and the abduction and killing of residents by security forces .
Authorities often justify the killings in the name of a struggle with separatists and Islamists , although there has been a backlash .
The Moscow Helsinki Group , a nongovernmental watchdog group , warned this month that Ingushetia is verging on a civil war .
Ingushetia.org frequently ranks as one of Russia 's most - viewed sites .
" We 're the only site that talks about what is really going on in Ingushetia , " says Roza Malsagova , its editor - in - chief , who oversees five editors and around 10 freelancers .
In recent years , Ingushetia.org 's employees have come under increasing pressure .
The president of Ingushetia , Murat Zyazikov , has said the site aims to destabilize the region and accused it of " publishing materials of an extremist , anti-Russian bent . "
Ingushetia.org 's editors and lawyers have been subject to criminal charges and searches and are treated with deep suspicion ; they communicate with each other using the Internet because they say their calls are monitored .
In April , a court ordered that the site , which formerly used the Russian domain " .ru " and was called Ingushetiya .ru , be shut down for inciting racial hatred .
The site 's lawyers said last week that a regional organization that manages domain names deleted its registration , though it immediately reappeared using the .org suffix .
And in August , Malsagova fled to Paris with her three teenage sons because she feared for her life .
Bloggers are another group that seems increasingly at risk ; two who criticized police and the special services face charges of inciting hatred .
In the case of Dmitry Solovyov from the Kemerovo region , court documents cite five blog posts critical of law enforcers , though the posts often quote material from other sites or repeat anti-Kremlin sentiments that are hardly novel .
None calls for violence against law enforcers .
" You can find worse statements than these all the time on the Internet .
I do n't understand why I 've had these problems , " says Solovyov , a graduate student .
One possible explanation :
He 's a member of an opposition movement , Oborona .
Solovyov was reluctant to discuss the case as he said his calls are under surveillance .
Savva Terentyev , from Syktyvkar , in the Komi republic , received a one - year suspended sentence in July after posting a comment on a blog calling for Russian policemen to be set on fire .
A day after receiving a recent inquiry from a reporter , Terentyev deleted his blog .
In Ingushetia , Yevloyev 's death continues to reverberate .
It sparked protests , and his relatives , steeped in the traditions of the Caucasus , declared " blood revenge " on the local president and police chief , meaning they intend to answer a killing with a killing .

What do you do when someone in your household catches a cold ?
If you 're like me , you run for the medicine cabinet and start megadosing yourself with vitamin C. Everyone knows this is the best way to stave off a cold .
Everyone also seems to think that vitamins are like spinach for Popeye :
Whether you need them or not , taking extra vitamins when you do n't necessarily have a deficiency is perceived to bestow some sort of super - health , as if you can somehow be even healthier than healthy .
If you take any vitamin supplement , and you do not have a diagnosed vitamin deficiency , please listen carefully to the following .
The idea that vitamin C is a wonder drug for preventing colds and other illnesses became widely popular around 1970 , due largely to some books written by one of our greatest scientists , Linus Pauling .
Along with Marie Curie , Pauling shares the distinction of being one of only two people to receive Nobel Prizes in two different fields .
He received his first in chemistry in 1954 for his pioneering work characterizing the nature of chemical bonds .
He received the Peace Prize in 1962 for his work warning of the dangers of nuclear weapons proliferation and radioactive fallout .
Ironically , it was this type of activism that had almost prevented his being able to travel to Stockholm to accept his first prize :
In those days , the United States was in the habit of denying passports to citizens who were sufficiently outspoken against nuclear weapons .
Pauling 's contributions to 20th century science are inestimable .
He described the structure of the atomic nucleus .
He was a key player in the theorized , and later proven , helical structure of DNA .
He was practically the founding father of the whole science of molecular biology .
He was even involved in the development of one of the first commercially available electric cars , the 1959 Henney Kilowatt .
So how is it possible that such an accomplished genius could be fundamentally wrong for much of his career ?
Let 's set aside the notion that a scientifically brilliant mind must always be a rational , objective , and unbiased mind , and look at Pauling 's later writings .
In 1970 , he published a book called Vitamin C and the Common Cold , in which he outlined the concept he called orthomolecular medicine .
Orthomolecular means the " right molecule " .
Its central thesis is that megadoses of vitamin C prevent colds and can prevent or treat other conditions .
He expanded this to include cancer when he wrote 1979's Vitamin C and Cancer .
In 1986 he published How to Feel Better and Live Longer , in which he broadened all his concepts and claimed that megadoses of all vitamins would improve your overall health , would slow aging , and increase your enjoyment of life .
It 's important to note that orthomolecular medicine is not a concept shared by responsible doctors or dietitians ; it is squarely in the alternative medicine camp .
The Mayo Clinic tested Pauling 's claims about treating cancer with vitamin C in three different randomized controlled trials , all of which showed no beneficial effect .
Pauling spent years passionately trying in vain to discredit these trials , which created something of a gap between himself and mainstream medical science .
In fact , despite the staggering importance of his earlier contributions to science , by the end of his life Dr. Pauling was largely regarded as a crank by his former colleagues , much like Nikola Tesla , by some accounts .
There have been at least 30 well - performed controlled trials to find out whether vitamin C at various dosages can prevent colds , or reduce their severity .
What these studies have determined is that vitamin C has no preventive value at all ; you 're just as likely to catch a cold if you take daily megadoses as you are if you take nothing at all .
A few of these trials did find small reductions in the severity or duration of the colds , but most trials did not show even this small effect .
I know all of this , but every time the cold and flu season comes around , I still catch myself eyeing that vitamin C bottle .
I 'm like the jungle native who 's been baptised by the missionaries , but whenever the volcano erupts , I still run to the stone pagan idol .
My own experience is that I 've never gotten sick whenever I 've been regularly taking vitamin C .
And , this is the same experience reported by a lot of people .
So it would seem that our own experiences support what Dr. Pauling was saying , and disputes what testing has revealed .
We all have to believe our own eyes , and to believe our own first - hand experiences , right ?
Well , yes , but we also have to understand the way our brain interprets our experiences .
Practically the whole reason for the science of psychology is that what we think and feel is not necessarily 100 % translated to the real world .
It 's certainly possible to misinterpret something someone tells us , so is n't it also possible to misinterpret other experiences ?
Well , we do misinterpret our own perceptions and our own experiences , and we all do it every day .
Is it possible that you did have a minor cold , but since you were taking vitamin C the thought never entered your mind that it could be a cold ?
Maybe you just attributed it to seasonal allergies , and even though the facts are that you got a cold while taking vitamin C , your own perception confirms that the vitamin C was 100 % effective .
Is it possible that you do n't exactly remember the number of colds you got last year ?
Of course it is .
And , perceptual biases aside , is there any chance that you would n't have happened to catch a cold anyway ?
Of course that 's possible too .
Thus , you can't reasonably consider your own experience as evidence that vitamin C is effective against colds .
Your only evidence is anecdotal and unreliable due to a variety of perceptual phenomena ; and in any case your own test of vitamin C was an uncontrolled , unblinded test with no statistical validity .
But you 're not alone .
A lot of people believe that vitamins will prevent colds , and the alternative medicine industry has always been quick to capitalize on this .
There 's a product called Airborne that is a repackaging of an ancient Chinese remedy called yin chiao .
It contains undisclosed quantities of a few herbs and vitamins , including vitamins A , C , and E .
Their marketing slogan is " Invented by a schoolteacher " , which for some reason people view as meritorious , even though all it really means is " Invented by someone with no medical background whatsoever " .
For a decade they made false advertising claims that their product could prevent and treat colds .
Sure enough , eventually the law caught up with them , and fined them $ 23 million and ordered them to refund the purchase of anyone who ever bought their product .
They 're still in business , although they now make the claim that Airborne boosts your immune system .
As any doctor will tell you , " immune system boosting " is pure pseudoscience .
It 's medically meaningless , but that 's a whole other subject that we 'll examine in a future episode .
Not only is there a lack of evidence that these products have any beneficial effects , there is well established evidence that they can be dangerous .
If you take the recommended dose of Airborne to fight a cold , you 're taking enough of a vitamin C overdose to put yourself at risk of kidney stones .
Although the popular folk wisdom teaches that extra vitamins are simply excreted in the urine , this is largely untrue .
Vitamin overdosing is called hypervitaminosis or vitamin toxicity , and can lead to serious effects .
Hypervitaminosis
A can lead to birth defects , liver problems , osteoporosis , skin problems , and hair loss .
Hypervitaminosis D can cause dehydration , vomiting , anorexia , hypercalcemia and kidney damage including kidney stones .
Hypervitaminosis E can lead to blood problems including high cholesterol and can act as an anticoagulant .
It should be noted that to be at risk of any of these conditions , you would need to significantly overdose over a long period of time .
Brief or modest overdoses of any vitamin supplement are unlikely to cause problems .
Interestingly , vitamin K is an effective treatment for many hypervitaminosis toxicity conditions .
A common criticism I receive is " Why should I believe you , when upstanding companies like Airborne , and practically everyone else in the world , tells me I should take vitamins ? "
Well , I hope you do n't trust me .
I hope that if you 're truly interested , you 'll ask a medical doctor .
And by " doctor " I do n't mean a naturopath , a health food store clerk , or anyone else who's in the business of selling you vitamin supplements .
The simple fact is that nearly everyone who eats anything close to a balanced diet in any developed country is extremely unlikely to have a vitamin deficiency .
Thus , there is no plausible benefit to vitamin supplementation for general health or wellness .

23 Tubes 1 Bowl
Over the years I ’ve ended up with quite a few sample - size tubes of toothpaste .
I dislike the strong , lingering flavors of most of these toothpastes , so I normally use Tom ’s of Maine ( or Trader Joe ’s equivalent , but not Tom ’s of Finland ) plain mint toothpaste .
As a result , I had a bunch of old tubes which were past expiration and needing to be thrown out .
23 tubes ( and four small sample packs ) , in fact .
Before throwing them out I decided to squeeze them all into one bowl .
Next I stirred it all together , found that a spoon will almost stand up in it , then put some on my toothbrush and brushed my teeth with it .
This multi-sample toothpaste concoction did n’t taste bad , but was overwhelmingly mint backed by a few other unidentifiable herbs .
Even after rinsing my mouth a number of times the taste still lingers , but this matches my experience ( and complaint ) with all of the Colgate , Crest , etc toothpastes I ’ve tried in the past .
Now to figure out how to dispose of it .
Maybe dumping it in the trash then attempting to wash the bowl …
Here ’s an index of the photos taken of the 23 Tubes 1 Bowl ‘ experiment ’ :
For reference , the following brands / models of toothpaste were used :

Some fans in China relish how the album discomfits the establishment .
" Rock ' n ' roll , as a weapon , is an invisible bomb , " says one .

Democracy is a touchy subject in this country .
Elections are limited to votes for selected village - level officials , and senior leaders are all chosen in secret within the Communist Party .
Many Chinese wish for greater say in their government .
But others -- including some rockers -- think too much democracy too quickly could lead to chaos , and they resent foreign efforts to push the issue .
Mr. Chen , the guitarist , says the " Chinese Democracy " album title suggests " they do n't understand China well " and are " just trying to stir up publicity . "
{ snip }
The new album 's title track , already released as a single , begins with eerie , high - pitched noises that sound vaguely like chattering in Chinese .
In the song 's three verses , Mr. Rose sings of " missionaries , " " visionaries " and " sitting in a Chinese stew . "
The overall message is unclear , but his most provocative lines are n't .
" Blame it on the Falun Gong .
They 've seen the end and you can't hold on now , " Mr. Rose sings .
It is a reference to the spiritual movement that Beijing has outlawed as an " illegal cult " and vowed to crush .

Fresh barriers went up after a Shanghai concert in March by the singer Bjork , who punctuated her song " Declare Independence " with shouts of " Tibet ! "
Officials thought it sounded like agitation against Beijing 's rule of the restive Himalayan region .
In new rules issued later , they threatened to hold promoters responsible for performers who violated its laws , " including situations that harm the sovereignty of the country . "

People today use the term " bigot " to mean anyone who opposes the idea that we can mix all different creeds , beliefs , opinions and heritages in one big melting pot and come up with something workable .
Of course , since preserving different things by separating them is tolerance itself , this is a backward usage .
But the word does apply to those who blindly refuse to believe any way but their own is the only way for all people on earth .
Rebellion ... it 's so easy .
Blame someone else , like the government , and take your mind off your problems .
Do we understand Tibet here in America , or in Iceland ?
Do we understand China ?
We 're not Chinese ; why are we making moral judgments about them ?
Life is better when people mind their own business except when there 's a clear threat .
Yes , in Tibet there is ; here , there is not .
We need to fix our own houses before we tell other people what to do .
America roils with social unrest , discontent , slackerdom and other signs of a failing empire .
China ?
Tibet ?
But they 're so easy .
Shout " Tibet ! " and suddenly you 're an individual , not part of the crowd .
A rebel .
You do n't stand for everything that 's now , including what 's wrong .
You 'll show them .
Be against what is .
It makes you look cool .
You 're now the ultimate altruist , a Jesus figure concerned with the welfare of the downtrodden , and obviously ( obviously ! ) well informed .
Even if you do n't know what you stand for , except vague terms like " justice for all " and " peace in our time . "
No shit , Sherlock ; everyone likes those ideas .
But what do they mean ?
The defining , in real world detail , is the hard part that rock star wannabes avoid .
Personally , I think it 's kind of a dickhead move to go to some foreign country and start telling them how they 're wrong and you 're right .
They like you for your music ... and if your ideas were any good , you'd be famous for those , not the backward logic of getting famous for music and then having people treat you like a guru .
You 're stuck for months inside a cramped tin can with a bunch of total strangers , with no gravity , fresh food or World of Warcraft .
And yeah , you 're forced to drink the recycled sweat of your fellow astronauts ( or your own urine ) .
But that does n't mean you can't have your own stylin ' bachelor ( or bachelorette ) pad in space .
Check out the new digs being delivered to the ISS .
Let 's be honest for a minute - living on the ISS pretty much sucks .
It 's like the college dorm from hell ( after some frat boys broke in and stole all the gravity for the weekend ) .
Terrible food .
Noisy .
Some random people you barely know constantly breathing down your neck .
And absolutely zero privacy .
If it was n't for the sheer awesomeness of being in space , no one would go .
NASA spent $ 30 million developing new private rooms for the orbital platform in an effort to make things more bearable , and it looks like they succeeded admirably .
Four of the new rooms will be installed ( two were delivered by Endeavor , with two more soon to come ) .
Each one is tiny , like more of a closet than a room , but it 's remarkably soundproof and has a door .
There are hooks for a sleeping bag , a foldout laptop table ( with foot anchors , so astronauts can sit comfortably ) , and velcro on the walls for attaching family photos and girly calendars .
Even though these new ISS cabins are roughly the size of a bathroom stall , I think they will represent a huge improvement in quality of life for the astronauts .
After all , they 've got 250 lbs. of insulating polyethlene to protect them from dangerous solar flare radiation .
What bachelor pad can boast that ?
Sadly , the ISS cabin doors do n't lock , and I do n't think NASA has developed a zero - G version of the sock - on - the - doorknob .

By viewing evolution as the motion of energy flows toward a stationary state ( entropy ) , evolution can be explained by the second law of thermodynamics , a law which conventionally describes physical systems .
In this view , a cheetah serves as an energy transfer mechanism , and beneficial mutations allow the animal to transfer more energy within its environment , helping even out the energy .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Often , physics and biology appear as different worlds , from a scientist ’s point of view .
Each discipline has its own language and concepts , and physicists and biologists tend to look at the world in different ways – not least being from inanimate and animate perspectives .
But at the core of these two sciences is the concept of motion .
As a biological ecosystem evolves by the process of natural selection , it disperses energy , increases entropy , and moves toward a stationary state with respect to its surroundings .
Similarly , as energy flows in various physical phenomena , they too cause biological systems to move toward stationary states with respect to their surroundings , in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics .
Whether an object is animate or inanimate , science does not seem to make a distinction .
In both cases , energy flows toward a stationary state , or a state of equilibrium , in the absence of a high - energy external source .
In this way , explain Ville Kaila and Arto Annila of the University of Helsinki , the second law of thermodynamics can be written as an equation of motion to describe evolution , and , in doing so , connect biology with physics .
Their study , “ Natural selection for least action , ” is published in the Proceedings of The Royal Society A .
The second law of thermodynamics , which states that the energy of a system tends to even itself out with its surroundings ( “ a system ’s entropy always increases ” ) , can be expressed in many different forms .
Kaila and Annila focus on two of these forms .
When written as a differential equation of motion , the second law can describe evolution as an energy transfer process : natural selection tends to favor the random mutations that lead to faster entropy increases in an ecosystem .
When written in integral form , the second law describes the principle of least action : motion , in general , takes the path of least energy .
Then , the scientists showed how natural selection and the principle of least action can be connected by expressing natural selection in terms of chemical thermodynamics .
As the scientists explain , nature explores many possible paths to level differences in energy densities , with one kind of energy transfer mechanism being different species within the larger system of the Earth .
Mechanisms of energy transduction , especially biological species , can be intricate and complex .
By randomly mutating individuals of a species , various paths are explored in the quest of increasing entropy most rapidly .
These mutations sooner or later naturally converge on the most probable path .
Although the energy landscape keeps changing , the most probable path is always that which is the shortest and follows the steepest energy descents .
It leads toward a stationary state , such as an ecosystem evolving toward a state that will have just the right amount of plants , plant eaters , and other energy transfer mechanisms ( both living and non-living ) to maintain the highest rate of energy dispersal .
“ In a biological context , when two rather similar species ( i.e. energy transduction mechanisms ) compete for the same source of energy ( e.g. food ) , the one with even slightly more effective mechanisms ( e.g. claws , teeth , feet , etc. ) captures more than the other , ” Annila explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Gradually , the population of the more effective species will increase at the expense of the other .
The overall process is pictured as flows of energy that gradually and naturally select the more effective , steeper paths .
In biology , this physical consequence , which can be deduced from Lyapunov stability criterion , is known as the competitive exclusion principle .
“ Let us assume that a mutation happens to improve the speed of a cheetah , ” he added as an example .
“ Consequently , this cheetah will catch more food , i.e. more energy will channel through this individual – the path has become steeper .
Likewise , a deleterious mutation will reduce the flow via the particular path that has turned less steep .
In this case , the non-mutated paths are the healthy rivalries , and will enjoy correspondingly larger flows due to the diminished competition . ”
The researchers note that this abstract description provides a holistic view of evolving nature , not a detailed explanation for how individual species emerge from the process .
For example , plant - eating species distribute the solar energy acquired by photosynthesis , and the cheetah , as a carnivore , disperses energy further down along the gradients of the food chain , which eventually terminates into cold space .
And since these energy flows themselves yield and affect energy transfer mechanisms that , in turn , alter the flows , it ’s virtually impossible to predict evolution ’s next move .
“ A system evolves to reach a stationary state with respect to its surroundings , ” Annila explained .
“ That is to say , when the surrounding environment is high in energy , then the system will evolve to a high - energy stationary state .
Matter on Earth has evolved over eons in increasing its energy content to match that of the solar radiation density .
During this process , mechanisms of energy transduction have improved , but presumably there are still ways to catch more of the sunlight to power activities that are presently fueled by non-renewables . ”
The idea of using the second law of thermodynamics to describe evolution is not new .
As far back as 1899 , physicist Ludwig Boltzmann , a great admirer of Darwin , was contemplating about connection .
Also , Alfred J. Lotka , in his main work published in 1925 , expressed full confidence that biotic systems follow the same universal imperative .
Many scientists today have recognized the principle of increasing entropy as a way to understand life .
The connection between increasing entropy and decreasing free energy , provided by Kaila and Annila via the principle of least action , has further strengthened the unified description of natural motions .

Young Suns of NGC 7129
Credit & Copyright : Bob and Janice Fera ( Fera Photography )
Explanation : Young suns still lie within dusty NGC 7129 , some 3,000 light - years away toward the royal constellation Cepheus .
While these stars are at a relatively tender age , only about a million years old , it is likely that our own Sun formed in a similar stellar nursery some five billion years ago .
Most noticeable in the striking image are the lovely bluish dust clouds that reflect the youthful starlight , but the smaller , deep red crescent shapes are also markers of energetic , young stellar objects .
Known as Herbig - Haro objects , their shape and color is characteristic of glowing hydrogen gas shocked by jets streaming away from newborn stars .
Ultimately the natal gas and dust in the region will be dispersed , the stars drifting apart as the loose cluster orbits the center of the Galaxy .
At the estimated distance of NGC 7129 , this telescopic view spans about 40 light - years .

Leahy report justifies
Rove contempt ; possibility of charges remains murky Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 18 , 2008
Print This Email This The Senate Judiciary Committee is releasing a 60 - page report justifying its contempt of Congress citations aimed at Karl Rove and other Bush administration figures , but the chances the Senate will actually vote to pursue criminal charges are slim .
The contempt citations stem from the committee 's investigation of the US Attorney firing scandal .
Rove , who resigned last year from his White House post , and Bush Chief of Staff Josh Bolten , among others , refused to comply with subpoenas demanding testimony and documents related to the committee 's investigation of the politically motivated attorney firings .
Bolten and Harriet Miers , the former White House counsel , already are fighting contempt charges issued by the House after they snubbed subpoenas from that chamber 's parallel investigation of the attorney firing .
Leahy has not said whether he will continue to push for criminal charges from the Senate after Bush leaves office next year , but he vowed to continue working to fix abuses within the Justice Department .
" This administration has repeatedly rejected the constitutional oversight role of Congress , " Leahy said in a press release accompanying the report .
" The Bush administrations days may be numbered , but the next Attorney General and the next Congress have much work to do to restore accountability and independence to the United States Department of Justice . "
The Judiciary Committee report ( .pdf ) corroborates the findings of an earlier investigation conducted by the Justice Department 's Inspector General and Office of Professional Accountability .
Investigators found that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other Department officials acted improperly and pursued political goals in seeking the dismissal of at least two dozen federal prosecutors .
Nine US
Attorneys were eventually fired .
The report says the committee 's investigation requires information that only officials like Rove and Bolten could provide .
" The White Houses unsubstantiated blanket claims of privilege and novel claims of immunity do not trump the Committees well - established need for the information it has sought about the firings and do not excuse current and former White House officials from complying with the Committees subpoenas , " it reads .
Whether Leahy continues to pursue a full vote on the contempt citations after President Bush leaves office in January remains to be seen , committee spokeswoman Erica Chabot tells RAW STORY .
There are lingering questions over whether a contempt resolution passed this session could still be brought up for a vote when the next session of Congress begins in January .
The Senate will briefly convene for a lame - duck session this week , when the full chamber could theoretically vote to hold Rove and Bolten in contempt , although Chabot says such a scenario seems unlikely .
A leadership aide likewise says the lame duck session will focus primarily on the ongoing financial crisis and efforts to achieve a bailout for the auto industry .
The golden gun is worth £ 80,000
The £ 80,000 golden gun used in the 1974 James Bond film The Man With The Golden Gun has been stolen from studios in Hertfordshire .
The gun was noticed to be missing from Elstree Studios on Friday .
It was made for the film starring Sir Roger Moore and Christopher Lee .
Lee plays Bond 's nemesis Scaramanga , who kills using the gun made from a cigarette case , a lighter and a pen .
The studios hope the golden gun will be offered to a memorabilia dealer .
It is then hoped the thief will be able to be traced via the dealer .
The gun was in the care of Elstree Props , a firm which is based at the studios .
Staff have no idea when the gun was taken , but it was discovered missing on Friday .
A spokeswoman for Hertfordshire Police said : " We were called to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood at 1325 BST after a report of a theft of a prop , which was the golden gun .
" Inquiries are ongoing . "
In the film , when Bond receives a golden bullet inscribed with 007 , he is distracted from his mission .
He decides to track down Francisco Scaramanga , an assassin known as " The Man with the Golden Gun " whose assassinations cost $ 1 m each .
Scaramanga uses the golden gun to kill a number of his foes , before a final confrontation with Bond .
Yale scientists have created nanowire sensors coupled with simple microprocessor electronics that are both sensitive and specific enough to be used for point - of - care ( POC ) disease detection , according to a report in Nano Letters .
The sensors use activation of immune cells by highly specific antigens — signatures of bacteria , viruses or cancer cells — as the detector .
When T cells are activated , they produce acid , and generate a tiny current in the nanowire electronics , signaling the presence of a specific antigen .
The system can detect as few as 200 activated cells .
In earlier studies , these researchers demonstrated that the nanowires could detect generalized activation of this small number of T cells .
The new report expands that work and shows the nanowires can identify activation from a single specific antigen even when there is substantial background “ noise ” from a general immune stimulation of other cells .
Describing the sensitivity of the system , senior author Tarek Fahmy , Yale assistant professor of biomedical engineering , said : .
“ Imagine I am the detector in a room where thousands of unrelated people are talking — and I whisper , ‘ Who knows me ? ’
I am so sensitive that I can hear even a few people saying , ‘ I do ’ above the crowd noise .
In the past , we could detect everyone talking — now we can hear the few above the many . ”
According to the authors , this level of sensitivity and specificity is unprecedented in a system that uses no dyes or radioactivity .
Beyond its sensitivity , they say , the beauty of this detection system is in its speed — producing results in seconds — and its compatibility with existing CMOS electronics .
“ We simply took direction from Mother Nature and used the exquisitely sensitive and flexible detection of the immune system as the detector , and a basic physiological response of immune cells as the reporter , ” said postdoctoral fellow and lead author , Eric Stern .
“ We coupled that with existing CMOS electronics to make it easily usable . ”
The authors see a huge potential for the system in POC diagnostic centers in the US and in underdeveloped countries where healthcare facilities and clinics are lacking .
He says it could be as simple as an iPod - like device with changeable cards to detect or diagnose disease .
Importantly , Stern notes that the system produces no false positives — a necessity for POC testing .
The authors suggest that in a clinic , assays could immediately determine which strain of flu a patient has , whether or not there is an HIV infection , or what strain of tuberculosis or coli bacteria is present .
Currently , there are no electronic POC diagnostic devices available for disease detection .
“ Instruments this sensitive could also play a role in detection of residual disease after antiviral treatments or chemotherapy , ” said Fahmy .
“ They will help with one of the greatest challenges we face in treatment of disease — knowing if we got rid of all of it . ”

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was a credit event which triggered a massive liability to participants in the large and potentially dangerous Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) market .
This is a market that represents the “ weapons of financial mass destruction ” label which Warren Buffett gave to the derivatives .
Below , I will attempt to explain , with much help from Wikipedia , what Credit Default Swaps are , how the market functions and why it is THE derivatives market that needs to be regulated before systemic risk threatens the global financial system .
This is how Wikipedia describes a Credit Default Swap :
A credit default swap ( CDS ) is a credit derivative contract between two counterparties , whereby the “ buyer ” makes periodic payments to the “ seller ” in exchange for the right to a payoff if there is a default [ 2 ] or credit event in respect of a third party or “ reference entity ” .
In the event of default in the reference entity : the buyer typically delivers the defaulted asset to the seller for a payment of the par value .
This is known as “ physical settlement ” .
Or the seller pays the buyer the difference between the par value and the market price of a specified debt obligation .
This is known as “ cash settlement ” .
While little known to most individual investors , credit default swaps are commonly used contracts to insure against the default of financial instruments such as bonds and corporate debt .
But they also are bought and sold as bets against bond defaults — a buyer does n’t necessarily have to own a bond to buy the credit default swap that insures it .
Banks and other institutions have used credit default swaps to cover the risk of default in mortgage and other debt securities they hold .
– Wikipedia
In essence , a CDS is an insurance contract against corporate default , much like auto insurance or home owner ’s insurance .
But it is also a derivative , which is a financial instrument that derives its value not from its own intrinsic worth , but from the underlying value of another asset .
The best simple example of a derivative is a equity call option .
Here the buyer of the option retains the right but not the obligation to buy a publicly - traded stock at a specific price .
The value of this option to buy the stock at the specified price is derived from the price of the underlying stock , how long the option is valid and how likely the stock is to reach that price .
Now , a CDS is a more complicated instrument , as you can see from the definition above .
Moreover , the CDS contract is over - the - counter i.e. it is not regulated by a formal exchange like equity options are .
This means that no one knows what the exposures of specific financial institutions to specific credit defaults are .
Only those institutions themselves know , there is no mandatory disclosure law , and it is not in the institutions ’ best interest to disclose .
Moreover , this market is not very liquid because the contracts are not standardized as they would be if traded on an exchange .
The contracts are two - party negotiations , often with very specific terms and are , therefore , illiquid — not interchangeable with other contracts , even for the same company and debt issuance .
The CDS market is enormous , one reason for its enormous implications or the health of global finance .
Again from Wikipedia :
These are enormous sums of money , an order of magnitude bigger than the underlying securities that the CDS market serves to insure .
Therefore , large credit events in the CDS market can have very bad implications for the health of our global financial system .
Lehman Brothers ’ bankruptcy presented us with the first test case of what kind of implications this market could have .
When Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy , it triggered the transfer of large sums in the CDS market to insure buyers of Lehman credit default risk protection against all losses from that event .
The sellers of these contracts received the Lehman debt and in return they were obligated to pay the contract buyers ( the insured parties ) enough money to make the buyers “ whole ” i.e. to give them their full investment in the bonds back as if they had never bought the Lehman bonds .
The auction for Lehman ’s debt occurred on Friday afternoon and the final auction price was $ 8.625 .
This means that for each $ 100 initial par value , the debt is only worth $ 8.625 .
The sellers of Lehman CDSs are obligated to pay the insured counterparties 91.375 % of the bonds ’ face value and , in return , they will receive the bonds .
Because Lehman has hundreds of billions of dollars of debt outstanding , this had been a large worry for the market .
In fact , it as because of large exposure to the CDS market
that the U.S. authorities did not allow AIG to fail .
In the end , we seemed to get through his one just fine so far .
However , the Lehman process demonstrates the potentially devastating problems the CDS market can create for sellers of CDS insurance like AIG .
In the future , the monetary authorities like the SEC cannot let a large derivatives market like this go unregulated .
These contracts must be disclosed , standardized and controlled via an exchange like the Chicago Board Options Exchange .
My hope is this will be a lesson that U.S. and G - 7 policy makers take on board in order to prevent crises of this nature in the future .

Analysis
By Professor Larry Sabato
University of Virginia
The whisper of September has turned to a roar in October : Barack Obama may be on the verge of a landslide victory .
A year ago , no one on the planet could have conceived of such a thing .
Jimmy Carter took 50.1 % of the vote , in 1976 After all , Democrats have elected just two American presidents since 1968 , moderate white Southerners Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton , both by modest popular vote margins .
In 2008 Democrats took a daring leap of faith and chose a far more liberal nominee who is the first African - American standard - bearer - no minor matter in a nation that is just 11 % black and has been plagued by racial divisions since its founding .
Yet the improbable is becoming probable .
With the presidential debates completed , Obama appears to have an unobstructed path to the White House .
The polls show he won all three debates and is viewed more positively than opponent John McCain .
Voters also believe Obama has the more qualified vice - presidential candidate , Joseph Biden .
Sarah Palin , who once gave McCain hope for attracting a generous share of Hillary Clinton 's supporters , did so poorly in a series of well - publicised media interviews that she has become a liability outside of the conservative Republican base .
The ' wrong track '
More importantly , the fundamentals of the election year have conspired to create a perfect storm for Democratic victory : Analysts are straining to come up with ways McCain could reverse the flow of the election at this late date .
The truth is , such a task is out of his hands
• President Bush 's popularity is now at 23 % , three points below Richard Nixon on the day he resigned the presidency in August 1974 and only one point higher than the all - time presidential low of 22 % recorded for Harry Truman in 1952 , in the twilight of his White House years .
Bush has made the political environment toxic for all Republicans , even one like McCain who enjoys a " maverick " image and ran against Bush in 2000 . •
The rocky economy , with an ongoing mortgage crisis and other troubles , became a major disaster area with the financial meltdown of Wall Street in September and October .
Americans are now convinced that a major recession - some insist it is a depression - has begun , and the traditional " pocketbook " issue has powerfully taken over the campaign .
The party not in control of the White House ( in this case , the Democrats ) always benefits from the fear and anger such conditions create .
•
An astounding 91 % of the voters say that the country is seriously on the wrong track - a level of dissatisfaction never registered in the history of polling .
Obama had held a modest lead in the popular vote and the electoral college count since June , save for the period immediately following the Republican National Convention , when McCain enjoyed a decent " bounce " .
By late September the financial crisis had converted Obama 's edge into a gulf , and his margin expanded to an average of seven percentage points .
In more than a few respectable polls , he has been outpacing McCain by 10 % or more .
Obama 's lead
The electoral college has followed suit .
Based on current polling averages , Obama is already above the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House .
This map shows Obama at 273 , and includes only those states where Obama has leads outside the margin of error in current surveys .
McCain has just 155 electoral votes firmly in his column .
This leaves nine states unaccounted for : Florida , Indiana , Missouri , Nevada , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Virginia , and West Virginia .
At present , Obama has modest leads in all of them , save Indiana , North Dakota , and West Virginia - which are essentially tied toss - ups .
Should Obama capture all the states where he is ahead with two weeks to go in the campaign , his electoral college total would be a remarkable 364 - 94 more than needed for election .
If he also wins the three pure toss - ups , he would go to 383 , an excess of 113 votes .
Such a total would exceed that of Jimmy Carter in 1976 ( 297 ) , Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 ( 370 and 379 ) , and both of George W. Bush 's elections ( 271 in 2000 and 286 in 2004 ) .
Close finishes Realistically , many observers doubt that Obama will hit the 383 mark , and perhaps even the lower 364 .
Indiana , North Dakota , and West Virginia may be a bridge too far , and no - one would be surprised to see McCain hold on to Missouri and North Carolina .
Should McCain win relatively conservative Florida , Ohio , or Virginia , it would count as only a mild upset .
After all , these eight states backed George Bush twice , and only Ohio was even close .
Are there some people who just cannot bring themselves to vote for an African - American ?
Yes
Douglas Wilder
Will closet racism derail Obama ?
Analysts are straining to come up with ways McCain could reverse the flow of the election at this late date .
The truth is , such a task is out of his hands .
A major terrorist strike or an international crisis might give McCain the opportunity to demonstrate his commander - in - chief credentials , though there are no guarantees this would work .
The much - discussed " Tom Bradley - Doug Wilder " effect , named after two black politicians who unexpectedly lost many white votes on election days in the 1980s , could enable McCain to sneak past Obama on 4 November .
Yet the country has made great strides in race relations over the past several decades , and it would be a major surprise if so - called " racial leakage " at the polls cost Obama the White House .
It is important to note that some presidential contests have tightened considerably in their final days , resulting in a closer - than - expected finish .
This phenomenon was observed in 1968 ( Richard Nixon v Hubert Humphrey ) , 1976 ( Jimmy Carter v Gerald Ford ) , 1992 ( Bill Clinton v George HW Bush ) , and 2000 ( George W Bush v Al Gore ) .
In each case , though , the frontrunner managed to hold on .
In 1980 , the opposite happened , as a tight match - up between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan turned into a Reagan landslide .
A late debate conquest by Reagan and the collapse of the Iranian hostage negotiations pushed the lion 's share of the undecided voters to the Republican in the campaign 's final week .
Political capital Tightening aside , at this point , a McCain victory would rival that of President Harry Truman 's giant upset in 1948 .
It 's always possible Truman will be reborn , but the 33rd chief executive is invoked every four years by the trailing candidate - and nothing like Truman 's triumph has happened in a presidential election since his long - ago shocker .
When governing , the size of your electoral college majority matters
Of course , if asked today , Obama would be pleased to take the absolute minimum of 270 electors , and be done with it .
However , if elected , he will inherit a deeply troubled economy , $ 10 trillion in national debt , and controversial wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He will need all the help he can get .
Large electoral college majorities confer political capital on a new president , enabling him to claim a mandate for swift passage of his platform .
The essential question to be resolved in two weeks is the identity of the 44th president .
A second vital query will be answered then , too :
Will the new president have enough clout to deal confidently and effectively with the enormous challenges that await him on 20 January ?
In the electoral college , for governing at least , size matters .

THE SIMULTANEOUS unfolding of the US presidential campaign and unraveling of the financial markets presents one of those occasions where the political and economic systems starkly reveal their nature .
Passion about the campaign may not be universally shared but almost everybody can feel the anxiety from the foreclosure of a million homes , and concerns about jobs , savings and healthcare at risk .
The initial Bush proposals to deal with the crisis so reeked of totalitarianism that they were quickly modified .
Under intense lobbyist pressure , they were reshaped as " a clear win for the largest institutions in the system . . . a way of dumping assets without having to fail or close " , as described by James Rickards , who negotiated the federal bailout for the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 , reminding us that we are treading familiar turf .
The immediate origins of the current meltdown lie in the collapse of the housing bubble supervised by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan , which sustained the struggling economy through the Bush years by debt - based consumer spending along with borrowing from abroad .
But the roots are deeper .
In part they lie in the triumph of financial liberalisation in the past 30 years - that is , freeing the markets as much as possible from government regulation .
These steps predictably increased the frequency and depth of severe reversals , which now threaten to bring about the worst crisis since the Great Depression .
Also predictably , the narrow sectors that reaped enormous profits from liberalisation are calling for massive state intervention to rescue collapsing financial institutions .
Such interventionism is a regular feature of state capitalism , though the scale today is unusual .
A study by international economists Winfried Ruigrok and Rob van Tulder 15 years ago found that at least 20 companies in the Fortune 100 would not have survived if they had not been saved by their respective governments , and that many of the rest gained substantially by demanding that governments " socialise their losses , " as in today 's taxpayer - financed bailout .
Such government intervention " has been the rule rather than the exception over the past two centuries " , they conclude .
In a functioning democratic society , a political campaign would address such fundamental issues , looking into root causes and cures , and proposing the means by which people suffering the consequences can take effective control .
The financial market " underprices risk " and is " systematically inefficient " , as economists John Eatwell and Lance Taylor wrote a decade ago , warning of the extreme dangers of financial liberalisation and reviewing the substantial costs already incurred - and proposing solutions , which have been ignored .
One factor is failure to calculate the costs to those who do not participate in transactions .
These " externalities " can be huge .
Ignoring systemic risk leads to more risk - taking than would take place in an efficient economy , even by the narrowest measures .
The task of financial institutions is to take risks and , if well - managed , to ensure that potential losses to themselves will be covered .
The emphasis is on " to themselves " .
Under state capitalist rules , it is not their business to consider the cost to others - the " externalities " of decent survival - if their practices lead to financial crisis , as they regularly do .
Financial liberalisation has effects well beyond the economy .
It has long been understood that it is a powerful weapon against democracy .
Free capital movement creates what some have called a " virtual parliament " of investors and lenders , who closely monitor government programmes and " vote " against them if they are considered irrational : for the benefit of people , rather than concentrated private power .
Investors and lenders can " vote " by capital flight , attacks on currencies and other devices offered by financial liberalisation .
That is one reason why the Bretton Woods system established by the United States and Britain after the second World War instituted capital controls and regulated currencies .*
The Great Depression and the war had aroused powerful radical democratic currents , ranging from the anti-fascist resistance to working class organisation .
These pressures made it necessary to permit social democratic policies .
The Bretton Woods system was designed in part to create a space for government action responding to public will - for some measure of democracy .
John Maynard Keynes , the British negotiator , considered the most important achievement of Bretton Woods to be the establishment of the right of governments to restrict capital movement .

In dramatic contrast , in the neoliberal phase after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s , the US treasury now regards free capital mobility as a " fundamental right " , unlike such alleged " rights " as those guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights : health , education , decent employment , security and other rights that the Reagan and Bush administrations have dismissed as " letters to Santa Claus " , " preposterous " , mere " myths " .
In earlier years , the public had not been much of a problem .
The reasons are reviewed by Barry Eichengreen in his standard scholarly history of the international monetary system .
He explains that in the 19th century , governments had not yet been " politicised by universal male suffrage and the rise of trade unionism and parliamentary labour parties " .
Therefore , the severe costs imposed by the virtual parliament could be transferred to the general population .
But with the radicalisation of the general public during the Great Depression and the anti-fascist war , that luxury was no longer available to private power and wealth .
Hence in the Bretton Woods system , " limits on capital mobility substituted for limits on democracy as a source of insulation from market pressures " .
The obvious corollary is that after the dismantling of the postwar system , democracy is restricted .
It has therefore become necessary to control and marginalise the public in some fashion , processes particularly evident in the more business - run societies like the United States .
The management of electoral extravaganzas by the public relations industry is one illustration .
" Politics is the shadow cast on society by big business , " concluded America 's leading 20th century social philosopher John Dewey , and will remain so as long as power resides in " business for private profit through private control of banking , land , industry , reinforced by command of the press , press agents and other means of publicity and propaganda " .
The United States effectively has a one - party system , the business party , with two factions , Republicans and Democrats .
There are differences between them .
In his study Unequal Democracy : The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age , Larry Bartels shows that during the past six decades " real incomes of middle - class families have grown twice as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans , while the real incomes of working - poor families have grown six times as fast under Democrats as they have under Republicans " .
Differences can be detected in the current election as well .
Voters should consider them , but without illusions about the political parties , and with the recognition that consistently over the centuries , progressive legislation and social welfare have been won by popular struggles , not gifts from above .
Those struggles follow a cycle of success and setback .
They must be waged every day , not just once every four years , always with the goal of creating a genuinely responsive democratic society , from the voting booth to the workplace .
* The Bretton Woods system of global financial management was created by 730 delegates from all 44 Allied second World War nations who attended a UN - hosted Monetary and Financial Conference at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods in New Hampshire in 1944 .
Bretton Woods , which collapsed in 1971 , was the system of rules , institutions , and procedures that regulated the international monetary system , under which were set up the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) ( now one of five institutions in the World Bank Group ) and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , which came into effect in 1945 .
The chief feature of Bretton Woods was an obligation for each country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained the exchange rate of its currency within a fixed value .
The system collapsed when the US suspended convertibility from dollars to gold .
This created the unique situation whereby the US dollar became the " reserve currency " for the other countries within Bretton Woods .

The Great Depression will look like a small blip compared to the economic collapse the United States is about to suffer , according to several experts .
But Congress refuses to listen and do what ’s necessary to stave off disaster .
Worse , Congress has been warned year after year since at least 1992 , and perhaps before that .
“ The federal budget is structurally unbalanced .
This will do increasing damage to the economy and is unsustainable in the long term .
Regardless of the approach chosen , prompt and meaningful action is essential .
The longer it is delayed , the more painful it will be . ”
Those were the words of the General Accounting Office ( now the Government Accountability Office ) 15 years ago .
Reporting on the long - term fiscal outlook of the federal government , GAO reported then ( PDF ) that Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security would grow out of control and that “ the path of ‘ no action ’ is unsustainable . ”
It also warned that “ a major effort to strengthen the economy must be completed by 2010 , ” when the Baby Boomers will begin retiring .
We all know what happened in the intervening 15 years : absolutely nothing good .
The entitlement programs are still here , larger than ever , and draining ever larger percentages of the national economy .
Last month , GAO reported again to Congress on the nation ’s long - term fiscal outlook .
It ’s only gotten worse .
“ GAO ’s current long - term simulations continue to show ever - larger deficits resulting in a federal debt burden that ultimately spirals out of control , ” GAO reported ( PDF ) .
Even under the best - case scenario GAO studied , “ the risks to the Nation ’s future financial condition are too high to be acceptable . ”
And again , the problem is government entitlement programs — and Social Security , bad as it is , is n’t even the biggest one .
In the succeeding 2 decades America ’s population will age dramatically , and relatively fewer workers will be asked to support ever larger costs for retirees .
. . .
Although Social Security is a major part of the fiscal challenge , it is far from our biggest challenge .
Spending on the major federal health programs ( i.e. , Medicare and Medicaid ) represents a much larger and faster growing problem .
In fact , the federal government ’s obligations for Medicare Part D alone exceed the unfunded obligations for Social Security .
Over the past several decades , health care spending on average has grown much faster than the economy , absorbing increasing shares of the Nation ’s resources , and this rapid growth is projected to continue .
For this reason and others , rising health care costs pose a fiscal challenge not just to the federal budget but to American business and our society as a whole .

Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last week also warned Congress , but of course , most of them refused to listen or even acknowledge that the problem exists .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke could not have sounded the alarm any clearer if he had carried a bullhorn and a gong .
“ This expansion of debt would spark a fiscal crisis .
. . .
The U.S. economy could be seriously weakened .
. . .
This is sort of like a snowball rolling down the hill .
. . .
This can really get out of control . ”
Other lawmakers struggled to wrap their arms around the crisis Bernanke was describing .
“ We ’re just , kind of , whistling past the graveyard ? ” asked Rep. Marion Berry ( D - Ark ) .
“ Yes , sir , ” said the chairman .
“ And hoping that the tooth fairy comes and bails us out of this deal ? ” “ I do n’t know about the metaphors there , Mr. Congressman , ” Bernanke replied .
Rep. Jeb Hensarling ( R - Tex . ) had a different metaphor to run by the chairman .
He asked if “ we are debating how to mop up six inches of water in the stateroom of the captain of the Titanic when we should be focused upon the gaping hole in the hull of the ship . ”
“ The heart of the problem are the entitlement programs , ” Bernanke affirmed .
— Washington Post
“ Federal deficits will grow to unsustainable levels in as little as two decades , ” says David M. Walker , the comptroller general of the United States , “ At that point , without significant policy changes , federal deficits could reach 10 % or more of our economy . ”
As head of the GAO , it ’s Walker ’s responsibility to sound the alarm .
Not at all satisfied with Congress refusing to listen , he ’s taken his message directly to the people , appearing on CBS News ’
60 Minutes television program on Sunday , and touring the U.S.
“ We are the world ’s largest debtor nation , and time is working against us , ” Walker said in an article for The Futurist magazine .
Indeed , the American welfare state is growing out of control , with tens of millions of Americans receiving some form of government handout .
The number of families receiving cash benefits from welfare has plummeted since the government imposed time limits on the payments a decade ago .
But other programs for the poor , including Medicaid , food stamps and disability benefits , are bursting with new enrollees .
The result , according to an Associated Press analysis : Nearly one in six people rely on some form of public assistance , a larger share than at any time since the government started measuring two decades ago .
— Associated Press
“ This story only looks at the welfare state for the poor , ” writes Cato Institute vice president David Boaz .
“ Far more than one in six Americans are dependent on such government programs as Social Security , Medicare , unemployment compensation , and so on .
. . .
And how long can a nation remain free if half its citizens are dependent on government hand - outs ? ”
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , who is running for President in 2008 , also sounded the alarm .
When it comes to Social Security and Medicare , the federal government simply wo n’t be able to keep its promises in the future .
That is the reality every American should get used to , despite the grand promises of Washington reformers .
Our entitlement system ca n’t be reformed — it ’s too late .
. . .
The politicians who get reelected by passing such incredibly shortsighted legislation will never have to answer to future generations saddled with huge federal deficits .
Those generations are the real victims , as they cannot object to the debts being incurred today in their names .
The official national debt figure , now approaching $ 9 trillion , reflects only what the federal government owes in current debts on money already borrowed .
It does not reflect what the federal government has promised to pay millions of Americans in entitlement benefits down the road .
Those future obligations put our real debt figure at roughly fifty trillion dollars — a staggering sum that is about as large as the total household net worth of the entire United States .
Your share of this fifty trillion amounts to about $ 175,000 .
Do n’t believe for a second that we can grow our way out of the problem through a prosperous economy that yields higher future tax revenues .
If present trends continue , by 2040 the entire federal budget will be consumed by Social Security and Medicare alone .
The only options for balancing the budget would be cutting total federal spending by about 60 % , or doubling federal taxes .
To close the long - term entitlement gap , the U.S. economy would have to grow by double digits every year for the next 75 years .
The answer to these critical financial realities is simple , but not easy :
We must rethink the very role of government in our society .
Anything less , any tinkering or “ reform , ” wo n’t cut it .
— Rep. Ron Paul
In summary , the welfare state that the socialists built here from the 1930s ( after they destroyed the money supply and created an artificial depression ) is going to do the same thing it did when they built it in the Soviet Union .
And if their example is any guide , it wo n’t take until 2040 for the nation ’s economy to collapse utterly .
It will be sudden and unexpected .
It will be horrific .
Millions of Americans will die , never knowing what happened .
But if you ’ve read this far , you will know why :
In a word , socialism .
Socialism sounds good , because it plays on the emotions , not because it ’s good fiscal policy .
It ’s terrible fiscal policy .
For that matter , it ’s also terribly damaging — psychologically and financially — to those who it ostensibly would help .
Maybe this time around , we will actually remember the lesson .
Maybe this time around , we ’ll remember what real money is , and reject the worthless paper our overlords have given us in its place .
Maybe this time around , when millions of Americans are starving in tents , we will look not to government for a “ solution ” which makes economic slaves of us all , but where we should have looked in the first place : our neighbors , our communities and within ourselves .
Intel Core 2 Performance Comparison Guide
The Intel Core 2 processors are a very successful line of processors .
They are based on the Core microarchitecture which offers a tremendous improvement in performance and power efficiency .
There are currently over 30 different processor models based on three main core designs .
They are split into several performance grades :
Core 2 Extreme ( QX Series ) - High - end quad - core Core 2 processor with unlocked multipliers
High - end quad - core Core 2 processor with unlocked multipliers Core 2 Extreme ( X Series ) - High - end dual - core Core 2 processor with unlocked multipliers
High - end dual - core Core 2 processor with unlocked multipliers Core 2 Quad ( Q Series ) - Mainstream quad- core Core 2 processor
Mainstream quad- core Core 2 processor Core 2 Duo ( E Series ) - Mainstream dual - core Core 2 processor
Mainstream dual - core Core 2 processor Pentium Dual - Core ( E2000 Series ) - Value - segment dual - core Core 2 processor
Value - segment dual - core Core 2 processor Celeron Dual - Core ( E1000 Series ) - Budget - segment dual - core Core 2 processor
Unlike the AMD Phenom quad - core processors which are built on a single die , Intel still build their Core 2 quad - core processors as multi-chip packages - essentially two dual - core dies combined into a single package .
Even their new 45 nm Core 2 processors are built this way .
This has led AMD to claim that they are not " true quad - core " processors , and therefore inferior to AMD 's monolithic quad - core design .
However , this is really a minor distinction .
The Intel Core 2 quad - core processors have four processing cores and that qualifies them as quad - core processors , whether they are built as two dies or a single die .
In this article , we compare the performance of 23 Intel Core 2 processors in five benchmarks - two game - based benchmarks and three application benchmarks .
We hope to add on more and more results as we get hold of additional Core 2 processors over time .
Let 's take a look at the Core 2 processors we have rounded up for this comparison .

Previously in series : Lawful Uncertainty
You may have noticed a certain trend in recent posts : I 've been arguing that randomness hath no power , that there is no beauty in entropy , nor yet strength from noise .
If one were to formalize the argument , it would probably run something like this : that if you define optimization as previously suggested , then sheer randomness will generate something that seems to have 12 bits of optimization , only by trying 4096 times ; or 100 bits of optimization , only by trying 1030 times .
This may not sound like a profound insight , since it is true by definition .
But consider - how many comic books talk about " mutation " as if it were a source of power ?
Mutation is random .
It 's the selection part , not the mutation part , that explains the trends of evolution .
Or you may have heard people talking about " emergence " as if it could explain complex , functional orders .
People will say that the function of an ant colony emerges - as if , starting from ants that had been selected only to function as solitary individuals , the ants got together in a group for the first time and the ant colony popped right out .
But ant colonies have been selected on as colonies by evolution .
Optimization did n't just magically happen when the ants came together .
And you may have heard that certain algorithms in Artificial Intelligence work better when we inject randomness into them .
Is that even possible ?
How can you extract useful work from entropy ?
But it is possible in theory , since you can have things that are anti-optimized .
Say , the average state has utility - 10 , but the current state has an unusually low utility of - 100 .
So in this case , a random jump has an expected benefit .
If you happen to be standing in the middle of a lava pit , running around at random is better than staying in the same place .
( Not best , but better . )
A given AI algorithm can do better when randomness is injected , provided that some step of the unrandomized algorithm is doing worse than random .
Imagine that we 're trying to solve a pushbutton combination lock with 20 numbers and four steps - 160,000 possible combinations .
And we try the following algorithm for opening it :
Enter 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 into the lock .
If the lock opens , return with SUCCESS .
If the lock remains closed , go to step 1 .
Obviously we can improve this algorithm by substituting " Enter a random combination " on the first step .
If we were to try and explain in words why this works , a description might go something like this : " When we first try 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 it has the same chance of working ( so far as we know ) as any other combination .
But if it does n't work , it would be stupid to try it again , because now we know that 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 does n't work . "
The first key idea is that , after trying 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 , we learn something - we acquire new knowledge , which should then affect how we plan to continue from there .
This is knowledge , quite a different thing from randomness ...
What exactly have we learned ?
We 've learned that 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 does n't work ; or to put it another way , given that 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 failed on the first try , the conditional probability of it working on the second try , is negligible .
Consider your probability distribution over all the possible combinations :
Your probability distribution starts out in a state of maximum entropy , with all 160,000 combinations having a 1/160,000 probability of working .
After you try 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 , you have a new probability distribution , which has slightly less entropy ; 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 has an infinitesimal probability of working , and the remaining 159,999 possibilities each have a 1/159,999 probability of working .
To try 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 again would now be stupid - the expected utility of trying 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 is less than average ; the vast majority of potential actions now have higher expected utility than does 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 .
An algorithm that tries 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 again would do worse than random , and we can improve the algorithm by randomizing it .
One may also consider an algorithm as a sequence of tries :
The " unrandomized algorithm " describes the sequence of tries 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 , 0-0-0 -0 , 0-0-0 - 0 ... and this sequence of tries is a special sequence that has far - below - average expected utility in the space of all possible sequences .
Thus we can improve on this sequence by selecting a random sequence instead .
Or imagine that the combination changes every second .
In this case , 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 , 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 is just as good as the randomized algorithm - no better and no worse .
What this shows you is that the supposedly " random " algorithm is " better " relative to a known regularity of the lock - that the combination is constant on each try .
Or to be precise , the reason the random algorithm does predictably better than the stupid one is that the stupid algorithm is " stupid " relative to a known regularity of the lock .
In other words , in order to say that the random algorithm is an " improvement " , we must have used specific knowledge about the lock to realize that the unrandomized algorithm is worse - than - average .
Having realized this , can we reflect further on our information , and take full advantage of our knowledge to do better - than - average ?
The random lockpicker is still not optimal - it does not take full advantage of the knowledge we have acquired .
A random algorithm might randomly try 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 again ; it 's not impossible , but it could happen .
The longer the random algorithm runs , the more likely it is to try the same combination twice ; and if the random algorithm is sufficiently unlucky , it might still fail to solve the lock after millions of tries .
We can take full advantage of all our knowledge by using an algorithm that systematically tries 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 , 0-0-0 - 1 , 0-0-0 - 2...
This algorithm is guaranteed not to repeat itself , and will find the solution in bounded time .
Considering the algorithm as a sequence of tries , no other sequence in sequence - space is expected to do better , given our initial knowledge .
( Any other nonrepeating sequence is equally good ; but nonrepeating sequences are rare in the space of all possible sequences . )
A combination dial often has a tolerance of 2 in either direction .
20-45-35 will open a lock set to 22 - 44 - 33 .
In this case , the algorithm that tries 0 - 1 - 0 , 0 - 2 - 0 , et cetera , ends up being stupid again ; a randomized algorithm will ( usually ) work better .
But an algorithm that tries 0 - 5 - 0 , 0 - 10 - 0 , 0 - 10 - 5 , will work better still .
Sometimes it is too expensive to take advantage of all the knowledge that we could , in theory , acquire from previous tests .
Moreover , a complete enumeration or interval - skipping algorithm would still end up being stupid .
In this case , computer scientists often use a cheap pseudo - random algorithm , because the computational cost of using our knowledge exceeds the benefit to be gained from using it .
This does not show the power of randomness , but , rather , the predictable stupidity of certain specific deterministic algorithms on that particular problem .
Remember , the pseudo - random algorithm is also deterministic !
But the deterministic pseudo - random algorithm does n't belong to the class of algorithms that are predictably stupid ( do much worse than average ) .
There are also subtler ways for adding noise to improve algorithms .
For example , there are neural network training algorithms that work better if you simulate noise in the neurons .
On this occasion it is especially tempting to say something like :
" Lo !
When we make our artificial neurons noisy , just like biological neurons , they work better !
Behold the healing life - force of entropy ! "
What might actually be happening - for example - is that the network training algorithm , operating on noiseless neurons , would vastly overfit the data .
If you expose the noiseless network to the series of coinflips " HTTTHHTTH " ... the training algorithm will say the equivalent of , " I bet this coin was specially designed to produce HTTTHHTTH every time it 's flipped ! " instead of " This coin probably alternates randomly between heads and tails . "
A hypothesis overfitted to the data does not generalize .
On the other hand , when we add noise to the neurons and then try training them again , they can no longer fit the data precisely , so instead they settle into a simpler hypothesis like " This coin alternates randomly between heads and tails . "
Note that this requires us - the programmers - to know in advance that probabilistic hypotheses are more likely to be true .
Or here 's another way of looking at it : A neural network algorithm typically looks at a set of training instances , tweaks the units and their connections based on the training instances , and in this way tries to " stamp " the experience onto itself .
But the algorithms which do the stamping are often poorly understood , and it is possible to stamp too hard .
If this mistake has already been made , then blurring the sensory information , or blurring the training algorithm , or blurring the units , can partially cancel out the " overlearning " .
Here 's a simplified example of a similar ( but not identical ) case : Imagine that the environment deals us a random mix of cards , 70 % blue and 30 % red .
But instead of just predicting " blue " or " red " , we have to assign a quantitative probability to seeing blue - and the scoring rule for our performance is one that elicits an honest estimate ; if the actual frequency is 70 % blue cards , we do best by replying " 70 % " , not 60 % or 80 % .
( " Proper scoring rule . " )
If you do n't know in advance the frequency of blue and red cards , one way to handle the problem would be to have a blue unit and a red unit , both wired to an output unit .
The blue unit sends signals with a positive effect that make the target unit more likely to fire ; the red unit inhibits its targets - just like the excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the human brain !
( Or an earthworm 's brain , for that matter ... )
Each time we see a blue card in the training data , the training algorithm increases the strength of the ( excitatory ) synapse from the blue unit to the output unit ; and each time we see a red card , the training algorithm strengthens the ( inhibitory ) synapse from the red unit to the output unit .
But wait !
We have n't said why the blue or red units might fire in the first place .
So we 'll add two more excitatory units that spike randomly , one connected to the blue unit and one connected to red unit .
This simulates the natural background noise present in the human brain ( or an earthworm 's brain ) .
Finally , the spiking frequency of the output unit becomes the predicted probability that the next card is blue .
As you can see - assuming you have n't lost track of all the complexity - this neural network learns to predict whether blue cards or red cards are more common in the mix .
Just like a human brain !
At least that 's the theory .
However , when we boot up the neural network and give it a hundred training examples with 70 blue and 30 red cards , it ends up predicting a 90 % probability that each card will be blue .
Now , there are several things that could go wrong with a system this complex ; but my own first impulse would be to guess that the training algorithm is too strongly adjusting the synaptic weight from the blue or red unit to the output unit on each training instance .
The training algorithm needs to shift a little less far - alter the synaptic weights a little less .
But the programmer of the neural network comes up with a different hypothesis : the problem is that there 's no noise in the input .
This is biologically unrealistic ; real organisms do not have perfect vision or perfect information about the environment .
So the programmer shuffles a few randomly generated blue and red cards ( 50 % probability of each ) into the training sequences .
Then the programmer adjusts the noise level until the network finally ends up predicting blue with 70 % probability .
And it turns out that using almost the same noise level ( with just a bit of further tweaking ) , the improved training algorithm can learn to assign the right probability to sequences of 80 % blue or 60 % blue cards .
Success !
We have found the Right Amount of Noise .
Of course this success comes with certain disadvantages .
For example , maybe the blue and red cards are predictable , in the sense of coming in a learnable sequence .
Maybe the sequence is 7 blue cards followed by 3 red cards .
If we mix noise into the sensory data , we may never notice this important regularity , or learn it imperfectly ... but that 's the price you pay for biological realism .
What 's really happening is that the training algorithm moves too far given its data , and adulterating noise with the data diminishes the impact of the data .
The two errors partially cancel out , but at the cost of a nontrivial loss in what we could , in principle , have learned from the data .
It would be better to adjust the training algorithm and keep the data clean .
This is an extremely oversimplified example , but it is not a total strawman .
The scenario seems silly only because it is simplified to the point where you can clearly see what is going wrong .
Make the neural network a lot more complicated , and the solution of adding noise to the inputs might sound a lot more plausible .
While some neural network algorithms are well - understood mathematically , others are not .
In particular , systems crafted with the aim of biological realism are often not well - understood .
But it is an inherently odd proposition that you can get a better picture of the environment by adding noise to your sensory information - by deliberately throwing away your sensory acuity .
This can only degrade the mutual information between yourself and the environment .
It can only diminish what in principle can be extracted from the data .
And this is as true for every step of the computation , as it is for the eyes themselves .
The only way that adding random noise will help is if some step of the sensory processing is doing worse than random .
Now it is certainly possible to design an imperfect reasoner that only works in the presence of an accustomed noise level .
Biological systems are unable to avoid noise , and therefore adapt to overcome noise .
Subtract the noise , and mechanisms adapted to the presence of noise may do strange things .
Biological systems are often fragile under conditions that have no evolutionary precedent in the ancestral environment .
If somehow the Earth 's gravity decreased , then birds might become unstable , lurching up in the air as their wings overcompensated for the now - decreased gravity .
But this does n't mean that stronger gravity helps birds fly better .
Gravity is still the difficult challenge that a bird 's wings work to overcome - even though birds are now adapted to gravity as an invariant .
What about hill - climbing , simulated annealing , or genetic algorithms ?
These AI algorithms are local search techniques that randomly investigate some of their nearest neighbors .
If an investigated neighbor is superior to the current position , the algorithm jumps there .
( Or sometimes probabilistically jumps to a neighbor with probability determined by the difference between neighbor goodness and current goodness . )
Are these techniques drawing on the power of noise ?
Local search algorithms take advantage of the regularity of the search space - that if you find a good point in the search space , its neighborhood of closely similar points is a likely place to search for a slightly better neighbor .
And then this neighbor , in turn , is a likely place to search for a still better neighbor ; and so on .
To the extent this regularity of the search space breaks down , hill - climbing algorithms will perform poorly .
If the neighbors of a good point are no more likely to be good than randomly selected points , then a hill - climbing algorithm simply wo n't work .
But still , does n't a local search algorithm need to make random changes to the current point in order to generate neighbors for evaluation ?
Not necessarily ; some local search algorithms systematically generate all possible neighbors , and select the best one .
These greedy algorithms work fine for some problems , but on other problems it has been found that greedy local algorithms get stuck in local minima .
The next step up from greedy local algorithms , in terms of added randomness , is random - restart hill - climbing - as soon as we find a local maximum , we restart someplace random , and repeat this process a number of times .
For our final solution , we return the best local maximum found when time runs out .
Random - restart hill - climbing is surprisingly useful ; it can easily solve some problem classes where any individual starting point is unlikely to lead to a global maximum or acceptable solution , but it is likely that at least one of a thousand individual starting points will lead to the global maximum or acceptable solution .
The non-randomly - restarting , greedy , local - maximum - grabbing algorithm , is " stupid " at the stage where it gets stuck in a local maximum .
Once you find a local maximum , you know you 're not going to do better by greedy local search - so you may as well try something else with your time .
Picking a random point and starting again is drastic , but it 's not as stupid as searching the neighbors of a particular local maximum over and over again .
( Biological species often do get stuck in local optima .
Evolution , being unintelligent , has no mind with which to " notice " when it is testing the same gene complexes over and over . )
Even more stupid is picking a particular starting point , and then evaluating its fitness over and over again , without even searching its neighbors .
This is the lockpicker who goes on trying 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 forever .
Hill - climbing search is not so much a little bit randomized compared to the completely stupid lockpicker , as almost entirely nonrandomized compared to a completely ignorant searcher .
We search only the local neighborhood , rather than selecting a random point from the entire state space .
That probability distribution has been narrowed enormously , relative to the overall state space .
This exploits the belief - the knowledge , if the belief is correct - that a good point probably has good neighbors .
You can imagine splitting a hill - climbing algorithm into components that are " deterministic " ( or rather , knowledge - exploiting ) and " randomized " ( the leftover ignorance ) .
A programmer writing a probabilistic hill - climber will use some formula to assign probabilities to each neighbor , as a function of the neighbor 's fitness .
For example , a neighbor with a fitness of 60 might have probability 80 % of being selected , while other neighbors with fitnesses of 55 , 52 , and 40 might have selection probabilities of 10 % , 9 % , and 1 % .
The programmer writes a deterministic algorithm , a fixed formula , that produces these numbers - 80 , 10 , 9 , and 1 .
What about the actual job of making a random selection at these probabilities ?
Usually the programmer will hand that job off to someone else 's pseudo - random algorithm - most language 's standard libraries contain a standard pseudo - random algorithm ; there 's no need to write your own .
If the hill - climber does n't seem to work well , the programmer tweaks the deterministic part of the algorithm , the part that assigns these fixed numbers 80 , 10 , 9 , and 1 .
The programmer does not say - " I bet these probabilities are right , but I need a source that 's even more random , like a thermal noise generator , instead of this merely pseudo - random algorithm that is ultimately deterministic ! "
The programmer does not go in search of better noise .
It is theoretically possible for a poorly designed " pseudo - random algorithm " to be stupid relative to the search space ; for example , it might always jump in the same direction .
But the " pseudo - random algorithm " has to be really shoddy for that to happen .
You 're only likely to get stuck with that problem if you reinvent the wheel instead of using a standard , off - the - shelf solution .
A decent pseudo - random algorithm works just as well as a thermal noise source on optimization problems .
It is possible ( though difficult ) for an exceptionally poor noise source to be exceptionally stupid on the problem , but you cannot do exceptionally well by finding a noise source that is exceptionally random .
The power comes from the knowledge - the deterministic formula that assigns a fixed probability distribution .
It does not reside in the remaining ignorance .
And that 's why I always say that the power of natural selection comes from the selection part , not the mutation part .
As a general principle , on any problem for which you know that a particular unrandomized algorithm is unusually stupid - so that a randomized algorithm seems wiser - you should be able to use the same knowledge to produce a superior derandomized algorithm .
If nothing else seems obvious , just avoid outputs that look " unrandomized " !
If you know something is stupid , deliberately avoid it !
( There are exceptions to this rule , but they have to do with defeating cryptographic adversaries - that is , preventing someone else 's intelligence from working on you .
Certainly entropy can act as an antidote to intelligence ! )
And of course there are very common practical exceptions whenever the computational cost of using all our knowledge exceeds the marginal benefit ...
Still you should find , as a general principle , that randomness hath no power : there is no beauty in entropy , nor strength from noise .
Rolf Reber , together with mathematician Morten Brun and psychologist Karoline Mitterndorfer , all from the University of Bergen , Norway , have reported first empirical evidence for the use of beauty as truth and they have provided an explanation for this phenomenon , based on the processing fluency theory of beauty .
Mathematicians and scientists reportedly used beauty as a cue for truth in mathematical judgment .
French mathematician Jacques Hadamard , for example , wrote in 1954 in his famous book , “ The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field , " that a sense of beauty seems to be almost the only useful “ drive ” for discovery in mathematics .
However , evidence has been anecdotal , and the nature of the beauty - truth relationship remained a mystery .
In 2004 , Rolf Reber ( University of Bergen ) , Norbert Schwarz ( University of Michigan ) , and Piotr Winkielman ( University of California at San Diego ) suggested – based on evidence they reviewed – that the common experience underlying both perceived beauty and judged truth is processing fluency , which is the experienced ease with which mental content is processed .
Indeed , stimuli processed with greater ease elicit more positive affect and statements that participants can read more easily are more likely to be judged as being true .
Researchers invoked processing fluency to help explain a wide range of phenomena , including variations in stock prices , brand preferences , or the lack of reception of mathematical theories that are difficult to understand .
Applied to mathematical reasoning , processing fluency , stemming either from familiarity with problems or from attributes of a task , is predicted to increase intuitively judged truth .
As a first step towards testing this assumption , the authors of the study demonstrated in two experiments that symmetry , a feature known to facilitate mental processing and to underlie perceived beauty , is used as heuristic cue to correctness in arithmetic problems .
The researchers constructed additions , consisting of dots .
For example , 12 dots plus 21 dots equaled 33 dots .
Half of the additions were correct ; the others were wrong , such as 12 dots plus 21 dots equaled 27 dots .
Half of the additions had symmetric dot patterns ( symmetric additions ) , the other half asymmetric patterns ( asymmetric additions ) .
These additions were presented briefly , e.g. , in one experiment 1800 milliseconds , and student participants without training in mathematics had to decide immediately after the addition disappeared whether it was correct or incorrect .
Participants were more likely to judge symmetric additions than asymmetric additions to be correct .
As this was also the case when additions in fact were incorrect , the finding cannot be explained by the fact that symmetric additions were easier to count or to estimate :
In this case , symmetric additions that were incorrect would have been less likely to be judged correct .
The results clearly show that participants used symmetry as an indication to correctness , or beauty as truth .
The authors have shown that people who do not have enough time to analyze the problem use heuristic cues in order to assess the correctness of a proposed solution .
This simple setup serves as a model for the more complicated situation where a mathematician has discovered a plausible solution to a problem and now wants a quick assessment of whether this solution “ feels ” right .
These findings suggest a solution to the mystery why beauty serves as a cue for truth in the context of mathematical discovery .
The UCC has Ubuntu - on - Tap !
Possibly conceived as the brainchild of mad-man hacker Davyd Madeley ( but possibly not ) the has UCC installed a network port for the express purpose of installing Ubuntu .
The Ubuntu Port was installed by the combined efforts of David Basden , Matt Johnston , Davyd Madeley , James French ( who broke the network , twice ) , one power drill , a multimeter named Albert and the Klone Krone .
The port is allocated to its own VLAN on one of our Cisco Catalyst switches , and fed into the trunk of the router madako .
Madako offers network bootable images to anyone who boots via DHCP on this port , as well as allowing access to UWA 's Ubuntu and Debian mirrors .
As of ( unknown ) , the Ubuntu On Tap port has been removed from its own VLAN , and it is now possible to netboot Ubuntu and other operating systems from any clubroom LAN port .
Using the Port
To install Ubuntu on your machine , follow these easy - peasy steps :
Plug in via Ethernet ( try not to steal Ethernet cables from a machine ) ; Reboot your machine ;
Tell your machine to network boot ( many laptops allow you to select the boot source by pressing F12 ) ; Follow the prompts ( just hit Enter at the image selection screen ) ; and , while you wait , Listen to the Ubuntu theme song ( as heard on LugRadio ) .
The port also allows you to install Debian from UWA 's mirror , and test your machine 's RAM using Memtest86 +.
To install Debian on your machine , follow these easy - peasy steps :
Plug in via Ethernet anywhere in the clubroom ( try not to steal Ethernet cables from a machine ) ; Reboot your machine ;
Tell your machine to network boot ( many laptops allow you to select the boot source by pressing F12 ) ; Follow the prompts , hitting F3 at the image selection screen DO NOT HIT ENTER AT THE ' boot ' prompt , this will select Ubuntu , and you do n't want this , instead type the name of the version you want , such as sarge 26 ... then hit enter Listen to some better music than the Ubuntu song while you wait
Future Goals
Teach it to recognise Apple machines , and netboot those appropriately ;
Offer a list of Ubuntu architectures where it is undetectable , as well as Live images , and perhaps other Free operating systems ;
Get a nicer sticker and a neon sign ( Ubuntu on Tap ) ;
Install an Ubuntu Power - Point that not only recharges your laptop , but delivers Ubuntu over IEEE P1901 ;
...
Profit !
Davyd has ( boring ) photos on line .
Boring Technical Details
Coming Soon !
Memtest86 + took far too long to get working .
There is a documented ' feature ' in PXELINUX that treats image files ending in '.bin ' ( among other things ) as a special case .
However , it also treats symlinks to files named '. bin ' as a special case , even when the symlink does not contain the characters '. bin ' anywhere in the name .
The theme song is played from a script on madako that is fed tftpd log entries .
When it sees the Ubuntu kernel loading , it connects to maroon , and enqueues the theme song .

In his first televised interviews since being named the chief of staff for President - elect Barack Obama , Rahm Emanuel on Sunday called for swifter action to lift the struggling auto industry and suggested Mr. Obama and President Bush might clash over a stimulus package .
On the first weekend since Mr. Obama was elected president , several of his aides said his administration would attempt to roll back a number of Bush administration policies , including tight restrictions on stem cell research and a push for oil and gas drilling in Utah .
The statements indicated that the first few months of an Obama administration could bring about stark reversals on controversial policies .
But Mr. Obama ’s aides emphasized that his first priority would be finding ways to repair the battered economy , whose latest woes include a steep drop - off in retail sales and the loss of about one million jobs .
The auto industry has been particularly hard hit , with Ford and General Motors pleading for government help after car sales plummeted 18 percent this quarter .
General Motors , the country ’s largest carmaker , reported a $ 4.2 billion third - quarter operating loss , and said it may be on the brink of collapse .
Over the weekend , the Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , and the Senate Majority leader , Harry Reid , sent a letter to the Bush administration requesting that funds from the $ 700 billion bailout package  intended for Wall Street  be used to help carmakers as well .
But the White House has signaled that it would oppose such a measure .
Ok so I 'd like to share a very special CEFD - which in this case is Crap Email From My Dad .
He is very conservative but reads
The Economist religiously and agrees with them on basically everything .
So yesterday when they endorsed Obama I was so frickin excited , and I emailed him " The Economist Endorsed Obama !!
Have you voted yet ?
Could they sway you ?
Love , Mmmmkay " and this is what I got back -
No , neither could the Financial Times , the Frankfurter Algemine or Der Spiegl ( the non US media that I read regularly ) which I also read and respect .
All data is relevant to me .
I encourage you and me to seek all data and make our own decisions .
I believe I have always done my best to do that with my children and others .
I am disappointed that individuals do not seek as much data a from all sides of an issue before they decide .
Maybe it does n't seem so bad but its just the epitome of my dad 's total ass - hole condescending tone when it comes to politics .
I just wrote back " Ok , well , I love you " and left it at that .
On Friday , Mahoney and I went to Panasonic HQ to check out one of the first prototypes of their ludicrous 150 - inch plasma TV .
This thing puts the 103 - incher that I checked out last year to shame , weighing a whopping 1700 pounds before the stand is attached and sucking up 7 kW of power while it runs .
We hooked up our energy - efficient - in - comparison PS3 and suffered through playing a bunch of video games on it to report back to you .
You 're welcome !
Today , a taste , with me sizing up a weighted companion cube in Portal , above , and , after the jump , seeing what a 42 - inch steering wheel on Gran Turismo would be like in real life and learning the ropes in Call of Duty 4 .

UK security agencies are sifting through information sent by Indian authorities to establish whether British Muslims were involved in the terrorist attacks in Mumbai that traumatised India .
The search to track down the " British connection " in the carnage began after a number of Indian officials claimed that evidence had been found on dead and captured gunmen linking them to the UK .
Senior Whitehall sources confirmed that police and the security and intelligence services were combing through information sent by Indian authorities to ascertain whether any of the group which carried out the assault were UK citizens or had visited or lived in this country .
According to one report , four of the terrorists , two of them dead , had connections with Britain .
The Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh told Associated Press that two British - born Pakistanis were among the eight gunmen arrested by Indian authorities .
However , British officials stressed they had not yet received " hard " evidence that the men were British nationals .
" There is a hell of a lot going on at the minute and it is not just a matter of citizenship – that 's a bit of a red herring , " said one source .
" We are trying to establish whether any of these men had been in this country and who they lived with , who they associated with , but it is very early days . "
At least 155 people are known to have died in the multi-pronged attacks .
Last night , the Indian government said the death toll could hit 200 .
Britain 's security agencies confirmed they were looking through intelligence on domestic suspects with overseas extremist links and reviewing tracked telephone calls to see if the " chatter " revealed British citizens were involved in the Mumbai plot .
Investigators are said to be concentrating on the Kashmiri separatist group Lashkar - e - Taiba , which has previously recruited from the UK .
Rashid Rauf , who was wanted in connection with a terrorist plot to blow up transatlantic airliners and was reported to have been killed recently in an American missile strike , was associated with Lashkar .
Unconfirmed reports from India stated that some of the terrorists were from Dewsbury and Bradford , areas from which some in the Muslim community had left in the past to join jihadist groups abroad .
Security officials stated that all leads were be explored but stressed that no arrests had taken place in this country yet in relation to the Mumbai attacks .
Gordon Brown said : " At no point has the Prime Minister of India [ Manmohan Singh ] suggested ... there is evidence ... of any terrorist of British origins , but obviously these are huge investigations ... and I think it will be premature to draw any conclusions at all . "
Security officials said it was looking increasingly likely that Lashkar - e - Taiba , previously known as Jaish - e - Mohammed , was involved in the attack with the militant group , Indian Mujaheddin .
They played down suggestions of a direct al - Qa'ida link .
As anti-terrorist officers from Scotland Yard flew out to Mumbai , security officials urged against jumping to conclusions on documentation which may have been found on the gunmen , pointing out that they may be forged .
What was crucial , said a senior source , was to establish their links in Britain and find people they had been associating with .
Ed Husain , director of the Quilliam Foundation , a think - tank that campaigns against extremism , said of the reports of British involvement in the attacks : " British Muslim leaders need to take their heads out of the sand and begin systematically dismantling the warped theology that has inspired these and other attacks .
Unless our government is bolder in identifying Islamism as the root cause of extremism , we will only be responding to and not preventing terrorism .
Extremist Islamist groups continue to hold events in England and recruit new followers .
Radical Islamism has no place in our country . "
There were still many unanswered questions last night about how many of the gunmen had been in the cell and the degree of planning they undertook before launching their operation .
Indian officials said the gunmen had been arrested and were being questioned by anti-terrorism officers .
Meanwhile another report , carried on the Indian NDTV news channel , suggested there may have been a total of 40 militants , 29 of them from Pakistan and the remainder from Bangladesh .
What does seem clear is that the gunmen were well - armed and well - trained .
It might also be assumed that while they may have made extensive plans about the attacks , there was no plan to escape .
No demands were made of the authorities and no attempt was made to use hostages to further their cause , except to cause terror .
It was , in effect , a suicide mission .
Yesterday , evidence about the training and planning of the gunmen came from the commandos whose task was to confront the militants .
At both the Taj Mahal and Trident - Oberoi hotels , they said it had been a game of cat - and - mouse .
" These people were very , very familiar with the hotel layouts and it appears they had carried out a survey before , " said one commando , who declined to be named .
He said the gunmen used their knowledge to move skillfully from place to place .
" [ They ] showed no remorse to anybody ; whoever came in front of them they fired at , " he added .
" They appeared to be a determined lot , wanting to create and spread terror . "
The gunmen had come well - prepared .
One backpack discovered by the commandos contained 400 rounds of ammunition .
It is understood that some of the gunmen were carrying bags of almonds to eat during a long siege .
They also had foreign currency and credit cards .
Not only were they well armed with assault rifles and hand grenades , but they knew how to use them .
The commando added : " It 's obvious they were trained somewhere ... not everyone can handle the AK series of weapons or throw grenades like that . "
Other questions will inevitably focus on how the gunmen were able to reach the coastline undetected .
Some experts have suggested a lack of co-ordination between marine authorities .

KABUL ( Reuters ) - Afghanistan ’s Taliban , notorious for summary public executions , urged the United Nations on Thursday to press the Afghan government to stop executing prisoners on death row , citing concern about fair trials .

Afghanistan resumed executions this week after a break of more than a year , with three Taliban sentenced for deadly attacks among nine people put to death in the past few days .
Those executions followed a public outcry over rising crime .
About 120 other people have been sentenced to death and their fate rests with President Hamid Karzai , who has to approve any execution order .
The United Nations and European Union have called on Karzai to halt the executions , citing concern about the standards of judicial fairness .
The United Nations says Afghanistan ’s law enforcement and judicial systems fall far short of internationally accepted standards .
The Taliban leadership council said it too was worried about fair trials .
“ We strongly request the U.N. , the EU , the Red Cross and human rights groups to earnestly prevent this barbaric act , ” the Taliban said in a statement on their website , accusing Karzai ’s government of corruption .
The Taliban , fighting to overthrow Karzai ’s pro-Western government , have executed dozens of captured soldiers and civilians since U.S. - led forces ousted the militant Islamist movement in 2001 .
During their 1996 - 2001 rule in Afghanistan , the Taliban executed dozens of people , occasionally staging killings in public at Kabul ’s main sports stadium .
In their statement , the Taliban warned the government against more executions , saying the officials responsible for them would be punished .
The Taliban have stepped up their insurgency over the past two years and crime has increased as security has deteriorated .
Fed up with crime , many ordinary Afghans have called on the government to carry out death sentences .
The Taliban won public support in the 1990s , emerging from religious schools on the Pakistani border and largely wiped out crime as they took over the country .
The Route 4 crash occurred when a southbound driver , Maynard Palmer , 61 , of Gaithersburg , Md. , crossed the yellow line in a rented black Mercury sedan and struck a Washington County Department of Public Works dump truck , the State Police said .
The Mercury spun and struck a northbound Toyota Camry in front of Adirondack Natural Stone Co. , police said .
Palmer was flown to Albany Medical Center with serious head injuries and was listed in critical condition as of Friday .
He had been visiting a relative in Vermont and was driving to Albany International Airport when the crash took place .
The driver of the dump truck , Edward McCullen , 33 , of Granville , and the operator of the Toyota , David Koran , of Ballston Lake , were taken to Glens Falls Hospital with non-life - threatening injuries , police said .
Neither man was in the hospital ’s public directory last week .
Koran said he suffered deep contusions to his legs , arms and shoulder .
His hands smashed into the dashboard as a result of the impact of the crash , he said .
" That caused a piece of the dashboard to go through my finger into the bone , " he wrote .
" I had my seatbelt on but the impact bruised the shape of my seatbelt across my chest , but it saved my life .
" Police could not provide an update on the investigation into the crash when contacted Thursday night .
They previously said it was not yet known what caused Palmer to cross the yellow line .
“ When I ’m trying to explain our program to someone who does n’t know it , I stammer a bunch of words like ‘ entertaining , ’ ‘ funny , ’ ‘ surprising plot twists , ’ ‘ true stories but not boring I swear ’ … and then I just give them this list . ” — Ira Glass
The information commissioner is to be given stronger powers to regulate the Data Protection Act ( DPA ) following a proposal from justice secretary Jack Straw .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) will now have the power to enforce a fine on the controllers of data who recklessly or deliberately lose personal data .
The ICO will be able to carry out checks , without notification , of government departments and public authorities ensuring that they fully comply with the DPA .
The office can also require any person , served a warrant , to provide evidence that they are complying with the act and determine a deadline and location for the information to be given .
They will also be responsible for publishing guidance for when the ICO should be notified about breaches and for publishing a practical Code of Practice .
Jack Straw said : " Strong regulation and clear guidance is essential if we are to ensure the effective protection of personal data .
" The changes we propose today will strengthen the information commissioner 's ability to enforce the Data Protection Act and improve the transparency and accountability of organisations dealing with personal information .
This is very important if we are to regain public confidence in the handling and sharing of personal information . "
The funding structure will also be revised from a flat rate notification fee , which has been in place since 1984 , to tiered structure fee based on the size of the organisation .
This change will better reflect the level of work that the ICO performs and also provide additional funds .
The secretary of state will also have the power to allow or force the sharing of personal information between selected persons , where a case calls for this .
It is hoped that tougher regulations and an increase in accountability will increase public confidence in the government 's handling of personal data .
RHINEBECK NY , 22 September 2008 --
On the evening of September 18th 2008 , the American democratic system was replaced by a financial dictatorship .
What was billed as a " Federal Bailout " was nothing less than a bloodless coup .
The Wall Street Gang had taken over the White House and control of Washington .
Congress promised not to resist , and pledged to pass legislation as demanded .
Warning that America 's financial system was perilously close to collapse unless immediate action was taken , economic martial law was declared .
The American people were told that from this day forward , they would be responsible for paying off the bad debt from any failing private financial enterprise deemed " too big to fail . "
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , spearheading the coup , sought unrestricted authority to spend the nation 's money as he saw fit .
The first order of business by the Economic Czar was to take trillions of dollars of bad debt from crumbling investment banks and insurance companies and transfer it to the backs of already debt - burdened citizens .
" We 're talking hundreds of billions , " said Paulson , former CEO of Goldman Sachs , one of the " too - big - to - fails . "
Within days of the takeover , the number jumped into the trillions .
This will put a " significant amount of taxpayers ' money on the line , " he said .
Quick & Clean
In simple language , with cameras rolling , in broad daylight , the American public was robbed blind .
This was n't a magic show .
There were no hidden tricks or sleights of hand .
" We want this to be clean , we want this to be quick , " demanded the Economic Czar .
" We need to get this done quickly , and the cleaner the better , " intoned President Bush , with the urgency of his " smoking gun that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud " logic he used as a pretext to invade Iraq .
" The risk of not acting would be far higher , " Bush said , promising to " work with Congress to get a bill done quickly . "
Having accurately forecast the current financial debacle , we confidently now forecast that taking swift action will prove - as it did in Iraq - far more catastrophic than allowing Wall Street to suffer the consequences of its greed and mismanagement .
Presidential candidate Barack Obama promised to " fully support " the plan and called on Congress to take " immediate action . "
Republican challenger John McCain said he would further review the proposal before passing judgment while Congressional leaders from both parties have signed on with their support .
Americans were told they would have to pay to rescue the very companies whose unregulated greed , fraud and recklessness had created the crisis in the first place .
Considered nobodies by the authorities , the people had no voice and had no choice .
" I know of nobody who is arguing over the amount of money or even about that the secretary ought to have the authority to purchase these toxic instruments , these bad debts , '' bowed Senator Christopher Dodd , the Democratic chairman of the Banking Committee .
Publisher 's Note :
If you are a " nobody " who cares about " the amount of money , " and does not believe " the secretary ought to have the authority to purchase these toxic instruments , " take action NOW .
While signing petitions or calling the White House or Washington representatives often proves fruitless , in this emergency we suggest you call , write , pester , hound , and protest .
Call your newspaper , radio and TV stations .
Talk to reporters covering the " DC Heist . "
Tell them what you think and what you want .
Write editorials .
Use the Internet as a call to action .
Use your imagination , wits and common sense to have your voice heard and make your will known .
Until Congress votes on the plan , it is not yet a fait accompli .
Tell them if they vote " yes , " you 'll vote " no . "
Trendpost :
While the transfer of " toxic instruments " from private firms to the national debt will enrich those companies that once had owned them , the measures taken will do nothing to keep the sinking US economy from going under .
The biggest casualty , besides indentured American servants held responsible for paying off the debt , is the US dollar .
The greenback 's getting slaughtered on the foreign exchanges and gold prices , the safe - haven commodity , are once again soaring .
As we previously forecast , we are still predicting " Gold $ 2000 . "

From the LEET ’08 conference : “ Designing and implementing malicious hardware , ” by Samuel T. King , Joseph Tucek , Anthony Cozzie , Chris Grier , Weihang Jiang , and Yuanyuan Zhou .
Abstract :
Hidden malicious circuits provide an attacker with a stealthy attack vector .
As they occupy a layer below the entire software stack , malicious circuits can bypass traditional defensive techniques .
Yet current work on trojan circuits considers only simple attacks against the hardware itself , and straightforward defenses .
More complex designs that attack the software are unexplored , as are the countermeasures an attacker may take to bypass proposed defenses .
We present the design and implementation of Illinois Malicious Processors ( IMPs ) .
There is a substantial design space in malicious circuitry ; we show that an attacker ,
rather than designing one specific attack , can instead design hardware to support attacks .
Such flexible hardware allows powerful , general purpose attacks , while remaining surprisingly low in the amount of additional hardware .
We show two such hardware designs , and implement them in a real system .
Further , we show three powerful attacks using this hardware , including login backdoor that gives an attacker complete and highlevel access to the machine .
This login attack requires only 1341 additional gates : gates that can be used for other attacks as well .
Malicious processors are more practical , more flexible , and harder to detect than an initial analysis would suggest .
7 state workers now agree to testify in ' Troopergate ' probe Associated Press
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( AP ) - Seven Alaska state employees have reversed course and agreed to testify in an investigation into whether Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin abused her powers by firing a commissioner who refused to dismiss her former brother - in - law .
There is no indication , however , that Palin or her husband will now agree to testify about the case , which has dogged her for the past several months and could hurt John McCain in the final weeks of the presidential race .
Palin , a first - term Alaska governor , is the focus of a legislative inquiry over her firing of Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan a year after she , her husband and key advisers began questioning him about getting rid of a state trooper who had gone through a nasty divorce with her sister .

U.S. AND ALLIES TORTURED KIDS IN IRAQ PRISONS
By Sherwood Ross
Since it invaded Iraq in 2003 , the U.S. has detained thousands of juveniles — some of whom were tortured and sexually abused , according to published reports .
Figures of the number of children behind bars vary .
Some estimates put the number as high as 6,000 .
While the criminal abuse of male prisoners at Abu Ghraib is well known , child and women prisoners held there have also been tortured and raped , according to Neil Mackay of Glasgow ’s “ Sunday Herald . ” 
Abu Ghraib prison is located about 20 miles west of Baghdad .
Iraqi lawyer Sahar Yasiri , representing the Federation of Prisoners and Political Prisoners , said in a published interview there are more than 400,000 detainees in Iraq being held in 36 prisons and camps and that 95 percent of the 10,000 women among them have been raped .
Children , he said , “ suffer from torture , rape , ( and ) starvation ”  and do not know why they have been arrested .
He added the children have been victims of “ random ”  arrests “ not based on any legal text . ” 
Former prisoner Thaar Salman Dawod in a witness statement said , “ ( I saw ) two boys naked and they were cuffed together face to face and ( a US soldier ) was beating them and a group of guards were watching and taking pictures and there was three female soldiers laughing at the prisoners . ” 
Iraqi TV reporter , Suhaib Badr - Addin al - Baz , arrested while making a documentary and thrown into Abu Ghraib for 74 days , told Mackay he saw “ hundreds ”  of children there .
Al - Baz said he heard one 12 - year - old girl crying , “ They have undressed me .
They have poured water over me . ” 
He said he heard her whimpering daily .
Al - Baz also told of a 15 - year - old boy “ who was soaked repeatedly with hoses until he collapsed . ” 
Amnesty International said ex-detainees reported boys as young as 10 are held at Abu Ghraib .
German TV reporter Thomas Reutter of “ Report Mainz ”  quoted U.S. Army Sgt. Samuel Provance that interrogation specialists “ poured water ”  over one 16 - year - old Iraqi boy , drove him throughout a cold night , “ smeared him with mud ”  and then showed him to his father , who was also in custody .
Apparently , one tactic employed by the Bush regime is to elicit confessions from adults by dragging their abused children in front of them .
The Los Angeles Times as far back as August 26 , 2004 , reported U.S. military police at Abu Ghraib “ used Army dogs to play a bizarre game in which they scared teenage detainees into defecating and urinating on themselves . ” 
And reporter Hersh told the American Civil Liberties Union convention he has seen videotapes of Iraqi boys that were sodomized , “ and the worst part is the soundtrack of the boys shrieking . ” 
Jonathan Steele , wrote in the British “ The Guardian ”  this past Sept. 9th , “ Hundreds of children , some as young as nine , are being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad ’s prisons , sleeping in sweltering temperatures in overcrowded cells , without working fans , no daily access to showers , and subject to frequent sexual abuse by guards , current and former prisoners say . ” 
Sixteen - year - old Omar Ali told the “ Guardian ”  he spent more than three years at Karkh juvenile prison sleeping with 75 boys to a cell that is just five by 10 meters , some of them on the floor .
Omar told the paper guards often take boys to a separate room in the prison and rape them .
As the occupying authority in Iraq , the Bush administration cannot escape legal responsibility for the torture crimes of Iraqi jailers or for the deplorable conditions in the prisons they operate .
Raad Jamal , age 17 , was taken from his Doura home by U.S. troops and turned over to the Iraqi Army ’s Second regiment where Jamal said he was hung from the ceiling by ropes and beaten with electric cables .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) last June put the number of juveniles detained at 513 .
The grounds : they pose “ imperative security risks . ” 
In all , HRW estimates , since 2003 , the U.S. has detained 2,400 children in Iraq , some as young as ten .
HRW said the children “ are subject to interrogations , have no access to lawyers , and sometimes are held for more than a year without charge , in violation of the United States ’ own regulations . ” 
It said children “ have very limited contact with their families . ” 
HRW called upon the U.S. to “ ensure that children it takes into custody are treated according to their status as children , and given prompt judicial review and access to independent monitors . ” 
Apparently , this has not been the case .
Clarisa Bencomo , of HRW ’s Children ’s Rights Division said , “ The vast majority of children detained in Iraq languish for months in U.S. military custody .
The U.S. should provide these children with immediate access to lawyers and an independent judicial review of their detention . ” 
IRIN , the humanitarian news service , last year quoted Khalid Rabia of the Iraqi NGO Prisoners ’ Association for Justice ( PAJ ) , stating : “ Children are being treated as adults in Iraqi prisons and our investigations have shown that they are being abused and tortured . ” 
IRIN was refused permission to visit child prisoners .
Five boys between 13 and 17 accused of supporting insurgents and detained by the Iraqi army “ showed signs of torture all over their bodies , ”  such as “ cigarette burns over their legs , ”  she said .
One boy of 13 arrested in Afghanistan in 2002 was held in solitary for more than a year at Bagram and Guantanamo and made to stand in stress position and deprived of sleep .
And 15 - year - old Omar Khadr , a Canadian , was held in Guantanamo for two years without being allowed to see a lawyer or have contact with his family .
Khadr has been held for a total of six years .
According to the current “ Catholic Worker , ”  Mohammed Jawad was 17 when captured in Afghanistan and was subjected to sleep deprivation at Gitmo day and night for two weeks .
Every three hours jailers shackled and transfered him to another cell under a “ frequent flier ”  program , forcing him to change cells 112 times .
Jawad ’s defense lawyer Air Force Major David J.R.
Frakt said the most likely reason Gitmo authorities tortured the youth ( who had attempted suicide five months earlier ) was “ for sport , to teach him a lesson , perhaps to make an example of him to others . ” 
Officials from UNAMI , the United Nations Assistance Mission to Iran , said that children awaiting trial at severely overcrowded Tobchi prison , Baghdad , said they had been tortured and sexually abused while in custody in adult facilities prior to their transfer to Tobchi , and showed the marks to prove it .
And at Karkh juvenile prison , children showed skin sores from lying on soggy mattresses in temperatures that average 112 during the day .
Former President Jimmy Carter wrote in “ Our Endangered Values ” ( Simon & Schuster ) that the Red Cross found after visiting six U.S. prisons “ 107 detainees under eighteen , some as young as eight years old . ” 
And reporter Hersh , ( who broke the Abu Ghraib torture scandal , ) reported 800 - 900 Pakistani boys aged 13 to 15 in custody .
President Carter wrote that the Red Cross , Amnesty International and the Pentagon “ have gathered substantial testimony of torture of children , confirmed by soldiers who witnessed or participated in the abuse . ” 
In an effort to conceal conditions in its Iraqi compounds , the U.S. has closed them to human rights monitors such as AI , HRW , and the International Federation of Human Rights , says Ciara Gilmartin , the Security Council Program Coordinator at Global Policy Forum ( GPF ) , a New York - based organization that seeks to strengthen international law .
GPF called for opening the Iraqi detention facilities “ to national and international observers ”  and for establishing clear accountability for U.S. officers and contractors in charge of the prisons .
“ The whole abusive system must be thoroughly overhauled or closed down , ”  Gilmartin said .
“ U.S. military and civilian leaders are not the only ones complicit in the abuse and lack of due process of Iraqi detainees .
All who stay silent in the face of the Iraq gulag allow it to continue . ” 
In 2005 , the AP reported from Geneva that UNICEF was “ profoundly disturbed ”  by reports of abuse of children in Iraq prisons .
“ Any mistreatment , sexual abuse , exploitation or torture of children in detention is a violation of international law , ”  UNICEF spokesman Damien Peronnaz said .
According to a report by Felicity Arbuthnot published last June 9th in Global Research , the UN Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict , Radhika Coomarswarmy , said children are not allowed any outside lawyers and may be held hostage to force an adult family male to give himself up .
HRW said that as of February of this year the length of detention for children was more than 130 days and “ some children have been detained for more than a year without charge or trial , in violation of the Coalition Provisional Authority memorandum on criminal procedures .
Not surprisingly , “ One of the biggest complaints ( by Iraqis ) is that the vast majority of ( U.S. ) detainees have not been charged with any crime , ”  David Enders writes in the October 27 issue of The Nation .
Although President Bush says he reads the Bible , the words about children Matthew ascribes to Jesus may not have sunk in and so are worthy of repeating : “ Who so shall offend one of these little ones ” ¦it were better that a millstone was hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea . ” 

Buffets are chemistry labs .
You ’ve got every element on the Foodiodic Table sitting in front of you in tiny black plastic containers .
There ’s smeared clumps of feta and pickled beets in the salad bar , greasy cheese pizza congealing under table lamps , and mini chocolate eclairs sitting pretty in paper wraps .
My favorite buffet was back at my old college dining hall .
It was fun eating in a roomful of scraggly - beard - and - pajama - pant teens buzzing over late Saturday breakfast , getting ready for Friday night , or just hogging out over the lunchtime trough .
And whether your buffet is the cruise ship , clinking casino , or Chinese restaurant , I ’m hoping you always find tipsy piles of heavy ceramic plates , chocolate milk on tap , and screaming kids scrambling to invent beautiful buffet hybrids amidst all the mayhem .
Let ’s count down five of the best :
5. Curry French Fries .
Since big plates of fries are pretty standard at most cafeteria buffets , it ’s all about figuring out new ways to color them up .
Farty squirts of ketchup , cheese and gravy , or if you ’re really adventurous , grabbing a ladle of curry sauce from the spicy chicken soaking in the metal tin next door .
4 . Apple pie in a waffle cone .
Hey , who says only ice cream gets to enjoy the sugary home of the waffle cone ?
Not us !
Nope , throw some apple pie in there for good measure or a couple brownies and some whipped cream if you ’re feeling crazy .
Feel free to try the “ food in another food ’s home ” technique elsewhere , too .
Spaghetti on a hot - dog bun , pita pockets filled with meatballs , chicken nuggets on an English muffin , yes , yes , yes .
3. Chicken finger fried rice .
Most cafeterias are home to boring bland trays of rice or noodles .
And even when you ’re given some yellow rice with peas or fried rice with tiny cubes of pork , it ’s still time to upgrade .
Chopping chicken fingers in fried rice is a good start .
For those with arteries to spare , you can also try the classic Fried Chicken Fried Rice , which is fun to whip out in a food court .
2. All Won Ton , No Broth Soup .
Back when our ancestors were tearing apart buffalo on open plains , I bet there was this one jerk in the tribe who would swing by just after the slaughter to swipe a big juicy leg .
He ’d let everyone else peel meat off feet and ears and suck marrow from bones while he sat by the fire and chomped away at the juiciest piece on the beast .
Well , that ’s kind of what the All Won Ton , No Broth Guy is doing to the soup .
We do n’t like them unless they ’re us .
Same goes for Taking - All - The - Shrimp - In - This - Shrimp - Pasta Guy and Stealing - That - Extra - Pepperoni - That ’s - Technically - On - The - Other - Slice Guy .
1. Creating a fake version of something you ca n’t find .
No pizza ?
No problem !
Just smear spaghetti sauce on a piece of bread and sprinkle it with cheese from the salad bar before tossing it in the toaster oven .
No tacos ?
No worries !
Fold a pita around some roast beef cold cuts and cover it with sliced cheese , shredded lettuce , and barbecue sauce .
It ’s not always pretty but creating fake versions of something you can’t find can help satisfy strong urges .
People , inventing foods at buffet is just part of who we are .
It makes meals sparkle with new taste sensations and breathes life into old flavors .
Just think about the first time the Earl of Sandwich invented the sandwich .
Dude was merging meat , cheese , and bread into a gem and he did n’t even know it .
Flash forward a few hundred years and inventing new foods is now part of our DNA .
It ’s in our blood .
It ’s in our genes .
It ’s in our cheap plastic bowls still wet from the dishwasher .
AWESOME !

Dell Equipping All New Laptops with Energy Efficient LED Displays
September 24th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Dell has announced that it plans have LED ( light - emitting diode ) backlit displays in 80 percent of its computers by 2008 and in all of them by 2010 .
LED displays consume 43 percent less energy for a 15 inch screen than standard CCFL ( cold cathode fluorescent lamp ) displays .
According to the company , its LED displays will save $ 20 million and 220 million KWh in 2010 and 2011 combined .
In addition to being energy - efficient , LED displays also extend a notebook computer ’s battery life from an average of 3 hours to 6 hours .
LED displays also allow for much thinner panels .
Computer manufacturers have been slow to get on the LED bandwagon , so Dell deserves some serious credit for its announcement .
Apple says it plans to get rid of CCFL displays eventually — but gives no timeline — and Hewlett - Packard sells optional LED displays on some of its computers .

US President George W Bush has defended a rescue package to tackle the worst financial markets crisis for decades .
The cost to taxpayers of shoring up markets was better than the alternative of job losses and diminished pensions , he said in his weekly radio address .
The US Treasury is proposing a fund worth up to $ 700 bn ( £ 382 bn ) to buy back much of the bad debt held by banks and other financial institutions .
The fund would aim to sell off these mortgage - related debts in the future .
Mr Bush said the measures required the US " to put a significant amount of taxpayer dollars on the line " .
" But I 'm convinced that this bold approach will cost American families far less than the alternative , " he said .
" Further stress on our financial markets would cause massive job losses , devastate retirement accounts , further erode housing values , and dry up new loans for homes , cars and college tuitions . "
' Devil in the detail ' Congressional and Treasury officials have been meeting over the weekend and the package is expected to be signed into law within days .
New laws will soon to be passed to free US banks from loans they cannot sell The US Treasury has revealed little detail of its ambitious package , other than the estimated cost of buying these bad debts and who is eligible for the scheme .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has asked for congressional approval to raise the amount the government can borrow to $ 11.3 trillion ( from $ 10.6 trillion ) to cover that cost .
The bailout is only open to financial institutions with " significant operations in the US " , unless the Mr Paulson 's team decides otherwise , according to the Treasury 's draft plan .
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said the devil will be in the detail , for example , how much the Treasury will pay for the banks ' toxic assets .
" There is an argument that Paulson should pay a discount to the market price , to protect US taxpayers and soundly spank the banks and their owners , " our correspondent says .
But such a move would further deplete banks ' resources and " further undermine their ability to lend to the rest of us " , he adds .
It is believed the intention is to find a way of bringing all the bad debts into one organisation whose task will be to hold them on behalf of the taxpayer until they can be sold off at some point in the distant future , says the BBC 's Justin Webb in Washington .
' Queasy Congress '
There are some members of Congress who are queasy at the thought of the taxpayer taking on hundreds of billions of dollars of currently worthless debt , he says .
But the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives , Steney Hoyer , said he expected quick action .
After a week of turmoil , stock markets around the world rallied on news of the rescue plan , with the UK's FTSE 100 closing on Friday with its biggest one - day gain .
Earlier , Mr Bush said swift , politically bipartisan action was needed to keep the US economy from grinding to a halt as problems sparked by the credit crisis had begun to spread through the entire financial system .
PESTON'S PICKS
For us here in the UK the big question is whether what Paulson 's proposing makes it more or less likely that our government will have to launch a similar rescue scheme for our banks
Read Robert 's thoughts in full The US Treasury Secretary said a " bold " move was needed to restore the financial system 's health .
The programme , he said , must be " large enough to have maximum impact " .
In the meantime , he said that the government would be stepping up action to increase the availability of capital for new home loans .
Once this difficult period was over , Mr Paulson said , the government 's next task would be to overhaul bank regulations .
' New economy '
The UK Prime Minister said one of the lessons that of the global financial crisis is the need for international regulation to be brought up to date .
Gordon Brown , speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show , said : " We 're in a new economy , a global financial economy , the world is changing very fast , but the governance of the global financial system has not caught up with it and that 's what 's got to change . "
On Friday , the US government announced plans to guarantee US money market funds - mutual funds that typically invest in low - risk credit such as government bonds and are often used by pension funds - up to a value of $ 50bn , in a move to further restore confidence .
The Treasury and the Fed have finally realised the depth and systemic nature of the crisis
John Ryding , economist
Who 's to blame for the crisis ?
Will the plan work ?
McCain attacks bank assistance Meanwhile , the Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily banned " short - selling " in the stocks of 799 companies .
Short - selling is a form of trading which effectively bets that the value of a company 's shares will fall .
" The Treasury and the Fed have finally realised the depth and systemic nature of the crisis , " said John Ryding , an economist at RDQ Economics " We believe that these actions will constitute the wider firebreak that will contain the crisis . "
Mounting fears that the credit crisis is beginning to spread out through the financial system have rocked shares and companies recently .
Investment giant Lehman Brothers collapsed this week , rival Merrill Lynch was bought out by Bank of America , and the US government has bailed out insurer AIG with an $ 85 bn rescue package and state - backed mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .

What are these ?
You know those new , super - secure , RFID - enabled passports the US is issuing to its citizens ?
They 're manufactured and assembled offshore , in sometimes - unstable regions , the blanks are shipped around using unsecured couriers , and they 're sold to US citizens at an 85 percent profit .
I feel safer already .
Each new e-passport contains a small computer chip inside the back cover that contains the passport number along with the photo and other personal data of the holder .
The data is secured and is transmitted through a tiny wire antenna when it is scanned electronically at border entry points and compared to the actual traveler carrying it .
According to interviews and documents , GPO managers rejected limiting the contracts to U.S. - made computer chip makers and instead sought suppliers from several countries , including Israel , Germany and the Netherlands .
Mr. Somerset , the GPO spokesman , said foreign suppliers were picked because " no domestic company produced those parts " when the e-passport production began a few years ago .
After the computer chips are inserted into the back cover of the passports in Europe , the blank covers are shipped to a factory in Ayutthaya , Thailand , north of Bangkok , to be fitted with a wire Radio Frequency Identification , or RFID , antenna .
The blank passports eventually are transported to Washington for final binding , according to the documents and interviews .

Process Management :
Processes execute within their own process environment , they have their own memory , current working directory , priority , process ID , parent process ID and the file access privileges of the user ID under which they execute .
The basic Linux monitoring commands such as pstree and ps - auxw and top will inform you of the processes running on your system .
Sometimes a process must be terminated .
To terminate a process :
Identify the process : pstree -p
OR
OR ps - auxw
OR
OR top Kill the process : kill < process - id - number >
killall < command - name >
This will perform an orderly shutdown of the process .
If it hangs give a stronger signal with : kill - 9 < process - id - number > .
This method is not as sanitary and thus less preferred .
A signal may be given to the process .
The program must be programmed to handle the given signal .
See /usr / include / bits / signum.h for a full list .
For example , to restart a process after updating it 's configuration file , issue the command kill - HUP < process - id - number >
In the previous example , the HUP signal was sent to the process .
The software was written to trap for the signal so that it could respond to it .
If the software ( command ) is not written to respond to a particular signal , then the sending of the signal to the process is futile .
Identify all known signals : fuser -l

nice : Process Priority Control
Multi-tasking operating systems executes processes in a time slice fashion sharing the processing resources base on their current privilege .
Privileges are not constant and elevate if they have not received an execution allocation in the processor after a given time .
This is to ensure that all processes get executed regardless of priority although a process can get squeezed out of the time allocation alltogether if the system is overloaded .
Higher priority processes may get more time allocated on the processor than a lower priority process but it is likely that the lower process will get some processor allocation .
Many system process which manage the system environment execute at an elevated priority in order to guarentee that they get executed .
User processes can have their priority elevated using the nice command .
Nice values have a range from - 20 ( most favorable scheduling ) to 19 ( least favorable ) .
Beware that if the priority is elevated higer than a system process , the behavior of the system may be compromised .
nice - run a program with modified scheduling priority
- run a program with modified scheduling priority renice - alter priority of running processes Modify process scheduling priority : Lower scheduling priority ( runs slower and less likely to slow you down . )
nice -n 19 program - to - launch
Default for " nice -n " is 10
Default for " " is 10 Show default for any process : nice executable
Shows nice value to be used if run .
IPCs : Semaphores , Shared Memory and Queues
Note that some processes may use Linux InterProcess Communication or IPC ( semaphores , shared memory or queues ) which may need to be cleaned up manually : Identify the semaphores : ipcs
ipcs -q
List share queues .
ipcs -m Shared memory .
ipcs -s List Semaphores .

List processes attached to a given file : lsof filename : [ root@node DIR ] # lsof / var / log / mailman / qrunner python 18538 mailman 4u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18578 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18579 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18580 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18581 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18582 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18583 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner python 18584 mailman 6u REG 3,5 657 486746 /var/log/mailman/qrunner
The process attached to an open file can be killed using the command fuser - ki filename
: The process attached to an open file can be killed using the command List all open files on system : lsof
( Long list )
( Long list )
List all files opened by user : lsof -u user -id
The commands netstat - punta and socklist will list open network connections .
Example : netstat - anp
Use the command lsof -i TCP : port - number to see the processes attached to the port .
Example : [ root@node DIR ] # lsof -i TCP:389 COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME slapd 5927 ldap 6u IPv4 7560023 TCP *: ldap ( LISTEN ) slapd 5928 ldap 6u IPv4 7560023 TCP *: ldap ( LISTEN ) slapd 21185 ldap 6u IPv4 7560023 TCP *: ldap ( LISTEN ) slapd 21186 ldap 6u IPv4 7560023 TCP *: ldap ( LISTEN ) slapd 21193 ldap 6u IPv4 7560023 TCP *: ldap ( LISTEN )
This shows that the command slapd running under user id ldap is running five process connected to port 389 .

Explanation of terms :
Major Page Fault ( MPF ) :
When a request for memory is made but it does not exist in physical memory , a request to the disk subsystem to retrieve pages from virtual memory and buffer them in RAM .
The MPF occurs most when an application is started .
Minor Page Fault ( MnPF ) : Reusing a page in memory as opposed to placing it back on disk .
Filesystems and Storage Devices :
Hard Drive Info :
df -k report filesystem disk space usage .
( - k reports in Kbytes ) du -sh Calculates file space usage for a given directory .
( and everything under it ) ( - s option summarizes ) mount Displays all mounted devices , their mount point , filesystem , and access .
Used with command line arguments to mount file system .
cat / proc / filesystems
Display filesystems currently in use .
cat / proc / mounts
Display mounted filesystems currently in use .
showmount Displays mount info for NFS filesystems .
cat / proc / swaps Displays swap partition (s ) size , type and quantity used .
cat / proc / ide / hda / any - file Displays disk information held by kernel .
Adding an extra hard drive : ( See commands and dialog of adding a second IDE hard drive )
fdisk / dev /< drive > - Allocate drive space and register info on the partition table .
( Option " n " / " p " , then " w " to write . )
Also see : sfdisk - cfdisk mkfs -t ext3 / dev / < drive > - Create file system .
( RH 7.1 and earlier use ext2 , RH 7.2 - 8.0 use ext3 ) mount -t ext3 / dev / < drive 's device name > /< hom e2 or some suitable directory > -
Mount the drive
Mount a raw ISO file : mount -t iso9660 - o loop / home / user1 / RedHat-9.0-i386-Disk1.iso /mnt/iso-1
( Fstab entry : /home/user1/RedHat-9.0-i386-Disk1.iso /mnt/iso-1 iso9660 loop , ro 0 3 )
Also see : mkefs man page
Where the drive is / dev/hdb or some device as conforms to the Linux device names :
IDE drives are referred to as hda for the first drive , hdb for the second etc ... IDE uses separate ribbon cables for primary and secondary drives .
The partitions on each drive are referred numerically .
The first partition on the first drive is referred to as hda1 , the second as hda2 , the third as hda3 etc ...
Linux IDE naming conventions :
Device Description Configuration / dev/hda 1st ( Primary ) IDE controller Master / dev/hdb 1st ( Primary ) IDE controller Slave / dev/hdc 2nd ( Secondary ) IDE controller Master / dev/hdd 2nd ( Secondary ) IDE controller Slave
Note : SCSI disks are labeled / dev/sda , sdb , etc ...
For more info see SCSI info .
Use the command cat / proc / partitions to see full list of disks and partitions that your system can see .
See Linux devices :
Kernel 2.4 : ( Red Hat 7.1 + ) file:/usr/src/linux-2.4/Documentation/devices.txt - ( local file )
Kernel 2.2 : ( Red Hat 7.0 -) file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt ( local file ) - H. Peter Anvin
To make the drive a permanent member of your system and have it mount upon system boot , add it to your /etc / fstab file which holds all the file system information for your system .
See man page for fstab .
Example of existing / etc / fstab file :
/dev/sdb6 / ext2 defaults 1 1 /dev/sdb1 / boot ext2 defaults 1 2 /dev/cdrom / mnt / cdrom iso9660 noauto , user , users , ro 0 0 / dev/fd0 / mnt / floppy auto noauto , owner 0 0 none / proc proc defaults 0 0 none / dev/pts devpts gid=5 , mode=620 0 0 / dev/sdb5 swap swap defaults 0 0
Add SCSI drive by adding line :
/ dev/sdc1 / home2 ext2 defaults 1 2
At this point one may optionally check the file system created with the command : fsck / dev/sdc1
Note that fsck is NOT run against a mounted file system .
Unmount it first if necessary .
( umount )
Also see the man page for :
cfdisk - Curses based disk partition table manipulator .
( very nice )
fdisk - Manipulate / configure the partition table .
sfdisk - Manipulate / configure the partition table .
fsck
Mounting other file systems : ( locally attached drives )
Add system swap space for virtual memory paging :
Swap space may be a swap partition , a swap file or a combination of the two .
One should size swap space to be at least twice the size of the computer 's RAM .
( but less than 2GB ) dd if=/ dev/zero of= / swapfile bs=1024 count=265032 - Create file filled with zeros of size 256Mb mkswap / swapfile - Create swap file swapon / swapfile - Begin use of given swap file .
Assign a priority with the " - p " flag .
swapon -s -
List swap files cat / proc / swaps - Same as above
This example refers to a swap file .
One may also use a swap partition .
Make entry to /etc / fstab to permanently use swap file or partition .
/ swapfile swap swap defaults
0 0 Note :
To remove the use of swap space , use the command swapoff .
If using a swap partition , the partition must be unmounted .

Increase open files limit :
cat / proc / sys / fs/ file-max - Kernel configuration for max number of files cat / proc / sys / fs / file - nr - Number of files presently open echo 4096 > / proc/sys/fs/file-max -
Set max file limit .
( This is default )
cat / proc/sys / fs/inode-max - Kernel 2.2 configuration for max number of inodes
To change : echo 12288 > / proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
See : proc man page - process information pseudo - filesystem Local file Kernel 2.2 ( RH 7.0 - ) : file:/usr/src/linux/Documentation/proc.txt ( local file )
Reboot count and fsck :
Pertains to Red Hat systems using the EXT2 filesystem ( RH 7.2 + uses EXT3 ) After 20 reboots of the system , Linux will perform a file system check using fsck .
This is annoying for systems with many file systems because they will all be checked at once .
The individual file system 's mount count may be changed so that they will be checked on a different reboot .
Check current reboot status : /sbin/dumpe2fs /dev/sdb6 | grep ' [ mM]ount count ' dumpe2fs 1.19 , 13 - Jul - 2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b , 95/08/09
Mount count : 2
Maximum mount count : 20
( This of course is specific for my system .
Refer to your particular filesystem . )
Perform the previous command on all the filesystems to obtain their mount counts .
Next change the mount counts for some of them .
umount /dev/sdb6
tune2fs -C 9 /dev/sdb6
mount / dev/sdb6
Now the filesystems will have an fsck performed on them on different system boots rather than all at the same time .
For home users who routinely shutdown and boot their systems , one can increase the maximum mount count : tune2fs -c 40
This feature can also be disabled : tune2fs -c -1
Check every week : tune2fs -i 7
System crash and disk check upon boot :
Pertains to Red Hat 7.1 EXT2 filesystems and earlier which require an integrity check .
( RH 7.2 + uses EXT3 which is a journaled file system which maintains file system integrity even with a crash . )
If the system crashes ( due to power outage etc ... ) then upon boot the system will check if the disk was unmounted cleanly .
If not you may get the following message : Unexpected inconsistency ; Run fsck Manually ... ***
An error occurred during the file system check .
***
Dropping you to a shell ; the system will reboot ... .
Give root password for maintenance ( or type Control - D for normal startup ) :
At this point enter the root password then run fsck : ( repair file system ) 1 # fsck - A -y ... .. .
***** FILE SYSTEM WAS MODIFIED ***** ... .. . ( repair file system ) 2 # exit
The system will hopefully reboot properly at this point .
fsck man page
Note that fsck is NOT run against mounted file systems .
Journaled Filesystem EXT3 :
Raw Devices : Commercial databases such as Oracle and IBM DB2 can maximize performance by using raw I/O .
One may use the raw command for both IDE and SCSI devices .
This will map a raw device to a blocked device for an entire disk partition .
To see if your system is using raw I /O issue the command : raw -a
raw man page
man page Configuration file : /etc/sysconfig/rawdevices
Add entries to this file to invoke raw I / O upon system boot .
Add entries to this file to invoke raw I / O upon system boot .
Devices : / dev/raw / raw ??
Raw device controller : / dev/rawctl
Sample use of command : raw / dev/raw / raw1 / dev/hdb5
One must be of group disk to use the raw device or change permissions : chmod a+r / dev/rawctl chmod a+r / dev/hdb5 chmod a+rw / dev/raw/raw1
to use the raw device or change permissions :
Note :
The above information applies to Red Hat distributions .
This info may be different for other distributions .
i.e. S.U.S.E. uses / dev/raw1 as a device and / dev/raw as the controller .
You can mimic Red Hat behavior with a symbolic link : ln -s /dev/your_raw_controller /dev/rawctl
Mounting Network Drives :
SMB Mount : Mounting a Microsoft Windows shared file server drive
Mounting a Microsoft Windows shared file server drive NFS : Mounting / exporting a Linux shared file server drive with NFS .
Requires the following packages : Red Hat / CentOS : portmapper nfs - utils nfs - utils - lib redhat - config-nfs
( Optional : nfs4-acl - tools ) Debian / Ubuntu : apt - get install nfs - kernel - server nfs-common portmap Client Server File : /etc/fstab ... server :/ directory - to - export / mnt / mount - point nfs rw , hard , intr 0 0 server1 :/ shared / images / mnt / srv1-images nfs rw , hard , intr 0 0 ... Hard mount read / write .
Mount can be interrupted by the kill command .
Command line mount : mount -t nfs server1 :/ shared/images /mnt/srv1-images
File : /etc/exports ...
/ shared / images 176.168.1.0/255.255.255.0(rw )
...
List of directories to export and restrictions .
For more see exports man page .
Options : Option Description ro Mounts of the exported file system are read - only .
rw Mounts of the exported file system are read - write .
hard
The program accessing a file on a NFS mounted file system will hang when the server crashes .
intr
If an NFS file operation has a major time - out and it is hard mounted , then allow signals to interrupt the file operation and cause it to return .
async
If the exported file system is read / write and hosts are making changes to the file system when the server crashes , data can be lost .
sync
By specifying the sync option , all file writes are committed to the disk before the write request by the client is completed .
The sync option , however , can lower performance .
wdelay Causes the NFS server to delay writing to the disk if it suspects another write request is imminent .
This can improve performance by reducing the number of times the disk must be accessed by separate write commands , reducing write overhead .
The no_wdelay option turns off this feature , but is only available when using the sync option .
root_squash Prevents root users connected remotely from having root privileges and assigns them the user ID for the user nfsnobody .
This effectively " squashes " the power of the remote root user to the lowest local user , preventing unauthorized alteration of files on the remote server .
Alternatively , the no_root_squash option turns off root squashing .
Pitfalls : Server must run services : portmap ( or rpcbind ) , nfslock , netfs , nfs Restart server service to pick up file changes : service nfs restart
( or : /etc/init.d / nfs restart ) Iptables may block port .
Clear iptables rules with iptables - F to test .
Keep ports 111 and 2049 clear .
iptables -A INPUT -f -j ACCEPT -s ip.pc.client iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 4000:4003 -p 6 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 4000:4003 - p 17 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 2049 - p 17 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 2049 -p 6 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 111 -p 6 -j ACCEPT iptables -A INPUT -s ip.pc.client -d 0/0 111 -p 17 -j ACCEPT
Check PAM restrictions in /etc/hosts.deny and hosts .allow .
To avoid NFS hanging up the system and immunity from the kill command , use the " intr " option to allow the process to be interrupted .
The user id ( uid ) numbers and the group id ( gid ) numbers on both systems MUST match to preserve sanity .
Check the numbers used in /etc / passwd and /etc / group .
Typically this problem is solved by using a single point of authentication .
Use NIS or LDAP .
NEVER EVER mount to a user 's home directory .
i.e. /home / user1 / mount - point
This is because when the user is removed from the system with the command userdel -r user1 , the user 's home directory is wiped and all subdirectories including the path below the mount point will be erased !!
NFS is not an encrypted protocol , and anyone on the same physical network could sniff the traffic and reassemble the information being passed back and forth .

Creating a new system local user account :
The three most common methods of defining a Linux user and authenticating their logins are :
Local user authenticated locally with the password files / etc / passwd and /etc / shadow Network authentication using an LDAP authentication server NIS authentication server .
To specify an NIS authentication server , use / etc / yp.conf which contains the line : ypserver ip.address.of.server .
Find with ypwhich
The following describes creating a local user :
Command Line Method : ( My preference )
useradd user_name :
Add a user to the system .
System uses configuration and security defaults set in /etc / default / useradd and /etc/ login.defs useradd -m user_name :
Add a user to the system and create a home directory populated with default files from / etc / skel / useradd -m user_name - G floppy :
Will grant the user read / write privileges to the floppy ( / dev/ fd0 ) upon creation of user by adding user to group floppy in addition to the default group specified in /etc / default / useradd .
useradd options : Option Description -c
Adds a comment or description to the password record .
-d HOME_DIR
Specify but do n't create the user 's home directory .
-m Create ( if it does not already exist by appending username to " / home / " ) and specify this as the users home directory .
Default files from / etc / skel / will be placed in the users home directory .
eg. ~/.bashrc -g Initial ( default ) group - G grp1 , grp2 Specify additional supplementary groups to which the user belongs .
-s Specify default shell .
Default is / bin / bash in most Linux distributions .
See the useradd man page for a full list of options .
userdel user_name : Delete user from system .
Purges user from /etc / passwd , group and shadow files userdel -r user_name :
Delete user and remove his home directory from the system .
Other files will remain .
[ Potential Pitfall ] :
Use the command " df " to see if there are any mount points to the user 's directory .
If there are any , they will get wiped out with the recursive delete .
Thus as a policy it is best to NEVER generate a mount point within a user 's directory .
It is best to mount to / mnt / mount - dir and use a sym- link ( ln -s / mnt / mount - dir / home / user - name / mount - dir - local ) to the user 's directory .
The default is to not follow symlinks during the delete .
passwd user_name : Assign a password to the user .
( Also see pwgen , a password generator )
Also see man page for : usermod .
Configuration file for useradd command : /etc / default / useradd
Default directory configuration and files for a new user are copied from the directory / etc / skel / .
The default shell is called bash ( bsh ) and is a cross of the UNIX ksh and csh command shells .
The users personal bash shell customizations are held in $ HOME /. bashrc .
( My preference ) GUI Method : system - config-users : GUI admin tool for managing users and groups .
( Fedora Core 2+ , RHEL4 / 5/6 ) redhat - config - users : GUI admin tool for managing users and groups .
( Fedora Core 1 ) linuxconf : ( Note : Linuxconf is no longer included with Red Hat Linux 7.3 + )
Start linuxconf : RH 5.2 : Select Start + Programs + Administration + linuxconf .
RH 6+ : Select Gnome Start icon ( located lower left corner ) + System + Linuxconf .
Add the user : Select options Config +
User accounts + Normal +
User accounts + select button Add .
There is also the option of adding the user to additional groups .
( I.e enter floppy under the heading Supplementary groups and then Accept )
For a list of groups , the group names should be separated by a simple space .
This tool will allow you to set default directories , shells , add rules about passwords , set e-mail aliases , group membership and disk quotas .
One can modify or delete users from linuxconf as well .
Set user password :
After creating the user , use options Config +
User accounts +
Normal +
User accounts .
Select the user from the list .
Then select the Passwd button .
This will allow you to enter an initial password for the account .
File Editing Method : - ( as root )
Edit files to add / remove a user Create user entry in /etc / passwd
user : x:505:505 : Mr. Dude User:/ home /user :/ bin/ bash Create group : /etc/group
user : x:505 : Create home directory :
cd /home
mkdir user Copy default files :
cp -pR /etc/skel/. /home/user
chown -R user.user /home/user
The creation of /etc / shadow and /etc / gshadow require the execution of a program to encrypt passwords .
Use the commands pwconv and grpconv to synchronize the shadow files .
Assign a password : passwd user
Also see : Shadow integrity verification : grpck [ - r ] [ group shadow ]
File editor : vipw .
- ( as root ) Edit files to add / remove a user
Note :
For every user ID text string there is an associated UID integer .
See the third " : " delimited field in the file /etc / passwd .
. The " Linux Standard Base " pecification states that IDs 0 to 99 should be statically allocated by the system and that user IDs from 100 to 499 should be reserved for dynamic allocation by system administrators and post install scripts using useradd .
[ LSB chapter 21 ]
This is of course not completely realistic as it would limit Linux to 400 users .
Red Hat / Fedora Linux distributions begin incrementing user UIDs from 500 .
By default the useradd command will increment by one for each new ID .
command will increment by one for each new ID .
Large organizations need to think ahead when creating a new user .
Autonomous systems are often eventually linked together to share files using NFS at a later date and have synchronization problems .
The same user ID ( text string ) on two different systems may have different UIDs .
The problem this creates is when a file with one system can not be edited when accessed from the second system as the second system regard him as a different user because the system has a different UID .
It is best to use the useradd " - u " option to assign users a UID integer associated with the text string ID .
Many systems administrators use the employee ID as they know it will be unique across the corporation .
Group GIDs can be assigned to department or division numbers .
This will allow smooth operation of connected systems .

Group GIDs can be assigned to department or division numbers .
This will allow smooth operation of connected systems .
NFS : For systems which will use NFS to share files , one can administer user accounts to make creation , editing and ownership of files seamless and consistent .
Look at the file /etc / passwd on the file server which you will mount to determine the user ID number and group ID number .
user1:x:505:505: Joe Hacker : / home / user1:/bin/bash
User-ID : User -ID - Number : Group - ID - Number : comment :/ home / User-ID - Home - Directory : default - shell
Add a user to the system which matches .
This will allow files generated on the file server to match ownership of those generated on the client system .
[ root ] # useradd -u User - ID - Number -g Group - ID - Number User-ID
Ideally you would configure an NIS or LDAP authentication server so that login id's and group id 's would reside on one server .
This tip is for separate autonomous systems or for systems using different authentication servers which are sharing files using NFS .
This tip also can also apply to smbmounted MS / Windows shares .

SELinux security policies and context :
Security Enhanced Linux ( SELinux ) enhancements developed by the US Federal National Security Agency ( NSA ) are included with Fedora Core beginning with version 3 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 4 .
The fine - grained access control architecture is supported in the Linux kernel .
Both " type " enforcement and Role Based Access Control ( RBAC ) are supported .
System processes and files ( including socket descriptors , IPC's , devices , ... ) are each assigned a collection of security attributes known as a security context .
Security Goals :
Protect the system from the users
Protect the users from each other
Protect the files from scripts / programs
The following RPM packages comprise SELinux :
selinux - policy - strict
selinux - policy - strict - sources : Configuration files
selinux - policy - targeted
selinux - policy - targeted - sources : Configuration files
libselinux : Library which provides a set of interfaces for security - aware applications to get and set process and file security contexts .
selinux - doc
Configuration file : /etc/selinux / config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system .
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values :
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced .
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing .
# disabled - SELinux is fully disabled .
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use .
Possible values are :
# targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected .
# strict - Full SELinux protection .
SELINUXTYPE=targeted
One may turn off the SELinux features by setting : SELINUX=disabled
( Requires reboot to read new configuration . )
Direct setting of enforcement : Enforce : Use command : setenforce 1
( Alter SELinux enforcement while kernel is running . )
or echo 1 > / selinux / enforce
or Specify in /etc / grub.conf on the " kernel " command line : enforcing=1
( Sets enforcement during boot . )
Disable : Use command : setenforce 0
or echo 0 > / selinux / enforce
or Specify in /etc / grub.conf on the " kernel " command line : selinux=0
See current setting using the command : getenforce
Security contexts :
View file / directory contexts : ls - Z /var / www

Operating as root : ( System Administrator )
If you are planning to administer the system , one would login as root to perform the tasks .
In many instances one would be logged in as a user and wish to perform some " root " sys - admin tasks .
Here is how :
Switch user account to root :
Shell / command mode :
su -
and then you will be prompted to enter the root password .
and then you will be prompted to enter the root password .
GUI mode : Allow console to be accessed by another user from same system :
xhost +localhost
Switch user and then you will be prompted to enter the root password :
su -
Set environment variable for GUI sessions so that display used is local display .
( Remember X - windows is a network enables windowing system )
export DISPLAY =:0.0 Launch GUI application .
Note :
The su command was issued with a trailing " - " which means that the login process will follow the login steps of the user and will execute its profiles .
Since no user id was given , the default is root user .
This all would be equivalent to : su - root
Some systems may be configured so that only the switch user ( su ) command may be required without all of the X - window configuration .
RPM - Redhat Package Manager :
The rpm command is used to manage software applications and system modules for Red Hat , Fedora , CentOS , Suse and many other Linux distributions .
Step One : Import Red Hat and Fedora GPG signature keys :
View your public key : ( RHEL5 ) [ root@yoserver2 ~ ] # rpm - qa gpg-pubkey gpg-pubkey - ed555983-3457f7f3 [ root@yoserver2 ~ ] # rpm - qi gpg-pubkey - ed555983-3457f7f3 ... ... ( Thus already installed .
Your system is ready . )
Remove your public key : ( RHEL5 ) [ root@yoserver2 ~ ] # rpm -e gpg-pubkey - ed555983-3457f7f3
Install public key : ( Red Hat package up2date - now depricated .
Use YUM . ) [ root@yoserver2 ~ ] # rpm -- import /usr/share/rhn/RPM-GPG-KEY [ root@yoserver2 ~ ] # rpm -- import /usr/share/rhn/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora
Do this once to configure RPM so that you wo n't constantly get the warning message that the signature is " NOKEY " .
The purpose is to protect you from using a corrupt or hacked RPM .
Once these command are performed , you are ready to use the RPM command .
( This is also required for the YUM commands below . )
Note : Many GPG public keys for other RPM packages ( i.e. MySQL : 0x5072E1F5 ) , can be obtained from http://www.keyserver.net/.
( The following RPM installation warning will inform you of the key to obtain : warning : MySQL-XXXX.rpm : V3 DSA signature : NOKEY , key ID 5072e1f5 )
Importing a new key from key server : gpg -- keyserver keyserver.veridis.com -- recv-key 5072e1f5 gpg -- export -a 5072e1f5 > pubkey_mysql.asc rpm -- import pubkey_mysql.asc
Step Two : RPM commands and their use
RPM Command Description rpm - qilp program_package-ver.rpm
Query for information on package and list destination of files to be installed by the package .
You can also use the Gnome GUI program file - roller to view and read the contents of an RPM .
Great tool for inspecting an RPM package and reading the package documentation before you decide to install the package .
rpm2cpio - < program_package-ver.rpm | cpio - id ./ path/and/ file-name
Extract a single file ( with path ) from the RPM package to the local directory .
rpm - Uvh program_package-ver.rpm
Upgrade the system with the RPM package rpm - ivh program_package - ver.rpm New Install rpm - Fvh program_package-ver.rpm Freshen install .
Removes all files ( including config files ) of older version during upgrade .
rpm -q program_package Query system RPM database ( / var/lib/rpm ) , to see if package is installed .
rpm - qi program_package Query system RPM database for info / description on package ( if installed ) rpm -ql program_package List all files on the system associated with the package .
rpm - qf file Identify the package to which this file belongs .
rpm -e program_package Uninstall package from your system rpm - qa List ALL packages on your system .
Use this with grep to find families of packages .
rpm - qp -- requires program_package-ver.rpm
List dependancies ( files and packages ) of RPM .
List prerequisites .
rpm -q -- whatrequires program_package List dependant packages of RPM .
What packages will break if this RPM is removed .
rpm -K -- nogpg *.rpm
Non sure if RPM downloaded ok ?
Verify md5 sum .
RPM Flag Description -- nodeps RPM flag to force install even if dependency requirements are not met .
-- force Overwrite of other packages allowed .
-- notriggers
Don't execute scripts which are triggered by the installation of this package .
-- root / directory - name
Use the system chrooted at / directory - name .
This means the database will be read or modified under / directory - name .
( Used by developers to maintain multiple environments ) -- ignorearch Allow installation even if the architectures of the binary RPM and host do n't match .
This is often required for RPM's which were assembled incorrectly
Notes :
Fedora RPM downloads : http://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/releases/##/Fedora/ arch / os/ Packages /
Use your browser , wget , curl ( downloads using http , https , ftp , ... ) or ftp the site download.fedora.redhat.com ( login : anonymous , password : your - email - address ) .
/ os/ Packages /
Use your browser , wget , curl ( downloads using http , https , ftp , ... ) or ftp the site ( login : , password : ) .
Many times , ( like with glibc library or Netscape RPMs etc ) it is necessary to mention two or more packages on the command line .
The rpm command will account for the co-dependency of the packages .
i.e.:
rpm -ivh abc - package1 - i386.rpm abc-package2-i386.rpm abc-package3-i386.rpm
Configuration information is stored in / var / lib / rpm
Database of descriptive package info .
RPM package rpmdb-redhat .

Building from a " src " ( source ) RPM : rpmbuild -- rebuild package - name .src.rpm
The source will be placed in /usr / src/redhat / RPMS /... .
The command then performs a prep , compile , install and finally creates a new binary RPM package .
Use option -- clean for cleanup .
The command rpmbuild -- showrc package - name .src.rpm shows options to be used as specified in rpmrc and macros configuration file (s ) .

If you get the errors : error : cannot get exclusive lock on / var / lib / rpm / Packages

If you get the errors : [ root ] # rpm -e package - name error : " package - name - X.X.X - X " specifies multiple packages

Fix : rpm -e -- allmatches package - name
: If you get the errors : Fix : [ Potential Pitfall ] :
You try and install an RPM but you can not get the appropriate version of the run time libraries because they are too old and not present on your system or you get a runtime error :
/usr/bin/ld : cannot find /lib/libxx.so.1.0.4
Here is how to install some old libraries on your newer system without corrupting your current installation .
First force the installation of the RPM without the dependency requirement : rpm -- nodeps -ivh xxxx -...rmp .
Next download an old RPM of the appropriate library , i.e. glibc-x.x.x.rpm
Extract the libraries from the RPM : rpm2cpio glibc-x.x.x.rpm | cpio -idv
This will install to your current directory : ./usr/lib/.. and ./lib/...
Manually copy the library file to the library directory or path accessible by LD_LIBRARY_PATH or ldconfig : i.e. cp ./lib/libxx.so.1.0.4 /lib/libxx.so.1.0.4

Automated System Updates : up2date ( Red Hat 7.1 and later )
Select the red dot and exclamation mark icon on the toolbar to launch up2date and follow the GUI .
One may also use the command line if managing a remote server .
Execute the following commands ( in order given ) to perform an automatic system update :
/usr/bin/rhn_register
: You must first register your system with the Red Hat database .
This command will perform a hardware inventory and reporting of your system so that Red Hat knows which software to load to match your needs .
/usr/bin/up2date-config
: This allows you to configure the " up2date " process .
It allows you to define directories to use , actions to take ( i.e. download updates , install or not install , keep RPM 's after install or not ) , network access ( i.e. proxy configuration ) , use of GPG for package verification , packages or files to skip , etc .
Use of GPG requires the Red Hat public key : rpm - import /usr / share / rhn / RPM-GPG-KEY /usr / sbin / up2date : This command will perform an audit of RPM's on your system and discover what needs to be updated .
It gives you a chance to unselect packages targeted for upgrade .
It will download RPM packages needed , resolve dependencies and perform a system update if requested .
[ Potential Pitfall ] :
This works quite well but it is not perfect .
Red Hat 7.1 Apache upgrade to 1.3.22 changed the configuration completely .
( Beware . manual clean - up and re-configuration is required ) .
When up2date finds the first messed up dependency it stops to tells you .
You then have to unselect the package .
It then starts again from the beginning .
Installing a new package with up2date : up2date package - name
The package name is given without the version number .
If the package is not currently installed , it will be downloaded and installed , along with any dependencies that package requires .
Command line options ( partial list ) for up2date :
Option Description -- nox
Do not display the GUI interface .
-u
-- update Completely update the system - h
-- help Display command line arguments -v
-- verbose Print more info about what up2date is doing -- showall
Show a list of all packages available for your release of Red Hat Linux , including those not currently installed .

YUM / YUMEX : RPM Updates
YUM ( Yellowdog Updater , Modified ) is a client command line application for updating an RPM based system from an internet repository ( YUM " yum - arch " server ) accessible by URL ( http:// xxx , ftp://yyy or even file :// zzz local or NFS ) .
The YUM repository has a directory of the headers with RPM info and directory path information .
YUM will resolve RPM package dependencies and manage the importation and installation of dependencies .
YUM is also capable of upgrading across releases .
One can upgrade Red Hat Linux 7 and 8 to 9 .
Red Hat 8 and 9 can be upgraded to Fedora Core .
See Fedora YUM release upgrades or upgrade Redhat 6 to 7 .
Note that RHEL6 is the first release of the enterprise product which can be upgraded to the next release .
Yum Configuration :
YUM config file : /etc/yum.conf ( CentOS 5 )

# Note : yum - RHN - plugin does n't honor this .
metadata_expire=1h installonly_limit = 5 # PUT YOUR REPOS HERE OR IN separate files named file .repo # in /etc/yum.repos.d
You may list packages you wish NOT to update ( Space delimited list .
'*' wildcards allowed . ) : exclude=package - name
( i.e . On x86_64 I do not update firefox or mozplugger with the 64 bit version , I use the 32 bit version so that 32 bit plugins will work . )
Set " gpgcheck=0 " to avoid the signature check .
For the option " gpgcheck=1 " to work , use the " rpm -- import GPG - KEY commands as detailed the RPM tutorial .

RSYNC : Synchronizing files between two drives or two computers
The command rsync helps the system administrator synchronize files on two separate computers .
This is ideal for web site maintenance .
Rsync Examples :
match up and update a backup directory on the same system ( eg a USB stick ) :
rsync - av ~/ Documents / media/KINGSTON
match up and update a backup directory on a different system :
rsync - avr --rsh=/usr/bin/ssh ~/Documents userx@remote-server:/mnt/drive2
using a file list to identify files :
rsync -e ssh -p 777 -- delete --include-from=files-to-sync.txt - avzu ./ www.your-domain.com:
Test with flags - navzu File : files - to - sync.txt +index.html
-README
+webpage -1.html
+webpage -2.html
+webpage-3.html
Files to include (+ ) and files which are excluded from synchronization ( - ) .
Links :
System log files :
/var/log/ messages - system messages / secure - Logging by PAM of network access attempts / dmesg - Log of system boot .
Also see command dmesg / boot.log - Log of system init process / xferlog.1 - File transfer log / lastlog - Requires the use of the lastlog command to examine contents / maillog - log from sendmail daemon
Note :
The lastlog command prints time stamp of the last login of system users .
( Interprets file : /var/log/ lastlog )
Also see last command .
logrotate - Rotate log files :
Many system and server application programs such as Apache , generate log files .
If left unchecked they would grow large enough to burden the system and application .
The logrotate program will periodically backup the log file by renaming it .
The program will also allow the system administrator to set the limit for the number of logs or their size .
There is also the option to compress the backed up files .
Configuration file : /etc/logrotate.conf
Directory for logrotate configuration scripts : /etc/logrotate.d/
Example logrotate configuration script : /etc/logrotate.d/process-name
/var/log/process-name.log {
rotate 12
monthly
errors root@localhost
missingok
postrotate
/usr/bin/killall - HUP process - name 2 > / dev/ null || true
endscript
}
The configuration file lists the log file to be rotated , the process kill command to momentarily shut down and restart the process , and some configuration parameters listed in the logrotate man page
Using the Linux / UNIX find command :
Find man page
Form of command : find path operators
Examples :
Search and list all files from current directory and down for the string ABC :
find ./ - name " * " - exec grep -H ABC {} \ ;
find ./ - type f - print | xargs grep - H " ABC " / dev/null
egrep -r ABC *
: Find all files of a given type from current directory on down :
find ./ - name " *.conf " - print
Find all user files larger than 5Mb :
find /home - size +5000000 c - print
Find all files owned by a user ( defined by user id number .
see /etc / passwd ) on the system : ( could take a very long time )
find / - user 501 - print
Find all files created or updated in the last five minutes : ( Great for finding effects of make install )
find / - cmin - 5
)
Find all users in group 20 and change them to group 102 : ( execute as root )
find / - group 20 - exec chown :102 {} \ ;
Find all suid and setgid executables :
find / \( - perm - 4000 -o - perm - 2000 \ ) - type f -exec ls - ldb {} \ ;
find / - type f - perm +6000 - ls Note : suid executable binaries are programs which switch to root privileges to perform their tasks .
These are created by applying a " sticky " bit : chmod +s .
These programs should be watched as they are often the first point of entry for hackers .
Thus it is prudent to run this command and remove the " sticky " bits from executables which either wo n't be used or are not required by users .
chmod -s filename
Find all world writable directories :
find / - perm - 0002 - type d - print
Find all world writable files :
find / - perm - 0002 - type f - print
find / - perm - 2 ! - type l -ls
Find files with no user :
find / - nouser -o - nogroup - print
Find files modified in the last two days :
find / - mtime 2 -o - ctime 2
Compare two drives to see if all files are identical :
find / - path / proc - prune -o - path / new - disk - prune - o - xtype f - exec cmp {} / new - disk{} \;
Partial list of find directives :
Directive Description - name
Find files whose name matches given pattern - print Display path of matching files - user Searches for files belonging to a specific user - exec command {} \ ; Execute Unix / Linux command for each matching file .
- atime ( +t , -t , t ) Find files accessed more that +t days ago , less than -t or precisely t days ago .
- ctime ( +t , - t , t ) Find files changed ... - perm Find files set with specified permissions .
- type Locate files of a specified type : c : character device files
b : blocked device
d : directories
p : pipes
l : symbolic links
s : sockets
f : regular files - size n Find file size is larger than " n " 512 - byte blocks ( default ) or specify a different measurement by using the specified letter following " n " : n b : bytes
n c : bytes
n k : kilobytes
nw : 2 - byte words

Finding / Locating files :
locate / slocate Find location / list of files which contain a given partial name which Find executable file location of command given .
Command must be in path .
whereis
Find executable file location of command given and related files rpm - qf file Display name of RPM package from which the file was installed .
dpkg -S file Display name of Debian package from which the file was installed .
Note : The script /etc/cron.daily/updatedb.cron generates the index for the locate command .
It will generate the database / var / lib / locatedb
File Information / Status / Ownership / Security :
ls List directory contents .
List file information chmod Change file access permissions
chmod ugo+rwx file - name : Change file security so that the user , group and all others have read , write and execute privileges .
chmod go - wx file - name : Remove file access so that the group and all others have write and execute privileges revoked / removed .
chown
Change file owner and group
chown root.root file - name : Make file owned by root .
Group assignment is also root .
fuser Identify processes using files or sockets
If you ever get the message : error : cannot get exclusive lock
then you may need to kill a process that has the file locked .
Either terminate the process through the application interface or using the fuser command : fuser -k file - name file Identify file type .
file file - name
Uses /usr / share / magic , /usr / share/magic.mime for file signatures to identify file type .
The file extension is NOT used .
CRON - Scheduling a re-occurring task :
Add shell script to have run hourly , daily , weekly or monthly into the appropriate directory :
/etc/cron.hourly /
/etc/cron.daily /
/etc/cron.weekly /
/etc/cron.monthly /
These are preconfigured schedules .
To assign a very specific schedule add a line to the /etc / crontab file .
Cron entries may also be added to a crontab formatted file located in the directory / var / spool / cron / .
Online , web based crontab entry generator .
Red Hat / CentOS / Fedora SeLinux security contexts for cron :
Specify each context separately : chcon -u system_u -r object_r -t bin_t /etc/cron.weekly / crontask
Specify context all at once : chcon system_u:object_r:bin_t /etc/cron.weekly /crontask
[ Potential Pitfall ] :
Try this method if you get the following error :
chcon : can't apply partial context to unlabeled file /etc/ cron.weekly / crontask
Scheduling access and control :
The administrator can allow users to use this facility with specific control by using the /etc/ cron.deny and /etc/ cron.allow files .
The at facility may be controlled with the /etc / at.deny and /etc / at.allow files .
Man pages :
cron - daemon to execute scheduled commands
crontab - command to maintain crontab files for individual users
/ etc /crontab - file of tables for driving cron
AT - Scheduling a single occurrance of a task :
The at command will schedule single jobs .
( cron is for re-occurring jobs )
The daemon /usr / sbin / atd will run jobs scheduled with the at command .
Access control to the command is controlled using the files / etc / at.allow ( list of user id 's permitted to use the at command ) and /etc / at.deny .
Time is specified before the date :
at HH : MM month - name day with an optional year
at midnight MMDDYY
at HH PM today
at noon DD.
MM.YY
at 14:30 19.03.06
at noon tomorrow
The at command will respond with it's " at > " prompt upon which you enter the command you wish to execute followed by " Enter " .
More commands may be entered .
When done enter " control -d " .
Input at commands from a file : at midnight today < job - list - file
List jobs with the command atq
[ prompt ] $ atq
1 2002-03-07 12:00 a user-id
The first column lists the job number .
Delete job with the command atrm
[ prompt ] $ atrm 1
Man pages :
at - schedule job at a specified time
atq - lists the user 's pending jobs or all if root
atrm - deletes jobs , identified by their job number
batch - executes commands when system load levels permit ( based on a specified system load )
at.allow / at.deny - determine who can submit jobs via at or batch
atrun - for backward compatibility .
Functionality built into at
after - Execute a command after a time delay
Managing Time :
The BIOS computer clock stores hardware time while the OS keeps track of system time .
The system time is initialized during boot by syncing OS time to the hardware time .
It is common for web servers to set their clocks to GMT0 time as their audience is worldwide and GMT is the only true standard time .
Your local office server would most likely be set to local time .
Read system time ( Linux OS time ) : date
Read hardware clock ( BIOS clock ) : /sbin/hwclock
( Same as / sbin / hwclock -- show ) /sbin/hwclock --utc
Set time : ( two methods )
Note than when setting server time to GMT , set your local environment first to GMT : export TZ=GMT0
( link to current GMT )
Set hardware clock and sync system ( OS ) time to match : ( hctosys )
Set hardware clock : / sbin/ hwclock --utc -- set -- date=" 07/14/2015 23:16:30 "
( Set either -- utc or -- localtime )
Then match system clock : hwclock -- hctosys --utc
( Set the System Time from the Hardware Clock . )
Set system ( OS ) clock and sync hardware time to match : ( systohc )
Set system time ( Linux OS time ) : date -s 10:20 date 073023162008.30
July 30 , 2008 11:16 pm and 30 seconds date MMDDhhmm.ss
( month , day , hour , minute , year and dot seconds - seconds optional )
( where hours are from 00 to 24 )
Set hardware clock to system clock in UTC : /sbin/hwclock --systohc --utc
( UTC preferred for Linux because it allows automatic accounting of daylight savings time .
Microsoft OS 's use local time .
UTC will mess up the time setting on a dual boot system which hosts a Microsoft OS )

/usr/lib/zoneinfo/
ln - sf /usr / share / zoneinfo / US / Central /etc/localtime
Note that the time zone setting is a soft link fromto a file under ( oron older systems ) .
To set the default time zone to US CST , generate a new link manually with the command :
Set System Time : ( using NTP - Network Time Protocol )
Query / Print the time returned by the remote host : Fedora Core ( RPM : ntp-4.2.0 ) : /usr / sbin/ntpdate -q hostname Up to Red Hat 9.0 ( RPM : ntp-4.1.2 ) : rdate -p hostname
Set the system time to the returned time : ( Must be root .
Only root can change system clock . )
Fedora Core ( RPM : ntp-4.2.0 ) : /usr / sbin/ntpdate hostname Up to Red Hat 9.0 ( RPM : ntp-4.1.2 ) : rdate -s hostname
Try : /usr/sbin/ntpdate -q time.ucla.edu
See List of public NTP Time Servers or http://www.pool.ntp.org.
Note : Typically many web servers set their time to GMT due to the world wide nature of their service .
Internally UNIX systems use Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) which is the number of seconds since Jan 1 , 1970 0 hrs .
" Calendar Time " is then calculated based on your time zone and whether you are on Standard or Daylight Savings time ( Second Sunday of March to First Sunday of November - beginning March 2007 ) .
Sync System Time :
The timed ( time server daemon ) allows one to synchronizes the host 's time with the time of another host .
This is a master - slave configuration .
See the timed and timedc man pages .

Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) : ( configuration )
The daemon ntpd will continually monitor time and synchronize your system clock with that of a known accurate time system ( atomic clock ) .
Corrections are implemented in small steps to correct the clock over time .
Errors of over 1000 seconds causes ntpd to abort correction .
The init script
/etc/rc.d/init.d/ntpd issues the command / usr / sbin / ntpdate to set the time .
You may also issue the command : /usr / sbin/ntpdate - b -s time.nist.gov ns.arc.nasa.gov tick.usno.navy.mil
This will hang without an internet connection !!!
Time servers : time.nist.gov
ns.arc.nasa.gov
tick.usno.navy.mil
Configuring NTP :
The system may be configured as :
a pure NTP client .
a pure NTP server an NTP client which then acts as an NTP server for a domain
Client Configuration :
List accurate clocks to use in file : /etc/ntp.conf server time1.ntpServer.gov server time2.ntpServer.gov restrict time1.ntpServer.gov mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery restrict time2.ntpServer.gov mask 255.255.255.255 nomodify notrap noquery restrict 127.0.0.1
This will synchronize your system clock with the times servers listed .
Note that using IP addresses instead of fully qualified domain names will provide a faster response .
restrict options : option Description mask Limits the remote NTP server to a single IP address ( 255.255.255.255 ) , default mask 0.0.0.0 .
nomodify
Run time configuration can not be modified by remote NTP server notrap
Do not log remote messages .
noquery
Do not allow remote ntpq or ntpdc querries notrust Deny cryptographically un-authenticated NTP querries .
Syncronize time with NTP server : ntpdate -u time1.ntpServer.gov
Start NTP daemon : service ntpd start
( or : /etc/init.d / ntpd start )
Configure NTP daemon to start during boot : chkconfig ntpd on Check time : date
Note :
NTP uses UDP on port 123 for inbound and outbound communication .
Check / var / log / messages for errors .
for errors .
PHP has an independent setting in /etc / php.ini [ Date ] ;
Defines the default timezone used by the date functions ; date.timezone = GMT-0 date.timezone = Europe / London
MySQL has an independent setting in / etc / my.cnf [ mysqld_safe ] timezone = Europe / London
Where the time zone is one from the list in /usr / share / zoneinfo/zone.tab
Or in SQL : SET time_zone timezone=GMT

Directory Listings and Terminal Colors for " ls " :
If you alter your terminal background color , you will quickly find that the display from the command " ls " may obscure some of the results .
There are three options for setting the colors applied to the results of the " ls " command :
The color scheme can be ignored and all output displayed in the foreground color .
Set an alias in your $ HOME /. bashrc file : alias ls='ls -F '
The output will use symbols instead of colors to identify the types : A closing " / " will denote a directory .
A " @ " denotes a symbolic link .
An " * " denotes execute permissions .
Use the command dircolors to list the system default .
Change and assign new colors using the environment variable " LS_COLORS " .
This can be set in your $ HOME /. bashrc file .
LS_COLORS='no=00 :fi=00:di=01;34:ln=01;36:pi=40;33:so=01;35:do=01;35 : bd=40;33;01:cd=40;33;01:or=40;31;01:ex=01;32:*.tar=01;31 : *.tgz=01;31:*.arj=01;31:*.taz=01;31:*.lzh=01;31:*.zip=01;31 : *.z=01;31:*.

First time through it will ask a bunch of questions .
( Answer " no " to the first question for autoconfigure . )
Defaults were good for me .
The only reason to manually configure this is if you are using a proxy .
It then asks for your location ( i.e. North America ) and country .
I entered a number for the first CPAN server but after that the actual URL was cut and pasted in whole .
If it fails , you must load the appropriate RPMs and retry using " force install module - name " PERL update : perl - MCPAN -e ' install Perl '

Using TAR ( Tape Archive ) for simple Linux backups :
It should be noted that automated enterprise wide multi-system backups should use a system such as Amanda .
( See Backup / Restore links on YoLinux home page ) Simple backups can be performed using the tar command :
tar - cvf / dev/st0 /home / opt
This will backup the files , directories and all it's subdirectories and files of the directories / home and / opt to the first SCSI tape device .
( / dev/st0 )
Restoring files from backup :
tar - xvf /dev/st0
Script to perform weekly archive backups : /etc/cron.weekly/backup-weekly.sh
#!/bin/bash
tar - cz -f /mnt/BackupServer/user-id/backup-weekly-`date +%F`.tar.gz - C / home / user - id dir - to - back - up
chmod ugo+x
/etc/cron.weekly/backup-weekly.sh
Be sure to allow execute permission on the script :
Manual page for the tar command .
SELinux Tar :
" Security Enhanced " Linux archive backup , " star " , will save and restore the SELinux attributes .
Note that the " tar " command will not operate with the " star " archive .
star - xattr - H=exustar - c -f archive - file.star /directory / path/to/backup/
For more on SELinux , see above section .
Notes :
Backup using compression to put more on SCSI tape device : tar - z - cvf / dev/st0 / home / opt
List contents of tape : tar - tf / dev/st0
List contents of compressed backup tape : tar - tzf /dev/st0
Backup directory to a floppy : tar - cvf / dev/ fd0 /home/user1
When restored it requires root because the root of the backup is " / home " .

Essential Guide to Disaster Recovery Free Request
One Shot Left
The latest science suggests that preventing runaway climate change means total decarbonisation .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 25th November 2008
George Bush is behaving like a furious defaulter whose home is about to be repossessed .
Smashing the porcelain , ripping the doors off their hinges , he is determined that there will be nothing worth owning by the time the bastards kick him out .
His midnight regulations , opening America ’s wilderness to logging and mining , trashing pollution controls , tearing up conservation laws , will do almost as much damage in the last 60 days of his presidency as he achieved in the foregoing 3000 ( 1 ) .
His backers – among them the nastiest pollutocrats in America – are calling in their favours .
But this last binge of vandalism is also the Bush presidency reduced to its essentials .
Destruction is not an accidental product of its ideology .
Destruction is the ideology .
Neoconservatism is power expressed by showing that you can reduce any part of the world to rubble .
If it is now too late to prevent runaway climate change , the Bush team must carry much of the blame .
His wilful trashing of the Middle Climate – the interlude of benign temperatures which allowed human civilisation to flourish – makes the mass murder he engineered in Iraq only the second of his crimes against humanity .
Bush has waged his war on science with the same obtuse determination with which he has waged his war on terror .
Is it too late ?
To say so is to make it true .
To suggest that there is nothing that can now be done is to ensure that nothing is done .
But even a resolute optimist like me finds hope ever harder to summon .
A new summary of the science published since last year ’s Intergovernmental Panel report suggests that – almost a century ahead of schedule – the critical climate processes might have begun ( 2 ) .
Just a year ago the Intergovernmental Panel warned that the Arctic ’s “ late - summer sea ice is projected to disappear almost completely towards the end of the 21st century … in some models .
” ( 3 ) But , as the new report by the Public Interest Research Centre ( PIRC ) shows , climate scientists are now predicting the end of late - summer sea ice within three to seven years .
The trajectory of current melting plummets through the graphs like a meteorite falling to earth .
Forget the sodding polar bears : this is about all of us .
As the ice disappears , the region becomes darker , which means that it absorbs more heat .
A recent paper published in Geophysical Research Letters shows that the extra warming caused by disappearing sea ice penetrates 1500 km inland , covering almost the entire region of continuous permafrost ( 4 ) .
Arctic permafrost contains twice as much carbon as the entire global atmosphere ( 5 ) .
It remains safe for as long as the ground stays frozen .
But the melting has begun .
Methane gushers are now gassing out of some places with such force that they keep the water open in Arctic lakes , through the winter ( 6 ) .
The effects of melting permafrost are not incorporated into any global climate models .
Runaway warming in the Arctic alone could flip the entire planet into a new climatic state .
The Middle Climate could collapse faster and sooner than the grimmest forecasts proposed .
Barack Obama ’s speech to the US climate summit last week was an astonishing development ( 7 ) .
It shows that , in this respect at least , there really is a prospect of profound political change in America .
But while he described a workable plan for dealing with the problem perceived by the Earth Summit of 1992 , the measures he proposes are now hopelessly out of date .
The science has moved on .
The events the Earth Summit and the Kyoto process were supposed to have prevented are already beginning .
Thanks to the wrecking tactics of Bush the elder , Clinton ( and Gore ) and Bush the younger , steady , sensible programmes of the kind that Obama proposes are now irrelevant .
As the PIRC report suggests , the years of sabotage and procrastination have left us with only one remaining shot : a crash programme of total energy replacement .
A paper by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research shows that if we are to give ourselves a roughly even chance ( 8,9 ) of preventing more than two degrees of warming , global emissions from energy must peak by 2015 and decline by between six and eight per cent per year from 2020 to 2040 , leading to a complete decarbonisation of the global economy soon after 2050 ( 10 ) .
Even this programme would work only if some optimistic assumptions about the response of the biosphere hold true .
Delivering a high chance of preventing two degrees of warming would mean cutting global emissions by over 8 % a year .
Is this possible ?
Is this acceptable ?
The Tyndall paper points out that annual emission reductions greater than one per cent have “ been associated only with economic recession or upheaval . ”
When the Soviet Union collapsed , they fell by some 5 % a year .
But you can answer these questions only by considering the alternatives .
The trajectory both Barack Obama and Gordon Brown have proposed – an 80 % cut by 2050 – means reducing emissions by an average of 2 % a year .
This programme , the figures in the Tyndall paper suggest , is likely to commit the world to at least four or five degrees of warming ( 11 ) , which means the likely collapse of human civilisation across much of the planet .
Is this acceptable ?
The costs of a total energy replacement and conservation plan would be astronomical , the speed improbable .
But the governments of the rich nations have already deployed a scheme like this for another purpose .
A survey by the broadcasting network CNBC suggests that the US federal government has now spent $ 4.2 trillion in response to the financial crisis , more than the total spending on World War Two when adjusted for inflation ( 12 ) .
Do we want to be remembered as the generation that saved the banks and let the biosphere collapse ?
This approach is challenged by the American thinker Sharon Astyk .
In an interesting new essay , she points out that replacing the world ’s energy infrastructure involves “ an enormous front - load of fossil fuels ” , which are required to manufacture wind turbines , electric cars , new grid connections , insulation and all the rest ( 13 ) .
This could push us past the climate tipping point .
Instead , she proposes , we must ask people “ to make short term , radical sacrifices ” , cutting our energy consumption by 50 % , with little technological assistance , in five years .
There are two problems : the first is that all previous attempts show that relying on voluntary abstinence does not work .
The second is that a 10 % annual cut in energy consumption while the infrastructure remains mostly unchanged means a 10 % annual cut in total consumption : a deeper depression than the modern world has ever experienced .
No political system – even an absolute monarchy – could survive an economic collapse on this scale .
She is right about the risks of a technological green new deal , but these are risks we have to take .
Astyk ’s proposals travel far into the realm of wishful thinking .
Even the technological solution I favour inhabits the distant margins of possibility .
Can we do it ?
Search me .
Reviewing the new evidence , I have to admit that we might have left it too late .
But there is another question I can answer more easily .
Can we afford not to try ?
No we can’t .

Anderson and Bows state that “ The framing of climate change policy is typically
informed by the 2 degrees C threshold ; however , even stabilizing at 450 ppmv CO2e [ parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent ] offers only a 46 per cent chance of not exceeding 2 degrees C. ”
This estimate is given in the following paper :

This is for stabilisation at 450 ppmv CO2e – well above the level that James Hansen and other climate scientists are now calling for .
11 . Anderson and Bows note that stabilising atmospheric concentrations even at 650 ppmv CO2e requires that global emissions peak by 2020 , followed by global cuts of 3 - 4 % a year .
This means that OECD nations will have to cut emissions by even more than this to prevent concentrations from rising above 650 .
Meinshausen estimates that stabilisation at 650 ppmv CO2e gives a 40 % chance of exceeding 4 degrees C .

After years of debate and planning , the St. Paul , MN city council has voted unanimously to move forward with a unique plan to produce biogas from manure and ethanol waste in rural farms and pump it miles to power an enormous paper recycling plant .
The energy - efficiency of recycling paper is not the best , so this plan is a welcome alternative - fuel twist to the standard process.[ social_buttons ]
The facility , run by the Rock - Tenn company , currently burns a combination of natural gas and petroleum fuel , but previous had operated on steam energy from a coal plant that shut down last year .
An alternative solution is important because the plant is highly energy - intensive , using about the same amount of power as 20,000 homes .
The recycling plant had considered moving to a location where energy costs could be kept down , but the city balked at the idea since the company employs 475 people .
The city funded an intensive investigation into the best solution to the plants ’ energy problem and decided on biogas for many reasons .
Building a biogas facility in the rural farm land keeps any kind of incineration process away from the Rock - Tenn ’s surrounding neighborhoods .
The biogas plant will create more jobs and also benefit the farming community by providing efficient waste disposal , which will help keep their water supply clean .

John McCain quickly shed his last vestiges of decency when he allowed his campaign to try to smear Barack Obama for having been in the same room with Bill Ayers , who had been a Weatherman in the 1960s when Obama was a child .
McCain knows very well that Obama is a centrist , not a radical , that Ayers had long since been rehabilitated and has ties to the Republican governor of South Carolina , and that Obama had very little to do with Ayers .
The ‘ terrorist ’ charge is supposed to work subliminally , and to subconsciously suggest other smears .
In contrast to Obama , McCain was closely associated with an extremist organization , the US Council for World Freedom of John Singlaub .
I showed that he went on associating with it long after he claims to have resigned .
So having created this foaming - at - the - mouth mob , McCain finds himself booed by it when he offers some pro forma boilerplate about Obama being decent and a family man .
But his campaign ads have n’t been alleging decency , they ’ve been alleging “ terrorist ties . ”
You ca n’t wave raw meat dripping blood at Doberman Pinschers and then suddenly pull it away without producing snarling , baring of incisors , and straining at the leash .
The McCain attempt to connect race and terror on a subliminal level in his advertising , while projecting an image of taking the high road in his public appearances crashed and burned on Friday when he did not notice he was engaging in racist hate speech :
‘ Later , another supporter told McCain , “ I do n’t trust Obama … He ’s an Arab . ” McCain stood shaking his head as she spoke , then quickly took the microphone from her .
“ No , ma’am , ” he said .
“ He ’s a decent , family man , a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with . ” ‘
McCain should have said , “ there would be nothing wrong with being an Arab , but Obama is not . ”
The way he put it strongly implied that he had a low opinion of Arabs .
An Arab is a native speaker of the Arabic language , which is akin to Hebrew .
The Arab civilization is one of the more glorious in world history , having bestowed on the world great scientific and cultural achievements .
Arabic is spoken in North Africa and West Asia by approximately 250 million people , a group only somewhat smaller than the population of the United States .
Arabs began immigrating into the United States in the 1880s from Lebanon , and have been an important ethnic group during the past over a century .
They provided everything from auto workers to physicians and comedians .
There are probably three million self - identified Arab - Americans , and as a group they are slightly wealthier , younger and more educated than Americans in general .
( If we counted everyone with at least an 8th Lebanese ancestry as Arab - American , they would be many millions , but most do n’t self - identify that way ) .
Arab - Americans are more likely to own a business than the average American .
Until very recently , they were slightly more likely to vote Republican than Democrat ( they are now trending Democrat ) .
They are potential swing voters in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New Jersey and Florida .
Here is the video .
That confused woman probably did not mean “ Arab ” but “ Muslim . ”
( She later said she was afraid America would become a Muslim country . )
But Arab is a linguistic identity whereas Muslim is a religious one .
Not all Arabs are Muslims .
The Copts in Egypt ( 6 % of the population ) speak Arabic but are Christians .
Likewise the Maronites in Lebanon and many Chaldeans and Assyrians in Iraq .
About 7,000 Jews living in Morocco speak Arabic at home .
If not all Arabs are Muslims , only a minority of Muslims is Arab .
Iranians ( 70 million strong ) are not Arabs .
Turks are not Arabs .
Pakistanis are not Arabs .
Malaysians and Indonesians are not Arabs .
Nigerians and Senegalese are not Arabs .
But all these national or ethnic groups are predominantly Muslim .
Worse than the lady ’s confusion between Arab and Muslim were her further obvious confusion between Muslim and dangerous .
Mr. McCain , Arab - Americans and Muslim - Americans are decent , family - oriented citizens .
The only thing wrong with calling Obama by either of these modifiers is that it would be incorrect .
He is not an Arab ethnically , but rather northern European and Luo ( Nilotic ) .
He is not a Muslim but a Christian .
McCain ’s insinuation that “ Arabs ” ( whether he and his friend actually meant “ Muslims ” or not ) are not decent and not family - oriented and not citizens is obscene .
Ralph Nader , one of McCain ’s rivals for the presidency , is an Arab - American , and McCain owes Mr. Nader and all Arab - Americans , indeed , all Americans , a huge apology .
As with his self - professed “ hatred ” of “ gooks , ” McCain ’s suddenly revealed attitude toward Arab - Americans is extremely troubling .
As if we needed one more problem in the financial market .
Unfortunately it ’s very predictable as credit has expanded well beyond the norm in recent years .
Having lived both in America and more recently in France , the difference in attitude towards credit is stark .
For the most part , people in France spend if and when they have the cash .
They may use a debit card with the VISA sign but it ’s almost always paid off at the end of the month .
Carrying credit as we do ( and I did ) in America is much less common which is perhaps why shopping is less of a national sport as it often is ( or was ) in the US .
The deterioration in consumer credit , the latest downturn to whack Americans after the housing slump and mortgage meltdown , threatens one of the linchpins of the U.S. economy .
Over the past 10 years , credit card debt has gone up 75 percent as Americans ’ real wages and savings rate have stayed flat .
That means Americans have been spending beyond their means — and fueling economic growth with borrowed money .
Now , the housing crash , financial downturn and contracting economy have made it more difficult for Americans to settle their bills , setting off a downward spiral .
As people fail to pay off their credit card bills and other loans , banks must put away money to cover expected losses .
So banks lend less .
Americans who tended to rely on loans to fuel their spending must cut back , readjusting their spending habits to conform with what they earn .
“ Given that the savings rate has been minuscule , there ’s no reserves in the tank for the consumer to tap his savings to support his spending , ” said Scott Valentin , a financial services analyst at Arlington investment bank Friedman Billings Ramsey .
But consumers have been driving about two - thirds of the U.S. economy .
Overall , the rate of credit card loans going bad increased 54 percent in the second quarter of 2008 from the same period in 2007 , according to Federal Reserve data , the latest available .
A report this week from Innovest , a research firm , said banks and other credit card lenders could record nearly $ 100 billion in losses because of bad loans through the end of next year .
Innovest said financial firms could be reaching a “ tipping point ” at which years of growth in credit card debt starts to decline .

JAYAPURA , Indonesia ( Reuters ) - Indonesia ’s Papua province is set to pass a bylaw that requires some HIV / AIDS patients to be implanted with microchips in a bid to prevent them infecting others , a lawmaker said on Saturday .
Under the bylaw , which has caused uproar among human rights activists , patients who had shown “ actively sexual behavior ” could be implanted with a microchip to monitor their activity , lawmaker John Manangsang said .
“ It ’s a simple technology .
A signal from the microchip will track their movements and this will be received by monitoring authorities , ” Manangsang said .
If a patient with HIV / AIDS was found to have infected a healthy person , there would be a penalty , he said without elaborating .
The Jakarta Post newspaper on Saturday quoted Constan Karma , the head of Papua ’s National AIDS Commission , as saying the plan violated human rights .
The local parliament was expected to introduce the controversial legislation in Papua , which lies in Indonesia ’s easternmost fringe , by end of this month , Manangsang said .
The number of HIV / AIDS cases per 100,000 people in Papua is nearly 20 times the national average in Indonesia , according to a government study in 2007 .
Health experts say the disease has been spreading rapidly from prostitutes to housewives in the past years .
High rates of promiscuity , rituals in some Papuan tribes where partner swapping takes place , poor education about AIDS and lack of condoms are among factors that cause the spread of the disease there .

Sangria is a delicious , luscious drink that will get you completely sozzled if you are n’t careful .
That ’s owing to the alcohol - infused fruit the drink is chock full of .
It ’s very easy to make .
Soak fruit overnight ( any combination of chopped organic fruit like apples , pearls and oranges ) in a good value red wine and you ’ll have to keep your guests from guzzling the pitchers .
Try the Organic Wine Company for earth - friendly red wine .
Do n’t use your best wine for this drink – the fruit will change the wine ’s flavor too much for anyone to notice if you shelled out for the expensive vintage .
Eco Margarita

Margaritas were sooooo cool in the 80s .
But with all the fantastic artisanal tequilas showing up these days , it would be a shame to bypass this classic drink .
Best over ice – blending is for wimps .
A margarita needs only 3 things : fine tequila , fresh squeezed lime juice , and a splash of triple sec , preferably Cointreau .
Forget the simple syrup and nasty premade mixes .
A true margarita should be tart and bracing .
A great organic , artisanal tequila to try is Dos Lunas , but there are hundreds , so experiment and explore .

Green Mark
Who knew Maker ’s Mark had gone sustainable ?
It ’s true , “ with its distillery situated on a state - certified nature preserve and with its state - of - the - art recycling and wastewater treatment .
Recently , Maker ’s Mark began using anaerobic digestion , a process that turns waste into bio - gas that is used for energy , offsetting up to 30 percent of the distillery ’s natural gas use .
Katz and Lindgren said a big company such as Maker ’s Mark could serve as an example for the Slow Food movement . ”

For most people , catching your spouse in the act with another person is reason enough to get divorced .
But for many , catching your spouse flirting with someone else online can be a gray area — at the very least , it usually results in a fight .
But what if you caught your spouse 's virtual character having sex — virtual sex , that is — with someone else 's virtual character in a virtual bedroom ?
For two Brits , that was enough to result in divorce , and not the virtual sort .
The couple , Amy Taylor and David Pollard , originally met online themselves before moving in together in Newquay .
Both Taylor and Pollard created avatars in Second Life , where Taylor liked to dress in " tight - fitting cowboy outfits , " as noted by The Guardian .
Taylor woke up one day to find her boyfriend 's Second Life character having sex with a virtual prostitute ( side note : virtual prostitution = easiest sex work ever ? ) .
She then apparently ended her virtual relationship with Pollard while keeping the real - life relationship going .
Here 's where things get a little too virtual - drama for us .
Taylor set herself up as a new Second Life character in order to spy on her husband 's virtual infidelities but discovered that Pollard could do nothing but talk about her .
Lovestruck , Taylor found herself marrying Pollard — both in a lavish Second Life ceremony and in a slightly - less - lavish real life ceremony .
However , she soon discovered that maybe she should have taken more time with Pollard , as she soon found him once again flirting in Second Life .
She also learned that his previous affair had resulted in " real affection . "
" It may have started on - line but it existed entirely in the real world and it hurts just as much , " Taylor told The Guardian .
" His was the ultimate betrayal .
He had been lying to me . "
Needless to say , Taylor filed for divorce .
In real life .
And probably Second Life .
Predictably , Pollard insists that nothing was happening and that no cyber sex had occurred between him and his Second Life lady friends .
" We were n't even having cyber sex or anything like that ; we were just chatting and hanging out together .
It was nothing really major .
I do n't think I was really doing anything wrong , " he said .
Somehow , we get the feeling that these two probably should have kept their own relationship online and bypassed the whole marriage thing in the first place .

11,000 alien species invade Europe
A comprehensive overview
Halle / Saale .
For the first time it is now possible to get a comprehensive overview of which alien species are present in Europe , their impacts and consequences for the environment and society .
More than 11,000 alien species have been documented by DAISIE ( Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventory for Europe ) , a unique three year research project with more than 100 European scientists , funded by the European Union that provides new knowledge on biological invasions in Europe .
Biological invasions by alien species often result in a significant loss in the economic value , biological diversity and function of invaded ecosystems .
Handbook of Alien Species in Europe
Source : Springer Publishing House Harmful visitors
The majority of these 11,000 alien species are however , not harmful .
About 15 percent of these alien species cause economic damages and 15 percent cause harm to biological diversity , that is the environment , habitats and native plants , animals and micro-organisms , according to findings in the newly released and freely accessible web portal at www.europe-aliens.org and the DAISIE " Handbook of alien species in Europe " that is launched this week .
Knowledge enables action Previous to the publication of the results of the DAISIE project , the number and impacts of harmful alien species ( also called invasive alien species ) in Europe has been underestimated , especially for species that do not damage agriculture , forestry or human health .
The lack of knowledge has contributed to inaction in many European countries which is becoming increasingly disastrous for Europe ’s biodiversity , health and economy .
Why do we need the information ?
Alien species may have a profound impact on the environment and society as they can act as vectors for new diseases , alter ecosystem processes , change biodiversity , disrupt cultural landscapes , reduce the value of land and water for human activities and cause other socio-economic consequences .
Alien species are plants , animals and micro-organisms that have been moved by humans to new environments outside of the range they occupy naturally .
Supporting qualified decisions Information in this week published DAISIE " Handbook of Alien Species in Europe " and the internet accessible knowledge base provides an important tool for managing the threat of biological invasion in Europe .
Information in DAISIE can be used for documenting current invasions , predicting new invasions and preventing future invasions .
Crucial information for planning measures for early detection , eradication and control methods is also provided to decision - makers , environmental planners , students and all concerned .

The Mercury Theatre on the Air
The finest radio drama of the 1930 ’s was The Mercury Theatre on the Air , a show featuring the acclaimed New York drama company founded by Orson Welles and John Houseman .
In its brief run , it featured an impressive array of talents , including Agnes Moorehead , Bernard Herrmann , and George Coulouris .
The show is famous for its notorious War of the Worlds broadcast , but the other shows in the series are relatively unknown .
This site has many of the surviving shows , and will eventually have all of them .
The show first broadcast on CBS and CBC in July 1938 .
It ran without a sponsor until December of that year , when it was picked up by Campbell ’s Soup and renamed The Campbell Playhouse .
All of the surviving Mercury Theatre shows are available from this page in RealAudio format ( some are also in MP3 format ) .
There are several Campbell Playhouse episodes available here as well , in both RealAudio and MP3 formats ; the rest are being added gradually .

Verdiem Launch Free Software to Slash PC Power Use Up to 80 Percent
November 18th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
PC energy saving specialists Verdiem have today released free downloadable software designed to help users slash their energy use up to a massive 80 percent .
According to Allison Cornia , vice president of product management at Verdiem , “ If we could get just 10 per cent of the world ’s one billion PCs using [ the product ] properly we could save 32 billion kilograms of CO2 a year .
That ’s equivalent to taking half a million cars off the road . ”
The new Edison software package employs a desktop user - interface designed to make it easier for users to access functions embedded deep in their PC ’s existing operating system , enabling them to set times at which the machine will automatically transfer to sleep mode .
It also allows users to reduce the amount of time a computer lies idle before it switches monitor , PC and hard drive power off .
One of the main aims of the product is to raise awareness among consumers about how much power their PC actually uses , thereby making it easier for consumers to minimize the size of their IT - related carbon footprint .
To enable this , a nifty feature of the software allows users to track their carbon and energy use savings in real - time , which should act as a powerful tool to change behavior .
Free products like these make it much easier for users to drastically reduce the environmental impact of their activities .
However , you have to wonder why the PC manufacturers themselves are n’t bundling such packages as standard with new PC ’s , so that from the moment they switch on , users are instantly aware of the best way to save money and energy .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
You may have heard that German is a difficult and complex language to learn .
This is true to some extent ; however , much depends on the way the language is taught , the learner ’s natural capacity for languages , and the amount of practice dedicated to it .
The following peculiarities of the German language should not discourage you from studying German , but simply prepare you for what you will encounter .
Remember , German is a very logically structured language , with many fewer exceptions than English .
The key to your success in learning German will truly be as this old German adage states : Übung macht den Meister !
( or , " Practice makes perfect " )
The Difference Between a German Sausage and a Verb
Why are we comparing a sausage to a verb ?
Simply because German verbs can be chopped and cut up just as a German sausage can !
In German , you can take a verb , chop off the first part , and place it at the end of a sentence .
And in actuality , you can even do more to a German verb than what you can do with a sausage : you can insert another “ part ” ( a.k.a. syllable ) in the middle of a verb , add other verbs alongside it and even elongate it .
How ’s that for flexibility ?
Of course , there are some rules to this chopping business , which once you understand them , will be easy to apply .
German Nouns
Every German student loves this particular German - language peculiarity — all nouns are capitalized !
This serves as a visual aid for reading comprehension and as a consistent rule in spelling .
Further , German pronunciation pretty much follows the way it is written ( though you need to know the peculiarities of the German alphabet first , see above ) , which makes German spelling not very difficult .
Now to put a damper to all of this good news :
Not all German nouns are inherently nouns and may , therefore , throw off the German writer at first as to whether to capitalize a word or not .
For instance , verb infinitives can change into a noun and German adjectives can change into nouns .
This role changing of words happens in the English language as well , for example when verbs change into gerunds .
German Gender
Most would agree , that this is the greatest hurdle of German grammar .
Every noun in German is identified by grammatical gender .
The der article is placed before masculine nouns , die before feminine nouns and das before neuter nouns .
It would be nice if that was all there was to it , but German articles change , along with the endings of German adjectives , adverbs and nouns depending on the grammatical case they are in .
For example , let ’s take a look at the following sentence :
Der Junge gibt der wütenden Mutter den Ball des Mädchens .
( The boy gives to the angry mother the girl ’s ball . )
In this sentence , der wütenden Mutter acts as the indirect object , so it is dative ; den Ball acts as the direct object , so it is accusative and des Mädchens is in the possessive genitive case .
The nominative forms of these words were : die wütende Mutter ; der Ball ; das Mädchen .
Almost every word was changed in this sentence .
One very important point about German grammar gender is that nouns do n’t necessarily follow the natural law of gender as we know it .
For example , though die Frau ( woman ) and der Mann ( man ) are designated feminine and masculine respectively , das Mädchen ( girl ) is neuter .
Mark Twain in his humorous account of “ The Awful German Language ” described this German grammar peculiarity in this way :
" Every noun has a gender , and there is no sense or system in the distribution ; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart .
There is no other way .
To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum - book .
In German , a young lady has no sex , while a turnip has .
Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip , and what callous disrespect for the girl .
See how it looks in print — I translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday - school books :
Gretchen : Wilhelm , where is the turnip ?
Wilhelm :
She has gone to the kitchen .
Gretchen :
Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden ?
Wilhelm :
It has gone to the opera .
However , Mark Twain was wrong when he said that a student has to have “ a memory like a memorandum - book . ”
There are some strategies that can help a German student figure out which gender a noun has .
German Cases
In German there are four cases :
Der Nominativ ( nominative )
Der Genitiv / Wesfall ( genitive )
Der Akkusativ / Wenfall ( accusative )
Der Dativ / Wemfall ( dative )
Though all cases are important , the accusative and dative cases are the most widely used and should be learned first .
There is a grammatical trend especially orally to use the genitive case less and less and replace it with the dative in certain contexts .
Articles and other words are declined in various ways , depending on gender and grammatical case .
The German Alphabet
The German alphabet has a few differences from the English language .
The very first ( and perhaps most important ) thing you need to know about the German alphabet is that there are more than twenty - six letters in the German alphabet .
Tiptoeing Through the Muck of Alaskan Politics
LONDON , England --
Many people think of tuberculosis as being a disease from the past .
The truth is far from it : Tuberculosis is mutating into dangerous new strains for which there is no known cure .
A mother comforts her young son who is suffering from TB meningitis .
more photos »
One of the most frightening strains is XDR - TB , which stands for extensively drug- resistant TB .
Unlike less virulent strains , XDR - TB does not respond to the antibiotics that are usually used to treat TB .
The disease is virtually incurable and threatens to become a pandemic .
About 40,000 new cases of XDR - TB emerge every year , the World Health Organization estimates .
Award - winning photojournalist James Nachtwey , who has chronicled the death and devastation the disease is bringing to many countries around the world , describes XDR - TB as " a merciless , man-eating predator lurking in the shadows . "
He warns : " If it 's not contained , the consequences could be dire . "
Nachtwey , who has been covering humanitarian crises for more than 30 years , was awarded a TED prize in 2007 which gave him $ 100,000 and one wish to change the world .
His wish centered on spreading awareness of this deadly form of TB and the images are borne out of Nachtwey 's frustrations with the underreporting of what is potentially a global health crisis .
His photos tell the grim stories of impending death .
In one , a man 's suffering is so palpable that it is almost impossible to tear your eyes away from him .
Another image shows a woman in a Thai hospital staring vacantly , as if resigned to the fact that death is soon approaching .

Vital Signs Each month CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brings viewers health stories from around the world .
See more from the show »
Yet another shows the look of helplessness on a mother 's face faintly reflected in the terrified eyes of her ailing child .
And so the images continue , revealing with each click of the mouse a photo that is more haunting than the last .
Nachtwey traveled to seven different countries , including Cambodia , South Africa , Swaziland and Siberia , and used his photography to tell the story of a disease that primarily afflicts developing nations , but has been found elsewhere worldwide .
His work is documented at XDR - TB.org , a Web site solely dedicated to telling the story of the disease through his powerful images .
Health experts say that the tragic thing about XDR - TB is that it should not exist .
TB in itself is curable .
But if anti-TB drugs are not properly administered or used , the disease can mutate into deadlier strands such as XDR .
And the life - saving drugs used to treat regular TB only cost $ 20 per patient in the developing world , according to the WHO .
But there have n't been enough funds raised to combat the disease , which is strongly linked to poverty .
Furthermore , according to Louise Holly from Action , a group aimed at controlling the spread of TB , no new scientific developments to combat TB have been made in more than 40 years .
Holly told CNN that people have many misconceptions about TB .
" The drug resistant strand is a highly contagious airborne disease .
With increased travel and globalization , it is possible for anyone to pick up the disease , even in developed countries like the U.S. and UK , " she said .
Holly said that TB can be transmitted in overly populated areas , which include poor villages and prisons , but also in cosmopolitan places , such as London or New York , where people work closely together and ride crowded public transportation .
Currently , treatment options for XDR are virtually non-existent .
Those most susceptible to it are people with weakened immune systems , such as those with HIV .
Holly told CNN that as serious as the XDR strand is , it could serve as a wake - up call to the public that the disease still exists and that people should view tuberculosis as a modern - day ailment .
In this guest article , Jacen Nicely goes through the first hand personal experiences of becoming a freelance designer detailing the emotions and the three phases of the process ( research , planning and implementation ) of going from frustrated to a full time freelancer .
This article is applicable to all freelancers , not just designers .
When Jacob first threw out the offer on Twitter ( Follow Jacob On Twitter ) to write a post for his website before he left on his trip around Australia I responded with “ “ I would offer but I do n’t have any examples of written work , just the last 6 months of planning & implication of starting my business . ”
I mean I ’m a nobody you ’ve never heard of right ?
This is why I really did n’t expect much from that but I was shocked with how Jacob responded back which was “ If you think you can get an article out of your experiences and benefit others , why not ? ”
I may be a nobody but I am a nobody that has been struggling with a way to escape the desk job life for almost six months now which I am sure there are many others who could relate with me in that scenario .
Over the past few months I have researched , planned and implemented my way into a new life of freelancing and what I wanted to do was show you what it was like for me to go from frustrated to the first client in six months .
The article details the three main phases of the process : research , planning and implementation of becoming a freelancer .
Making The Choice To Freelance
You could feel free to name your typical frustrated cubicle jockey situation where thoughts of meaningfulness fly around in your head on rotating shifts .
Thoughts like “ What am I doing ” and “ Is this what I am going to do for the rest of my life ? ” were a Monday through Friday routine .
I knew the answer to the second question for sure and it was a very emphatic negative .
I had been surfing around the web and discovered entire websites dedicated freelancing and the art of how to start and I was instantly hooked .
I had been working with Photoshop for around 7 years and enjoyed doing random projects for friends and family , all of which paid in meals , which was fine with me because I always got the steak .
So I knew that I enjoyed doing the work but I did n’t really like not getting paid .
This freelancing gig seemed like a good deal , you find work and people actually pay you for the work you do .
Doing The Research
So I began my search for how people were starting out and I found a lot of resources available out there , this site being one of them and found that it was n’t that hard to start up .
There were a lot of great ideas out there of what one needed to be aware of before taking the plunge .
Mostly articles about getting started as a freelancer , pricing ones self and independent insurance coverage cost , which if you are a family man like I am that is pretty important for the sanity of your entire household .
There were many of great resources for anything that you could possibly dream up on sites like Freelance Switch , Freelance Folder and Vandelay Design .
These along with Just Creative Design were my top four inspirations for getting started , which if words were to actually have a weight measure then these sites would have TONS of information for any eager wannabe freelancer out there .
To this day one of my favorite posts is Jacob ’s “ Why logo design does not cost $ 5.00 ” because it helped give me a sense of value to the work I did and erased the fear of quoting a cost to someone even if it seemed a little “ expensive ” in their eyes .
I also found other sites like FreshBooks or Zoho Invoicing to assist with looking extremely professional when it comes to sending an estimate or letting someone know you mean business by sending a bill for services rendered .
Planning
I was stoked to say the least , here were all of these mostly free resources to utilize so that I could basically operate out of my home in my pajamas should I desire , but I needed a plan .
I could n’t just be excited everyday and not do anything .
There came a time to face quite possibly two of the most dangerous words in the entire English language , Personal Responsibility .
To be comfortable with that I wanted to make sure there would be enough funds in the bank to cover any unforeseen trouble in case one month did n’t go as well as another .
I believed 6 months of my gross income saved up would be enough and I set a date one year from then to have that money saved .
I also wanted to make sure of exactly what services I was going to offer and I knew that I was most comfortable with print type projects but I knew that there was some major money to be made with website and blog designs .
I actually ended up teaming up with a friend of mine that I have known for almost 15 years that has a lot of excellent experience in developing web sites .
So now I knew how much money I needed to save and what services I was going to offer now all I needed to do was to start getting my name out there .
Which leads me to the next section .
Implementation :
I decided to get some business cards and a small brochure , make a list of local business ’s that did n’t have a web site or who desperately needed a makeover and drop by for a visit .
Editors note :

I also decided that whenever I would meet someone and they would ask what I did I would make sure and tell them that I was a graphic designer who designed anything from wedding invitations to websites .
This really did two things , it boosted my confidence and it opened up a lot of opportunities for some business card projects and yes even a wedding invitation .
It ’s amazing what a little eye contact and decent suit will get you .
Those projects gave me a lot of encouragement … it helped me to think that this could actually be done .
I started letting other people know what I was doing .
I sent out a letter to every friend and family member whose address I had and I got a couple of projects out of that as well until recently we got our first order for a full - on e-commerce website and logo .
It ’s hard , tedious and I am pulling some late nights but I honestly love it .

Conclusion :
It is completely worth putting your man / woman pants on and owning up to what you want to do in life .
Personal responsibility is n’t so scary once you commit to the pursuit of your dream .
The more action that I took towards making a freelancers life , the better I felt about the decision I made .

When the going gets tough ... well , you know the saying ... the tough get going .
However , in the case of software development , in times of financial crisis - like we 're in - when belt - tightening begins , some developers and development shops might be better suited to roll with the turbulent times than others .
These folks include Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers , and other programmers who focus on dynamic languages or provide specialty programming skills that many people claim enable them to do more with fewer resources .
Whether that 's totally true or not , I do n't know .
Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers typically boast of large productivity gains from moving to those environments - whether they get performance gains is another story .
" I think Rails developers are much better positioned to weather the storm as they generally stand for delivering more with less faster , " said David Heinemeier Hansson , creator of the Ruby on Rails Web application framework .
" It 's the traditional mainstream environments that are going to see much more pressure to deliver . "
Lance Walley , CEO of Engine Yard , a Ruby and Ruby on Rails hosting and deployment service provider , said , " A slowing economy will likely lead to constrained IT budgets .
There 's a good chance this will have a positive impact on the uptake of open - source options , such as Linux , Ruby and Rails . "
Click here to read about Engine Yard 's drive to use Ruby and Ruby on Rails to build large , scalable applications .
Indeed , Walley said , in Engine Yard 's experience , " developing Web applications with Ruby and Rails results in a five - to - six - times project time reduction and a project completion probability increase from the industry average of 10 percent to well over 50 percent .
We see this over and over from Engine Yard customers .
With many hundreds of customers , this is not a fluke of one customer or a few customers but real , proven savings . "
Echoing Hansson , Walley added , " When times are lean , IT managers are forced to do more with less .
Ruby and Rails present a way to do just that .
Developers are [ rarer ] and more expensive in terms of hourly rates , but projects can be cut down from 30 man-months to six man-months .
That 's a huge cost savings , plus it 's always good to be done sooner than later . "
Meanwhile , Doug Levin , the CEO and founder of a new stealth startup company and founder of several other startups , including Black Duck Software six years ago , said :
" Rails is very hot and Erlang is super - hot at this time .
This is because there is more expertise in the market , people are understanding their strengths and weaknesses , more support is available and these technologies have recently improved .
Specialty coding shops always do well .
They will net out positively during these times :
Some companies will avoid them because of the risk and uncertainty ; some will double down with new projects because they see opportunity . "
Even non-Ruby or open - source - related observers said they believe there could be a connection between the language / framework platform and productivity and savings .
For instance , Jonathan Lindo , CEO and co-founder of Replay Solutions , said he also believes specialty coding shops could fare well in a down economy .
" Companies that have IT requirements but do n't have the stomach to hire a team or build an off - shore operation may increasingly turn to specialty shops to deliver smaller , well - scoped projects , " Lindo said .
" I believe there is good opportunity here for trusted shops to do well . "
Hansson added :
" I think now is exactly the time to follow what we 've been preaching with Getting Real for all these years .
Build less software with fewer resources !
Build half a product , not a half - assed one .
Do n't do preemptive hiring .
Charge money for your software .
Try to ' underdo ' your competition . "
Moreover , Engine Yard 's Walley predicted , " If there is a downturn in IT spending , it may very well be a boost to Ruby and Rails and companies like Engine Yard , as well as the many Engine Yard customers who are specialized Ruby and Rails development shops . "
Presidential candidate Barack Obama surprised political observers yesterday by suddenly withdrawing from the campaign trail to spend some time with his elderly rival John McCain .
McCain who is 97 years old and very frail is said to be fading fast and Obama wanted to see him one last time before he was gone forever .
‘ Barack knows that he could never have got this far if it had n’t have been for old man McCain .
He owes everything to him . ’
Obama reportedly sat at the bedside of the dying Republican nominee trying to make sense of the confused ramblings coming from the old man ’s mouth , according to an assistant to the Illinois senator .
‘ Grandpa McCain ’s mind had gone unfortunately , he just kept claiming everyone was a terrorist and then he ’d go off on some incomprehensible rant about dividing up a pie or making a bigger pie or something .
He ’s completely lost it . ’
Doctors give Obama ’s opponent another couple of weeks or so , but do n’t expect him to be around after the first week of November .
Seeing the positive press reaction to Obama ’s humanitarian gesture , Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin today announced that she was withdrawing from the campaign to spend some time with a dying polar bear in her home state of Alaska .
However one local observer commented ‘ It ’s a touching gesture , but it does n’t count when she ’s the one who shot it . ’

The Paper Ostrich
Experience in Indochina and Central America suggests that CIA , the principal paymaster for U.S. - backed Afghan warlords , may be more deeply involved in the drug trade than we yet know .
October 16 , 2008
Afghanistan is in a `downward spiral , ' the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen , admitted last week , giving the most negative view of that conflict heard in Washington .
Military men are programmed to always be optimistic , so Admiral Mullen 's grim words were particularly noteworthy .
They also flatly contradicted the rosy claims of `progress ' in Afghanistan made by the Bush administration and its increasingly dispirited allies in Canada , France , Germany , Italy and other NATO nations that were dragooned into this deeply unpopular war .
Most Europeans see the Afghan conflict as a 19th - century style colonial war for regional domination and resources .
By contrast , Americans are still being misled by their corporate media and posturing politicians of both parties into believing the seven - year U.S. occupation of Afghanistan is a noble `anti-terrorism ' mission that is defending women 's rights and rebuilding a ravage nation instead of another brutal grab for energy , this time from the Caspian Basin .
In a troubling example of Vietnam - style ' mission creep , ' the U.S. commander in Afghanistan , Gen. David McKiernan , is calling for 15,000 more American troops on top of the 8,000 now slated to arrive in January 2009 .
His predecessor told Congress that 400,000 U.S. troops would be needed to pacify Afghanistan .
But McKiernan also called for talks with Afghan nationalists resisting western occupation collectively known as Taliban .
Days earlier , it was revealed that senior British officers and diplomats in Afghanistan had called the US - led war `un- winnable ' and advocated peace talks with Taliban .
Admiral Mullen also ordered U.S. and NATO forces to begin targeting Afghanistan 's opium and heroin dealers .
Under American tutelage , Afghanistan has become the world 's leading narco - state , surpassing even Colombia , and now producing 90 % of the world 's heroin .
Well over half of the nation 's GDP consists of drug money .
Considering this , Admiral Mullen 's ' shoot on sight ' orders seem rather overdue .
The 64,000 rupee question that arises from Admiral Mullen 's new anti-drug policy is :
Why was it not done seven years ago when the U.S. invaded Afghanistan ?
Why did Washington turn a blind eye to the Afghan drug trade and is only now taking some action ?
The answer is simple and dismaying .
America 's local allies in Afghanistan , the politicians and warlords who overthrew Taliban in 2001 , are up to their turbans in the heroin trade .
Drug money is the blood that courses through Afghanistan 's veins and keeps the economy limping along .
The U.S. - installed Karzai regime in Kabul propped up by US and NATO bayonets has only two sources of income : cash handouts from Washington , and the proceeds of drug dealing .
When Taliban ruled 90 % of Afghanistan from 1996 - 2001 , it almost totally stamped out poppy cultivation as un-Islamic .
The UN 's drug control agency has confirmed this fact .
The only remaining source of drug dealing was in the remote northeast of Afghanistan controlled by the Russian and Iranian - backed Northern Alliance , made up of Tajik Panshiri tribesmen , brutal Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostam , and the remains of the old Afghan Communist Party .
In 2001 , the U.S. overthrew Taliban and put the drug - dealing Northern Alliance and Communists in power .
Since then , Afghanistan 's drug production has spread across the nation and exports have soared by 60 - 70 % , making Afghanistan the source of nearly all the world 's supply of heroin .
Washington called off efforts by the Drug Enforcement Agency to combat the Afghan drug trade for fear of endangering the power base of its former CIA `asset , ' President Hamid Karzai .
Starting with Karzai's brother , Ahmed Wali , the U.S. - installed regime 's most important supporters are all involved in varying degrees with the heroin trade .
As this writer has seen himself , almost every important warlord gets revenue from the drug trade .
The Northern Alliance warlords are considered the biggest of the nation 's narco - dealers .
Ahmed Karzai denies involvement .
Moving against the drug warlords would have meant undermining Karzai 's sole domestic support .
So Washington held its nose and let the drug trade flourish in order to sustain the occupation .
The faux `war on terror ' and lust for Caspian energy trumped the old war on drugs .
Experience in Indochina and Central America suggests that CIA , the principal paymaster for U.S. - backed Afghan warlords , may be more deeply involved in the drug trade than we yet know .
Author Alfred McCoy 's wrote a brilliant study in his ground - breaking ` The Politics of Heroin ' in which he documents how first French , then American intelligence was drawn into the heroin trade in Laos and Vietnam as a way of supporting anti-Communist guerilla fighters .
The same thing happened in Central America where CIA collaborated with cocaine - dealing members of the anti-Communist Contras .
In both cases , drugs served as a currency and became more important than paper money .
French and American spies even ended up transporting heroin for their local allies .
The same may be happening in Afghanistan .
Equally disturbing , there is no way that simple Afghan farmers or Taliban fighters are running the drug trade , as Washington claims .
Poppy sap is collected and converted into opium tar .
Then it is smuggled to secret labs in Pakistan to be transformed into first morphine base , and then purified into heroin .
None of these drugs would move south into Pakistan or be processed with imported chemicals without the full cooperation and assistance of the Afghan government , its supporting warlords , and local Pakistani officials .
The drugs are then smuggled out of the port of Karachi , again under at protection by port and local officials .
Pakistan is a key U.S. ally .
The Karzai regime has been totally corrupted by the drug trade , and so has parts of Pakistan 's establishment .
But the United States has also become corrupted in the sense that it has done nothing to combat this scourge and has collaborated with Afghanistan 's drug barons by at minimum turning blind eye .
When the history of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan is written , Washington 's sordid involvement in the heroin trade and its alliance with drug lords and war criminals of the Afghan Communist Party will be one of the most shameful chapters .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
At least three U.S. citizens , including a Brooklyn rabbi , were killed in militant attacks in the Indian capital Mumbai and the State Department said more Americans were at risk .
President George W. Bush said he was deeply saddened and the United States was working with India ’s government to ensure the safety of those still under threat .
“ We will continue to cooperate against these extremists who offer nothing but violence and hopelessness , ” he said in a statement .
The Virginia - based Synchronicity Foundation said on its Web site that Alan Scherr and his 13 - year - old daughter Naomi , Americans who were in India as part of a meditation program , had died in the attacks that have killed at least 124 people .
Separately , the New York office of the Chabad - Lubavitch Jewish group said a Brooklyn rabbi and his wife were killed in the siege on a Jewish center in Mumbai as part of the coordinated attacks .
The rabbi was a dual U.S. - Israeli national and his wife Israeli , the group said .
“ Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg , the beloved directors of Chabad - Lubavitch of Mumbai , were killed during one of the worst terrorist attacks to strike India in recent memory , ” the Chabad ’s New York headquarters said in a statement .
The couple ’s son , who turns two on Saturday , escaped along with his nanny , the group said .

State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said : “ There are still Americans at risk on the ground and we want to be very , very careful with any facts . ”
At least 124 people have been killed and 284 wounded in the attacks on India ’s financial hub .
Indian commandos on Friday stormed the Jewish center , killing two suspected Islamist gunmen but failing to save five hostages .
Rescue efforts were still going on at the luxury Taj hotel where many foreigners stay while in Mumbai .
Duguid said a State Department hotline had received around 1,500 calls for information about friends and relatives .
U.S. consular staff are stationed at hotels affected by the attacks as well as hospitals in order to identify Americans in need of help as quickly as possible , he said .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has over the past 36 hours spoken to India ’s foreign minister as well as Pakistan ’s President Asif Ali Zardari , said Duguid .
Rice also called U.S. President - elect Barack Obama twice to brief him , said Duguid .
Aides to Obama said he had also received an intelligence briefing on the attacks .
Duguid said Rice had spoken to Zardari to “ get a good sense of what is happening in the region . ”
“ Regional tensions have been a historical factor in South Asia and the United States has always worked for lessening those tensions , ” he added .
When John McCain chose Sarah Palin to be his running mate , his supporters declared the move a masterstroke .
But Republican poll ratings have been falling day by day - and now the ' Troopergate ' scandal has turned the Hockey Mom from Alaska into a liability for a campaign that has lost its way .
Paul Harris reports
Nothing typifies the plight of John McCain 's campaign more than the rollercoaster ride of his surprise vice - presidential pick , Sarah Palin .
In six weeks , she has gone from disaster to triumph and back again several times .
Originally greeted with disbelief after her candidacy was announced on the eve of the Republican National Convention in St Paul , Minnesota , Palin wowed the party with her stunning debut speech .
For a while it seemed that the self - described ' pitbull in lipstick ' would be the surprise ingredient in the race .
Palin electrified voters , taking McCain ahead of Barack Obama in the polls and bringing in legions of undecided women .
The Obama campaign floundered as it tried to come to terms with a phenomenon so novel that the old game - plans had to be torn up .
In teaming up with a political ingenue with grassroots appeal , McCain had taken a terrific risk .
And it appeared to have paid off .
Then came Katie Couric .
The network TV anchor did not so much grill Palin as give the Alaska governor enough rope to hang herself .
Palin floundered against even the most harmless questions , such as what newspapers she read , and became the butt of jokes on Saturday Night Live .
Satirists competed to offer the best impression of her bumbling incoherence .
But then Palin surprised everyone again with a strong performance in her debate against Senator Joe Biden , resurrecting her supporters ' belief that she could change the campaign .
That hope has probably died with the Troopergate report .
The enormous microscope of a presidential campaign has magnified an obscure staffing dispute in Alaska - over whether Palin pursued a family vendetta against state trooper Mike Wooten - into a major political story .
With the release of a damaging report this weekend that concluded Palin did abuse the powers of her office , her political trajectory has once again changed course .
Gone are the dreams of Palin bringing in the desperately needed independent voters , former Hillary Clinton supporters and soft Democrats the McCain campaign need so much .
Instead she has now been firmly assigned to the traditional role of the vice - presidential candidate : attack dog .
It is a role she does well and it plays to the Republican base .
There is still no doubting that Palin can powerfully move a Republican crowd .
Her angry attacks on Obama stir supporters far more effectively than does McCain 's more measured style .
But she is now largely reduced to stumping in the rural Republican heartlands of America .
She is a powerful tool in working up the party base , ensuring that they turn out on election day , but her crossover appeal has gone .
Indeed , even Republican critics of Palin have been stamped on for questioning her .
Several high - profile conservative writers - such as David Brooks in the New York Times and Kathleen Parker in the National Review - have poured scorn on her .
Brooks even called her ' a fatal cancer on the Republican party ' .
But the response among the base was instant and brutal .
Parker received no fewer than 12,000 outraged emails , including some wishing she had been aborted , after writing that Palin should step down .
There seems little doubt that Palin is still the darling of a huge section of red state America .
But what works for the Republican base no longer works for the country as a whole .
Attack dogs do not win the middle ground , especially ones beset by scandal and smarting from the damning judgment of Alaska state investigator Steve Branchflower , who discovered that Todd , Palin 's husband , enjoyed extraordinary access to his wife 's closest advisers , despite being unelected and having no salaried state post .
He then used that access to try to get Wooten fired , the report found .
Palin was criticised for taking no action to rein in her husband and Branchflower concluded there was evidence that she participated in the campaign against Wooten .
The report states : ' The evidence supports the conclusion that Governor Palin , at the least , engaged in " official action " by her inaction , if not her active participation or assistance , to her husband in attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired ( and there is evidence of her active participation ) .
' She knowingly ... permitted Todd Palin to use the governor 's office and the resources of the governor 's office , including access to state employees , to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired . '
It adds that Palin 's actions created ' conflicts of interests for subordinate employees who must choose to either please a superior or run the risk of facing that superior 's displeasure and the possible consequences of that displeasure ' .
In sum , Palin breached a code of conduct for state officials that ' each public officer holds office as a public trust , and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust ' .
Not an ideal verdict for a vice - presidential candidate 23 days from the election .
Troopergate has come as a body - blow to a campaign that was already on a losing streak .
All last week , as the polls showed Obama pulling away , the atmosphere at McCain rallies had become angrier and angrier .
In Wisconsin , one irate supporter , taking the microphone , urged his chosen candidate on the stage to do something - anything - to beat Obama .
' I am begging you , sir .
I am begging you .
Take it to him !' implored James Harris , a local radio host , as the crowd clapped and applauded .
His mantra was picked up by other speakers .
' I 'm mad !
I 'm really mad ! ' said another man , who refused to let go of the mic and whose furious rant was then broadcast on the nation 's TV screens and the internet .
Fury has become the dominant theme .
As the poll numbers have worsened , Republican supporters seem to have reacted with a mixture of disbelief and anger .
At rally after rally , from Florida to Ohio to Wisconsin , supporters have urged their campaign to fight harder .
Mention of Obama 's name prompts cries of ' traitor ' , ' treason ' and ' kill him ' .
Members of the press , universally suspected of Democratic sympathies , are targeted and insulted .
At one rally in the South a black network TV cameraman was racially abused by a McCain supporter and told : ' Sit down , boy . '
Inside the Obama camp , and increasingly among Republican insiders , there is a growing feeling : this is what losing campaigns look like .
In the wake of Troopergate , such a conclusion is hard to resist , even though there are more than three weeks of electioneering ahead .
After months of holding on against what seemed impossible odds , McCain 's chances of keeping the White House in Republican hands are sinking fast .
The wheels are coming off his campaign as the key states of Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania all swing firmly towards Obama .
In fact , the electoral battleground has become the Republican turf of Virginia , North Carolina and Indiana .
One national poll late last week put Obama a huge 11 points clear of McCain .
The deep - seated reasons why McCain 's campaign has been swept aside can be found in the gravity of the economic crisis and the legacy of President George W Bush , who is leaving after eight years in office with a popularity rate so disastrous that it compares only to Richard Nixon's .
But the Palin fall - out promises to be damaging because Troopergate is an embarrassment that is entirely self - inflicted .
The stunning , quixotic choice of Palin had seemed to give McCain a remarkable chance of success .
But after the dreadful rollout to the national media and now ' Troopergate ' , Palin has gone from saviour to liability with a swiftness that has amazed even watchers of her meteoric career rise .
Perhaps the one thing the campaign has going for it is that it knows it is in trouble .
McCain , always a realist , is being frank about the realities of his plight .
' I 'm the underdog .
I 've always been the underdog from the beginning , ' he told a television interviewer late last week .
What now ?
Yesterday , the McCain team were engaged in a desperate damage limitation exercise , rubbishing the Branchflower report as an exercise in partisan politics .
Nevertheless , the Alaskan mud is likely to stick .
McCain 's biggest problem is still the sheer scale of the economic crisis .
The collapsing stock market , economic bail - out and banks going bust has shocked the American electorate .
It wiped out any other issue and focused the entire election on the traditional Democratic territory of the economy .
Neither is that likely to change any time soon .
McCain must also overcome the fact that Americans increasingly blame their problems on Bush and eight years of Republican rule .
Though McCain has tried to co-opt Obama 's image of change and fighting the current administration , it is a tough trick to pull off .
The fact is the electorate desperately wants change and faces a choice between a Republican veteran who would be one of America 's oldest presidents and a young , fresh - faced Democrat who would be the first black politician to sit in the Oval Office .
Given that stark choice , the change mantle is hard to yank from Obama 's shoulders .
That has seemingly left only one line of attack : going negative .
In the past week , as newspaper headlines around America have reported the worst week in Wall Street 's history , McCain 's campaign has relentlessly touted the name of Bill Ayers .
The 1960s radical was a member of the Weather Underground , an urban terrorist group that bombed government targets .
He is now , however , a university lecturer in Chicago , with minor links to Obama .
But it is possible that the attacks using Ayers are but the prelude to a more ominous main event .
Despite urging from some quarters within his campaign , McCain has not yet himself raised the issue of Obama 's former pastor , the Rev Jeremiah Wright .
McCain is believed to have termed the issue off - limits so far , even though news of Wright 's incendiary sermons , condemning America as a racist society and blaming Aids on government , almost derailed Obama 's candidacy when they first emerged .
But , as the November election gets closer and closer , and if the polls do not shift , McCain may be tempted to let the Wright issue loose .
He is already facing pressure from Palin to do just that .
In an interview with conservative columnist Bill Kristol , Palin urged her running mate to bring the Wright issue out of the box .
' I do n't know why that association is n't discussed more ... but , you know , I guess that would be a John McCain call on whether he wants to bring that up , ' she said .
That interview of course , took place before the Branchflower report .
Now Palin may find that the attack dogs are chasing her .
The human and chimpanzee genomes vary by just 1.2 percent , yet there is a considerable difference in the mental and linguistic capabilities between the two species .
A new study showed that a certain form of neuropsin , a protein that plays a role in learning and memory , is expressed only in the central nervous systems of humans and that it originated less than 5 million years ago .
The study , which also demonstrated the molecular mechanism that creates this novel protein , will be published online in Human Mutation , the official journal of the Human Genome Variation Society .
Led by Dr. Bing Su of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Kunming , China , researchers analyzed the DNA of humans and several species of apes and monkeys .
Their previous work had shown that type II neuropsin , a longer form of the protein , is not expressed in the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) of lesser apes and Old World monkeys .
In the current study , they tested the expression of type II in the PFC of two great ape species , chimpanzees and orangutans , and found that it was not present .
Since these two species diverged most recently from human ancestors ( about 5 and 14 million years ago respectively ) , this finding demonstrates that type II is a human - specific form that originated relatively recently , less than 5 million years ago .
Gene sequencing revealed a mutation specific to humans that triggers a change in the splicing pattern of the neuropsin gene , creating a new splicing site and a longer protein .
Introducing this mutation into chimpanzee DNA resulted in the creation of type II neuropsin .
" Hence , the human - specific mutation is not only necessary but also sufficient in creating the novel splice form , " the authors state .
The results also showed a weakening effect of a different , type I - specific splicing site and a significant reduction in type I neuropsin expression in human and chimpanzee when compared with the rhesus macaque , an Old World monkey .
This pattern suggests that before the emergence of the type II splice form in human , the weakening of the type I splicing site already existed in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees , implying a multi-step process that led to the dramatic change of splicing pattern in humans , the authors note .
They identified a region of the chimpanzee sequence that has a weakening effect on the splicing site that also probably applies to humans .
" It is likely that both the creation of novel splice form and the weakening of the constitutive splicing contribute to the splicing pattern changes during primate evolution , suggesting a multi-step process eventually leading to the origin of the type II form in human , " the authors state .
They note that further studies should probe the biological function of type II neuropsin in humans , as the extra 45 amino acids in this form may cause protein structural and functional changes .
They note that in order to understand the genetic basis that underlies the traits that set humans apart from nonhuman primates , recent studies have focused on identifying genes that have been positively selected during human evolution .
They conclude , " The present results underscore the potential importance of the creation of novel splicing forms in the central nervous system in the emergence of human cognition . "

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Washington Mutual announced Thursday it will eliminate 1,600 jobs in the San Francisco area , a company spokesman said .
Employees will receive their 60 - day notice December 1 , according to Gary Kishner , a WaMu spokesman .
The layoffs at the company 's call centers will include 1,200 from the Pleasanton , California , office and 400 from San Francisco .
The work will be shifted to other facilities around the country .
After the layoffs , WaMu will still employ 11,000 people in California , Kishner said .
Washington Mutual collapsed September 29 , making it the biggest bank failure in the nation 's history .

WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US Attorney General Michael Mukasey has signed new guidelines for FBI operations he said are designed to better protect the country from terrorist attacks , but that raise concern of some lawmakers and civil rights groups .
" These guidelines provide more uniform , clearer and simpler rules for the FBI operations ... are designed to allow the FBI to become , among other things , a more flexible and adept collector of intelligence , " Mukasey and FBI director Robert Mueller said in a statement Friday .
" Since the 9/11 attacks , the FBI and the Department of Justice more broadly have set priorities for and reorganized their activities to prevent future terrorist acts against the American people , " the statement said .
The new , revised regulations -- the original version met strong criticism from congressional committees last month , comprise 50 pages dealing with five areas of FBI investigation , including criminal , national security and foreign intelligence .
Mukasey said most of the new , streamlined rules " will be available to the public ...
As a result , the general public will have access in a single document to the basic body of operating rules for the FBI 's activities . "
But despite Mukasey 's assurances that the new regulations " reflect consultation with Congress as well as privacy and civil liberties groups , " not all concerns over their effect on privacy rights were dispelled .
Senate Judiciary Committee chairman , Democrat Patrick Leahy said the new guidelines expand the FBI 's powers of surveillance .
" It appears that with these guidelines , the attorney general is once again giving the FBI broad new powers to conduct surveillance and use other intrusive investigative techniques on Americans without requiring any indication of wrongdoing or any approval even from FBI supervisors , " Leahy said in a statement .
" The American people deserve a vigilant Justice Department that does not sacrifice or endanger their rights and privacy , " he added .
The American Civil Liberties Union , who had called for an investigation into the first version of the FBI regulations , said the new rules " reduce standards for beginning ' assessments . ' "
" More troubling still , " it added , " the guidelines allow a person 's race or ethnic background to be used as a factor in opening an investigation , a move that the ACLU believes may institute a racial profiling as a matter of policy . "
A new and insidious environmental threat has been detected in North American lakes by researchers from Queen 's and York universities .
Along with scientists from several Canadian government laboratories , the team has documented biological damage caused by declining levels of calcium in many temperate , soft - water lakes .
Calling the phenomenon " aquatic osteoporosis , " Queen 's PhD candidate Adam Jeziorski , lead author of the study , notes that calcium is an essential nutrient for many lake - dwelling organisms .
" Once calcium declines below a certain threshold , some keystone species can no longer reproduce , " he says .
" These species and other organisms that feed on them are endangered . "
The study is published November 27 in the journal Science .
The researchers examined a water flea , Daphnia , known to be a key component of many aquatic foodwebs .
Having identified the calcium levels that would damage Daphnia in a laboratory setting , they worked with government scientists to assemble hundreds of " water quality time series " from across the province , explains Biology professor Norman Yan from York University , the Canadian research lead on the threat to aquatic life of calcium decline .
" Our hope was to determine if damage was already occurring at key sites , and then see how common these conditions were across the province , " he says .
However , calcium decline occurred in many lakes before people knew about the problem and monitoring programs had been put in place .
By studying tiny fossils and other indicators in sediment accumulated at the bottom of each lake , Queen 's paleoecologist professor John Smol , Canada Research Chair in Environmental Change , and his colleagues were able to reconstruct environmental trends over the past 200 years .
The researchers found that key invertebrate species were disappearing in the lakes with declining calcium levels , often starting in the 1970s .
Linking the problem to the long - term effects of acid rain on forest soils , as well as to logging and forest re-growth , the researchers note that , despite signs of chemical recovery from recent reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions , lower calcium levels may delay the biological recovery of lakes from acidification .
" This has important management implications , " says team member Dr. Andrew Paterson of the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and adjunct professor at Queen 's University .
" It was a combination of experimental work , paleoecological research and long - term monitoring that helped to identify this emerging threat , " he adds .
The authors conclude that the phenomenon of calcium decline is causing widespread transformation of aquatic food webs in boreal lakes in North America , and in other acid-sensitive regions of the globe .
While their work focuses on the water flea Daphnia , they note that all life in lakes requires calcium , and many creatures including crayfish , mollusks and fish have quite high calcium demands .
They are all at risk , say the researchers , but we do n't yet know if calcium levels have fallen to the point of damage .
" This is all very worrisome , " concludes Dr. Smol , recipient of the 2004 NSERC Herzberg Gold Medal as Canada 's top scientist and co-director of Queen 's Paleoecological Environmental Assessment and Research Laboratory ( PEARL ) .
" The good news is that we have found the ' miner 's canary ' in the form of these water fleas that track the decline in calcium levels .
The bad news is that many lakes have already passed these critical thresholds . "
The research was supported primarily by grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada , as well as funding from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment , Environment Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada .
Also on the team are : Anna DeSellas , Kyle McIver , Kristina Arseneau , Brian Ginn and Brian Cumming ( Queen's ) ; Michelle Palmer ( York ) ; Michael Turner ( Fisheries and Oceans Canada ) ; Dean Jeffries ( Environment Canada , National Water Research Institute ) ; Bill Keller ( Ontario Ministry of the Environment ) ; and Russ Weeber and Don McNicol ( Environment Canada ) .

Calculating the death toll from the crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Richard Brennan , the IRC 's health director .
IRC
Conflict once again rages in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
A figure often quoted is that 5.4 million people have died from the war there since 1998 , making it the deadliest crisis since the Second World War .
Nature News spoke to Richard Brennan , health director of the International Rescue Committee , a relief charity with its headquarters in New York .
Brennan is one of the researchers behind the survey that produced this number .
When we say 5.4 million , is that people who have died in fighting ?
The vast majority of deaths are not from violent injury .
The vast majority of deaths , over 90 % , are due to common infectious diseases , malnutrition ; the fact people do n't have access to health care , and so on .
How did you calculate that figure ?
It 's not possible to do a simple , random - sample survey in a country like the DRC .
What pollsters do is they get the telephone book and they pick people at random , essentially .
That gives them a pretty even distribution across the country .
It 's clearly not possible to do to that in a country like Congo .
What you have to do is randomly select health zones around the country , based on proportion of population size .
So a health zone with a population of 200,000 will have twice the chance of being selected as a health zone with a population of 100,000 .
We selected 35 health zones that way in our last survey .
Then we actually went to the health zone itself and asked for a breakdown of all the villages and their populations .
We selected 20 of those randomly , again proportionate to the size of population .
Next , we went out to the village with the assistance of local health - authority staff who speak the language .
We would select 20 households at random , then go and ask them a series of questions about the people living in the house : their age , their sex , the number of deaths , what people died from , and so on .
How did collecting the data actually work on the ground ?
Logistically , it 's a very difficult country to get around .
It 's the size of Western Europe with only about 2,000 kilometres of paved roads .
Often , that would mean we'd have to charter an aeroplane or ride motorbikes — maybe we'd have to paddle a canoe , rent a boat , hike up mountains .
It could take two days to get to a village .
How reliable is your figure of 5.4 million deaths ?
In our most recent survey , there were only about 160,000 people we did n't get access to .
The vast majority of the country was open to surveying .
We 're pretty confident we 've got a representative sample of the population .
“ Everyone focuses on the figure of 5.4 million .
What 's more important is the rate at which people are dying . ”
Richard Brennan
International Rescue Committee
I could go on for some time talking about the limitations and caveats of the data , but it 's like any survey : you take a sample , you make some assumptions and extrapolations and you make your best estimates based on that .
Everyone focuses on the figure of 5.4 million .
What 's more important is the rate at which people are dying , and our surveys estimate this .
We then extrapolate this to determine how many people died in excess of what you would have expected over that period of time .
That requires a little more art than just pure science , but we always feel the assumptions and extrapolations that we make have been conservative in nature .
That 's why we have stood by the figures we 've come up with .
So how high above expectations was the rate of deaths in the DRC ?
There 's a little controversy about that , because we do n't have absolute baseline data for the period before the survey .
A census done in 1984 indicated that the mortality rate across the country at that time was 1.3 deaths per 1,000 per month .
The average for sub -Saharan Africa is 1.4 to 1.5 deaths per 1,000 per month .
Across the DRC this time , we found a death rate of 2.2 deaths per 1,000 per month .
That 's clearly significantly higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa or that reported for the country as a whole in 1984 .
Other mortality figures in areas of conflict , especially those that have come out of Iraq , have been hugely controversial .
Does politics start to enter into those discussions ?
There 's no question that politics comes into it .
People can disagree about the assumptions and extrapolations that you make as well .
Some people question our assumptions , although most people accept what we have done .
I 've got colleagues who say we should have used a baseline of 2.0 [ deaths per 1,000 per month ] , but based on what ?
Are any of your team still in the DRC ?
Yes .
We 've got a large health programme there .
We 've been working in Rutshuru district , which is one of the worst affected areas .
We 've had to evacuate our team because several of our staff were roughed up out there .
As soon as the security situation allows , we will be expanding our programmes .
Right now , we 're providing water and sanitation services and some basic medical care .
How might the death toll change as a result of the current situation ?
I think there 's every reason to expect that in the area that 's been impacted by the conflict , in north Kivu , the mortality rates will go up .
Again , most of them wo n't be a result of violent injury .
Most of them will be caused by the indirect consequences of conflict — increased rates of infectious disease , malnutrition .

A key protein can cause damage to the brain leading to Alzheimer 's A vitamin found in meat , fish and potatoes may help protect the brain from Alzheimer 's disease - and even boost memory in healthy people .
US researchers found vitamin B3 lowered levels of a protein linked to Alzheimer 's damage in mice .
The Journal of Neuroscience study also showed the animals performed better at memory tests .
UK Alzheimer 's charities said people should not start taking the vitamin before results from human studies .
This suggests that not only is it good for Alzheimer 's disease , but if normal people take it , some aspects of their memory might improve
Professor Frank LaFerla
University of California , Irvine
The vitamin , also called nicotinamide by scientists , is sold in UK pharmacies and health food shops .
It has already been shown to help people suffering from diabetes complications and has some anti-inflammatory qualities .
The researchers , from the University of California at Irvine , added the vitamin to drinking water given to mice bred to develop a version of Alzheimer 's disease , then tested the levels of certain chemicals associated with the condition .
They found that levels of one , called phosphorylated tau , were significantly lower in the animals .
This protein is involved in abnormal ' deposits ' in brain cells , called ' tangles ' , which contribute to the brain damage which progressively affects people with Alzheimer's .
Using ' water mazes ' , the team also found some evidence that memory was enhanced in both ' Alzheimer 's ' mice and unaffected mice .
Normal memory Dr Kim Green , who led the study , said that human tests were progressing : " Nicotinamide has a very robust effect on neurons .
It prevents loss of cognition in mice with Alzheimer 's disease , and the beauty of it is we already are moving forward with a clinical trial . "
His colleague Professor Frank LaFerla , said : " This suggests that not only is it good for Alzheimer 's disease , but if normal people take it , some aspects of their memory might improve . "
Susanne Sorensen , the head of research at the Alzheimer 's Society , said the research was " interesting " and pointed to new ways to treat the condition .
" From the research , it appears that Nicotinamide has more than one beneficial effect on nerve cells including the facilitation of the recycling of the ' bad ' phosphorylated tau .
" Nicotinamide occurs naturally in meat , fish , beans , cereals and potatoes and is cheap and easy to take .
" However , more research is now needed to explore the possible mechanisms involved so we can better understand if Nicotinamide could have the same effect in people and , if it does , what level of vitamin intake would be required . "
Rebecca Wood , Chief Executive of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said until the human research was completed , people should not start taking the supplement .
" These are exciting findings , but until the results from the human clinical trial are announced , people should be wary about changing their diet or taking supplements .
In high doses vitamin B3 can be toxic . "

Obama speaks with Indian PM , ' closely following ' Mumbai situation Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday November 29 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  US president - elect Barack Obama has conveyed his condolences to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the wave of attacks on Mumbai and is closely following the situation , an aide said on Saturday .
Obama spoke by telephone to Singh at about 10:30 eastern standard time ( 0330 GMT ) late Friday " to express condolences for those killed in the terrorists attacks in Mumbai and to let him know that his thoughts and prayers are with the people of India and all who were affected by the attack , " the aide in Obama 's transition office said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Repeating a phrase he has used often since his electoral victory on November 4 , Obama told the prime minister that there is one US president at a time " but that he would be monitoring the situation closely . "
Obama , who has been receiving regular updates on the Mumbai assault from officials in President George W. Bush 's administration , will take over the presidency on January 20 .
Commandos Saturday killed the last remaining gunmen in Mumbai's Taj hotel to end the devastating attack by Islamic militants on India 's financial capital that left 195 dead , including 26 foreigners .
Shortly after dawn on the third day of the siege , heavy gunfire and loud explosions signalled the final commando offensive against the militants , who had held hundreds of security personnel at bay for 60 hours .
Ron Paul Answers Your Questions , Part Two
When we solicited your questions for Congressman Ron Paul shortly after the election , so many questions came in that we split Paul ’s answers into two batches , the first of which was published last week .
Here is the second .
Like the first batch , they are well - considered and interesting throughout ; they will surely make many readers continue to wish fervently for a Paul presidency .
Thanks again to Rep .
Paul for his time and insights , and to all of you for the good questions .
Q : What is the first thing the country should do about its monetary policy ?
A : We should immediately audit the Federal Reserve .
I am the ranking member of the Monetary Policy subcommittee in the U.S. Congress , yet I can get more information about the internal workings of the C.I.A. than I can about our central bank .
This secrecy is fundamentally wrong , and I believe that people from all over the ideological political spectrum can agree on that .
Bloomberg
News this month has gone to court compel the Fed to disclose securities the central bank is accepting on behalf of American taxpayers as collateral for trillions of dollars of loans to banks .
Expanding transparency is critical and could be done very quickly .
Q : What are your expectations for the next four years under an Obama administration ?
How might President Obama ’s interventionist economic policies impact our lives ?
A : Unfortunately , I do n’t expect many good things .
I do expect a lot of spending and even more debt .
To really cut spending and balance our budget , we need to change foreign policy .
Obama ’s rhetoric on foreign policy is better than what we have gotten recently , but do n’t expect any real change .
He may be more likely to wind things down in Iraq , but he ’s still planning on keeping troops there for a least 16 more months .
He wants money for Georgia and more troops in Afghanistan .
He is n’t going to bring home our 30,000 troops from Korea or our 50,000 soldiers in Germany , and he wo n’t close any of our 700 foreign bases .
At the same time , he is planning even bigger spending here at home .
I hope I ’m wrong , but if this spending and debt continue , the dollar is going to crash and we will see the middle class in this country take a grave hit .
Q : Do you deny global warming ?
Is Obama right to invest money in green technology ?
If you do n’t deny it , and do n’t think Obama is right , what is your solution ?
A : I try to look at global warming the same way I look at all other serious issues : as objectively and open - minded as possible .
There is clear evidence that the temperatures in some parts of the globe are rising , but temperatures are cooling in other parts .
The average surface temperature had risen for several decades , but it fell back substantially in the past few years .
Clearly there is something afoot .
The question is :
Is the upward fluctuation in temperature man-made or part of a natural phenomenon .
Geological records indicate that in the 12th century , Earth experienced a warming period during which Greenland was literally green and served as rich farmland for Nordic peoples .
There was then a mini ice age , the polar ice caps grew , and the once - thriving population of Greenland was virtually wiped out .
It is clear that the earth experiences natural cycles in temperature .
However , science shows that human activity probably does play a role in stimulating the current fluctuations .
The question is : how much ?
Rather than taking a “ sky is falling ” approach , I think there are common - sense steps we can take to cut emissions and preserve our environment .
I am , after all , a conservative and seek to conserve not just American traditions and our Constitution , but our natural resources as well .
We should start by ending subsidies for oil companies .
And we should never , ever go to war to protect our perceived oil interests .
If oil were allowed to rise to its natural price , there would be tremendous market incentives to find alternate sources of energy .
At the same time , I ca n’t support government “ investment ” in alternative sources either , for this is not investment at all .
Government cannot invest , it can only redistribute resources .
Just look at the mess government created with ethanol .
Congress decided that we needed more biofuels , and the best choice was ethanol from corn .
So we subsidized corn farmers at the expense of others , and investment in other types of renewables was crowded out .
Now it turns out that corn ethanol is inefficient , and it actually takes more energy to produce the fuel than you get when you burn it .
The most efficient ethanol may come from hemp , but hemp production is illegal and there has been little progress on hemp ethanol .
And on top of that , corn is now going into our gas tanks instead of onto our tables or feeding our livestock or dairy cows ; so food prices have been driven up .
This is what happens when we allow government to make choices instead of the market ; I hope we avoid those mistakes moving forward .
Q : Will you run for a leadership position in the House Republican caucus ?
A : I have no plans to do so .
I do n’t cut deals and trade votes , which is exactly what a role like that requires .
Q : What are your thoughts on abolishing America ’s income tax and switching over to a consumption tax such as the fair tax ?
A : I want to abolish the income tax , but I do n’t want to replace it with anything .
About 45 percent of all federal revenue comes from the personal income tax .
That means that about 55 percent — over half of all revenue — comes from other sources , like excise taxes , fees , and corporate taxes .
We could eliminate the income tax , replace it with nothing , and still fund the same level of big government we had in the late 1990’s .
We do n’t need to “ replace ” the income tax at all .
I see a consumption tax as being a little better than the personal income tax , and I would vote for the Fair - Tax if it came up in the House of Representatives , but it is not my goal .
We can do better .
Q : Did former Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan really believe in free markets or did he fail to practice what he preached ?
A : In my book The Revolution : A Manifesto I talk about an encounter I had with Greenspan when he was still Fed chairman .
I had come across an old Objectivist newsletter Greenspan had written in the 1960 ’s supporting a real gold standard .
It was great stuff !
At a gathering we both attended , I presented the booklet and asked if he still believed in its subject .
He said he remembered the piece and still believed every word .
I ca n’t profess to know what is in Mr. Greenspan ’s heart , but his own words lead me to believe that he knew better than to pursue the policies he did .
Q : What policies should have been put into place in 1932 to stimulate the economy instead of the confiscation of monetary gold ?
A : A trust in free markets and sound money would have made the 1930 ’s much less rough .
Inflation caused the Depression , and the big government policies of Roosevelt exacerbated the problem .
Murray Rothbard wrote a masterpiece on the cause of the 1929 crash and the Great Depression , and I highly recommend it to anyone with a deep interest who wants to read the authoritative view .
Q : Is there any part of the Republican Party reaching out to you ?
At what point do we dump the G.O.P. and leave it for dead ?
A : The leadership in the House of Representatives and at the N.R.C.C. has been cordial , and I as a ranking subcommittee member am myself in leadership .
Other national leadership bodies largely ignore me .
Where I get the most attention , though , is from rank - and - file members .
Dozens of Republican congressmen from across the country asked me for money and support in November ’s election .
I was happy to support and contribute to several deserving individuals through my Liberty PAC .
As far as quitting or staying with the Republicans , everyone will have to make up his or her own mind .
There can be value in choosing either path .
I myself have no plans to leave the G.O.P .
Q : Why is it that , even in the midst of unimaginable deficits and an economic crisis , both our enormous military and our policy of drug prohibition remain sacrosanct ?
Do you think this reflects actual democratic opinion , or is it the work of powerful , but numerically small interest groups ?
A : I think that it might reflect democratic opinion , but only because each issue has been demagogued .
Take military spending .
I believe in a strong national defense .
I want our troops here , defending our territory ; I want nuclear submarines and an adequate arsenal of weapons that can repel any conceivable attack .
What I do n’t want to do is spend a trillion dollars a year maintaining an empire .
Today , our troops are in 130 countries .
We have 700 foreign bases .
We can spend far less and have a stronger national defense than we do right now .
But if you question our foreign policy , you are branded as un-American .
And we ’re told that if we do n’t “ fight them over there , we ’ll fight them over here . ”
That ’s absurd .
On your second example , the federal war on drugs has proven costly and ineffective , while creating terrible violent crime .
But if you question policy , you are accused of being pro-drug .
That is preposterous .
As a physician , father , and grandfather , I abhor drugs .
I just know that there is a better way — through local laws , communities , churches , and families — to combat the very serious problem of drug abuse than a massive federal - government bureaucracy .
There are certainly some powerful special interests that benefit from our flawed foreign and drug policies .
Now , do I think they openly conspire together to deceive and manipulate ?
No I do n’t .
The system is much too complicated to think a few puppet masters control the strings .
But I do think we’d be a lot better off if we listened to our founding fathers and obeyed the Constitution .
The founders would never have formed a D.E.A. , and they would be horrified if they saw our troops spread thin around the globe .
Q : What do you think were your biggest mistakes in the primary race , and what would you now do differently ?
A : I was always pessimistic and never thought we would get to where we did .
My regret is that we could n’t see how quickly things would grow and were not adequately prepared for the explosion in money and support when they came .
There are dozens , hundreds of things we could have done better , but we all worked hard and did our best .
And I know we built something that will only get stronger in the years to come .
" I 've been a fisherman for fifteen years now , ever since I was fifteen years old .
My father was a fisherman and so was my grandfather .
I have spent half my life at sea .
But every day we face problems from the Israeli gunboats : they follow us , and then they start shooting at us because they want to force us to stop working . "
Saber Al - Hissie comes from a Gazan family of fishermen .
His 20 metre vessel belongs to his father , who , after many years of fishing , has finally passed the family business over to Saber .
There are more than 3,500 professional fishermen in the Gaza Strip , and the majority of them live in and around Gaza City , where the main harbour is located .
The Al - Hissie family , like most of the other Gaza city fishermen , live in the sprawling refugee camp , known locally as the Beach Camp , near Gaza harbour .
Gaza harbour awakens before dawn .
The fishermen land the night catch , the fishmongers gather to buy the fish , and those fishermen who have spent the night in the luxury of their own beds at home arrive to start preparing for the early morning fishing .
Nets are mended , fuel and water supplies replenished , and the boats are back out at sea before 7 am .
Saber Al - Hissie has a crewe of seven men and boys with him today , including thirteen year old Mahmoud , and eighteen year old Ali , who both regularly work as fishermen .
Mahmoud is still at school , but Ali says he never went to school .
" I always wanted to be a fisherman " he says , grinning .
As we sail out of the harbour and head west , Saber Al - Hissie describes the restrictions that Israel is imposing on him and every other fisherman trying to earn a living in the Gaza Strip .
" If we sail six miles out to sea , then maybe we will be safe " he says .
" But if we go any further out to sea , the Israelis always harass us .
They circle the boats , they shoot towards us , and recently they started using water cannons to attack us . "
He explains that some fishermen still take the risk of sail further out than the six mile limit , where they can trawl for the richer stocks of fish in deeper waters .
" But I do n't want my boat damaged so I stay within the [ Israeli ] limit " he adds .
His boat is already scarred with bullet holes inflicted by the IOF .
The fishermen often sail out of Gaza harbour in fleets .
Some vessels stay fairly close together at the edge of the six mile limit for mutual protection , though a minority of fishermen sail on further , in defiance of the Israeli Occupation Forces ( IOF ) .
But regardless of how far they sail , all the fishermen risk being shot , water cannoned , arrested and detained , and also having their vessels damaged , destroyed or confiscated .
More than seventy Gaza fishermen were arrested by the IOF last year .
Commercial fishing is an inherently risky profession , and has become increasingly more dangerous in Gaza because of the relentless IOF harassment and intimidation .
Even before we reach six miles from the Gaza coast , we can see three Israeli gunboats speeding towards us .
We are amongst a fleet of around ten Gazan fishing vessels that gradually disperse between six to eight miles from the coastline and drop their nets .
The crew on board Saber 's boat become visibly tense as the Israeli gunboats begin circling individual vessels at high speed , causing huge waves that pitch the vessels .
Soon we can clearly see fishing vessels being water cannoned by one of the Israeli gunboats .
" The Israelis attack us every day " says one of the crew , Abu Mahmoud .
" Until you see it for yourself , you cannot believe the situation we are facing . "
Gazan fishermen say the Israelis are using dirty , possibly contaminated water in the highspeed water cannons , in order to force them back towards shore , despite the fact the fishermen have the absolute right to fish off their own coast .
The Interim Arrangements signed between the PLO and Israel in 1994 / 5 , stipulate that Gazan fishermen have the legal right to fish up to 20 nautical miles from the Gaza coastline .
However , Israel has never honoured the Interim Agreements , and has consistently harassed and intimidated fishermen across the Gaza Strip , decimating the local fishing industry .
Ten years ago , Gazan fishermen were hauling approximately 3,000 tons of fresh fish a year .
But productivity has plummeted since the Second Intifada due to escalating IOF attacks , and now the fishermen are hauling less than 500 tons of fresh fish per year , and being forced to over - fish the shallow waters in close proximity to Gaza .
The fishermen say the presence of a small group of international human rights observers from the Free Gaza Movement has improved the situation for those boats which are accompanied by the internationals - but these fishermen want their right to work without facing daily harassment and violence from the IOF .
This manufactured crisis in the Gaza fishing industry is yet another part of the overall IOF siege and closure of Gaza , including its mass violations of the social and economic rights of the entire civilian population of the Gaza Strip .
One of the Israeli gunboats speeds towards us , and uses a megaphone to order us back ..
We are now at the edge of the six mile limit , and Saber refuses to be cowed .
His crew calmly continues working , as the gunboat circles us at high speed and the boat pitches wildly .
When the IOF start to shoot into the waters around us with a sub- machine gun , Saber turns his vessel back towards Gaza .
" We just want to fish and support our families " he says .
" We are not committing any crimes .
But they are . "

Torture - related satire and other forms of torture humor are , I think , a clear way of coming to grips with the horror of what our government have become .
It 's a difficult subject to contemplate , and express a view on , without resorting to humor on some level .
But that of course is n't what 's happening here .
Instead we see conservatives deciding to embrace torture as constitutive of conservative identity .
If you 're a conservative , you like torture .
If you 're against torture , you 're not a conservative .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Jeb Bush in 2012 ( Vanity )
Posted on by MinorityRepublican
Yes , we lost tonight .
But let 's regroup for 2012 and come back stronger than ever .
That 's why I support Jeb Bush , he was a popular governor of Florida and he 'll win the battleground state easily .
Also , in four years from now with President - elect Obama 's disastrous policies , people would welcome another Bush in the White House for a return of stability .

I ’m sorry , but George W. got a few things right , and a whole lot of things wrong .
At the end of his two terms , we now have a Rat Congress and the most liberal member of the Senate as President .
His legacy is worse than his father ’s .

Oh , please .
In the first place , we have n’t lost yet .

When Barack Obama first announced he was going to run for president I was very skeptical – both about whether he was seasoned enough or whether this was his moment .
It took me six months of reading , researching , and reflecting to finally come to decide that Obama was my choice .
I doubt anyone reading this blog over the past year would consider me to be a skeptic of Obama .
But I did start out as one – and despite my strong support for Obama , I still remain one .
Electing anyone as president is a risk – and those of us who are skeptical , who are less than completely taken with a candidate , who can sees the flaws along with the great opportunity – can be tempted to throw up our hands in despair and suggest – as many do – that each election is merely a choice between the lesser of two evils .
But by giving up our place in politics , we cede power to those whose secular or religious convictions are certain – allowing them to drag us from one extreme to another .
There are serious issues we need to deal with as a nation in the next four years , issues which have been festering for far too long untended – global warming , terrorism , islamist extremism , the challenges of globalization , the fiscal instability , our deteriorating infrastructure , growing executive power .
We need a president who can focus the country on these tasks and finally set us on the right path again .
Here are the reasons why I believe Barack Obama is the leader we need to set us on that path :
As I wrote before : Obama is a liberal pragmatist , with a conservative temperament , who seeks to understand the world as it is , to identify our long - term challenges , and to push ( to nudge it ) in a positive direction by tinkering with processes and institutions and creating tools to get people more involved in the government .
These are my reasons , as an initial skeptic , that I support Obama .
These are not reasons to be complacent if he does , in fact , win .
But they are reasons to be satisfied – if only for one night – that our country is moving in the right direction again .

NASA astronaut Don Pettit loves his coffee .
So it comes as no surprise that he found a way to drink coffee from a cup , instead of the traditional straw , on his day off Sunday aboard the International Space Station .
Drinking any liquid in the weightless environment of space could be a messy affair .
With hot coffee , it could be a potentially scalding affair .
So astronauts use silver pouches and plastic straws to sip anything from water to orange juice to Pettit ?s beloved space java .
" We can suck our coffee from a bag , but to drink it from a cup is hard to do because you can ? t get the cup up to get the liquid out , and it ? s also easy to slosh , " Pettit told Mission Control while sending a video of his new invention to Earth .
Pettit arrived at the space station last week aboard the shuttle Endeavour , which is delivering a recycling system that converts urine into drinking water and other new gear to outfit the space station for large , six - person crew .
He used a piece of plastic ripped from his Flight Data File mission book and folded it into a teardrop - shape that ? s closed at one end .
Surface tension inside the cup keeps the coffee from floating out and running amuck .
" The way this works is , the cross section of this cup looks like an airplane wing , " he said .
" The narrow angle here will wick the coffee up . "
The result : space coffee in a zero - G cup .
Endeavour shuttle astronaut Don Pettit sips coffee from a zero-g cup of his own invention during the STS - 126 mission to the International Space Station .

" This may very well be what future space colonists end up using when they want to have a celebration and do a toast , " Pettit said .
Pettit is no stranger to space invention .
During his first spaceflight as the space station ? s
Expedition 6 science officer in 2002/2003 , he was renown for his Saturday Morning Science efforts and tinkering with broken hardware .
He told SPACE.com before launching aboard Endeavour that he hoped to hunt down his favorite tools , stowed away in a so - called Strange Tool Bag , when he returned to the space station .
It was during his Expedition 6 mission that Pettit packed along enough instant coffee to tide him over during his long - duration mission in space .
Drinking coffee through a bag pales in comparison to the comfort of a real cup , he said .
" You can enjoy a cup of coffee in a weightless environment without having to sip it from a bag , " Pettit said .
" You can just keep sipping and sipping clear down to the last drop in the cup . "

From an ’04 book chapter by Cathy Salmon on porn vs. romance novels :
There is such a thing as a pornography consumed exclusively by women .. it is the romance novel .
Romance novels account for 40 % of mass market paperback sales in the United States ….
The realm of the romance novel , which might be called " romantopia , " is a utopian erotic female counterfantasy to pornotopia .
Just as porn actresses exhibit a suspiciously male - like sexuality , romances are exercises in the imaginative transformation of masculinity to conform with female standards . …
The public debate over pornography has been going on for years …. [ and ] had has covered everything from the treatment of women within the industry , to the image of women it presents and the impact of that image on men in the general population as well as the effects on women in the general population .
… [ Studies show ] men who viewed sexually explicit films did not have negative attitudes toward women ’s rights , nor were they more accepting of marital or date rape .
… [ Regarding ] the incidence of rape in several societies … increased availability was not associated with increased reports of rape . …
On a personal level , women often express concern over a partner ’s regular purchasing of Playboy or watching pornographic videos .
In particular there is a verbalized concern that these things will effect their relationships . …
[ And in fact ] males that viewed images of attractive models reported being less committee to their partner after the viewing .
…
Playboy centerfolds … got the same results .
… Modern media .. perhaps giving men an unrealistic view of how many attractive available women are out there .
The vehicles have also been fitted with voice reminders telling drivers " this is a diesel vehicle " when the fuel cap is opened , while they have begun fitting devices which fit into the filler neck making it almost impossible to get a petrol nozzle into a diesel tank .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Both presidential candidates want to turn employer - sponsored health insurance on its head .
A principal goal : to make sure more Americans get coverage .
But in helping the 45 million uninsured , both Republican nominee John McCain and his Democratic rival Barack Obama could prompt radical changes in on - the - job insurance , which currently covers 164 million people .
" Both McCain 's and Obama 's plans would move coverage in ways that changes the nature of the employer - sponsored system , " said James Klein , head of the American Benefits Council , which represents larger employers .
McCain and Obama take very different paths to what they say is the same endpoint - reforming health care .
As part of McCain 's plan , employees would lose the tax exemption for company - sponsored health insurance .
Instead , taxpayers would get a refundable tax credit of $ 2,500 for single filers , or $ 5,000 for families , to cover the costs of insurance bought on the job or on their own in the individual market .
By doing this , McCain would level the playing field between those who get insurance on the job , where benefits are n't taxed , and those who buy it their own , where it is subject to tax .
The tax credit would let more of the uninsured afford coverage .
Obama , on the other hand , is promising to push employers to cover more Americans as part of his health care proposal .
He would require larger companies provide insurance to employees or contribute toward the cost of a national plan , while giving small businesses a tax credit to entice them to offer coverage to their workers .
The plans of both candidates raise the concerns of employers and experts , who say the proposals could wind up undermining the nation 's employer - based health insurance system .
Most workers still depend on their employers for health benefits , but the system is already under stress .
Only 62.9 % of Americans under age 65 had employer - based coverage in 2007 , down from 68.3 % in 2000 , according to the Economic Policy Institute .
This means more than three million fewer people had on - the - job coverage in 2007 than seven years earlier .
McCain 's tax proposal
Under McCain 's plan , employees would get taxed on the value of their health insurance , which on average costs $ 12,680 per year for a family , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Workers pay an average of $ 3,354 in premiums , while their employers cover the rest .
Most employees have their premiums deducted from their paychecks without paying tax on them .
So , if you make $ 50,000 , you are likely paying tax on only $ 46,646 of income .
Under McCain , your taxable income would rise to $ 59,326 .
If you were in the 25 % tax bracket , it would mean an additional $ 3,170 in taxes .
But this increase would be knocked back by the $ 5,000 tax credit .
So in the end , you 'd actually have $ 1,830 to put in a health savings account , which could be used to cover premiums and other medical expenses .
Experts , however , fear that eliminating the tax advantage of employer - based coverage would prompt younger , healthier workers to leave their office plans .
If that happened , costs for the remaining workers could skyrocket .
Companies may drop coverage altogether .
" If companies know their employees have the tax credit , it relieves them of the burden of providing coverage , " said Sara Collins , who directs a health insurance program at the Commonwealth Fund .
McCain 's plan " moves people out of the employer system and to the individual market . "
Some 74 % of companies said that eliminating the tax exclusion would have a " strong negative impact on their workforce , " according to a September survey by the American Benefits Council .
Estimates vary , but the Tax Policy Center estimates that 20 million people would lose their employer - based coverage by 2018 .
Roughly the same number would gain insurance through other means .
But , overall , McCain 's plan would do little to reduce the number of uninsured .
Also of concern , experts say , is the fact that the $ 5,000 tax credit would be indexed to inflation .
As a result , it would not keep up with the swiftly rising cost of health care , which was soaring as much as 13 % a year in the middle of this decade .
McCain advisers counter these concerns .
Changing the tax treatment would n't hurt the employer - sponsored system and would allow more of the uninsured to buy their own coverage , they say .
Also , his advisers say a McCain administration would keep an eye on the credit to make sure it did n't lag behind the cost of coverage , while also working to lower the rate of medical inflation .
Younger , healthier workers likely would n't abandon their company - sponsored plans , said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's senior economic policy adviser .
" Why would they leave ? " said Holtz - Eakin .
" What they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit . "
Obama 's employer coverage expansion
Obama 's approach is very different .
The Democrat would require larger companies to provide " meaningful coverage " for their staffs under a " pay or play " system .
If they do n't provide insurance , they would have to subsidize the cost of a national plan .
Small businesses , which would be exempt from this provision , would receive a new refundable tax credit of up to 50 % of the premiums paid on behalf of their employees .
They could also join a new National Health Insurance Exchange , which Obama envisions would provide public and private plans to individuals and small employers .
This could entice smaller employers to provide coverage , said Jennifer Tolbert , principal policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Currently , only 49 % of small businesses provide health care coverage , down from 57 % in 2000 , according to the Commonwealth Fund .
Workers who already have health insurance at their jobs wo n't see much of a change , though Obama says he could lower their annual medical costs by as much as $ 2,500 a year by improving technology , increasing competition and stressing prevention and better management of chronic diseases .
Obama 's policy advisers say they want to expand the employer - based system since they believe it works well .
" We need to build on success , not tear them down and try to build new plans , " said David Cutler , senior health care adviser to Obama .
The Tax Policy Center estimates that an additional five million people would gain coverage by requiring employers to extend coverage , but it finds Obama 's plan lacking details on nearly everything else .
" The numbers are n't supported by anything , " said Robertson Williams , principal research associate at the Tax Policy Center .
Among the big questions many have is how Obama decides which small businesses would be eligible for the credit and how larger employers would have to pay into the national system .
Also unclear is exactly how he'd save workers as much as $ 2,500 a year .
Businesses fear the mandates under Obama 's plan would tax their resources at a time when many are struggling because of the economic downturn .
Some 46 % of companies said requiring employers to " pay or play " would have a " strong negative effect on their workforce , " according to the American Benefits Council .
Companies are also wondering how Obama will define " meaningful coverage " and whether their plans are acceptable , experts said .
" It could limit employers ' flexibility in the type of plan they provide because it may not meet the standards , " said the council 's Klein .
An NHS doctor accused of the Glasgow airport attack today admitted planning to set cars on fire to give Britain a " taste of fear " .
Bilal Abdulla , 29 , an Iraqi , said he had wanted the incendiary devices to throw the spotlight back on the devastating effect of war on his homeland .
He branded the British government " democratically elected murderers " and said he wanted Muslims to escape oppression and leave Britain .
But Abdulla told Woolwich crown court in London that he knew the " horror and terror " of the July 7 attacks and had not wanted to injure or kill anyone .
Going into the witness box for the second day , Abdulla said he wanted to " bring the Iraq issue to life " .
" I wanted the public to taste what is going on , for them to have a taste of what the decisions of their democratically elected murderers did to my people .
" I wanted to challenge the government 's proposal that war brings peace , will bring peace to this country , that pre-emptive strikes will bring peace to this country .
" War brings only war and hatred .
If you want peace , bring peace .
If you want love , give love .
" We intended to bring a device that would give just a taste , the taste of fear .
It would look professional , it was dangerous , but in reality it was not .
" In reality it was not a dangerous device .
It was a device that would not kill people . "
Abdulla admitted researching and preparing the devices in Houston , near Glasgow , with his friend Kafeel Ahmed , 28 , an Indian engineering student .
He said they decided to act as he prepared to leave Britain and return to Jordan after his family fled there from the fighting in Iraq .
" I had a major sense of guilt , living in safety while all my people are massacred , " he said .
Abdulla said Ahmed , who died after the pair drove a burning Jeep into the main terminal building of Glasgow airport , was in London on July 7 2005 .
" I felt the horror and terror of 7/7 as you people felt it .
I felt exactly the same as you , " Abdulla said .
" One of my friends was in London .
The opinion of all of us was that the killing of innocent people is an atrocity by all the word means .
" It is not accepted by any religion or any law and that was the opinion of all of us . "
Abdulla is accused of attempting to murder hundreds of people by leaving car bombs detonated by mobile phones outside a West End nightclub in June 2007 .
When the gas canister and petrol devices did not go off , he joined a suicide attack on Glasgow airport the next day , the prosecution has said .
Abdulla said he was responsible for gathering cash and finding a base while Ahmed designed the devices .
The junior doctor said he " did not have a clue " about how the devices would be made and saw Ahmed as an expert .
He admitted translating an Arabic internet document , The Military Use of Electronics , for his friend .
Abdulla said : " The plan was simple .
Kafeel would use cars that would have petrol canisters at the back of the car , the boot .
" We would use mobile phones to ignite the petrol and the cars would burn .
" The second part of the plan was we would call the cars from far away , on our way home .
He would be in one of the airports and [ I would be just about ] to get on a plane , and we would call the cars and let them burn .
" Kafeel said he would give it touches that would show there was an element of professionalism in this job .
" The media would take up these devices , [ making them into ] a big thing . "
Abdulla is on trial with a second man , Mohammed Asha , 28 , who is accused of conspiracy to murder cause explosions .
They have pleaded not guilty .
Chris Dannen sees the power of the Reddit generation :
The question of the next decade is :
How can we find what we want -- the perfect job , just the right pair of shoes , exactly the news that 's important to us -- amidst the maelstrom of information that 's available on the Web ?
Google , of course , is the de facto answer , it 's algorithms generating a ballpark guess at what we want when we type in a few search terms .
But the burgeoning mass of data on the Internet is threatening to outmode such robotic tools .
So a growing number of start - ups is putting forward another strategy for filtering the Web : Use human judgment first , computer power second .
GOP lawmaker defends use of ' uppity ' to describe Obama Associated Press
Published : Friday September 5 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON -- A Republican congressman from Georgia who referred to Barack and Michelle Obama as " uppity " says he was n't aware of the term 's racial overtones and did not intend to insult anyone .
Speaking to reporters Thursday , Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Grantville , Ga. , described the Obamas as members of an " elitist - class ... that thinks that they 're uppity , " according to The Hill , a Capitol Hill newspaper .
Asked if he intended to use the word , he said , " Yeah , uppity . "
In a statement Friday , Westmoreland - who was born in 1950 and raised in the segregated South - said he did n't know that " uppity " was commonly used as a derogatory term for blacks seeking equal treatment .
Instead , he referred to the dictionary definition of the word as describing someone who is haughty , snobbish or has inflated self - esteem .
" He stands by that characterization and thinks it accurately describes the Democratic nominee , " said Brian Robinson , Westmoreland 's spokesman .
" He was unaware that the word had racial overtones , and he had absolutely no intention of using a word that can be considered offensive . "
The Obama campaign had no immediate response .
Westmoreland is one of the most conservative members of Congress .
He has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates on a number of issues , including last year when he led opposition to renewing the 1965 Voting Rights Act .
He also was one of two House members last year who opposed giving the Justice Department more money to crack unsolved civil rights killings .
Last month I blogged about how Microsoft is extending support for jQuery .
Over the last few weeks we 've been working with the jQuery team to add great jQuery intellisense support within Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Web Developer 2008 Express ( which is free ) .
This is now available to download and use .
Steps to Enable jQuery Intellisense in VS 2008
To enable intellisense completion for jQuery within VS you 'll want to follow three steps :
Step 1 : Install VS 2008 SP1
VS 2008 SP1 adds richer JavaScript intellisense support to Visual Studio , and adds code completion support for a broad range of JavaScript libraries .
You can download VS 2008 SP1 and Visual Web Developer 2008 Express SP1 here .
Step 2 : Install VS 2008 Patch KB958502 to Support " - vsdoc.js " Intellisense Files
Two weeks ago we shipped a patch that you can apply to VS 2008 SP1 and VWD 2008 Express SP1 that causes Visual Studio to check for the presence of an optional " - vsdoc.js " file when a JavaScript library is referenced , and if present to use this to drive the JavaScript intellisense engine .
These annotated " - vsdoc.js " files can include XML comments that provide help documentation for JavaScript methods , as well as additional code intellisense hints for dynamic JavaScript signatures that cannot automatically be inferred .
You can learn more about this patch here .
You can download it for free here .
Step 3 : Download the jQuery - vsdoc.js file
We 've worked with the jQuery team to put together a jQuery - vsdoc.js file that provides help comments and support for JavaScript intellisense on chained jQuery selector methods .
You can download both jQuery and the jQuery - vsdoc file from the official download page on the jQuery.com site :
Save the jquery - vsdoc.js file next to your jquery .js file in your project ( and make sure its naming prefix matches the jquery file name ) :
You can then reference the standard jquery file with an html < script /> element like so :
Or alternatively reference it using the < asp : scriptmanager / > control , or by adding a /// < reference / > comment at the top of a standalone .js file .
When you do this VS will now look for a - vsdoc.js file in the same directory as the script file you are referencing , and if found will use it for help and intellisense .
The annotated
For example , we could use jQuery to make a JSON based get request , and get intellisense for the method ( hanging off of $ . ) :
As well as help / intellisense for the $.getJSON ( ) method 's parameters :
The intellisense will continue to work if you nest a callback function within the method call .
For example , we might want to iterate over each JSON object returned from the server :
And for each of the items we could execute another nested callback function :
We could use the each callback function to dynamically append a new image to a list ( the image src attribute will point to the URL of the returned JSON media image ) :
And on each dynamically created image we could wire - up a click event handler so that when it is pressed it will disappear via an animation :
Notice how the jQuery intellisense works cleanly at each level of our code .
JavaScript Intellisense Tips and Tricks
Jeff King from the Web Tools team wrote up a great post earlier this week that answers a number of common questions about how JavaScript intellisense works with VS 2008 .
I highly recommend reading it .
One trick he talks about which I 'll show here is a technique you can use when you want to have JavaScript intellisense work within user - controls / partials ( .ascx files ) .
Often you do n't want to include a JavaScript library < script src= " " /> reference within these files , and instead have this live on the master page or content page the user control is used within .
The problem of course when you do this is that by default VS has no way of knowing that this script is available within the user control - and so wo n't provide intellisense of it for you .
One way you can enable this is by adding the < script src= " " /> element to your user control , but then surround it with a server - side <% if %> block that always evaluates to false at runtime :
At runtime ASP.NET will never render this script tag ( since it is wrapped in an if block that is always false ) .
However , VS will evaluate the < script /> tag and provide intellisense for it within the user - control .
A useful technique to use for scenarios like the user control one .
Jeff has even more details in his FAQ post as well as his original jQuery intellisense post .
Rick Strahl also has a good post about using jQuery intellisense here .
More Information
To learn more about jQuery , I recommend watching Stephen Walther 's ASP.NET and jQuery PDC talk .
Click here to download his code samples and powerpoint presentation .
Rick Strahl also has a really nice Introduction to jQuery article that talks about using jQuery with ASP .
NET .
Karl Seguin has two nice jQuery primer posts here and here that provide shorter overviews of some of the basics of how to use jQuery .
I also highly recommend the jQuery in Action book .
Hope this helps ,

MOGADISHU , Somalia - Disagreements between Somali pirates holding a ship laden with tanks and heavy weapons escalated into a shootout and three pirates are believed dead , a U.S. defense official said Tuesday .
The pirates denied the report .
The U.S. destroyer USS Howard and several other American ships have surrounded the Ukrainian cargo ship Faina , which was hijacked Thursday and is now anchored off the lawless coast of Somalia .
The pirates have demanded a ransom of $ 20 million and the U.S.
Navy cordon aims to prevent them from taking any of the weapons ashore .
The official in Washington who reported the shootout spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record .
He refused to elaborate and said he had no way of confirming the deaths .
But the pirate spokesman insisted the report was not true , that his colleagues were just celebrating the Muslim feast of Eid al - Fitr despite being surrounded by American warships and helicopters .
" We did n't dispute over a single thing , let alone have a shootout , " pirate spokesman Sugule Ali told The Associated Press by satellite telephone Tuesday .
" We are happy on the ship and we are celebrating Eid , " Ali said .
" Nothing has changed . "
The Islamic feast marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan .
Earlier Tuesday , Andrew Mwangura of the East African Seafarers ' Assistance Program cited an unconfirmed report saying three Somali pirates were killed Monday night in a dispute over whether to surrender .
Mwangura said , however , he had not spoken to any witnesses .
Elsewhere in Somalia , pirates freed a Malaysian tanker Tuesday after a ransom was paid , according to a Malaysian shipping company .
The blue - and - white Ukrainian ship Faina has been buzzed by American helicopters since Sunday .
Pirates hijacked the Faina and its cargo of 33 Soviet - designed tanks and weapons Thursday while the ship was passing through the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes , en route to the Kenyan port of Mombasa .
Ali said the vessel was surrounded by four warships but he could not identify where the ships were from .
The San Diego - based USS guided missile destroyer Howard has been watching the pirate ship for several days and has spoken the pirates and crew by radio .
The U.S. defense official in Washington said the pirates have been moving from ship to shore and back again , bringing provisions including livestock .
He said between 40 and 50 pirates were involved in the hijacking , but a second U.S. official said only about 30 of them were on the ship itself .
On Monday , U.S. naval officials said several other American ships had joined the watch , but declined to give details .
U.S. Navy officials said they have allowed the pirates to resupply the ship with food and water , but not to unload any of its military cargo , which included T - 72 tanks , ammunition , and heavy weapons that U.S. Defense officials have said included rocket launchers .
The U.S. fears the armaments may end up with al - Qaida - linked Islamic militants who have been fighting an insurgency against the shaky , U.N. - backed Somali transitional government since late 2006 , when the Islamists were driven out after six months in power .
More than 9,000 people , most of them civilians , have been killed in the Iraq - style insurgency .
Russia has also dispatched a warship to the area , but it will take about a week to get there .
American military officials and diplomats say the weapons are destined for southern Sudan .
Meanwhile , the Malaysian shipping line MISC Berhad said Tuesday that Somalia pirates released the seized palm oil tanker , MT Bunga Melati 2 , on Monday , two days after its first vessel was released .
Chairman Hassan Marican said a ransom was paid for both vessels but declined to reveal the amount .
All 79 crew on both ships are safe but were traumatized and will undergo counseling , he said .
Piracy has become a lucrative criminal racket in impoverished Somalia , bringing in tens of millions of dollars a year in ransom .
There have been 24 reported attacks in Somalia this year , according to the International Maritime Bureau .
Most pirate attacks occur in the Gulf of Aden , one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes , to the north of Somalia .
But recently pirates have been targeting Indian Ocean waters off eastern Somalia .
In all , 62 ships have been attacked in the notorious African waters this year .
A total of 26 ships were hijacked , and 12 remain in the hands of the pirates along with more than 200 crew members .
International warships are patrolling the area and have created a special security corridor under a U.S. - led initiative , but attacks have not abated .
Debbie Mantenopoulos Divorce Discovery
E! Daily 10
Show hostlearned that her husband filed for divorce right along with the rest of us - on the internet .
Debbie and music executive Jay Faires were together for 7 years .
Although the couple have been separated since March of this year , Debbie was hoping that things could be worked out because she is not a " proponent " of divorce .
Faires clearly felt otherwise , filing the divorce papers on Wednesday at the Los Angeles Court House , citing irreconcilable difference .
As part of the filing , he has asked that Mantenopoulos not receive spousal support .
Olbermann : Bush ' lied ' about intending to close Gitmo David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 22 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush " lied " when he promised to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp .
That was the conclusion of MSNBC's Keith Olbermann , based on a New York Times report that Bush " never considered proposals drafted in the State Department and the Pentagon that outlined options for transferring the detainees elsewhere , according to senior administration officials . "
Defense Secretary Gates has publicly conceded that Guanatanamo " is an issue that will have to be addressed early on by a new administration . "
" Mr. Bush does not even have the courage to clean his own diaper , " Olbermann concluded .
In an exchange during a White House press briefing on Wednesday , Press Secretary Dana Perino was asked about Bush 's decision not to close the camp and replied , " I do n't see anything that 's new in that story .
What the President has said is that he wants to be able to get into a position where we could close Guantanamo eventually .
But it 's very complex , it 's complicated , it is difficult . "
Pernio cited unresolved issues involving military commissions , returning some detainees to their home countries or elsewhere , ongoing habeas corpus litigation regarding a federal judge 's recent order that 17 Chinese Muslims who are no longer considered enemy combatants must be freed within the United States , and the administration 's attempt to get Congress to pass legislation overturning a Supreme Court ruling that detainees have the right to challenge their detention in US courts .
When that ruling was handed down in June , John McCain called it " a decision which I think is one of the worst decisions in the history of this country , " while Barack Obama praised it in a statement which read , " Today 's Supreme Court decision ensures that we can protect our nation and bring terrorists to justice , while also protecting our core values .
The Court 's decision is a rejection of the Bush Administration 's attempt to create a legal black hole at Guantanamo  yet another failed policy supported by John McCain . "
The administration favors a bill proposed by Senators Lindsay Graham and Joe Liberman that " would reaffirm that the nation remains at war and thus that enemy combatants may be detained until the termination of hostilities . "
It would also prevent the release of detainees within the US and perpetuate the use of military commissions .
Perino went on to claim that " seven percent of the people who have been returned from Gitmo have returned to the battlefield .
...
It 's slow work because we are being very diligent in making sure that we do everything that we can to make sure that potential terrorists are n't in a position to be able to hurt innocent people again . "
The figure of seven percent comes from a Defense Intelligence Agency report of last May , which asserts that 36 former detainees are " confirmed or suspected " of having returned to terrorism .
However , that number includes both actual terrorists and those involved in " local , tactical - level , anti-coalition activity " in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The Guantanamo issue has now been dragging on for well over a year .
On June 22 , 2007 , USA Today reported that " a scheduled high - level Friday meeting on the matter was canceled after AP reported on it and the White House said no decision is imminent  while repeating President Bush 's stated desire to shutter Guantanamo Bay . "
Perino stated at the time that the AP report had been " overblown " and that " while the president has said that we want to make sure that we close this facility as quickly as possible , he 's not put a deadline on it because there are complex issues .
We have to make sure that we handle it appropriately . "

Pennies : Enough Already !
Whenever I travel in other wealthy countries , I am a bit embarrassed about the dollar bill ’s insignificance compared to other countries ’ smallest bills : a 5 - pound note is worth $ 9 ; a 5 - euro note is worth $ 7 ; a 1,000 - yen note is worth $ 9 .
At the same time , no rich country has a coin as worthless as the U.S. penny .
Imagine my surprise at the recent announcement that the U.S. will be issuing four new versions of the penny , the first of which comes out in February , in honor of Lincoln ‘s bicentennial .
What a waste of resources — and what a move inside the production - possibility frontier !
Each penny costs much more than 1 cent to manufacture .
Many people have called for the demise of the penny .
It should go , but so should the dollar bill .
After all , at 3 percent annual inflation , by 2030 the dollar ’s value will have fallen by half ; will we still be using dollar bills ( and more worthless pennies ) ?
I hope not .
It ’s time to join the rich world ; it ’s time to stop wasting resources ; and it ’s time to stop transferring taxpayer money as subsidies to zinc producers .
" We see landfills as potential New Age energy plants , because you can combine all three and create a steady source of power - and not everybody wants a windmill in their back yard , " said Jeff Tittel , executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club .
There was a Wall Street Journal Article which got lost in the news about bailouts failing and stock markets crashing .
The article dealt with a slowdown in the medical field .
As a patient activist , I found the article very troubling and the developments disturbing .
In short , many people are cutting back on " unnecessary spending , " and medical care is getting passed off as unnecessary .
The Journal described what Americans are cutting corners on :
" In a survey by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners last month , 22 % of 686 consumers said that economy - related woes were causing them to go to the doctor less often .
About 11 % said they 've scaled back on prescription drugs to save money .
Some of the areas being hit include hip and knee replacements , mammograms , and visits to the emergency room , according to a survey conducted by D2 Hawkeye Inc. , a Waltham , Mass. , medical data analytics firm , on behalf of The Wall Street Journal . "
Of course , colonscopies , prescriptions which keep Crohn 's Disease in remission , PSA tests for prostate cancer , and blood tests for anemia are all being skipped too .
Cancers and flares will go undetected .
People will suddenly develop severe symptoms , and they 'll be admitted to the hospital , spiking up the total cost of their medical care .
It 's even worse for some people .
People who have a chronic illness but lose their health insurance simply cannot find affordable health insurance on the private market .
No middle class family can afford the $ 2,000 a month it costs to insure a chronically ill individual .
So the chronically ill skip out on tests and drugs they need to keep healthy .
They " try not to get sick " by not thinking about their disease .
And they end up worse off than they were .
The Journal details a typical , and heartbreaking , story of a Crohn 's Disease patient who lost her health insurance :
" Marianne Falacienski of Pensacola , Fla. , had health coverage through her husband 's land - surveyor job until he was laid off in April last year .
Her husband , Brian , has since bought a policy for himself and their 2 - year - old daughter on the individual market , but the family could n't afford to include Ms. Falacienski , who has a chronic inflammatory bowel disease called Crohn's .
The premiums charged by insurers for health plans purchased by individuals with pre-existing conditions can be prohibitive .
Ms. Falacienski , 33 , has been putting off a pricey blood test to monitor her Crohn 's - related anemia , which if it worsens , can indicate bleeding in the intestines .
She says she already owes more than $ 3,000 for a blood transfusion she needed in January -- the result , she says , of skipping the tests last year and thus failing to spot her worsening blood count in time .
" I 'm just trying not to get sick again , " she says .
She found a receptionist job in July but wo n't be eligible for its health benefits until late fall . "
And if my life is any indicator , Ms. Falacienski will develop a flare right before her health insurance takes effect .
She 'll be laid off .
She 'll be forced to use the emergency room to treat her illness .
She 'll get tens of thousands of dollars in bills that she cannot afford .
The hospital will refer her bills to a collection agency .
She 'll get too many phone calls to count .
She 'll become stressed out over how she can afford to live , she 'll feel like she is a big burden on her family , she 'll get depressed , her disease will get worse , and the vicious cycle will repeat itself .
Welcome to being ill in 21st Century America .
As a country , we need to ask ourselves if we truly value human life like Ms. Falacienski's .
We need to ask ourselves if we would be willing to spare a little bit extra every two weeks in order to make sure that everyone -- no matter their condition -- could access the medical care system .
For me this election is about health care .
John McCain would continue to exclude the chronically ill from the health insurance system .
In contrast , Barack Obama would allow those of us who are chronically ill to buy into the health care plan that Member 's of Congress given themselves , and provide subsidies to ensure that everyone could afford the premiums .
The choice is clear .
I , and many other patients who care about expanding access to the health insurance system , are standing with Barack Obama .
Camcorders are among the latest gadgets that have scaled down to pocketable sizes .
Pure Digital Technologies is one of the companies that has led the pack with its line of Flip Video cameras , enabling a new generation of YouTubers and spontaneous documentarians alike .
As these compact video cameras have been shrinking , though , the race to larger HD resolutions has escalated .
Pure Digital Technologies has just released the latest member of its lineup , the Flip MinoHD , which shoots 720 p footage .
I spent some time with the MinoHD and shot a few test videos to see what it has to offer .
Design
If you 've used a point - and - shoot camera , the Flip MinoHD should seem at least familiar , though the MinoHD is held in a vertical , portrait format versus most cameras ' landscape .
With the same 3.94 " x 1.97 " x 0.63 " dimensions and 3.3 ounce weight as its older Flip Mino ( SD ) brother , the Flip MinoHD is noticeably smaller and lighter than previous non-Mino generations .
It is also roughly the same size and shape as many point - and - shoot digicams , though a bit thicker by today 's standards .
Sporting an integrated lithium - ion rechargeable battery , a 1.5 inch display , and 4GB of internal , non-expandable memory ( providing 60 minutes of 720 p HD footage at 30 fps ) , the Flip MinoHD is significantly smaller than competing pocket camcorders .
Kodak 's Zi6 , by contrast , runs on AA batteries , has an expandable SD slot that supports up to 32GB , can shoot 640 x 480 stills , and features a larger 2.4 inch display , but weights in at 3.8 ounces and is a bit larger at 4.5 " x 2.5 " x 0.9 " .
It should also be noted that , like the original Mino , the Flip MinoHD can be customized with a number of styles available at Pure Digital Technologies ' website , or you can upload your own image if you 're really gunning to destroy your resell value .
My test model was the base gadget black design with silver trim , however , cuz that 's how we roll .
The most noticeable thing about the Flip MinoHD right out of the box is that it is light .
Extremely light .
I admittedly have n't used other pocket camcorders , but after touting around Canon Elph point - and - shoot cameras with metal enclosures for the last few years , the MinoHD 's closed , plastic design and rounded edges feel comfortably light in my hand .
A mono microphone next to the Flip MinoHD 's fixed focus , f /2.4 aperture lens picks up audio reasonably well ( which you 'll hear in videos below ) .
Aside from a backlit touchpad on the front of the device to play / pause videos , skip between videos , raise and lower volume , and trash unwanted clips , the Flip MinoHD has three physical controls .
A big red button on the front starts and stops recording , a latch on the left side releases a retractable USB port for downloading videos and charging the battery , and a power button serves its purpose on the right .
While shooting test videos for this piece , I found the Flip MinoHD 's control layout to be pretty unobtrusive , and I never struck a button by accident .
I admit that even after owning an iPhone for a year and a half now , I can still be a little apprehensive about touch controls on gadgets .
But the Flip MinoHD is a good size for my hands to wrap around ( I 'm short , though , at 5 ' 8 " ) , and there is plenty of room at the bottom of the device on which to rest my thumb and keep it away from the controls while shooting .
On - the - go usability
After shooting a few test videos in our apartment and down the street at a park with our dogs , the Flip MinoHD 's tiny 1.5 inch screen became a little irksome .
I realize that design constraints prevent the screen from being any larger ( I suppose Flip could have moved the speakers on either side to a different area on the device 's face ) , but 1.5 inch displays are just as virtually useless as they were on digital cameras of years past .
This display certainly gets the job done , but you 'll probably end up squinting quite a bit if you like to capture specific kinds of action or detail in a scene .
On - camera editing options have become popular over the years , as most digital cameras have offered simple editing and trimming options for some time now .
The Flip MinoHD does n't offer any of this functionality , but I 've personally never liked those options to begin with .
Perhaps it is my digital design and motion graphics background , but I prefer to get all the footage into a computer where more intuitive tools can get the job done much faster .
Still , this omission is worth noting for those who are concerned about 60 minutes not being enough for their pocket camcorder needs .
Another factor for travelers to consider about the Flip MinoHD is that its flip - out USB port is the only way to charge it .
While AAs do n't last on a charge quite as long as a lithium - ion battery , the fact of the matter is that USB is the only way to charge a MinoHD on the go .
Compact USB adapters like Apple 's reportedly do n't work with the MinoHD , but Pure Digital Technologies will introduce its own USB charger soon for about $ 20 .
Park test with the dogs
Note how well the microphone picks up dialog between my wife , who was shooting ,
and myself , standing about 6 feet away and playing with the dogs .
In my testing , though , I never ran into a battery issue .
The Flip MinoHD 's battery is rated to provide two hours of life , though again , it only holds one hour of video .
I used this camera the way I imagine most people will though : I shot some video around the apartment in the morning , took the dogs to the park over lunch and shot them playing , then plugged the camera in to offload those two videos , charging the battery in the process .
For what it 's worth , Pure Digital Technologies says the Flip MinoHD 's battery should fully charge off a powered USB port in about three hours .
Video quality
Here are a couple more videos I shot to give you some quality references .
The first is from a moving car ( no , I was n't driving ) because I wanted to see the MinoHD 's performance while moving faster than a brisk pace .
The Flip MinoHD car test
Video capture works well in motion , but notice how jostled the image is .
The Flip MinoHD
leaves a little to be desired in the stabilization department .
Also note that I say the
camcorder shoots 60 fps in this video , but it actually shoots 30 .
The second video is a test of the MinoHD 's night shooting abilities , as Pure Digital Technologies is said to have improved them for this HD upgrade .
Again , I have n't tested other Flip Video cameras , so perhaps owners of previous models can comment on whether night shooting has improved .
Naturally , uploading to a Flash video site ( even one like Vimeo that focuses on high - quality video ) degrades video footage to some measure .
The videos embedded in this post look pretty good considering the MinoHD 's design and $ 229.99 price , though on Vimeo , the frame rate appears a little slower , even with the HD option turned on .
If you can take my word for it , the Flip MinoHD 's native 1280 x 720 footage in H.264/AAC
format at 9 Mbps ( adaptive ) 30 fps looks very fluid and less artifact - ridden on my Mac 's display , though colors do seem a little more washed out than I would prefer .
The black coat on our hyperactive dog Maddy in the park video , for example , could be a lot more black in these videos .
If you would like to see the original versions of these videos , you can sign up for a free account at Vimeo .
Registered users can download the native QuickTime files at our Ars account ( scroll down on the right side of each video for the link ) .
It should also be noted that the Flip MinoHD has a 2 x digital zoom , operated by the volume up / down keys while shooting .
I did n't test this feature , but digital zoom is indeed there in case someone just has to use it .
Software
Staying true to Pure Digital Technologies ' KISS philosophy , the company includes a basic suite of video management and editing software called FlipShare for Mac OS X and Windows in its own directory on the Flip MinoHD .
The camera 's file system appears when plugging it into a machine , and native applications like iPhoto and iMovie can grab movies off if you want to work that way , though iMovie '08 throws an error when trying to use its native camera importing tool ( I 'm still waiting to hear from Pure Digital Technologies on this error ) .
A simple File >
Import operation works just fine , though , and movies were quickly imported and ready for editing in my testing .

Click for a larger view
FlipShare is n't a half - bad piece of software though , and it should suit the needs of many users .
The fact that the software is always with you and ready to run or install on any computer is also pretty convenient .
Videos can be played back as thumbnails or scaled up while the camcorder is plugged in , and basic management features allow for deleting and organizing videos .
A very simple tool allows for adjusting start and stop points for videos ( nothing more ) , so you wo n't be replacing Final Cut Pro or even iMovie anytime soon .
A number of sharing features are also built into FlipShare , which allow for easily e-mailing clips or even creating simple e-cards with them .
This is especially handy for the common user since , at 720 p , virtually nothing you shoot with this camera will be e-mail friendly .
You can select one or multiple videos and add a few recipients , and your videos are uploaded to Pure Digital Technologies ' servers , then transcoded and compressed to a Flash video about 470 pixels wide .
Your lucky viewers then receive an e-mail with links to watch the videos online .
It 's a reasonably useful workaround for sharing Flip MinoHD videos , and there is also built - in support for uploading to YouTube , MySpace , and AOL Video .
Conclusion
So is the Flip MinoHD worth its $ 230 price tag ?
Yes , as long as you value simplicity and small size over competitors ' features like expandability and larger displays .
After carrying this camera around for a couple of days , I can say that it 's great to be able to capture spontaneously memorable moments where the video does n't end up looking like it was rendered on Atari 800 .
The Flip MinoHD 's intuitive controls , compact package , and quality video capture that now goes to HD make it an appealing competitor among camcorders that can come along for any ride .

– The droids duking it out in the fighting pit are GNK power droids , better known as “ gonk droids ” because of the distinctive noises they make .
– The droid fighting pit could be a reference to robot combat shows like Robot Wars and BattleBots .
L3 -37 would HATE those shows .
– The six - eyed alien that is trying to peek at Han ’s cards during the first sabacc game is an Azumel named Argus “ Six Eyes ” Panox .
He is a reference to the “ many - eyed ” giant from Greek mythology named Argus Panoptes .
Also , do n’t the Azumel sorta resemble the three - eyed Gran ?
– Classic Star Wars species who appear in Solo include Twi’leks , Wookiees , and Trandoshans .
– The planet Kessel , best known for its harsh conditions and mines operated by slave labor , has been around since the very beginning of Star Wars .
Kessel was first mentioned by C - 3PO in A New Hope and has subsequently appeared several times in the Expanded Universe .
In George Lucas ’ Journal of the Whills outline for what would eventually become A New Hope , Kessel appeared as a star system called “ Kissel , ” which contained the planet Utapau ( you may remember it from Revenge of the Sith as General Grievous ’ final resting place ) .
Kessel first appeared in the flesh in a comic strip published by Los Angeles Times Syndicate called “ The Second Kessel Run . ”
You guessed it : it ’s about Han and Chewie attempting a second run through the dangerous smuggling route .
– In the Legends timeline , Kessel was the home of a huge spice mining operation ( this was totally ripped from classic 1965 sci - fi novel Dune by Frank Herbert ) .
However , it seems that coaxium is Kessel ’s main export in Solo .
– The Kessel Run , the infamous smuggling route , was also first mentioned in A New Hope by Han while boasting about the Millennium Falcon .
The route is 18 parsecs long .
– It should also be noted that parsecs are a unit of distance , not speed , in the real world .
The original line from A New Hope is “ It ’s the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs , ” which would indicate that parsecs are a unit of speed .
George Lucas later explained in the Star - Words letters section of Marvel ’s Star Wars # 6 ( 1977 ) that the error was a hint that Han was lying about the Falcon ’s exploits while negotiating with Luke and Obi-Wan .
According to Wookieepedia , writer Kevin J. Anderson later retconned the explanation , turning parsecs into a valid unit of distance in terms of the Kessel Run :
“ The Kessel Run is through the Maw .
Event horizons around black holes are dependent on the speed at which you are traveling .
A standard ship has to do the run in eighteen parsecs because to cut the route any closer , the ship would get sucked in .
The Falcon , however , is fast enough to straighten the route and cut over six parsecs off the distance traveled . ”
Okay , that ’s enough about the parsecs …
– The rescue / revolt scenes in the spice mines are reminiscent of those in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom , which features
Indy saving children from slave labor at the hands of the evil Kali cult .
– Droids featured in the revolt on Kessel include both astromech and protocol droids .
– Speaking of droids , this is the first Star Wars movie to not feature C - 3PO or R2 - D2 , who even popped up briefly in Rogue One .
– Scarif is also mentioned in passing .
This tropical planet first appeared in Rogue One. Jyn Erso and the other Rebels infiltrate Scarif in order to steal the plans to the Death Star .
– Savareen , the final planet introduced in the movie , first appeared in a West End Games role - playing publication , Star Wars Journal 9 , in 1996 .
In both the old and new canon , the planet is known for is brandy .
– John Powell is only the third composer to score a live - action Star Wars movie ( John Williams and Michael Giacchino are the other two , of course ) .
His excellent score features a few homages to Williams ’ original music , including sections of “ TIE Fighter Attack , ” “ The Asteroid Field , ” and the “ Main Title ” theme .
All of these musical cues are just exquisite .
– You can also hear a slightly modified version of “ The Imperial March ” in the recruitment video for the Imperial Academy on Corellia .
– Warwick Davis , who first played Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi , makes a cameo in Solo , reprising his cameo role from The Phantom Menace , Weazel , who was first introduced as a thief and member of the Hutt gang on Tatooine .
He ’s become a spy and Enfys Nest ’ lieutenant since then .
– Clint Howard , Ron Howard ’s brother , makes a cameo as the guy running the droid fighting pit .
He ’s appeared in several of his brother ’s movies .
The Bond girl
The villain
.
The technology
The locations
.
The action
.
I 'll admit , I was n't completely crazy about Like Josh , I found it a little too opaque , a little too brutish , and not remotely satisfying on the character level .
But I 'm not going to tell you to avoid it ; is still better than most action movies , and even does a few things better thandid .
Below is a list of five things that are better in ; any of these alone is enough reason to see the movie , but all of them put together means you 'll have a good time no matter what .
Even though Olga Kurylenko is a Ukrainian playing a Colombian , she kicks ass as one of the few Bond girls who actually gets to stand up for herself .
She starts off as mere eye candy for the main bad guy , but halfway through the film emerges with a revenge motive of her own , and teams up with Bond only to make sure she 'll get her way .
Sure , Bond has to bail her out of a few tough situations , but she more than holds her own -- and looks amazing while doing it .
No offense to Mads Mikkelsen , the meanie card player from , but Mathieu Amalric brings the snaky Bond villain to a whole new level .
He abandons the usual Bond villain gimmicks , like a cat or a bloodshot eye ( again , sorry Mads ) , and plays someone so evil you would almost believe him as a nice guy .
Plus , it 's been a while since we 've had a good villain with a French accent , and Amalric makes exactly the kind of baguette - eating , beret - wearing frog we Americans love to hate .
You know CNN 's magic map , where they make states and electoral votes fly all over the screen ?
Just wait ' til you see the gadget they 've got on hand at MI6 headquarters .
It 's pretty crucial for understanding half the plot , which involves a lot of traced cell phone calls and traveling gadgets , and brings Bond into the 21st century more successfully than pretty much anything else so far .
Did I mention how badly I want one for my desk ?
We 've seen Bond tool around scenic European cities countless times , so this time director Marc Forster is bringing us south of the border .
Pretty much the entire plot takes place in South America , with a brief stopover in Forster 's native Austria , and the locations feel as real and unglamorous as 's Venice was staged .
The camera even takes moments to linger on the actual residents of these poor countries , a grounded moment that 's strange for a Bond film , but oddly refreshing .
You 've heard already thatis the shortest Bond film and probably the most stuffed with action , but you 'll still be amazed at how , 30 minutes into the movie , you 've already gone through three action set pieces and a badass car chase .
And that 's before you get to the cat - and - mouse airplane fight and the desert explosions .
Sure , action is n't what makes a movie good , but it is what makes you stand up in your seat and cheer -- and see the movie again to figure out how the hell they pulled it off .

( Natural News ) The Veterans Administration ( VA ) is issuing a warning that the popular anti-smoking drug Chantix has been linked to an elevated risk of suicide .
This warning comes months after the FDA first expressed concerns over the psychiatric effects of the drug .
Chantix helps people quit smoking by simulating the effects of nicotine in the brain , while at the same time making real nicotine less effective .
As early as November 2007 , the FDA warned that many people were experiencing changes in emotions and behavior , including depression and suicidal thoughts , within weeks or even days of starting the drug .
By February , the agency had strengthened its message , saying , " it appears increasingly likely that there may be an association between Chantix and serious neuropsychiatric symptoms .
" At least 40 cases of suicide and another 400 attempted suicides have been reported among those taking Chantix .
In February , the FDA asked Chantix manufacturer Pfizer to make warnings about suicidal and other psychiatric side effects more prominent on the drug 's label .
But consumer advocacy groups have insisted that this measure does not go far enough .
Public Citizen wants the FDA to put a stronger " black box " warning on the drug , while researchers from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices have expressed concern over non-psychiatric side effects such as loss of consciousness and seizures .
When the FDA issued its first warning in November , the VA had already begun a study into the behavioral effects of Chantix on hundreds of Iraq war veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder .
Participants in this ongoing study are being paid $ 30 per month .
The VA did not pass the FDA 's first warning on to study participants .
When it finally warned them about potential psychiatric side effects after the second FDA announcement in February , the VA failed to mention the risk of suicide .
The agency says that it will now send warning letters to all 940 study participants , plus an additional 31,000 veterans who have been prescribed the drug .
The study will continue , but no new participants will be enrolled .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bankers and traders are bracing for sharply reduced bonuses amid one of the worst downturns ever -- and they will be the lucky ones .

With more than 75,000 jobs already cut and more than $ 400 billion of credit losses , the proverbial blood is flowing on Wall Street .
And while there are still four to five months left in the year , annual bonuses representing the bulk of Wall Street pay are expected to fall by 30 to 40 percent , recruiters and compensation experts said .
Given the environment , there may be little choice but to accept the cuts and hope for a 2009 rebound .
“ It ’s clearly a buyers ’ market , ” said Robert Sloan , head of the U.S. financial services recruiting practice at Egon Zehnder International .
“ The assumption going into this year is you can take your base salary or severance .
That ’s the choice .
There ’s a resignation in the market . ”
Wall Street firms typically pay out about half their revenue as compensation .
Based on performance so far this year , a period that saw Bear Stearns fall off the map , payouts are poised to fall hard .
Morgan Stanley last month said its first - half revenue fell 28 percent , and the funds set aside for compensation dropped at the same rate to $ 7.03 billion .
Goldman Sachs revenue fell 22 percent , with the compensation pool down 23 percent to $ 8.5 billion .
Last week , New York state officials estimated total bonus payments from the nation ’s financial hub would plunge 20 percent , removing billions of dollars from the tax rolls .
“ Things have been bleak , ” said Brent Longnecker , chief executive of Longnecker & Associates , a compensation firm .
FROM ZERO TO $ 40 MILLION
Actual payouts will span the range from zero to healthy increases .
Some executives are refusing bonuses , notably Lehman Brothers Chief Executive Richard Fuld and President Herbert “ Bart ” McDade .
Others will still strike it rich .
Former Goldman star Thomas Montag , who starts work at Merrill Lynch on Monday as head of sales and trading , will receive a guaranteed $ 40 million for five months work .
Meanwhile some firms are building up certain businesses even as they hand out pink slips at others .
Morgan Stanley this week said it will redeploy some of the $ 1 billion of savings from 4,800 job cuts to recruit top executives .
Goldman
Sachs says its headcount will rise by low single digit percentages , despite slashing 10 percent earlier this year , fueled by expansion in fast growing markets outside New York .
But these are exceptions .
“ Right now we see the volume of opportunistic hiring is also reduced , ” Sloan said .
Compensation experts also said that with firms eager to conserve cash while holding on to key employees , a bigger slice of bonuses will be paid out in restricted shares .
Banks , moreover , are asking for longer hold periods -- for three or five years .
That said , last year actual bonuses proved higher than predicted as many firms paid up to avoid losing top bankers and traders , mindful of past downturns when markets quickly snapped back .
Yet U.S. housing prices remain under pressure and the credit crisis continues to spread .
Many Wall
Street executives say the current downturn is far worse than other recent slumps , including the post - Internet bubble period of 2002 and 2003 .
So until profits do bounce back , banks and their employees will be playing defense .
“ It ’s a cyclical business , ” said Adam Zoia , managing partner of Glocap Search .
“ And the key thing during a downturn is keeping your job . ”
During the recent debate with Barack Obama , John McCain stated that " I know the veterans , I know them well , and I know that they know that I 'll take care of them " .
Obama let it slide , but nothing could be further from the truth .
Our good friend Brandon Freidman of VetVoice has done some excellent work researching and compiling the Master List of how little McCain cares for troops and veterans .
It 's a must - read post that 's too detailled to excerpt but it comprehensively lists all the times McCain : refused to support veterans by refusing to vote for veteran benefits , healthcare and support ; refused to support the troops in combat by voting against extra armor for them ; refused to support the troops by first cheerleading for and then voting for enmiring America in Bush 's war of choice in Iraq ; refused to support the real front in Afghanistan by continually voting against any withdrawal from Iraq .
It also lists a whole slew of McCain 's foreign policy gaffes , pointing to systemic ignorance and bad judgement rather than a few accidental mis-speakings .
Brandon has included sources for his list and YouTube videos to back many of the items .
Seriously , you 'll want to read and cite this list often .
His support for veterans and troops is a big part of McCain 's pitch but in reality it 's simply mythology created out of whole cloth .
And so is McCain 's " judgement " on Iraq .
McCain : " We 're going to win this victory .
Tragically , we will lose American lives .
But it will be brief .
We 're going to find massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction . . .
It 's going to send the message throughout the Middle East that democracy can take hold in the Middle East . "

[ Haskell ] ANNOUNCE : hpapi 0.1 release
I am pleased to announce the first release of hpapi , Performance API ( PAPI ) bindings for Haskell .
The release is on Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/hpapi
The source repository is at : http://code.haskell.org/hpapi/
Please send bug reports to < adamsmd [ AT ] cs.indiana.edu>
What is it ==========
This is a simple set of bindings for the Performance API ( PAPI ) .
PAPI provides access to various CPU counters such as cache - miss , instruction and pipeline stall counts .
The easiest way to use this library is the withCounts function : withCounts :: [ EventCode ] -> IO a -> IO ( a , [ Integer ] )
Given a list of events to count and an IO operation it will run the operation and return the resulting counts .
So you could do something like : main = do [ l1, tlb , fp ] <- withCounters [ papi_l1_dcm , papi_tlb_dm , papi_fp_ins ] ioOperationToMeasure printLn ( l1 , tlb , fp )
To use it one will of course need the PAPI C library and any necessary kernel modifications installed .
Status ======
The High Level interface ( which will be sufficient for most people 's needs ) should be usable , but the low level interface is still alpha quality .
That is to say , it is ready for people to start banging on it , but it is largely untested and the modules / interfaces may be reorganized based on user feedback .
All of PAPI is supported with the exception of the following " advanced " features : - Multiplexing - Threads - Locks - Overflow - Statistical Profiling Future Directions =================
Future directions will be determined largely by user feedback .
Principal areas that I am looking for feedback on are : - documentation - module organization - the handling of PAPI errors ( currently it throws an IO error ) - the design of the Haskell interface build on top of the C level PAPI_get_opt and PAPI_set_opt - what advanced features of PAPI to build bindings for next Comparison with GHC 's built - in PAPI ===================================
GHC supports a built - in version of PAPI ( see http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/PAPI).
This system is different in a few ways .
First , hpapi allows you to measure specific parts of a program while GHCI 's PAPI only does whole program measurement Second , since hpapi is a library you can have fine grained and sophisticated control over how things are measured .
On the other hand GHC 's PAPI as part of the RTS gives you less control , but on the plus side does n't require any modification to the program .
Finally , GHC's PAPI splits apart the counts that come from the garbage collector from those that come from the mutator , while hpapi combines them .
This is a limitation of hpapi we hope to correct some time in the future .
It remains to be seen whether it would be worth while to unify these two systems .
================
Bug reports as well as suggestions , feedback or contributions to the API or the documentation most welcome .

Scores of children train to become suicide bombers at a camp run by Qair Hussain in Spinkai , South Waziristan .

The Taliban have rebuilt a camp in South Waziristan that trains children to be suicide bombers , a video from Pakistan shows .
Children as young as seven years old are indoctrinated to wage jihad in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The video , obtained by AfPax Insider , was shot in August in Spinkai Ragzai , South Waziristan , a tribal area run by Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
The Taliban are seen “ training dozens of boys ranging in age from seven to 14 , ” the news service reported .
“ The video attempts to justify suicide bombings as a legitimate means of attack against “ infidels . ' ”
The images shows the children reading from the Quran and an adult Taliban training the children .
One slide shows a poster board with the words “ Killing a Spy ” written in English .
While not explicitly stated in the AfPax Insider report , the camp is run by Qari Hussain , a senior lieutenant to Baitullah who has close links to al Qaeda .
Hussain has rebuilt his child training camp after the Pakistani military demolished his suicide nursery during a short offensive in Spinkai in January 2008 .
In May , a senior Pakistani general described the previous camp as a “ factory . ”
The military seized numerous documents and training materials in the demolished camp .
“ It was like a factory that had been recruiting nine to 12 - year - old boys , and turning them into suicide bombers , ” said Major General Tariq Khan , the commander of Pakistan ’s 14 Division , which led the operation in South Waziristan .
“ The computers , other equipment and literature seized from the place … give graphic details of the training process in this so - called ‘ nursery , ' ” Dawn reported in May .
“ There are videos of young boys carrying out executions , a classroom where 10 - to 12 - year olds are sitting in formations , with white band of Quranic verses wrapped around their forehead , and there are training videos to show how improvised explosive devices are made and detonated . ”
The Pakistani military launched the operation in South Waziristan on Jan. 24 after Taliban forces commanded by Baitullah overran two military outposts and conducted attacks against other forts and military convoys in the tribal agency .
The Pakistani military reported that Hussain was killed in January after intercepting Taliban communications .
The military later reiterated that claim during the tour of the Spinkai camp on May 18 .

Hussain held a press conference at a government school building in South Waziristan five days later .
During the interview , he mocked the reports of his death .
“ I am alive , do n’t you see me ? ” Hussain said .
Hussain is believe to be in the running to succeed Baitullah Mehsud in the event of his death .
Baitullah is suffering from complications related to kidney disease and was rumored to have died last week .
Baitullah was later seen visiting villagers to celebrate Eid in towns throughout South Waziristan .
The Spinkai camp is one of 157 training camps and more than 400 support locations in the Taliban - controled tribal areas and in the Northwest Frontier Province .

Sarah Palin scares the Jews !
From her crazy Jew - converting church to emails your grandmother is receiving right now , it 's clear that America 's Jews are nervous about this woman .
Just ask Ed Koch !
This wo n't help : remember Palin 's address to the Republican National Convention ?
That bit of speechcraft so inspiring that it is already being taught in schools alongside Dr. King 's Dream Speech and Billy Crystal 's second Oscars monologue ?
It turns out one of its few memorable non-Obama - attacking lines was lifted from an old anti-Semite so extreme that he was booted from the John Birch Society .
It is , honestly , a bizarre and inexplicable story .
" We grow good people in our small towns , " Palin said , quoting someone identified only as a writer , " with honesty and sincerity and dignity . "
That " writer , " Wall Street Journal columnist Thomas Frank notes , is a man named Westbrook Pegler .
You have probably never heard of him , but he was a very popular and very right - wing columnist from the first half of the 20th century .
How right - wing ?
He openly wished for the assassination of Franklin Roosevelt , for one .
And for two , he was quite the anti-Semite !
He hated Jews so much , the far - right anti-Semitic John Birch Society banned him from their journal .
And all Pegler did was claim that American Jews were " instinctively sympathetic to Communism " !
And also claim lots of other crazy stuff !
So .
Quoting an old anti-Semite is obviously proof of nothing — people still say nice things about Lindbergh , Henry Ford , Walt Disney , and Richard Nixon — but the larger question here is who put those words in her nice speech , where did they find them , and what the hell were they thinking .
Like ... did they think no one would notice ?
Who even reads Pegler anymore ?
Answer : Pat Buchanan !
Buchanan , that lovable old coot , used that same line in a 1990 book .
Buchanan , of course , did not mind being associated with a crazy old anti-Semite , and the passage was quoted in a section quite complimentary to the reactionary columnist .
It really does boggle the mind , does n't it , that they could not find another passage by another writer talking about how nice small towns are , right ?
Of course the line is question is also about Harry Truman , who was , of course , a Vice President who eventually became president when the guy before him died in office of old age , so really there are a lot of questions we have for the people who composed that terrible speech .

Obama names first African - American attorney general : report RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday November 18 , 2008
Print This Email This President - elect Barack Obama plans to tap longtime lawyer Eric Holder to be attorney general , which would making him the first African - American ever in the post , according to several reports Tuesday .
Holder , who served as deputy attorney general under former president Bill Clinton , will head the Justice Department , reported Newsweek magazine 's Michael Isikoff , citing legal sources close to the presidential transition .
Obama 's transition team did not immediately comment on the report .
" Obama offered Holder the job and he accepted , " the magazine said on its website , adding that " the announcement is not likely until after Obama announces his choices to lead the Treasury and State departments . "
Holder was co-chief along with Caroline Kennedy of Obama 's vice - presidential selection process and , like Obama , is a fellow alumnus of Columbia University in New York .
The Associated Press followed with a report that Obama was asking senators whether Holder would be confirmed if nominated .
The Washington Post said it was " almost certain " that Holder would be nominated .
An official with the Obama transition team told the New York Times that the initial Newsweek report was " wrong " and that " no decision has been made " regarding Holder 's nomination .

SoonerG already has a good diary that points out aptly and astutely that John McCain 's latest web attack ad is really a not too subtle code to the Christian Right Wing that Barack Obama is the literal Anti-Christ as foretold in the Book of Revelations and popularized in " non-fiction " books like " The Late Great Planet Earth " and Tim LaHaye 's " Left Behind " novels .
Well , as if we needed confirmation that this is the violent , dangerous meme the McCain is attempting to spread , WorldNetDaily has published a screed by Hal Lindsey , entitled " How Obama Prepped World for Anti-Christ " .
Who is Hal Lindsey ?
In right - wing Christian Evangelical and Dominionist Circles Hal Lindsey is a Big Deal .
In the late Seventies Lindsey helped popularize the modern , Fundamentalist Christian interpretation of the Book of Revelations and the Apocalypse with his book " The Late Great Planet Earth " .
This is the grand - daddy of the violent , homophobic , racist apocalyptic fiction of Lim LaHaye 's " Left Behind " books and scores of other works attempting to interpret The Book of Revelations for our times .
Hal Lindsey is largely responsible for the modern Fundamentalist Christian view of the Anti-Christ as a world leader who can unite the world and bring a temporary peace before the End of the World .
The very same imagery and sophistry that McCain 's The One ad plays up .
So I sincerely doubt it is mere coincidence that the same day McCain 's Campaign puts out an ad with images of Barack Obama as a messianic figure Hal Lindsey writes :
Obama 's world tour provided a foretaste of the reception he can expect to receive .
He will probably also stand in some European capital , addressing the people of the world and telling them that he is the one that they have been waiting for .
And he can expect as wildly enthusiastic a greeting as Obama got in Berlin .
The Bible calls that leader the Antichrist .
And it seems apparent that the world is now ready to make his acquaintance .
The lifetime Agnostics and Atheists , even the sane Christians , among us may find it easy to write this off as pure silliness , but no one should be quick to dismiss this new line of smear attack .
Why ?
Because what seems silly nonsense to the rational is deadly serious to the true believers and the un-balanced .
Having grown up in the Evangelical Church I can tell you that the Dominionist view of the Book of Revelation is real .
Real to them as surely as the laptop you are reading this diary on and means nothing short of the End of the World .
So put yourself in their heads , and ask what would you do to stop The End of the World ?
The chill that just went up your spin is what makes the McCain Campaign 's hamfisted attempt at smear something more than smear , something more than a attempt to rally his base .
This is something incredibly dangerous .
To compare Obama to the Anti-Christ , whether by implication as in McCain 's Ad , or by direct accusation as with Lindsey 's screed , is to invite violence against Barack Obama and incite every nutcase with a God Complex to take matters into his own hands .
Think it can't happen ?
Today the FBI released the name of a Doctor at Fort Dietrich , Bruce Ivins , who is possibly if not probably , responsible for the 2001 Anthrax attacks , who was both mentally unstable and a strict Catholic with Christian Dominionist predilections .
For the sake of decency McCain should pull his " One " Ad , and decline anymore attempts to prey on the End of Times delusions propagated by the Christian Fundamentalist movement .
But , given McCain 's current campaign , decency seems to be among the things found lacking .
( Update : In the comments I answer questions .
Also see this analysis .
- Sam )
( Update 2 : A major bottom line of this post was to give to key races as detailed on my ActBlue page , or on the other side via the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
Thanks to all who gave .
- Sam )
I ’ve noticed a lot of continued speculation about the Presidential race .
You ask about the Bradley effect , voter purges , and other detailed topics .
It ’s all over the comments section , both here and on other sites .
As immersed as I am in the analysis , I am only now noticing that many of you are taking a little time to adapt to current conditions .
This post is directed at those of you who are rooting for one side – Democrats and Republicans alike .
It is time for you to take a good , hard look at what is going on .
Whatever your personal preference may be , a Democratic sweep is coming .
The storm is about to make landfall , and we know where .
The question is what you should do about it .
Where the Presidential race stands .
By the standards of Presidential elections since 1992 , Barack Obama is far ahead .
For most of this season he has been running about 50 EV ahead of where John Kerry ran at the same point in 2004 , which ended in a near - tie .
Currently the gap is even larger – it ’s nearing Clinton v. Dole proportions .
In the face of a down economy and abysmal approval ratings for the Bush Administration , a lead of this size by a Democrat is essentially insurmountable .
This is why John McCain ’s tactics have become increasingly savage – it ’s his last stand .
It is why Obama has started to buy 30 - minute blocks of time – he is shooting for a massive blowout .
Conservative commentators are jumping ship , writing obituaries for the Republican Party or even coming out for Obama .
The writing is on the wall .
Every knowledgeable insider on either side knows it .
At a time like this , one impulse is to worry or grasp for straws , depending on who you are rooting for .
You might like to speculate on the Bradley effect , in which polls overstate the support for the black candidate .
This effect was never more than 2 - 3 percentage points in the first place , and signs of it disappeared over a decade ago .
You might want to know if cell phone users are undersampled .
Perhaps , but only by a little , and that ’s a population that favors Obama by an even larger margin than the general population .
You might want to know if pollsters ’ likely voter models are off .
This effect is n’t going to be more than a few points , and could well be zero .
All of these potential errors are either negligible or suggest that Obama has more support than polls now state .
In short , the wind is at Barack Obama ’s back .
I currently expect a final outcome of Obama 318-364 EV , McCain 174-220 EV .
The last normal game - shifting point in a national campign is the first debate , which worked in Obama ’s favor .
Of course , it is always possible to imagine an extreme scenario in which the outcome is different .
Recent inflammatory words of McCain and Palin do increase the odds of a tragic event .
But affecting the likelihood of such a freak occurrence is out of your reach .
Making your efforts pay off .
An example of wasted effort at this point is making an additional contribution to either Presidential campaign .
I realize that for some of you , this is a difficult proposition .
If you are already committed to turning out the vote for your candidate , by all means do so .
But if you still have time or money to spare , think about the following argument .
In general , any contribution you make to a strongly leading or trailing candidate makes little difference in the outcome .
It ’s like voting in Massachusetts or Utah : whether you do or do n’t essentially makes no difference in the outcome .
The same is true for campaign contributions .
In the best of worlds , $ 100 to Obama - Biden or McCain - Palin would move the national win probability by an infinitesimal amount .
Even 0.00001 % would be an overstatement .
The place to make a difference is at the margins .
Take the Georgia race , in which incumbent Republican Saxby Chambliss is defending his seat .
In 2002 , Chambliss won office by tarring Vietnam war hero and triple - amputee Max Cleland with an alleged sympathy for Osama bin Laden .
Now Chambliss is fighting for his political life , and is in a dead heat with Democratic challenger Jim Martin .
If you had the choice of driving voters to the polls in Georgia or in South Carolina , you ’d be dead wrong to pick South Carolina .
By the same token , a contribution in Georgia , but not South Carolina , might make a small difference in the outcome .
What your contribution buys .
The outcome of the 2008 campaign determines the size of the working majorities in next year ’s Congress .
Next year , top priorities for any President and Congress will be the war in Iraq , the financial meltdown , health care , and global warming .
It will be an unenviable and enormously difficult task .
If Obama wins , as I expect he will , what he accomplishes will depend critically on how many votes he has in Congress .
Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican , your point of leverage in this process is the Senate , where a minority of 41 can stop a bill from becoming a law .
What I suggest you do .
For all these reasons , I have identified three Senate races as being among the most effective places you can put your effort or money .
This is my advice to everyone , Democrats and Republicans .
The Republican National Committee may be about to act along these lines .
These races may become less competitive .
Others may come into the picture .
But right now they are the best targets , period .
Tonight I ’m donating to my side – Merkley , Franken , and Martin – via my ActBlue page .
Some of you might want to contribute to the other side via the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
I assure you that in either case , the donation will have the maximum possible leverage in what happens in 2009 .
China and Japan bid for more than 100 tonnes of stockpiled elephant ivory from South Africa , Namibia , Botswana and Zimbabwe
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Namibia has sold more than seven tonnes of ivory for $ 1.1 m ( £ 703,000 ) in the first sale of elephant ivory for nearly a decade which began today in southern Africa .
Namibia , along with South Africa , Botswana and Zimbabwe , has been taking part in a UN - sanctioned auction of more than 100 tonnes of stockpiled elephant ivory that is being sold exclusively to Japan and China .
Namibia 's deputy environment minister , Leon Jooste , said three buyers from Japan and three from China bought 7.2 tonnes for a total of $ 1.18 m during the closed - door auction .
" We had nine tonnes on offer , but the remaining 1.8 tonnes will be utilised by local jewellers and carvers , " he said .
The one - off sale was agreed in July at a meeting of the UN body the Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) .
Under the deal , the two countries can bid for up to 108 tonnes of ivory which has been collected from culls and natural deaths and will be used in the traditional ivory carving trade .
Both countries will be monitored by Cites to ensure that companies are not mixing illegally sourced ivory with the legal shipments .
China and Japan are not permitted to export the material , and it is a condition of any sale that money raised will go to conservation projects to support elephants and community conservation and development programmes .
The issue of ivory sales is contentious .
The international trade in elephant ivory was banned by Cites in 1989 , but since then trading has been permitted for certain large elephant populations .
Last week , eBay banned all trading in ivory on its online auction website .
Conservation bodies have warned that sales of ivory could encourage illegal poaching .
The Environmental Investigation Agency 's campaigns director , Julian Newman , said of today 's auction : " Cites ' own comprehensive international monitoring system for tracking illegal elephant products , has shown a steady increase in ivory seizures – driven by a rising demand for ivory .
" This coupled with a lack of sufficient checks in importing countries such as China and instability in some African range states , could easily drag us back to the dark and bloody days of the 1980s when we were seeing around 200 elephants killed by poachers a week . "
The International Fund for Animal Welfare elephants programme director , and former director of Kenya Wildlife Service , Michael Wamithi , said : " Allowing this exorbitant amount of ivory to flood the market , considering the level of elephant poaching occurring today , is just plain irresponsible .
" Developing countries persistently bear the brunt of escalating Asian markets .
By permitting legal trade in ivory , we are only encouraging the laundering of illicit ivory , thereby increasing illegal hunting activities by poachers . "
Chinese authorities were forced to prove that the country had put in place sufficient measures to regulate sales and crack down on the illegal domestic ivory trade before it was approved as a buyer earlier this year .
Japan was already an approved buyer following a one - off experimental sale in 1999 .
This prompted a number of conservation groups to claim that the sale had significantly increased the killing of elephants in Africa .
But Traffic , an organisation founded by WWF and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) that monitors the illegal ivory trade , said there was no evidence of a link between the sale and illegal trading .
The auction will continue until November 8 .

ScreamBody is the first of the series of Wearable Body Organs .
ScreamBody is a portable space for screaming .
When a user needs to scream but is in anynumber of situations where it is just not permitted , ScreamBody silences the user ’s screams so they may feel free to vocalize without fear of environmental retaliation , and at the same time records the scream for later release where , when , and how the user chooses .
Wearable Body Organs Machines influence self - conception , expression , social perception , and perception of responsibility or action .
By accessing and vitalizing the interplay of people and machines through custom interaction design and psychotherapeutic techniques , a social awareness is brought out and individuals are invited to reinvent their own existence .
Wearable Body Organs is a series of very visible , spectacular or carnival even , play - use objects - devices - equipments that both offer context sensitive functionality for their wearer and simultaneously announce their own need for existence by being used in public without being hidden and small as is the trend with consumer gadgets and self - helping devices , hearing aids , PDAs , artificial organs , and colostomy bags .
ScreamBody , CryBody , SleepBody , EatBody , HoldBody , FightBody , HideBody , HouseBody ...
Rather than being hidden and made to go unnoticed , these " products " are designed to be noticed , as this is key in their functionality -- they are social - critical activists .
The wearable apparatuses function as transitional objects - they allow bridges between the person ’s internal experience and the outside world insituations in which the person would otherwise not be able to make that possible .
Each apparatus simultaneously acts to call attention to the social repression addressed by the very need for the existence of the device .
Participants access sensorial energy that has been implicitly or explicitly put to sleep by enculturation .
A bankruptcy filing by even one of the Big Three would probably set in motion a cascade of smaller bankruptcies by suppliers of car parts , as the money the company owed them ( which would be classified as an unsecured claim ) could not be paid until it exited bankruptcy .
And this loss of suppliers would almost certainly overwhelm the other two carmakers .
There would also be a severe contraction in the availability of trade credit from suppliers , which amounts to tens of billions of dollars .
And as surely as day leads to night , bankruptcy proceedings would be followed by liquidation .
In a flash , the American carmaking business , representing about 10 percent of the nation ’s retail sales , would begin to disappear .
For those concerned about the potential price of a federal bailout for Detroit  and I ’m one of them  the reality is that this cost would be dwarfed by the long - term spillover costs of bankruptcy and liquidation .
Nearly three million jobs would be lost in the first year if all three car companies closed and their suppliers absorbed the shock , according to the Center for Automotive Research .
That would mean tens of billions of dollars in pension liabilities would be transferred to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , the federal insurance fund that protects the pensions of nearly 44 million American workers but already has a $ 10.7 billion deficit .
We ’d also see an influx of Americans who have lost their health insurance onto the rolls of Medicare and Medicaid , costing billions of dollars more .
And the budgets of the so - called “ auto states , ” mainly in the Midwest , that depend heavily on the domestic car manufacturing industry would be wrecked , and that would likely lead to both higher taxes and depressed economic growth .
Bankruptcy would also deliver a painful shock to the country ’s already damaged financial system , which draws significant revenue from , and has significant credit exposure to , auto loans .
For the past decade , an average of roughly eight million vehicles made by General Motors , Ford and Chrysler have been sold annually .
That translates into about $ 190 billion in auto financing each year .
Given that the average life of an auto loan is two years , an estimated $ 350 billion to $ 400 billion worth of exposure is thrashing around our financial system .
And the value of this paper would drop along with the value of the cars .

The long reign of trans fats as worst dietary substance may be nearing an end .
Trans fats are still very , very bad , mind you .
But lately , researchers have pointed to a new culprit in the country 's battle with obesity : fructose .
A study published in the new issue of the Journal of Nutrition suggests that one of the reasons people on low - carbohydrate diets lose weight is that they reduce their intake of fructose .
Fructose , a type of sugar found in fruit , can be made into body fat with stunning speed .
The researchers , from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , asked healthy , normal - weight volunteers to consume three different drinks in three separate tests .
The drinks varied in their composition of fructose and glucose .
After a drink , the subjects ate a regular lunch an hour later .
The study found that the process by which sugars are turned into body fat increased when as little as half of the glucose was replaced with fructose .
While glucose passes through the liver , which decides whether to burn it for energy or turn it into fat , fructose hits the ground running .
" It 's basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence , " says Dr. Elizabeth Parks , the lead investigator .
" It 's a less - controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis .
The bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body . "
Fructose consumed in the morning changed the way the body handled food eaten at lunch .
Primed by the earlier fructose , the lunch fat was more likely to be stored than burned , the study showed .
This does n't mean fruit is bad for you .
Fruit has some redeeming values .
But beware of the high - fructose corn syrup added to many processed foods , Parks says .
A study released last month also fingered fructose .
A paper presented at the Endocrine Society meeting by a UC Davis scientist showed that people who ate a diet in which 25 % of their energy came from fructose gained more intra-abdominal fat ( the pot - belly effect ) and had higher triglycerides than people who ate a similar diet in which 25 % of their energy came from glucose .
The author of that study , So Peter Havel , concluded that people with metabolic syndrome should avoid drinking too many fructose - containing beverages .

High - fructose corn syrup is found in many sodas , snacks and processed foods .

Palin Plays Earmark Game Like Champ
Created : September 02 , 2008 12:13 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
PHILADELPHIA —
On the campaign trail , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the designated GOP vice presidential nominee , paints herself as a McCain - style earmark terminator .
At a rally Sunday in O’Fallon , Mo. , Palin made just this claim :
“ In Alaska now , with the budget under control , we have a surplus .
I ’ve never hesitated to protect the wages and the jobs of our people by vetoing wasteful spending .
I ’ve also championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending of Congress .
As the senator said , I told the Congress , ‘ Thanks , but no thanks for that bridge to nowhere .
If our state wanted to build a bridge , we would b ild it ourselves . ’ ”
In the wake of the Jack Abramoff scandal , earmarks have become synonymous with corruption .
Therefore extolling one ’s opposition to them has become fashionable on the stump .
Unfortunately for Palin , she does not point out that as a candidate for governor , she supported the earmark for the so - called “ Bridge to Nowhere . ”
The Washington Post finds that as mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , Palin was perfectly willing to play ball , even going so far as to hire — GASP ! — well - connected lobbyists to ensure her town got a disproportionately large piece of the federal spending pie .
As mayor of Wasilla , however , Palin oversaw the hiring of Robertson , Monagle & Eastaugh , an Anchorage - based law firm with close ties to Alaska ’s most senior Republicans : Rep. Don Young and Sen . Ted Stevens , who was indicted in July on charges of accepting illegal gifts .
The Wasilla account was handled by the former chief of staff to Stevens , Steven W. Silver , who is a partner in the firm .
Palin was elected mayor of Wasilla in 1996 on a campaign theme of “ a time for change . ”
According to a review of congressional spending by Taxpayers for Common Sense , a non-partisan watchdog group in Washington , Wasilla did not receive any federal earmarks in the first few years of Palin ’s tenure .
Senate records show that Silver ’s firm began working for Palin in early 2000 , just as federal money began flowing .
In fiscal 2000 , Wasilla received a $ 1 million earmark , tucked into a transportation appropriations bill , for a rail and bus project in the town .
And in the winter of 2000 , Palin appeared before congressional appropriations committees to seek earmarks , according to a report in the Anchorage Daily News .
Palin and the Wasilla City Council increased Silver ’s fee from $ 24,000 to $ 36,000 a year by 2001 , Senate records show .
Soon after , the city benefited from additional earmarks : $ 500,000 for a mental health center , $ 500,000 for the purchase of federal land and $ 450,000 to rehabilitate an agricultural processing facility .
Then there was the $ 15 million rail project , intended to connect Wasilla with the town of Girdwood , where Stevens has a house .
The Post reports Wasilla — population 6,700 — received $ 6.1 million in earmerks in fiscal year 2002 , compared to $ 6.9 million for Boise , Idaho , which has a population of 190,000 .
In February , Palin submitted a request for $ 200 million in earmarks to the now - indicted Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) .
I ’ve never been to Wasilla .
I do n’t know what its needs are , and some of the projects listed in The Post article seem worthwhile .
It could be that $ 900,000 for sewer repairs is a solid investment for the people of the town .
Others , probably could have used more scrutiny , like the $ 15 - million rail link .
Whatever the case , Palin ’s claim to being an anti-earmark crusader is a bit off .
This also reveals a lot about the philosophies of Sen. John McCain and his running mate .
McCain has taken a hard line against earmarks , and my home state of Arizona ranks dead last in federal “ pork ” spending .
Stevens , and we now know Palin played the game : Alaska ranks first in pork .
Pork is a derogatory , catch - all term that includes a lot of projects , from Woodstock museums and bridges to nowhere to schools and hospitals .
Earmarks are n’t all bad .
Some are genuinely worthwhile , despite being labeled as pork .
I ’m not saying everyone should behave like Stevens .
Certainly , there should be a lot more oversight and appropriations should be evaluated on the basis of merit .
But the reality is that McCain ’s campaign pledge to veto all bills containing an earmark , which sounds great on its face and never fails to get cheers from a town hall audience , would slow the frequently glacial pace of lawmaking to a near stop .
His blanket anti-earmark stance , which has been mimicked by several of his House colleagues , has left Arizona severely underrepresented in Congress .
McCain has long been more prominent as a national figure than he has been in his home state .
His service to his constituents is a major aspect of McCain ’s career in Washington that has thus far escaped hard examination during this campaign season .
It looks like this could be about to change .
Stay tuned .
CANBERRA ( Reuters ) -
An Australian holiday resort will hold a month - long , nude “ anything goes ” party to combat an expected economic downturn , media reports said on Thursday .

“ Tough economic times call for stiff measures , ” Tony Fox , the owner of the White Cockatoo resort in Mossman , in tropical Queensland state , told the Courier - Mail newspaper .
“ It will be a hedonism resort , where anything goes for a month .
It does n’t take rocket science to work out what it means , ” Fox said , naming March as the risque party month .
The controversial “ clothes optional ” resort made headlines three years ago when police were called to end partner - swapping parties after a swathe of public complaints .
“ You ’ve got to wonder what sort of people go and why .
Where is the moral code of behavior and how do you stop jealousies and fights ? ” Cairns Catholic Bishop James Foley said after Fox ’s announcement .
But local regional Mayor Val Schier said she was not opposed to the event as long as no laws were broken .
“ People in tropical north Queensland are extraordinarily creative , ” Schier said .
“ It is tough economic times and as long as it is with consenting adults , then there is no problem . ”
Australia ’s tourism in industry is being hit hard by global economic turmoil with official figures showing a 7.6 percent decline in overseas visitors in September .
Industry leaders expect holiday bookings may drop by up to a third in early 2009 and are planning a new international advertising campaign to coincide with the movie “ Australia ” starring Oscar - winning actress Nicole Kidman .
Fox said his resort was almost fully booked for the month - long rainforest party .

PHOTO GALLERY : New Jerusalem in western Mexico FAITH & REASON : Conscience and the U.S. Catholic voter
This is New Jerusalem , the largest and longest surviving of a string of traditionalist Catholic colonies that have sprung up around the world .
Here , soccer balls and alcohol are forbidden , women are required to wear headscarves , and many people believe the end of the world is just around the corner .
Now , 35 years after its founding , some residents are worried that New Jersualem 's future is in danger .
The Mexican government has broken a long tradition of leaving the town alone , having recently set up a public school and sent in riot police to protect dissidents .
The deaths of the sect's two spiritual leaders this year have left followers divided and confused .
And , perhaps most worrisome , the population has dropped from 8,000 to 3,000 , and is rapidly aging .
" I came here when there were 10 houses , " says Miguel Chavez Barrera , a former church leader who lost his position in a 2006 purge .
" Now , to see it come to this .
…
It 's enough to drive you crazy . "
New Jerusalem is the biggest of the Catholic " holy communities " that were created in the backlash against the Vatican II reforms of the 1960s , says Miguel Leatham , an anthropologist at Texas Christian University who is writing a book about the group .
He says other similar communities exist in Japan , Australia and in the United States in St. Marys , Kan . Visions of the Virgin Mary
The reforms — which allowed Mass in languages other than Latin and urged more tolerance toward non-Catholics , among other changes — were opposed by many priests including Nabor Cárdenas , New Jerusalem 's founder .
He urged his followers to create the town after a local woman , Gabina Sánchez Romero , said she saw the Virgin Mary warning that the Catholic Church had gone astray and the world would be destroyed before 2000 .
Cárdenas appointed himself archbishop , adopted the nickname " Papa Nabor " and presided over Masses in Latin wearing a papal hat and robe .
New Jerusalem preached chastity , discouraged new marriages and advised against having children .
The Catholic Church rejected the sect and stripped Cárdenas of his priesthood .
But the story about the Virgin Mary found an eager audience .
On weekends , thousands of pilgrims arrived by the busload to visit the town 's shrine , drop money in donation boxes and shop .
Many visitors decided to stay — among them Americans from Fort Collins , Colo. , and others from a traditionalist sect in New York City .
" We came because this was the only place in the world where you could actually live in the presence of the Virgin , " says Franklin Gitchier , a former truck driver from Haverhill , Mass. , who settled here with his mother in 1985 .
To this day , New Jerusalem 's residents go to church three times a day and celebrate Mass in traditional Latin , avoid outsiders and eschew government services like schools and clinics .
No TVs , radios , makeup or nail polish are allowed .
Signs , some faded or peeling , warn visitors they are on sacred ground .
" A penitent people for an unrepentant world , " says one .
" This place is unique in all the world , " says church spokesman Gerardo Ruiz .
" It is an ark for those who truly believe . "
Clashes among rivals
However , a series of schisms and purges have slowly been tearing the community apart .
As early as 1982 , one band of faithful set fire to a rival chapel and chased their members from their houses .
Many residents left in the 1990s after the rise of a new " seer , " Agapito Gómez , who mimicked different voices into a tape recorder — including that of John F. Kennedy — and claimed they were messages from the afterlife .
Then , the 2000 deadline for the apocalypse passed .
The church claimed the world was spared because the Virgin Mary took pity on it .
The state finally built an elementary school here last year .
Some church members tried to block the road to prevent construction but eventually relented , principal Armando Mouguia says .
Clashes among rival factions have become even more frequent .
On Sept. 16 , Mexico's Independence Day , scuffles broke out when church followers blocked a parade organized by the dissidents .
On Feb. 19 , Cárdenas died at age 98 .
Gómez , the seer , died on Sept. 26 .
No new visionary has emerged , but the Michoacan government is bracing for another round of conflicts when one does .
" There is a latent risk of violence there , " says Victor Manuel Serrato , president of the state branch of the National Commission on Human Rights .
Meanwhile , the flow of pilgrims , who sustained the church with donations , has slowed to a trickle .
The church 's biggest problem , however , is the town 's aging population , says author Leatham .
Many young men have left to find work .
The entire town still gathers every Wednesday at the shrine for a group meal .
While sharing a pot of chicken with a visitor , Elinda Goll of Clifton , N.J. , recounts the upheavals since she moved here in 1985 .
" The Virgin weeps for this place , " she says .

Okay , so the British passport might be a problem , but he is intelligent , witty , well - travelled , debonair and has a strong support base .
So why not vote for Michael Palin for US president ?
Sure , Sarah Palin has generated a lot of headlines for the Republicans , and put some fizz in John McCain 's campaign , but has he picked the wrong Palin ?
Hundreds of thousands of people have been watching a YouTube video pushing the case for the former Python .
As the Sunday Times notes , you can interpret Palin 's policies from his Python ouvre , such as a stance on the environment : " I'm a lumberjack and I 'm okay . "
While few Americans are sheltered from the jolt of the recent economic crisis , the nation ’s newest veterans , particularly the wounded , are being hit especially hard .
The triple - whammy of injury , unemployment and waiting for disability claims to be processed has forced many veterans into foreclosure , or sent them teetering on its edge , according to veterans ’ organizations .
The problem is hard to quantify because there are no foreclosure statistics singling out veterans and service members .
Congress recently asked the Veterans Affairs Department to find out how badly veterans were being affected , particularly by foreclosures .
The Army , too , began tracking requests for help on foreclosure issues for the first time .
Service organizations report that requests for help from military personnel and new veterans , especially those who were wounded , mentally or physically , and are struggling to keep their houses and pay their bills , has jumped sharply .
“ The demand curve has gone almost straight up this year , ” said Bill Nelson , executive director for USA Cares , a nonprofit group that provides financial help to members of the military and to veterans .
Housing , Mr. Nelson said , “ is the biggest driver in the last 12 months . ”
Congress has recently taken small steps to help , banning lenders from foreclosing on military personnel for nine months after their return from overseas , up from three months , and ensuring that interest rates on their loans remain stable for a year .
Another relief bill to prevent certain injured veterans from losing their homes while they wait for their disability money was signed into law in October .
The protection is good for one year .
“ We owe these men and women more than a pat on the back , ” said Senator John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts , who introduced one of the bills .
In the midst of this epic and monumental election campaign , which I do sincerely hope you go out and vote , the number one issue which is the economy is now fluttering into the abyss at a much quicker pace .
On Monday , automotive sale numbers came out and the numbers were downright shocking .
U.S. auto sales dropped to levels unseen in 25 years .
General Motors U.S. sales are down 45 percent from a year ago while Toyota is down 29 percent .
For those holding out on decoupling coming back that dream may be shattered once again with sales dropping 40 percent in Spain and 19 percent in Italy .
Every major auto manufacturer was impacted with Ford dropping 30 percent and Nissan following 33 percent .
These are across the board collapses .
Later in the article , I will go into the detail of what these numbers mean for the overall U.S. economy .
If that was n’t enough to highlight the sad state of the economy , big ticket flat screen seller Circuit City announced that it will be closing 155 of its 700 stores meaning more job cuts are in the pipeline .
Circuit City has about 43,000 employees and recent estimates are looking at an additional 7,000 job losses .
This is simply another testimony that consumers are tapped out and the silent depression is making its full fledge attack on the consumer economy .
What this also means is people need to get ready to see more folks driving their cars a little bit longer .
What we will also be seeing in the weeks to come is a “ surprise ” drop in foreclosures .
It really wo n’t be a surprise for those that are following the news with Bank of America , JP Morgan , and IndyMac Bank and their great experiment in mass mortgage modifications .
JP Morgan recently announced a moratorium of 90 days on foreclosures on loans targeted for modifications .
Why is this big ?
Well because they now own uber toxic mortgage dealer Washington Mutual that went buck wild here in California with the wonderful Pay Option ARMs .
These are 3 trends to follow in the next 90 days .
Let us dig deeper into the numbers and see what this will mean for the economy .
Beware the Phony Drop in Foreclosures
Nationwide foreclosure filings are still running at a record pace .
We are in the path of a tempest and will see 3,000,000 foreclosure filings this year :
[ click for larger chart ]
As you can see from the chart above , we are clearly running higher than 2007 and still much higher from 2006 .
So why will we see a slight drop in foreclosures ?
Well two of the largest banks JP Morgan and Bank of American will be on a campaign of massive loan modifications .
JP Morgan now the proud of owner of Washington Mutual , Wells Fargo with new baby girl Wachovia , and Bank of America who now owns poster boy of mortgage greed Countrywide Financial .
So what does this effort look like ?
JP Morgan :
$ 70 billion in loans targeted
Potential mortgage pool : 400,000 mortgages
Freezing foreclosures for 90 days to setup process
Bank of America :
Two - tier modification
1st Potential mortgage pool : 265,000 mortgages targeted ( all kinds )
Second - tier modification
2nd Potential mortgage pool : 400,000 subprime and option - ARM customers serviced by Countrywide .
Deal hashed out with 14 state attorney generals .
Wells Fargo :
Potential mortgage pool : Large number of roughly $ 120 billion option ARM pool in portfolio from Golden West purchase by Wachovia in 2006 .
So we ’re talking a large number of loans .
In addition , California recently through SB 1137 recently announced a few more measures lenders will need to go through in order to help borrowers with their loans .
But if recent shenanigans at government run IndyMac Bank are any indication , borrower responses may be low .
You need to remember that a large number of this pool is right here in California .
Washington Mutual has a disproportionately large number of loans here in California especially of the option ARM flavor .
The Golden West lunch special bag of mortgages is largely California based .
Countrywide ?
Oh yeah .
Get the picture ?
This get out the modification effort is largely targeted at the tsunami we ’ve been talking about for over a year which is the $ 300 billion in option ARMs here in California .
Will this work ?
No .
But it ’ll sure make the numbers look a bit better for a few months .
It is an American Right to Have a Plasma in Every Home
Circuit City , the technology store went from having a market cap of $ 5 billion to currently having the market cap of $ 60 million .
If you want to see the collapse of the big ticket consumer economy just take a look at this :
That is a shocking decline .
Year to date the company is down 91 % which of course is n’t saying much now that it is trading under $ 1 .
Yet think about the massive implication here .
Circuit City employs 43,000 people .
What do you think is going to happen ?
More importantly , who is going to go out there and load up on $ 5,000 plasma televisions ?
Not many .
If you think this is strictly a problem facing Circuit City look at big kid on the block Best Buy :
Best Buy is down 47 percent year to date and that is with the recent jump up .
However , you ’ll notice that most of the decline came in September and October .
Why ?
Well first , I think the last bastion of steroid consumer dogma was just shattered during the epic market decline we have recently lived through .
People realize that without easy credit and people having near heart attacks opening up those October 401 k statements , people are not going to be in the mood to load up on expensive technology gadgets .
In economics there is a thing called elasticity .
That is , these stores sell items with elastic goods .
For example , a person can easily forego a $ 4,000 surround sound system and go with the generic Wal - Mart brand for $ 200 .
They ’ll still get sound but not at the quality of the more expensive unit .
They ’ll survive .
Inelastic goods are items such as insulin where someone has no reasonable substitutes in the market .
The consumer will pay whatever price is demanded .
These industries are getting hammered .
But take a look at Wal - Mart and Family Dollar Stores for the year :
Wal - Mart and Family Dollar Stores are up 17 and 40 percent respectively for the year .
Why ?
Well they sell items at lower prices including household goods like food , clothes , and medicine which people will need no matter what .
I have yet to see a study but I am willing to bet that maybe for a brief time , while folks decided to stay away from Best Buy and Circuit City electronics , Wal - Mart goods in this area did well .
Only for a short timeframe as the market adjusted but now , everyone is hurting including higher priced goods at Wal - Mart .
What do you Mean I Ca n’t Trade in my Car ?
There is only one word to describe auto sales .
Pathetic .
The data on this is so stunning that it would have sent the markets down if it were n’t for the world on hold for a historic election .
Let us take a look at the raw and startling data :
Every single area got hammered into the ground aside from one tiny group that barely edged up , small car sales and that is if we look at year to date performance only .
If we go back to October of 2007 sales are down 23 % .
SUV sales are down 53.8 percent across all sizes since October of 2007 .
Large car sales are down 40.6 % from the same timeframe .
Aside from insane oil prices for much of the year , what else contributed to this decline ?
Can it be that Americans are broke ?
That is one factor .
But another factor is the sudden desire for standards in the industry when it comes to loaning money out .
GMAC , the financing arm of General Motors is now requiring a 700 FICO score for MSRP prices :
“ GMAC Leaders and NAO Team :
In light of the disruption in the credit markets , GMAC NAO is announcing a temporary , more conservative purchase policy for retail auto contracts in the United States .
In the short term , we will limit auto contracts to those consumers who have a minimum 700 credit bureau score , with an advance rate equal to or less than dealer invoice .
This means that consumers will be required to make a down payment .
In addition , we will restrict approval of contract terms beyond 60 months , except for those customers qualifying for GM - supported 72 - month incentives currently advertised .
These are extraordinary times , and we must take these prudent steps to focus our resources on high quality retail contracts and critical areas such as dealer wholesale financing , until the credit markets are stabilized .
To assist dealers , GM has enhanced its retail incentive programs in October to utilize more cash incentives .
GM and GMAC will continue to work collaboratively through these challenging financial market conditions .

What do you mean I now need good credit and a down payment to buy a new Corvette ?
Suddenly people are looking for good credit and are coming to realize very few Americans fall in this area .
And those that do have good credit for the most part have it that way since they are financially prudent and not out there buying gas guzzlers !
It is a paradox .
I have to tell you a quick anecdotal story that captures this sentiment .
This weekend I went down to my local Ralphs supermarket for some angus steak .
It felt like a good weekend for a steak and a good Laker game versus the Denver Nuggets .
As I was coming out of the store , there is a local recycling center in the parking lot .
In Southern California , these are all over .
What I could n’t help noticing though was a younger guy pulling up to the center in a brand new Jaguar .
The car was loaded with cans , plastic bottles , and empty beer glasses .
Out come these items from the passenger seat , the back seat , and finally the trunk which was completely full .
Now I ’m all for recycling but this was n’t someone recycling for keeping the planet green .
This was someone looking for the cash it would bring .
And the line was twice as long from normal weekends .
The car was a newer model leased within the past year since the plates had a “ leased at … ” type frame .
And you wonder why homes across the country are defaulting in record numbers .
Only in Southern California folks can you make your monthly Jaguar payment by recycling cans .

ST . PAUL , Minn . –
The city that became a bat­tle­field between police and pro­test­ers , who took to the streets dur­ing the Repub­li­can Nation­al Con­ven­tion ( RNC ) in ear­ly Sep­tem­ber , is now embroiled in a new fight – a legal bat­tle over free­dom of speech and assembly .
" If the police are able to preemptively shut down dissent , people will be afraid to have even simple political meetings , " says Luce Guillen Givins , one of the accused .
In an unprece­dent­ed appli­ca­tion of Minnesota ’s ver­sion of the fed­er­al Patri­ot Act , eight mem­bers of the RNC Wel­com­ing Com­mit­tee , an anar­chist orga­ni­za­tion , each face up to sev­en and a half years in prison for charges of ​ “ con­spir­a­cy to riot in fur­ther­ance of ter­ror­ism ” for their alleged roles in RNC protest activities .
The charges against the eight indi­vid­u­als , now known as ​ “ The RNC 8 , ” fol­low a year­long inves­ti­ga­tion in which the Ram­sey Coun­ty Sheriff ’s Depart­ment , with the help of state and fed­er­al agen­cies , used an under­cov­er agent and two paid infor­mants to infil­trate and col­lect infor­ma­tion on the organization .
On Aug. 30 and 31 , the week­end pre­ced­ing the RNC , the inves­ti­ga­tion cul­mi­nat­ed in a series of pre­emp­tive raids on sev­er­al homes in the Twin Cities that the Amer­i­can Civ­il Lib­er­ties Union and the Nation­al Lawyer ’s Guild ( NLG ) have condemned .
“ The scari­est thing about this is that no one is accused of actu­al­ly doing any­thing , they have been charged with con­spir­ing , ” says attor­ney Jor­don Kush­n­er , an NLG mem­ber who is rep­re­sent­ing defen­dant Luce Guillen Givins .
​ “ What is worse is they are label­ing peo­ple advo­cat­ing tra­di­tion­al civ­il dis­obe­di­ence as ter­ror­ists .
In my opin­ion , the intent of this is to sti­fle people ’s desires to exer­cise their First Amend­ment rights . ”
Accord­ing to the sher­iff department ’s appli­ca­tion for a search war­rant , author­i­ties ini­ti­at­ed an inves­ti­ga­tion on Aug. 29 , 2007 .
Based on pub­licly avail­able infor­ma­tion on the orga­ni­za­tion , police deter­mined there was ​ “ rea­son­able sus­pi­cion ” that the RNC Wel­com­ing Com­mit­tee was plan­ning to engage in ​ “ crim­i­nal activ­i­ty ” in the days lead­ing up to , and dur­ing , the RNC .
Dur­ing the course of the inves­ti­ga­tion , agents placed the RNC Wel­com­ing Com­mit­tee under sur­veil­lance and infil­trat­ed the group .
The pre­emp­tive raids were exe­cut­ed on ​ “ prob­a­ble cause ” derived from infor­mants ’ claims that the homes con­tained incen­di­ary and explo­sive devices , as well as alle­ga­tions that mem­bers had dis­cussed kid­nap­ping del­e­gates and sab­o­tag­ing airports .
Dur­ing the raids , police seized prop­er­ty and jailed eight alleged lead­ers of the RNC Wel­com­ing Com­mit­tee .
They were not charged until Sept. 3 , the day before the con­ven­tion end­ed .
The sec­ond - degree con­spir­a­cy to riot charge car­ries a max­i­mum five - year penal­ty , how­ev­er , the addi­tion­al state Patri­ot Act charge of ​ “ fur­ther­ance of ter­ror­ism ” allows for a 50 per­cent increase in the max­i­mum penalty .
In a Sept. 3 state­ment , pres­i­dent of the Min­neso­ta Chap­ter of the NLG , Bruce Nestor , who was at the scene of the raids , said police found no evi­dence of incen­di­ary or bomb - mak­ing mate­ri­als , and instead seized com­mon house­hold items such as com­put­ers , paint and hatch­ets for chop­ping wood , among oth­er things .
Nestor also not­ed that alle­ga­tions that the anar­chists intend­ed to kid­nap or sab­o­tage air­ports came from paid informants .
“ Based on past abus­es of such infor­mants by law enforce­ment , the Nation­al Lawyer ’s Guild is con­cerned that such police infor­mants have incen­tives to lie and exag­ger­ate threats of vio­lence and to also act as provo­ca­teurs in rais­ing and urg­ing sup­port for acts of vio­lence , ” the state­ment said .
Givins , one of the RNC 8 , says she was n’t sur­prised police cracked down on pro­test­ers , but believes the nature of the arrests has seri­ous implications .
“ If the police are able to pre­emp­tive­ly shut down dis­sent , peo­ple will be afraid to have even sim­ple polit­i­cal meet­ings , ” she says .
Kush­n­er says he fears a return to ​ ’60s - style police infil­tra­tion of rad­i­cal groups .
“ We have n’t seen this kind of police activ­i­ty since the Chica­go 8 , ” he says , refer­ring to the arrest of eight orga­niz­ers dur­ing the 1968 Demo­c­ra­t­ic Nation­al Con­ven­tion in Chica­go .
​ “ What has hap­pened with these crim­i­nal charges is very extreme and dan­ger­ous because peo­ple are being pros­e­cut­ed for polit­i­cal reasons . ”

Dragomir Kovacevich is a New Mexico Democratic
Party activist who lobbies for a green energy economy .
Or at least he was , until last week when stock markets nose - dived and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson hatched a plan to have the government buy bad securities from financial - services firms .
Now , he 's an antibailout crusader , using planned meetings with several organizations , including the Congressional Black Caucus , to denounce the $ 700 billion plan rather than talk up alternative energy .
The biggest flaw , according to Mr. Kovacevich , an economist by training , is that after the government buys up bad securities , there 's a possibility they will lose more value and be bought back , at a discount , by the same firms that caused the problem in the first place .
" There can't be a flip here , " he said .
" This just benefits Goldman Sachs :
They take the money from your sack and put it into their sack . "
Kovacevich joins the swelling ranks of a grass - roots movement aimed at convincing Congress to turn down the Bush administration 's plan .
The movement crosses party lines .
It draws support not only from angry taxpayers but also some economists .
And it is beginning to make itself heard in the halls of Congress .
" If it looks like they bail out Wall Street , there 's going to be a lot of anger , " said a Democratic party staffer in Michigan , who declined to be identified .
Michigan is a key swing state in the presidential election .
Not surprisingly , the movement has found a ready audience online .
" A bailout requires responsible Americans to pay for the acts of greedy bankers , mortgage brokers , flippers , and over - extended home - borrowers , " intones StopTheHousingBailout.com .
AngryRenter.com , backed by a conservative lobbying group run by former House majority leader Dick Armey , claims to have 58,300 signatures for a petition opposing the administration 's plan .
In less than 24 hours after posting his letter to Secretary Paulson outlining an alternative to the bailout , Sen. Bernard Sanders ( I ) of Vermont said he gathered more than 8,000 citizen cosigners .
Among the " netroots " – blogs that cater to Democrats – the sentiment is also overwhelmingly against a simple bailout .
" We 're opposed to rushing into this too quickly , " said Markos Moulitsas , who runs the Daily Kos site .
" We have n't gotten a proper explanation of the problem or how $ 700 billion is supposed to fix it .
We 're supposed to take it all on faith , and we 've been burned way too many times by this administration to take anything they say on faith . "
While many who oppose the bailout do n't have ready alternatives , some observers do have specific proposals .
The object of the bailout plan is as much to reassure the markets as it is to actually buy the bad debt securities , said Milton Ezrati , senior economist at Lord , Abbett & Co. , in Jersey City , N.J .
To that end , another method might have been to do what the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did when Long - Term Capital Management collapsed in 1998 .
The Federal Reserve told banks that they should lend to LTCM and that they would , in return , have backing from the Fed , Mr. Ezrati said .
In this case , the Fed and the Treasury could have told banks to provide credit months ago with implicit backing from the government , he added .
It would not have been as dramatic , but it might have forestalled some of the problems that exist now .
Not everyone in the industry agrees .
" There are 100 options , " said David Kotok , chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors , a money - management firm in Vineland , N.J. " But we do n't have the time to spend a year weighing them . "
While Paulson 's original request for little or no oversight was too much , the focus should n't be on punishing those responsible because the fundamental credit mechanism of the market is broken , he said .
The markets need three things : a lot of money , transparency in the way decisions about that money are made , and a clear process for bailing out institutions .
" Main Street only sees rich people on Wall Street getting help , " he said .
" They do n't understand that the local store gets credit from Wall Street firms . "
That makes transparency in any bailout plan that much more crucial , he added .
The image is hard to shake .
" The same people are still in charge , " Philadelphia barber Mark Endres told the Associated Press .
" They are still sitting back , sipping their lattes , driving their Jaguars . "
The bailout seemed to have mixed public support .
Nearly two - thirds called it the right thing to do in a Pew Research Center survey of 1,003 adults released Tuesday .
But a Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of 1,000 likely voters Sunday found only 28 percent support .
Both surveys found opposition around 30 to 35 percent .
But since then , Congress has gotten an earful from constituents .
Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick ( D ) of Michigan , who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus , said she has been getting calls that are overwhelmingly in favor of holding off on any bailout plan .
" It 's not settled , " she said .
" We know it 's urgent .
But we want it tied to a stimulus package . "
They were n’t all stellar individuals , but in ways large and small , their lives or their deaths had an impact on us all .
May they rest in peace .
The incident was consistent with others , “ in which parents of children whose skin color or ethnicity differs from theirs fell under suspicion . "

An innovative imaging system that uses muons - a type of cosmic ray - to reveal the interior of a volcano has been developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute .
Muons are high - energy elemental particles that result from collisions between cosmic rays and molecules in the Earth 's upper atmosphere .
Hold out your hand and a muon would pass through it about once every second .
Chief Scientist Dr. Kanetada Nagamine of the Muon Science Laboratory at RIKEN ( Japan 's national science research institute ) is big on muons , to say the least .
Opines Nagamine , " If the 20th century was the electron age , the 21st century could be the muon age . "
One might think that 's going a bit far , but the professor knows a thing or two about muons - among other things , he uses them to look inside volcanoes .
" The muons ' ability to penetrate matter depends on their energy , " explains Dr. Nagamine .
" Muons with energies of 100 giga electron volts can pass through 100 meters of rock , and muons with energies of 1 tera electron volts can penetrate 1000 meters into the Earth . "
Based on the wide range of energies , Nagamine 's team designed an imaging system that records hits from muons which pass through a volcano to reach the detector .
A radiograph - style image illustrating the density of the volcano is then gradually created using colors to denote muons of different energies .
Although it takes up to 2 months to create a suitably detailed image , that 's more than enough time for scientists to see magma moving up the throat of the volcano and , if necessary , alert governmental authorities that an eruption may be imminent .
On the lighter side , any concerned homeowners looking to buy volcano insurance may want to chat up Dr. Nagamine first .

There are a million stories cropping up about Plumber Joe Wurzelbacher .
He was mentioned 25 times during the debate , more so than issues like the economy , the war , or social security .
Turns out , JOE DOESN ’T EXIST .
There IS NO JOE Wurzelbacher registered to vote in Ohio .
A simple search reveals no matches to Joe , Joseph or J Wurzelbacher .
You can download the Lucas County , OH voterfile here since it is a matter of public record .
Registered voters with that unique last name are here .
The only near match is a Robert Lee Wurzelbacher .
Neither he nor “ Joe ” have a listing in the Yellow Pages .
A better question might be : why is Robert Wurzelbacher filing for bankruptcy ?
Moreover , is Mr. Wurzelbacher really a “ real , average American ? ”
He does n’t appear to be an average Joe in the slightest .
If we assume Robert Wurzelbacher to be the man calling himself “ Joe ” , Mr. Wurzelbacher has an almost perfect voting record since 2000 .
He has voted in every major general election , two primaries and one special election .
This is NOT your typical , infrequent , independent and undecided voter .
This guy is a high information , highly engaged voter .
I would even call him ACTIVIST in his voting patterns .
ABC seems to think it was a chance encounter between Senator Obama and Mr. Wurzelbacher .
But the facts are beginning to look like it has all been staged .
In fact , some commentators were quick to point out Mr. Wurzelbacher spoke an awful lot like a polished pundit .
So why did Mr. Wurzelbacher have to complete his chat with Katie Couric with a mildly racist ending ?
Here ’s a clip from the debate – they talk about Joe a lot .
Senator Obama met “ Plumber Joe ” in Holland , OH

But the garlic had to be eaten with nothing else and you could n't eat or drink anything else for one hour .
No one believed that it worked until they actually tried it .
They also ( in a time period that I did not tell you * smirks * ) found out if you planted one of the kernels ( they used to think that you had to plant the whole cornstalk ) it grew new ears of corn .
( It passed on to us ! )

The corn cured a rare and deadly disease that was called Asian Flybying Fire & Ice disease .
It had to be cooked the right way and eaten the right way ( It had to be cooked in meat and chewed for a while . ) .
But after that you had to eat a 1/4 cup of garlic .

7:20 pm Mythbusters !!!
Mythbusters are great .
They test myths in very crazy ways ( sometimes normal ways for comparing ) .
They sometimes do wacky myths ( using sound and explosives to fire guns , firing meat for tenderness , using explosives to tenderize meat , using dryers to tenderize meat , paragliding themselves to make a girl fly 6 stories high , which is 60 feet high ) .
I love watching Mythbusters ( 1 Comment | Comment on this )

We looked in crazy places .
( in all of the closets , in all of the shelves , in Vickibee 's incense making room , and under 2 of the beds . )
We finally found it in the laundry .
It was never ever what we expected .
When Sythyry asked me why i put it there , i said i guessed it was clean laundry .

Once up on Tertopermout Mountain , the crazy monster mountain that was a monster itself , there was a extreme crazy human who dared to climb to the horn .
Every time he tried a boulder knocked him down .
But he had another extreme idea .
He would parachute on the horn .
Every time he tried nothing worked .

I no longer recognize marriage .
It ’s a new thing I ’m trying .
Turns out it ’s fun .
Yesterday I called a woman ’s spouse her boyfriend .
She says , correcting me , “ He ’s my husband , ”
“ Oh , ” I say , “ I no longer recognize marriage . ”
The impact is obvious .
I tried it on a man who has been in a relationship for years ,
“ How ’s your longtime companion , Jill ? ”
“ She ’s my wife ! ”
“ Yeah , well , my beliefs do n’t recognize marriage . ”
Fun .
And instant , eyebrow - raising recognition .
Suddenly the majority gets to feel what the minority feels .
In a moment they feel what it ’s like to have their relationship downgraded , and to have a much taken - for - granted right called into question because of another ’s beliefs .
Just replace the words husband , wife , spouse , or fiancé with boyfriend , girlfriend , special friend , or longtime companion .
There is a reason we needed stronger words for more serious relationships .
We know it ; now they can see it .
A marriage is a lot of things .
Culturally , it ’s a declaration to the community that two people are now a unit , and that unity should be respected .
Legally , it ’s a set of rights and responsibilities .
And spiritually , it ’s whatever your beliefs think it is .
That ’s what ’s so great about America .
As a Constitutionally secular nation , or at least in reality a vaguely pluralistic nation , we can all have our own spiritual take on what marriage is .
What ’s troublesome is when one group ’s spiritual beliefs deny the cultural and legal rights of another .
But , back to the point .
They say their beliefs do n’t recognize my marriage , I say my beliefs do n’t recognize theirs .
Simple .
It may seem petty , and obviously the legal part of the cultural / legal / spiritual trilogy is flip - floppy , but it may be the cultural part that really matters .
People get married to be recognized as a permanent couple .
To be acknowledged by friends , family , and strangers as being off the market , in a relationship , totally hooked up , yikes … it ’s impossible to say without saying ‘ married . ’
We wear rings to declare this !
So , we can take this away .
We can refuse to recognize marriage in the cultural sense .
It is totally within our rights , as Americans , to follow our beliefs and recognize or not recognize what we like .
I guess this is a call out to all Americans with beliefs similar to mine .
If you believe that all people should have equal rights , and if you believe that marriage is one of the greatest destinations of a relationship , then perhaps you believe that nobody should have marriage until everybody does .
That ’s what I believe .

Now , you can't help but feel you 're watching an especially lurid episode from Wisteria Lane , as the real - life Sarah Palin fends off rumours of a fake pregnancy - and the accusation that her son is actually her grandson - by revealing that her unmarried 17 - year - old daughter is expecting a baby and will soon marry the father , a young hockey player .
Meanwhile , Palin has hired a lawyer to beat back a state investigation into claims that she abused the power of her office to remove her sister 's ex-husband from his job as a state trooper , a man who has admitted tasering his own 10 - year - old stepson !
Would even America 's trashiest daytime soaps dare squeeze that much action into just the first four days of a new storyline ?
The McCain campaign has done it , thereby achieving in an instant one of its key objectives .
At last people are talking about the Republicans , after months in which all the excitement had been on the other side .
Ever since McCain introduced Palin to a stunned , unprepared political world last Friday , Obama has barely had a look - in .
From conservative talk radio to celebrity gossip websites , there is only one topic : it 's all Palin , all the time .
In these reams of commentary , there is uncertainty about the only question that really matters : how will this saga , and Palin herself , play in the November election ?
Ultimately , will she hurt or hinder John McCain ?
If it 's hard to tell , that 's because almost every new nugget we discover about Governor Palin can be viewed in radically opposite lights .
The " family values " brigade might be shocked by the admission of premarital sex in the Palin clan ; or it might be heartened that young Bristol - even the names sound like they come from a TV soap - has chosen to carry her baby to term and marry the father .
So far , the latter reaction seems to have prevailed , with the Christian right , already smitten by Palin 's anti-abortion , pro-guns , anti-gay marriage stances , standing by its woman .
Some McCain backers have even tried to turn the episode into a net positive : talkshow host Michael Graham wrote yesterday that Palin , with one son off to Iraq , another with Down 's syndrome and now a daughter set to become a teenage mom , had undergone experiences that millions of American women could relate to : " Sarah Palin is as accessible as Obama is exotic . "
Or take what was , until the soap suds started lathering up , Palin 's most obvious weakness : her inexperience .
To political veterans , it 's ludicrous to propose that a 20 - month governor of a state with a population of under 700,000 is ready to take over as president ( not such a remote possibility , given that John McCain is 72 and has a history of cancer ) .
They note that when Palin visited Kuwait last year , she reportedly had to apply for a passport : she had never travelled outside North America before .
How could she possibly be ready to lead the world 's greatest military power ?
But Democrats who make these points risk doing the Republicans ' work for them , falling into the wearily familiar trap of sounding like condescending coastal elitists , who look down their noses at ordinary Americans like the Palins .
The blue - collar Republican base is already wild for the governor : every time they see a New York talking head say how absurd her candidacy is , they 'll like her even more .
Besides , the McCain camp is already hard at work spinning that all this inexperience is a good thing .
It means , they say , that Palin will be a " breath of fresh Alaska air " in stale Washington , an outsider who had already dared take on politics - as - usual in her own state .
Viewed that way , Palin has restored to McCain what always used to be his USP : his status as the reformer , fearlessly standing against the machine .
So she will go into the vice - presidential TV debate against the seasoned senator and foreign policy sage Joe Biden cushioned by subterraneanly low expectations .
If she manages to utter several coherent sentences in a row , it will be declared a draw .
If he so much as looks patronising or if he does an Al Gore - style sigh of impatience , she will be declared the winner .
He 's a bruiser who would have been eager to crush any male opponent .
Now he 'll be holding himself back lest he looks like a sexist pig .
There are some straightforward negatives for Palin that are not susceptible to even the most energetic spin .
It 's not good that she turns out to have been for the notorious " bridge to nowhere " - a $ 400 m project in Alaska that has come to symbolise wasteful , " pork - barrel " spending - before she was against it .
It dents her image as a reformer and shows she flip - flops as much as any other politician .
Not helpful , either , that in the 1990s she was a member of the Alaskan Independence party , which seeks a referendum on breaking away from the US .
The firing of her brother - in - law , and the outstanding request that she give a deposition on the matter , under oath , will linger through the campaign .
And the fact that the McCain camp seems to have started seriously vetting Palin after nominating her , only now sending lawyers and researchers to Alaska , reflects especially badly on McCain himself .
( He met her properly for the first time last week , according to the New York Times . )
It suggests the downside of all that maverick brio is a recklessness that is hardly suitable in a commander - in - chief .
What no one can know is whether that cost will be outweighed by the gains Palin brings , galvanising a socially conservative base that had been previously lukewarm towards McCain .
What we can know already is that this election will share a depressing feature with the contests of the past 40 years : that America will plunge again into the never - ending culture wars .
For Palin cannot help but polarise the electorate .
Everything that liberal , blue - state America can't stand about her makes conservative , red - state America swoon .
It 's not just about " Jesus babies and guns , " as Rush Limbaugh pithily put it .
Palin also wants " intelligent design " - creationism - taught in school .
When she was mayor of the small town of Wasilla , " she asked the library how she could go about banning books , " according to a local official quoted by Time .
Palin was worried about " inappropriate " language .
" The librarian was aghast " - and was later threatened with the sack .
In his stirring speech last week , Obama urged America not to " make a big election about small things " .
Yet here we are , discussing not Sarah Palin 's record or programme but Jesus , guns , and as one feminist blogger put it yesterday , " the uterine activity of her family " .
This is a setback for women , especially in a year that seemed to promise a breakthrough , but it is also a setback for America itself .
Obama made his name four years ago with a speech that called for an end to the civil war of red against blue .
In 2008 , he urged a different kind of election , one that would match the gravity of the hour .
But the naming of Sarah Palin , and the reaction it has provoked , has dashed that hope .
Americans are , once again , fighting over the questions that politics can never really settle - faith , sexuality - and pushing aside the ones that it can .
And which it must .

With a sharp booming sound that sent dozens of people scurrying into the street , much of the first floor of a house in the Sunnyside neighborhood of San Francisco exploded Monday night , shattering the home 's garage and injuring five people .
Luke Konigsmark said he was in the home with several friends and relatives when suddenly , around 7:45 p.m. , the whole house shook with what sounded like a bomb going off on the bottom floor .
" That was the craziest thing that ever happened , " Konigsmark , 19 , said as he stood , dazed , outside the wreckage of his house .
" I 'm in shock .
I just about had a heart attack . "
The two - story , wood - frame house at 108 Congo St. rocked with the impact , and then everyone who could move bolted onto the sidewalk , authorities said .
There , they found that the garage had been turned into a blackened hole littered with splintered timbers , with a small fire blazing in the rubble .
Konigsmark , clutching his 20 - year - old cat Paws in his arms , huddled with relatives in shock as neighbors - who had also run outside - comforted them .
Firefighters quickly arrived and extinguished the flames .
Two men suffered second - degree burns that were not life - threatening , and they were taken to St. Francis Memorial Hospital , authorities said .
Two others , including an elderly woman , were also taken to a hospital .
A 2 - year - old child who was next door was injured by flying glass and treated at the scene .
" We do n't know what it was , but it was a pretty big boom , " said San Francisco police Officer Brian Oliver .
" We had a lot of calls . "
Five houses near the damaged home were evacuated , and authorities roped off the area for the night .
Not knowing if there might be a follow - up explosion , investigators said they would wait until morning light before they went in to inspect the scene .
" We do n't know the cause , " said police Lt. Neville Gittens .
" We ca n't get in to figure it out because it 's too dangerous . "
A source close to the investigation said all possibilities were being examined , from a gas line leak to a bombing .
Konigsmark said he thought the explosion might have been caused by a gas leak because " it happened on the side where the gas line is in the basement . "
He said his 27 - year - old brother , David Konigsmark , was among those injured , and that David was downstairs in a room next to the explosion when it occurred .
Also in the house was David Konigsmark 's son Luciano , 7 , and David and Luke 's brother , 16 - year - old Noah Riccardi .
The brothers ' father , John Konigsmark , said five of his children and one grandson live in the house .
Neighbors along the tree - lined street of tidy bungalows and cottages described the residents of the exploded house as " nice , " but in the shock of the incident did not want to be quoted .
" We do n't know what goes on behind closed doors , " said one neighbor .
" It 's personal and tragic .
I feel really bad for them . "
In Los Angeles and other big cities many people get lost in the concrete jungle of urbanism .
In fact , hundreds of people die alone each year without any human contact with the outside universe .
It is as if they have disconnected from the actual grid of social interaction .
Every year a service in Los Angeles is done with cremated remains of those who have passed away and city workers , with all their abilities try to find ties with potential family members .
You would think that in a technologically advanced age that everyone would have at least one connection to another human in this world .
That is not the case .
The reason I bring up this point is how disconnected we have gotten from one another and how this is simply one additional facet to this economic calamity .
A few years ago I was getting a loan for an investment property .
Nice little place that was out of the state and met my criteria for a good buy and hold rental .
I shopped around for the best mortgage rate and found a place online in Arizona .
The broker I worked with was a good salesman and all the paperwork was done via the phone and e-mail .
Never met the guy .
Got an excellent rate and did n’t even have to show one W - 2 form .
In fact , I could have gotten a loan 5 times as big if my heart desired and that was a scary prospect because it made me realize how little oversight was in the system .
I remember at the time that the broker was trying to push me into an option ARM but I had to explain to him that I strictly dealt with 30 year fixed mortgages .
He was sincere in that he believed what he was trying to sell was truly the best product .
It was more a case of ignorance and lack of future planning .
I think of the $ 500 billion in option ARMs that will be striking down upon this nation in 2009 and 2010 during the worst economic crisis of our lives .
The broker worked for a company that has long ago imploded .
Not sure what he is doing today .
That is the ease in which a decentralized economy has allowed people to eliminate any face to face contact .
Loans were made across the country to people who could have claimed anything on paper .
No one really cared .
Everything was front loaded and long - term planning did n’t matter .
Like the person that passes away alone , usually the city workers find years and years of unpaid bills , QVC bought items that remain unopened , and observations that may seem incredible to the general public .
Yet this is what we have on our hands at the moment .
A decade of hidden bets , horrible investments , and toxic waste is now coming to the surface .
The Mighty are not Immune
Warren Buffet who once stated derivatives were “ financial weapons of mass destruction ” is now facing the wrath of the derivatives market .
It is incredible that the cost to protect against Berkshire being unable to meet its debt payments based on credit - default swaps has more than tripled in two months .
The swaps jumped over 475 basis points from 129 only two months ago .
Berkshire is now down a stunning 43 percent for the year when the previous worst year in its 40 year record was a drop of 6.2 percent in 2001 .
Seeing this massive conglomerate take a near 50 % hit is stunning and a blow to confidence .
If the Oracle of Omaha ca n’t get it right in this market , who can ?
Now , it is n’t that the [ once ] wealthiest man in the world is feeling the pain of the markets but what investments he made to feel the pain .
He holds large stakes in American Express and Wells Fargo who have n’t done well in the current market .
Berkshire ’s income stream largely from insurance holdings is down 77 % .
His public buy of Goldman Sachs led many sheep to the slaughter thinking he saw value in the once Golden boy of Wall Street .
Since that time , Goldman has been cut in half :
We also see the massive banking giant Citi taking a major pummeling in this current market .
It is now trading well in the single digits even after announcing a major job cut of 52,000 for the upcoming months .
It was the second biggest mass job layoff announcement in history .
Take a look at Citi :
This market has no mercy for anyone .
It would appear that the only safe place to be right now is in cash .
Consumers Forced to Save
There is a silent depression hitting the nation that is finally coming to the surface .
That is the life of living on the edge of financial ruin with only one paycheck keeping you liquid .
With unemployment sky rocketing , many people are being forced off that edge in a wave of insolvency .
I think a story that highlights this is how a colleague thought that his home equity line and his credit cards were his “ emergency savings ” and this was his buffer .
If he ever needed cash desperately , he had access to a $ 50,000 home equity line and $ 20,000 in credit cards .
Well guess what ?
WaMu which was the home equity line provider closed his line down here in California since he was now in a negative equity position and his credit cards have been chopped down to $ 5,000 .
In his mind , he has had $ 65,000 in his savings wiped away .
How many others are in this kind of mindset ?
You also do n’t want to count or trust the government completely .
Remember that $ 700 billion TARP plan that was supposedly going to buy toxic assets ?
As it turns out , that never happened .
Much of the funds went as capital injections to banks .
This was n’t the essence of the plan but these people are making it up as they go along .
Ironically , since the bailout bill was passed the market has tanked even further :
A near 3,000 point drop in less than 2 months is a crash .
Was n’t the bailout suppose to stop a crash ?
Are you meaning to tell me that if the bailout did n’t go through the market would be 5,000 points down ?
Consumers unlike the government have to operate in a world of money reality .
They have no access to bailouts .
And people are actually focusing more on servicing current debts :
If you look at the above chart , this is the first significant decline since the early 90s recession .
This may on the surface look like a good sign but all it is showing is the massive contraction in debt but also all the debt destruction via bankruptcies and foreclosures where debt is literally evaporating .
Think of it this way .
You lose your home and go bankrupt and that is all your debt .
You technically have no debt at least on paper .
But would you really claim this person is in good shape ?
Many Real Homes of Genius are hitting the market here in California , in fact every 30 seconds to 1 minute a home is being foreclosed on here in the state .
Job Protectionism
The few remaining doubters keep saying this wo n’t be that bad because we wo n’t see the Great Depression soup lines .
Well what about job fair lines ?
Source : Gawker
Someone sent me the above picture taken from a Monster job fair in New York on Wednesday November 12 .
Normally you would see a sizable line but this time the line curves around the entire avenue block .
People are doing all they can to look for work .
This is merely a reflection of the poor economic landscape .
Maybe it is n’t as powerful as a soup line but you can rest assured many people in that line are distressed .
The climate is such where everyone is on pins and needles worrying about their jobs .
Some rightfully so .
October was horrible but just look at November .
November is already on pace to being the worst month on record this year for the markets and we still have a few days left .
What good news is going to come out ?
Unemployment insurance claims are at 16 year highs which only mean the next job report is going to be brutal .
In addition , many states are cutting budgets back with hiring freezes and also cutting pay for employees .
They are not in good shape .
California is currently in a special session which seems to be going nowhere .
It also does n’t solve next year ’s budget which will be horrific .
Things are grim .
Being protective of your job is a natural and human instinct .
But even many places are seeing over qualified employees vying for retail jobs ( those that are still open ) .
Times are tough and all the data is pointing to tougher times .
Gear up and now you know why people are saying , “ what the TARP just happened ? ”
What just happened is the crony capitalist on Wall Street with their idiotic politicians just suckered you for a nice chunk of change .

The Federal Opposition says the Government 's plans to roll out a national broadband network are looking increasingly like a pipedream .
The tender for the Government 's $ 4.7 billion fibre - to - the - node network closes later this month .
Opposition broadband and communications spokesman Nick Minchin says bidders are frustrated about the lack of detail from the Government .
The project is already months behind schedule and Senator Minchin says that is just one of a litany of problems .
" They 've given no indication of legislative and regulatory arrangements that would be for such a bid , " he said .
" They 're giving no indication whether the $ 4.7 billion they 're talking about of taxpayers ' money is going to be a subsidy , or is it going to be a loan , or are they going to buy shares in the business ?
" Telstra have said they wo n't bid unless the Government gives an indication on the issue of structural separation . "
Senator Minchin says without Telstra 's cooperation , the project will be a disaster .
" Telstra must be part of the scheme because what 's being proposed by Labor is an upgrade of the existing network , " he said .
" So Telstra 's cooperation is essential , one way or the other .
And if they do n't bid at all , it 's hard to see how you can have a realistic bidding process . "
The Opposition says the Government needs to rule out structural reform of Telstra to encourage the telco to be a part of the project .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc will invest $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs Group Inc , in a major boost for the Wall Street bank from perhaps the world ’s best - known investor .
U.S. Investor Warren Buffett laughs during a news conference in Madrid May 21 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Andrea Comas
“ It ’s a vote of confidence which is gold plated , ” said Michael Holland , a money manager at Holland & Co in New York .
“ You do n’t get better than this . ”
Shares of Goldman rose 8.1 percent after the announcement , while Standard & Poor ’s 500 futures gained 15 points .
Goldman also announced plans to sell $ 2.5 billion of common stock .
Buffett is adding Goldman to a portfolio of investments at Berkshire that includes large stakes in a handful of major U.S. commercial banks .
On Sunday , Goldman won Federal Reserve approval to become a bank holding company , giving it easier access to financing and adding to speculation it might buy another bank .
This came after many investors questioned its business model amid this month ’s market turmoil , causing shares to fall 50 percent from their record set last Oct 31 .
“ Goldman Sachs is an exceptional institution , ” Buffett said in a statement .
“ It has an unrivaled global franchise , a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance . ”
Buffett is the second - richest American according to Forbes magazine , and built Berkshire into a $ 199 billion conglomerate by investing in undervalued companies with strong management .
He was not available for immediate comment , according to Debbie Bosanek , who works in his Omaha , Nebraska office .
Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman ’s chief executive , in a statement noted Buffett ’s “ longstanding relationship ” with the company , and called the investment “ a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects .
This investment will further bolster our strong capitalization and liquidity position . ”
SECOND BIG INVESTMENT IN WEEK
Berkshire will buy $ 5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock that carries a 10 percent dividend .
It also will receive warrants to buy $ 5 billion of common stock , or 43.5 million shares , at $ 115 per share , within five years , which could give it a roughly 9 percent stake in Goldman .
Last week , Goldman said it averaged 448.3 million common shares in the quarter ended Aug 29 .
On Sunday , Goldman and rival Morgan Stanley said they would become bank holding companies , enabling them to accept deposits and killing the investment bank model that dominated Wall Street for decades .
The following day , Morgan Stanley said it would sell up to a 20 percent equity stake , worth as much as $ 8.5 billion , to Japan ’s largest bank , Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc .
Goldman and Morgan Stanley announced the investments barely a week after upheavals at the two other major Wall Street investment banks .
Merrill Lynch & Co Inc agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp , while Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy protection .
“ Clearly they are saying that Goldman is not only going to be a survivor , but that it is going to prosper in this new world , ” said Tim Ghriskey , chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills , New York .
Berkshire as of June 30 disclosed stakes in six major U.S. financial services companies : American Express Co , Bank of America , M&T Bank Corp , SunTrust Banks Inc , U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co .
A person familiar with Goldman ’s thinking said the company is not likely to announce deals with these banks .
U.S. Bancorp spokesman Steve Dale and Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment .
The other companies did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
Goldman said on Sunday it intends to expand its deposit base by buying deposits from other banks , including those in distress .
Goldman ’s bank unit had about $ 25 billion in assets and $ 23 billion in deposits , tiny in comparison to its total assets of $ 1.1 trillion at the end of August .
The investment is Buffett ’s second major purchase in a week .
On Thursday , Berkshire ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co affiliate agreed to buy power supplier Constellation Energy Group Inc for $ 4.7 billion .
Constellation took that bid over a higher offer led by France ’s Electricite de France SA .
GOLDMAN TIES
Despite his disdain for investment banking excess , Buffett has publicly praised Goldman investment banker Byron Trott , who helped arrange Berkshire ’s $ 4.5 billion purchase in March of a majority stake in industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings Inc from Chicago ’s Pritzker family .
Goldman also provided financing for Mars Inc ’s planned $ 23 billion acquisition of chewing gum maker Wm Wrigley Jr Co. Berkshire committed $ 6.5 billion to that transaction .
Wrigley shareholders will vote on the merger on Sept 25 .
When Buffett was 10 years old his father brought him to visit former Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg .
And as a young broker Buffett worked with Gus Levy , who later ran Goldman in the 1970s as senior partner .
SALOMON INC
Buffett ’s most famous foray into Wall Street came in 1991 , when he became interim chairman at Salomon Inc to help it clean house following a Treasury market scandal .
Salomon was a major Berkshire investment , but not one of Buffett ’s best .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s a statement on all the financials or the market , ” said Marshall Sonenshine , chairman of Sonenshine Partners in New York , referring to the Goldman investment .
“ He sees Goldman Sachs as a good value where it ’s currently priced .
Remember , he invested in Salomon Brothers in the past , and that was n’t a sign that Salomon was going to start doing well . ”
Buffett may have reason to believe a Goldman investment will fare better , said Anton Schutz , a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester , New York .
“ The valuation is great , and with what the government ’s doing to unfreeze debt markets , it ’s a great time to be buying , ” he said .
Shares of Goldman rose $ 10.10 to $ 135.15 in after - hours trading following the announcement , after closing up $ 4.27 , or 3.5 percent , to $ 125.05 in regular trading .
Recently in the Well blog , Tara Parker - Pope wondered if she has been missing out on beets , which one researcher recently identified as nutritional powerhouses , high in folate , manganese and potassium .
If you , like Ms. Parker - Pope , have never made beets , then yes , you really are missing out .
It ’s easy to love fresh beets , and not just for their nutritional advantages .
Beets have an earthy , hard - to - define flavor like no other vegetable ’s , one reason they so often appear on high - end restaurant menus .
But they 're perfect at home , too , and so this week we 'll be offering some simple ways to prepare them .
Beets are available year - round , but the best time to buy them is June through October , when they are at their most tender .
Look for unblemished bulbs with sturdy , unwilted greens .
In addition to the usual red variety , you may find beautiful golden beets , and pink - and - white striated Chioggia beets .
Unless a red color is important to the dish , either type can be used interchangeably with red beets .

Often purchasers ask that the greens be chopped off .
That ’s a mistake -- the greens bring an additional set of nutrients to the plate , most notably beta - carotene , vitamin C , iron and calcium .
Take your beets home from the farmer ’s market with the greens intact .
Another Google Alert cropped up in our services , but this time it was n’t another article about “ Freedom Fries ” , but – alas – “ French Surrender ” .
As soon as we investigated the link , we discovered that the TMZ Staff from Glendale California thought it would be quite humorous to write some fluffy entertainment story about Britney Spears in France and bash the French at the same time .
The headline was vulgar and blunt : Brit Performs , French Surrender .
We immediately posted a note in their comment section which read as follows : “ Very disappointed by TMZ ’s French Bashing .
By referring to the 1940 surrender to describe some pop culture news , TMZ is showing utter contempt and disdain for a people and their history .
To the French , the 1940 surrender is as funny as 9/11 is to Americans .
Please show some cultural understanding the next time you wish to write something about France or the French . ”
We added for good measure a quote by Edward C.Knox .
Within hours , our comment was removed .
Was it the mention of 9/11 ?
TMZ can dish it out certainly , but can they take it ?
It seems not .
These cowardly writers believe they can vilify and trash the French anytime they want , but when faced with the ugliness of their words , they censor .

Hot dog !
A picnic in orbit .
Astronaut Donald Thomas , a native of Ohio , had an extra spicey time in Outer Space aboard U.S. shuttle Columbia in April 1997 .
He packed a can of Tony Packo Hot Dog Sauce .
He also took along Stadium Mustard .
The astronaut says he became hooked on that particular sauce during a 1996 dinner at Tony Packo's Cafe in Toledo , Ohio .
The cafe has a tradition of asking celebrity guests to autograph a hot dog bun .
Thomas is from Cleveland Heights and a promoter of all things Ohio .
Like all astronauts , he was allowed to pack a few extra items in his kit bag .
He decided to take along the hot dog sauce and mustard .
Astronaut Thomas was the first astronaut to request Stadium Mustard .
Now , the brand name Stadium Mustard used at Cleveland Stadium advertises itself on the Web as , " The mustard that 's requested on space shuttle missions ! "
Owner David Dwoskin , who first ate the mustard on three hot dogs in Cleveland Stadium at age 12 , says his mustard has been served at that stadium for more than 50 years .
Stadium Mustard flew with Astronaut Thomas aboard shuttle Discovery from July 13 - 22 , 1995 , and on shuttle Columbia from April 4 - 8 , 1997 .
I know there ’s a lot of talk in Republican circles that Sarah Palin is going to be the star , the new face of the GOP in the post - Bush , post - McCain era .
And this speculation has been goosed by Palin ’s own hints that it ’s full speed ahead with Palinism on the national stage if she and McCain fall short on Tuesday .
But for me the whole idea has never really added up .
I ’m certainly not the target audience .
But my own sense is that Palin ’s appeal is uniquely and paradoxically tied to the dynamics of this particular election — an election in which Republicans are expecting , rightly or wrongly , to be beaten decisively and the most aggrieved are uniquely drawn to Palin ’s bright eyed and unapologetic appeal to resentment and victimology .
As I think Noam Scheiber said a week or two ago , Palin is the first Republican presidential or vice - presidential since Richard Nixon to so genuinely appeal to the politics of resentment .
Sure , the Bushes and McCain have played to it .
But either economically or socially or both , these men were all to - the - manor - born — elites who ’ve lived their whole lives on greased rails .
To use a different analogy I think Palin ( and perhaps Joe the Plumber too ) appeal to the brainstem of conservatism , where the most primitive and persistent impulses are registered , even as the areas of higher reasoning and cognition ( frontal lobes and all that ) are flat - lining or tracking into oblivion .
Even a week or so back a poll of Republicans found that Palin came in third behind Romney and Huckabee in their choice for a 2012 nominee .
The conventional wisdom seems to be that only the conservative ‘ intellectuals ’ have a beef with Palin .
But I ’m pretty sure the post- election view is going to seem very different .
The chatter out of the McCain campaign only confirms what her two months on the public stage has made painfully clear .
Palin was n’t simply unprepared for intense scrutiny of a national campaign .
The woman is an ignoramus of almost unprecedented magnitude in the annals of national politics .
It ’s not just that virtually every - non - Republican has a negative view of her .
I just do n’t see a national party getting behind someone like that .
And before you snark , “ What about George Bush ? ”
Sorry but there ’s no comparison .
Whatever else I think of him , he ’s not a moron .
And while he appears to be astoundingly incurious , there ’s simply no comparison to Palin .
I guess I could imagine a rump Republican party nominating Palin .
It could be Palin with perhaps Mark Levin as veep to nail down the all important angry , middle - aged DC Jewish male , right - wing ravanchist vote and Joe the Plumber to run her Phalangist paramilitary .
But my strong hunch is that if McCain loses tomorrow that will be the end of Sarah Palin ’s national political career even if there are some persistent twitches and jerks over the coming months .
The U.S. government has approved the first noninvasive brain stimulator to treat depression – a device that beams magnetic pulses through the skull .
If it sounds like science - fiction , well , those woodpecker - like pulses trigger small electrical charges that spark brain cells to fire .

Yet it does n’t cause the risks of surgically implanted electrodes or the treatment of last resort , shock therapy .
Called transcranial magnetic stimulation or TMS , this gentler approach is not for everyone .

" We ’re opening up a whole new area of medicine , “ says Dr. Mark George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston , who helped pioneer use of TMS in depression .
" There ’s a whole field now that ’s moving forward of noninvasive electrical stimulation of the brain . “
While there ’s a big need for innovative approaches – at least one in five depression patients is treatment - resistant – the question is just how much benefit TMS offers .

The FDA cleared the prescription - only NeuroStar based on data that found patients did modestly better when treated with TMS than when they unknowingly received a sham treatment that mimicked the magnet .
It was a study fraught with statistical questions that concerned the agency ’s own scientific advisers .
For a more clear answer , the National Institutes of Health has an independent study under way now that tracks 260 patients and may have initial results as early as next year .
Quantifying the benefit is key , considering the price tag .
TMS is expected to cost $ 6,000 to $ 10,000 , depending on how many treatments a patient needs , says Dr. Philip Janicak of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago , who helped lead the NeuroStar study .
That ’s far more expensive than medication yet thousands of dollars cheaper than invasive depression devices .

Neuroscientists have been using TMS for years as a research tool in brain studies .
Zap a powerful magnet over a certain spot on the head – where motion is controlled – and someone ’s arm can suddenly , involuntarily , lash out .
Beyond the " wow “ factor , magnetized pulses were triggering brain activity .
The question was how to harness that activity in a way that might improve disease .
TMS also is being studied in stroke rehabilitation and other brain disorders .
" Nobody thought this would work ; it was a crazy idea .
I had to do it at 6 in the morning before the real scientists came in , “ South Carolina ’s George laughs as he recalls work he began in 1993 .

But , " the brain is an electrical organ , “ George adds , explaining the rationale .
" Electricity is the currency of the brain .
It ’s how the brain does what it does . “
For depression , psychiatrists aim the magnet at the left front of the head , the prefrontal cortex .
Since everyone ’s brain is different , they first zap the top of the head to find a patient ’s motor - control region , and then carefully move 5 centimeters forward .
Then , the NeuroStar beams about 3,000 pulses a minute during a 40 - minute treatment , done about five times a week for up to six weeks .
The theory : Stimulating brain cells in the prefrontal cortex triggers a chain reaction that also stimulates deeper brain regions involved with mood .
TMS did prove to be very safe : Patients in the NeuroStar study suffered no seizures or memory problems like shock therapy can cause , or other reactions throughout the body .
The chief complaint from the sessions was headaches .
The FDA cleared the device after focusing just on a subset of the patients initially enrolled – 164 who had failed one antidepressant during their current bout of depression , not those who were more severely treatment - resistant .
What ’s a modest benefit ?
About 24 percent who got TMS scored significantly better on standard depression measures after six weeks , compared with 12 percent who got the sham , says Janicak .
That ’s about as well as patients respond to a single antidepressant , he says .
Some reported remarkable improvement .
Anzeige
" One day it was like a light switch went off , “ says Steve Newman , 60 , of Washington , D.C. , who enrolled in the NeuroStar study at the University of Pennsylvania in 2005 .
Newman had suffered repeated bouts of depression since he was a teenager , and drug after drug barely blunted it .
He was considering shock therapy when he heard about TMS .
After two weeks of treatment , Newman was wondering if he was getting the sham – when suddenly , he started feeling lots better , and doctors spotted a corresponding major improvement in his depression measurements .
" I was awake .
I was there , “ says Newman who said he still gets what he calls a " maintenance dose “ of TMS about once a month .

KANSAS CITY , Kansas ( CNN ) -- Army Spc. Jeremy
Hall was raised Baptist .
Army Spc. Jeremy
Hall , who was raised Baptist but is now an atheist , says the military violated his religious freedom .
Like many Christians , he said grace before dinner and read the Bible before bed .
Four years ago when he was deployed to Iraq , he packed his Bible so he would feel closer to God .
He served two tours of duty in Iraq and has a near perfect record .
But somewhere between the tours , something changed .
Hall , now 23 , said he no longer believes in God , fate , luck or anything supernatural .
Hall said he met some atheists who suggested he read the Bible again .
After doing so , he said he had so many unanswered questions that he decided to become an atheist .
His sudden lack of faith , he said , cost him his military career and put his life at risk .
Hall said his life was threatened by other troops and the military assigned a full - time bodyguard to protect him out of fear for his safety .
Watch why Hall says his lack of faith almost got him killed »
In March , Hall filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , among others .
In the suit , Hall claims his rights to religious freedom under the First Amendment were violated and suggests that the United States military has become a Christian organization .
" I think it 's utterly and totally wrong .
Unconstitutional , " Hall said .
Hall said there is a pattern of discrimination against non-Christians in the military .
Two years ago on Thanksgiving Day , after refusing to pray at his table , Hall said he was told to go sit somewhere else .
In another incident , when he was nearly killed during an attack on his Humvee , he said another soldier asked him , " Do you believe in Jesus now ? "
Hall is n't seeking compensation in his lawsuit -- just the guarantee of religious freedom in the military .
Eventually , Hall was sent home early from Iraq and later returned to Fort Riley in Junction City , Kansas , to complete his tour of duty .
He also said he missed out on promotions because he is an atheist .
" I was told because I can't put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops I would n't make a good leader , " Hall said .
Michael Weinstein , a retired senior Air Force officer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , is suing along with Hall .
Weinstein said he 's been contacted by more than 8,000 members of the military , almost all of them complaining of pressure to embrace evangelical Christianity .
" Our Pentagon , our Pentacostalgon , is refusing to realize that when you put the uniform on , there 's only one religious faith : patriotism , " Weinstein said .
Religious discrimination is a violation of the First Amendment and is also against military policy .
The Pentagon refused to discuss specifics of Hall 's case -- citing the litigation .
But Deputy Undersecretary Bill Carr said complaints of evangelizing are " relatively rare . "
He also said the Pentagon is not pushing one faith among troops .
" If an atheist chose to follow their convictions , absolutely that 's acceptable , " said Carr .
" And that 's a point of religious accommodation in department policy , one may hold whatever faith , or may hold no faith . "
Weinstein said he does n't buy it and points to a promotional video by a group called Christian Embassy .
The video , which shows U.S. generals in uniform , was shot inside the Pentagon .
The generals were subsequently reprimanded .
Another group , the Officers ' Christian Fellowship , has representatives on nearly all military bases worldwide .
Its vision , which is spelled out on the organization 's Web site , reads , " A spiritually transformed military , with ambassadors for Christ in uniform empowered by the Holy Spirit . "
Weinstein has a different interpretation .
" Their purpose is to have Christian officers exercise Biblical leadership to raise up a godly army , " he says .
But Carr said the military 's position is clear .
" Proselytizing or advancing a religious conviction is not what the nation would have us do and it's not what the military does , " Carr said .
The U.S. Justice Department is expected to respond to Hall 's lawsuit this week .
In the meantime , he continues to work in the military police unit at Fort Riley and plans to leave as soon as his tour of duty expires next year .

A new Pew survey indicates what many of us have long suspected :
The Internet is now a “ major source ” of campaign news .
Many more Americans are turning to the internet for campaign news this year as the web becomes a key source of election news .
Television remains the dominant source , but the percent who say they get most of their campaign news from the internet has tripled since October 2004 ( from 10 % then to 33 % now ) .
While use of the web has seen considerable growth , the percentage of Americans relying on TV and newspapers for campaign news has remained relatively flat since 2004 .
The internet now rivals newspapers as a main source for campaign news .
And with so much interest in the election next week , the public ’s use of the internet as a campaign news source is up even since the primaries earlier this year .
In March , 26 % cited the internet as a main source for election news , while the percentages citing television and newspapers remain largely unchanged .
This image shows NASA ’s Phoenix Mars Lander ’s solar panel and the lander ’s Robotic Arm with a sample in the scoop on June 10 , 2008 .
The image was taken just before the sample was delivered to the Optical Microscope .
This view is a part of the " mission success " panorama that will show the whole landing site in color .
NASA 'sPhoenix Mars Lander is clinging to life and communicating daily with missioncontrollers though its power supply is quickly diminishing .
Phoenix has communicated with missionscientists everyday since Oct. 30 , when the spacecraft suddenlywent quiet after a drop in available power sent it into an inactive ? " safemode . "
Thespacecraft is now in its sixth month on the Martian surface - double itsinitial mission - sincelanding on the red planet 's arctic plains on May 25 .
Phoenix has beenscooping up samples of Martian dirt and the rock - hard , subsurface layer ofwater ice at its landing site and analyzing them for signs of past potentialhabitability .
Phoenix is nearing the end of its mission as the fraction of the day the sun spends above thehorizon shrinks at its arctic landing site .
Dust raised by a storm last week , which contributed to Phoenix 's shutdown , continues to block some of the littlesunlight reaching the spacecraft .
Informationreceived by NASA over the past weekend shows that Phoenix is running out ofpower each afternoon or evening , but reawakening after its solar arrays catchmorning sunlight .
" Thisis exactly the scenario we expected for the mission 's final phase , though thedust storm brought it a couple weeks sooner than we had hoped , " saidPhoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , Calif .
" We will be trying to gain some additional scienceduring however many days we have left .
Any day could be our last . "
Missionengineers at JPL and at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver , Colo. , are attempting this week to send commands to be stored in the Phoenix ?s flash memoryfor science activities to be conducted when the lander wakes up each day .
" Weatherobservations are our top priority now , " said Phoenix PrincipalInvestigator Peter Smith .
" If there 's enough energy , we will try to getreadings from the conductivity probe that has been inserted into the soil , andpossibly some images to assess frost buildup . "
Phoenix finished scoopingup dirt and ice samples late last month .
The team filled one of the fourremaining unfilled ovens on the lander 's Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) , which bakes the samples and analyzes their composition .
Two more ovenswere closed without samples for background measurements and one was leftunfilled , Smith told SPACE.com in an email .
The teamtried to use the lander 's robotic arm to push a sample that was stuck into thewet chemistry lab , but it did n't go in , Smith wrote .
Katrina Spears , a self - described internet medium , was running errands Sept. 30 , the day the Dow plummeted 770 points .
" When I got home that day , I had messages from 30 clients , " Spears says .
While it does n't take a psychic to see that tough times lay ahead for the economy , online practitioners of the divination arts say they 're seeing a marked sift in the questions posed by their clientele , with anxious consumers increasingly asking what 's in store for them financially in the months ahead .
Believers who normally seek psychics for advice on a cheating spouse are now asking whether a pink slip is in their future , and internet psychics across the board saw a spike in traffic in the days following the initial market crash .
The boom in superstition is a predicable response to troubling times , says Columbia Business School professor Gita Johar , who 's studied the phenomenon .
" If the future is uncertain , people turn to psychics , " Johar says .
Consumers tend to embrace the supernatural when confronted by stress , combined with uncertainty .
" You have an illusion then that you can then control the outcome .
People want the illusion of control . "
Spears is one of many self - described psychics , empaths and mediums who make a living giving online readings by instant message or phone on sites such as LivePerson.com and AT&T's Keen.com .
Spears performs readings by online chat for $ 2 to $ 3 a minute , and says that since September she 's been talking almost exclusively with Americans who are concerned about their economic futures .
" People ask if they are going to lose their house or if they are going to find a job soon , or am I going to be laid off , " says Spears ,
" Usually I can give some time frames , and for some people , it is clearly ' yes , ' " Spears says .
" I can tell them if another job is coming and a time frame for when they will get another job . "
Hourly rates for online psychics typically range from $ 100 to $ 1,000 per hour , but those steep rates have n't seemed to deter the monetarily anxious from reaching out .
Another IM reader , Pure Empathy , says his business has soared since the economic downturn .
He charges $ 2 a minute and says he gives away lots of free time .
" It 's really starting to pick up , " he says .
" People are more depressed , and I can easily make $ 150 to $ 200 a day . "
" Finances are coming up a lot more lately , " he adds .
" People want to know when their finances are going to get better .
I tell them I do n't see it happening until middle of next year � we are going to have a long down period . "
But not all psychics are having bullish times in a bear market .
Amaya Elliot , an intuitive and spiritual consultant who also does IM readings via Live Person , says her business has already entered its own recession :
It 's off 50 percent from months ago .
This time last year Elliot � also known as Autumn Dancing Heart � charged a higher rate and made a " fairly nice living " off four to eight sessions a day .
The drop - off is a bit unusual , though , according to Elliot who has been reading professionally since 1999 .
" Usually in times of crisis � war and usually in economic crisis � business picks up , " Elliot says .
" Not this time . "
Elliot might take some solace in Spears ' reading of the U.S. economy .
" Things will improve in March , April and May and start progressing from there , " Spears says .
" We are not about to go into a holy war that means everyone will have to eat rice and beans for the rest of our lives .
But it is back to basics , and people wo n't shop as much . "
Spears also says that her initial spike of new business has declined , but that her American clients remain economically worried .
" Things are back to normal , " Spears says .
" I have several clients in Australia and for them every day is the same as usual , but people in the U.S. are stressed about jobs and the economy . "
All three say their job is n't just about making future predictions , it 's also about giving good advice and listening to people 's concerns .
" I answer all of my questions using my cards or gifts , but I make sure to tell them to use common sense in spending , to not quit a job that is a sure pay until another job is secured , and to make sure to use a budget and stick to it as best they can , " Elliot says .
" I also remind them that readings are entertainment and not a necessity , to keep in mind the things that are wants and the things that are needs . "
Sometimes people ask the obvious , according to Spears .
" Sometimes a person asks what does that person feel about me , " Spears says .
" If he does n't call you in four weeks , that tells you other things are on his mind , and you are not it . "

It is hard to spot what happened this year in the peanut butter aisles of local supermarkets .
But a careful look at the jars of Skippy on the shelves may reveal a surprise .
The prices are about the same , but the jars are getting smaller .
They do n’t look different in size or shape .
But recently , the jars developed a dimple in the bottom that slices the contents to 16.3 ounces from 18 ounces -- about 10 % less peanut butter .
The only way to know you are buying less is to look at the weight on the label and recognize it ’s lighter than before Unilever , owner of the Skippy brand , switched out containers .
Advertisement
Across the supermarket , manufacturers are trimming packages , nipping a half - ounce off that bar of soap , narrowing the width of toilet paper and shrinking the size of ice cream containers .
Often the changes are so subtle that they create “ the illusion that you are buying the same amount , ” explained Frank Luby , a pricing consultant with Simon - Kucher & Partners of Cambridge , Mass .
To shoppers it may seem like getting less , but companies say cutting quantity is a common way to avoid raising prices .
It ’s an age - old dilemma for manufacturers juggling prices , container sizes and profits -- at the same time coping with rising prices for ingredients and greater competition on supermarket shelves .

At international food giant Unilever , “ we have chosen to reduce package sizes as one of our responses ” to rising commodity and business expenses , said spokesman Dean Mastrojohn .
He said the new smaller sizes are clearly marked on labels .
Shoppers understand the manufacturers ’ dilemma but also say they feel deceived at times .
Kathy Yukl of La Crescenta says she ’s tired of going to the store and finding dimples in the bottoms of jars -- she buys Skippy only when she has a coupon .
She is annoyed that containers that once held half a gallon of ice cream , or 64 ounces , now have only 48 ounces .
And she ’s frustrated that cereal boxes are shrinking .
“ What these companies do n’t realize is that their chronically deceptive marketing ploys tell us loud and clear that we absolutely cannot trust them for anything , ” Yukl said .

Other shoppers agree .
“ I think the whole thing is deceitful , and yes , it does irritate me , and I do feel they are tricking the consumer , ” said Bill Stone of Long Beach .
“ This practice , however , has been going on for many years and apparently the manufacturers feel it is to their advantage to try to slip these changes by the customer rather than announcing it . ”
Asked whether the new packaging is deceptive , Mastrojohn said only that the lower weight is clearly listed on the package .
Unilever also changed the shape of its Breyers ice cream containers , reducing the contents to 1.5 quarts from 1.75 quarts .
Competitor Dreyer ’s Grand Ice Cream did the same , shortening its carton .
Reducing the size of the Dreyer ’s and Edy ’s Grand Ice Cream cartons was not an easy decision , spokeswoman Kim Goeller - Johnson said .
Advertisement
“ We understand that consumers do n’t like to pay the same price for a smaller container , ” she said .
But the division of food giant Nestle had seen large increases in the cost of milk , cocoa , sweeteners and energy during a period when the average price of ice cream had “ not really changed much , ” she said .
“ We looked at raising prices to cover these costs , but at some point it just does n’t make sense to raise prices too high .
. . .
The ongoing feedback from our customers is that they are n’t ready to pay $ 7 or more for a carton of ice cream , ” Goeller - Johnson said .
In June , Kellogg Co. reduced the weight of many popular cereals -- including Cocoa Krispies , Corn Pops , Apple Jacks , Froot Loops and Honey Smacks -- an average of 2.4 ounces per box to offset rising grain and energy expenses .

The reduction would n’t be obvious to shoppers walking down the cereal row .
From the front , the size of the box remains the same ; only the depth was reduced , Kellogg told The Times .
Dial shaved its soap bars to 4 ounces from 4.5 ounces but kept the size and look of its packaging the same , spokeswoman Natalie Violi said .
Dial did n’t want to increase the price of its soap but needed to do something to maintain its profits because of the skyrocketing cost of tallow .
Made from beef and chicken fat , tallow is one of the primary raw materials of bar soap .
Its price has doubled over the last 18 months , in part because of increased demand for it as a component of biodiesel fuel , Violi said .
Consumers are confronting similar packaging changes in the toilet paper aisle .

In its promotional materials , the Quilted Northern brand likes to talk about its history of innovation .
In the 1920s , it was among the first bath - tissue brands to be sterilized .
Quilted Northern went “ splinter - free ” a decade later and upgraded to two layers in the 1960s .
This year ’s innovation was to shave half an inch off the width of its Ultra Plush product .
Quilted Northern owner Georgia - Pacific said the savings allowed it to make the tissue three - ply instead of two , but it means consumers are getting fewer square inches of paper .
Shoppers on the candy aisle will find that the formerly 8 - ounce Hershey ’s chocolate bar is now 6.8 ounces , a 15 % reduction .
Luby , the pricing consultant , said the move allowed Hershey ’s to keep the price from rising above 99 cents .
The company worries that crossing the $ 1 threshold could hurt sales , he said .
Advertisement
Many of these changes were made when food commodity and oil prices were surging to record highs .
It ’s not clear what the companies will do now that the cost pressures have eased .
Oil has fallen from more than $ 145 a barrel in July to about $ 61 now .
Wheat futures are down from $ 12.82 a bushel in March to $ 5.21 now .
They ’re not likely to go back to the larger sizes because of the expense involved in changing packaging .
And they are not interested in setting off a price war with competitors , Luby said .
“ If the focus is on profit , food companies would be better off accepting flat volume or even a slight loss in market share in their more stable , mature products in order to make money , ” Luby said .
The big question is whether consumers who notice they are getting less for their money will stop buying the product .
Any backlash is likely to be small , Luby said .
Advertisement
“ Many people notice the change but they do n’t protest and stop buying their favorite brand of cereal , ” he said .
“ These brands are strong enough to overcome any backlash . ”
Stone , the shopper from Long Beach , agreed .
“ If it is an old favorite , maybe from a highly reliable source , you will probably continue to buy it , especially if the price has not changed , ” he said .
“ In the case of bathroom tissue , one has to have a decent - quality product or else your hand goes right through it , and no one really wants that . ”

November 18 , 2008 from the source ; Standing on the back deck using the house for wind protection , a severe storm was captured on video from The Gap , Brisbane , Queensland , Australia .
And now for some good news .
Last May , White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten instructed federal agency heads to make sure any new regulations were finalized by Nov. 1 .
The memo did n’t spell it out , but the thinking behind the directive was obvious .
As Myron Ebell of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute put it : “ We ’re not going to make the same mistakes the Clinton administration did . ”
... But that strategy does n’t account for the Congressional Review Act of 1996 .
The law contains a clause determining that any regulation finalized within 60 days of congressional adjournment — Oct. 3 , in this case — is considered to have been legally finalized on Jan. 15 , 2009 .
The new Congress then has 60 days to review it and reverse it with a joint resolution that ca n’t be filibustered in the Senate .
In other words , any regulation finalized in the last half - year of the Bush administration could be wiped out with a simple party - line vote in the Democrat - controlled Congress .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
By choice or by force , more U.S. consumers are putting away their credit cards as the financial crisis reshapes attitudes toward spending and debt .
A credit card transaction in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
Wal - Mart Stores Inc WMT.N noticed that customers were pulling out the plastic less and less this year as the financial turmoil intensified .
The world 's biggest retailer said the portion of transactions using credit cards was falling after three consecutive years of double - digit gains .
“ Customers have maxed out on their credit limits , ” Eduardo Castro - Wright , the head of Wal - Mart ’s U.S. stores , said at a recent conference .
“ They ca n’t use ( credit cards ) more . ”
A survey on U.S. holiday shopping intentions , conducted for Reuters by America ’s Research Group , found that 60 percent of shoppers plan to use credit cards less this year to buy gifts .
Some of that reflects efforts by banks to clamp down on credit lines , but it is also a symptom of rising anxiety among consumers worried about how to survive a recession .
By definition , credit lets consumers smooth out their spending by borrowing against future income .
When confidence is running high , appetite for debt increases , and when the mood turns pessimistic , demand for credit dives .
The latest borrowing binge was likely exaggerated because it coincided with the housing bubble .
Rising real estate values fostered a sense of economic security that is now deflating faster than home prices .
BACK TO BASICS
“ The consumer has completely lost confidence in the future , ” said Richard Hastings , consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities LLC .
“ They do n’t want to make long - term financial commitments . ”
First , consumers cut spending on homes , which usually come with a 30 - year commitment otherwise known as a mortgage .
Then came cars , typically financed over five years or so .
Now the pullback is spreading to all but essential goods .
In October , for instance , U.S. retailers ’ sales fell a record 2.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 363.7 billion -- the largest drop since this series began in 1992 , the Commerce Department said .
In comparison , September ’s U.S. retail sales slipped a revised 1.3 percent .
That ’s ominous for the economy at home and abroad .
The American consumer ’s spending accounts for two - thirds of U.S. economic growth and has been one of the most reliable engines of world growth for the past decade .
So when the U.S. consumer puts the wallet away , it reverberates around the world .
Not only are American retailers hurting , but U.S. data released on Thursday showed that both imports and exports fell sharply in September .
The World Bank thinks global trade will drop next year for the first time since 1982 .
A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT
U.S. households have accumulated an additional $ 8 trillion in debt since 1998 , bringing the grand total to $ 14 trillion , according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Federal Reserve .
As banks grow wary of extending more credit , that may prove to be the high - water mark for many years to come .
While much of that pile of debt is made up of mortgages , credit card usage also jumped toward the tail end of the housing boom .
Now it is slowing .
JPMorgan economist Joseph Lupton expects consumer credit to contract by 8 percent in the coming year .
That will hit lower - income consumers particularly hard .
“ In light of the weak labor market as well as falling share and home prices , the credit card is for many households the only chance to maintain current consumption , ” said Harm Bandholz , an economist with UniCredit in New York .
Among the 20 percent of households with the lowest income , credit card debt equals about a quarter of income , he said .
For the wealthiest quintile , it is around 3.5 percent .
The delinquency rate on credit cards rose to 4.9 percent in the second quarter of this year , according to Federal Reserve data , the highest since the first quarter of 2002 when the economy was recovering from the last recession .
The percentage of credit card debt that banks have written off is even higher at 5.47 percent , and that figure will likely rise in the coming quarters .
Deutsche Bank analysts said charge - offs were up more than 50 percent last month at six of the 11 credit card issuers that they survey .
IN NO MOOD TO SHOP
Private consumption fell in the third quarter that ended in September , and economists think it will drop again in the current period and in the first quarter of 2009 .
It would mark the first time since quarterly statistics began in 1947 that consumption fell for three straight quarters .
That is precisely what the U.S. government is trying to avoid .
The Treasury wants to use some of its $ 700 billion rescue fund to guarantee consumer lending in the hope that doing so will get money flowing again .
It may not be enough because even those with plenty of credit appear to be curbing their spending .
In the 2001 recession , consumer spending remained positive even as the economy contracted .
The current episode has taken a much heavier toll on confidence across a wider swathe of the population .
Luxury retailers that are normally deemed recession resilient are hurting badly , as evidenced by weak sales at chains such as Saks Inc SKS.N .
Simply put , shopping does not feel good right now , with or without easy credit .
“ It ’s no longer cool to display ostentatious spending habits when those around you are losing their jobs and homes , ” said Darrell Rigby , head of the global retail practice at consulting firm Bain & Co .
Following are excerpts from an interview with Egyptian lawyer Nagla Al - Imam , which aired on Al - Arabiya TV on October 31 , 2008 .
Interviewer : Egyptian lawyer Nagla Al - Imam has proposed that young Arab men should sexually harass Israeli girls wherever they may be and using any possible method , as a new means in the resistance against Israel .
[...]
Interviewer :
We have with us the lawyer Nagla Al - Imam from Cairo .
Welcome .
What is the purpose of this proposal of yours ?
Nagla Al - Imam :
This is a form of resistance .
In my opinion , they are fair game for all Arabs , and there is nothing wrong with ...
Interviewer : On what grounds ?
Nagla Al - Imam : First of all , they violate our rights , and they " rape " the land .
Few things are as grave as the rape of land .
In my view , this is a new form of resistance .
Interviewer :
As a lawyer , do n't you think this might expose Arab youth to punishment for violating laws against sexual harassment ?
Nagla Al - Imam : Most Arab countries ...
With the exception of three or four Arab countries , which I do n’t think allow Israeli women to enter anyway , most Arab countries do not have sexual harassment laws .
Therefore , if [ Arab women ] are fair game for Arab men , there is nothing wrong with Israeli women being fair game as well .
Interviewer : Does this also include rape ?
Nagla Al - Imam : No. Sexual harassment ...
In my view , the [ Israeli women ] do not have any right to respond .
The resistance fighters would not initiate such a thing , because their moral values are much loftier than that .
However if such a thing did happen to them , the [ Israeli women ] have no right to make any demands , because this would put us on equal terms – leave the land so we wo n't rape you .
These two things are equal .
[...]
I do n’t want young Arab men to be interrogated .
I want these Zionist girls with Israeli citizenship to be expelled from our Arab countries .
This is a form of resistance , and a way of rejecting their presence .
Dutch " magic mushroom " vendors lose court bid against ban Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday November 28 , 2008

THE HAGUE ( AFP ) - " Magic mushrooms " will be banned in the Netherlands from next week after a court ruling Friday , in the latest sign of a hardening stance on recreational drug use by the traditionally liberal Dutch .
The ban will be in place from Monday after the district court in The Hague rejected a petition by a body representing vendors of the hallucinogenic fungi to halt a health ministry ban on their cultivation and sale .
The ruling comes days after authorities ordered dozens of Amsterdam 's famous cannabis - selling coffee shops to close and two other municipalities announced they would close down all their cannabis cafes from February .
" This is bad news for us , " Paul van Oyen , a spokesman for the vendors ' association VLOS told AFP after the verdict .
" We are highly disappointed . "
The district court dismissed the VLOS 's petition for an urgent interdict against the ban as groundless and unfair .
The ban , introduced by Health Minister Ab Klink and already passed by lawmakers , will now come into force on December 1 .
The legislation forbids both the cultivation and sale of fresh hallucinogenic mushrooms , which grow naturally in the wild in several areas .
A total of 186 species of " shrooms " or " paddos " will become illegal from Monday , with more expected to follow later .
The dried variety has been illegal in the country for several years .
Klink believes consumption of the fungi , sold in the Netherlands in so - called smart shops , " can lead to unpredictable and risky behaviour " .
His ban follows the death in March last year of a French teenager who had taken mushrooms before jumping to her death from an Amsterdam bridge , reigniting a national debate over tolerance of the substance .
But Jaap Jamin of the Jellinek addiction prevention institute said the prohibition made no sense .
" We are not necessarily for the use of paddos , but we are against its banning , " he told AFP .
The move would merely force the trade underground where it could no longer be regulated , said Jamin .
" And one can imagine a situation in which people who want it will merely go and pick mushrooms themselves at the risk of consuming poisonous types . "
According to Amsterdam health services , where a quarter of the country 's smart shops are to be found , more than 90 percent of the 1.5 million to two million doses consumed every year are bought by foreign tourists .
VLOS says there are six growers in the Netherlands , 180 smart shops , and a few hundred employees in an industry with an annual turnover of 15 - 20 million euros .
Several political parties have become more critical of the Netherlands ' traditionally liberal approach on issues such as drugs and prostitution which is seen as a draw for sex tourists .
The Netherlands decriminalised the consumption and possession of under five grams of cannabis in 1976 .
Its cultivation , however , remains illegal .
The Netherlands hosts a total of 702 so - called coffee shops -- establishments with special licences to sell cannabis .
However the Mayor of Amsterdam said last week he would reluctantly close 43 in his city in accordance with a new law banning cannabis - selling coffee shops situated within a 250 - metre ( 820 - feet ) radius of schools .
Last week , the southern Dutch city of Maastricht incurred the ire of nearby Belgian towns by opting to move its seven coffee shops closer to the border to dilute the nuisance it claims is caused by drug tourism .
And Roosendaal and Bergen - op - Zoom , two other southern Dutch municipalities close to the Belgian border , have announced they will close their coffee shops from February 1 next year .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A quarter of sharks and rays are threatened with being fished out of existence in the Northeast Atlantic , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) said on Monday .

That is far above the threat level globally , reflecting the activity of fishing nations such as Spain , Portugal , France and Britain , the Swiss - based conservation group said .
The IUCN hopes that its findings will drive tougher fishing controls in the European Union -- and recommended a zero catch for spiny dogfish and all deepwater sharks , and an end to fishing for common skates .
“ Action is absolutely necessary to change the current course toward extinction of these remarkable ocean animals , ” said Sonja Fordham , co-author of the first IUCN report assessing threat levels for sharks specifically in the northeast Atlantic .
The IUCN ’s Red List details the world ’s wildlife with the bleakest prospects -- threatened species grouped in descending order of risk as critically endangered , endangered , or vulnerable .
The next categories are “ extinct in the wild ” and “ extinct . ”
Critically endangered sharks in the Northeast Atlantic included the gulper shark , prized in the cosmetics industry for its liver oil , and the two sharks most valued in Europe for their meat -- the spiny dogfish and porbeagle sharks .
The basking shark , the world ’s second largest fish , was listed as vulnerable .
Some 26 percent of sharks and rays in the Northeast Atlantic region were classified as threatened , compared to 18 percent for the same species globally , the report found .
“ Deepwater sharks are faring worse in this region than globally , due to loosely regulated , targeted fishing by European vessels , ” it said .
Spiny dogfish and porbeagle are subject to EU fishing quotas , but the IUCN said these quotas were too generous .
“ These species are among the few that are subject to EU fishing quotas and yet those limits are set well above the zero catches advised by scientists with the International Council for Exploration of the Sea ( ICES ) for avoiding collapse . ”
In mid-December in Brussels the European Council of Ministers will agree 2009 EU catch limits for skates and rays as well as spiny dogfish and porbeagle sharks .
The IUCN works with environmental groups and government agencies to compile environmental knowledge and prepare and implement national conservation and biodiversity strategies .
Some might argue that it has been a bad year for encryption .
After all , just as the last decade was ending came reports that the algorithm that is used to encrypt GSM mobile phone calls ( as used by some 4 billion people around the world ) had been cracked wide open .
Now this has been followed by the announcement that 768 - bit RSA encryption has been cracked .
I 'm inclined to think that this is a good thing , and am happy to explain why starting with GSM encryption .
The GSM Association responsible for developing the algorithm in the first place responded by stating that the work of the scientists behind the code cracking would be highly illegal in the UK and other countries .
Well duh !
Seriously though , there is an argument to suggest that it 's better for the good guys to crack the code than the bad guys .
After all , at least it is now known to be vulnerable and that should , as the guys who did the donkey work suggest , create pressure to produce a better encryption algorithm .
Some argue that if they had not published the results of their work ( which was apparently done after taking legal advice ) then things might have been a little safer until such a time that this happens .
Of course , the counter argument being that without the publication of such work the motivation to make changes is reduced considerably .
In many ways I think that this has probably done us a favour , in that the A5/1 GSM encryption algorithm involved is some 22 years old so it 's about time it was overhauled to be honest .
Not least because researchers have been poking holes in it for the last 16 years or so .
Eavesdropping on GSM conversations is nothing new either , it just cos a small fortune ( we are talking six figures ) to be able to put together the right rig to perform the task .
You had better believe that government agencies have been doing it for the longest time , but now the costs have lowered considerably , down to low five figures in fact .
And that means that all sorts of unsavoury types from terrorists to criminal gangs and even , he says popping his head above the parapets , the media might be tempted to listen in .
All of which means that the plans to phase in a stronger A5/3 encryption will be put into the fast lane and should become the new standard sooner rather than later .
OK , so what about the news that 768 - bit RSA encryption has been cracked .
How can that be good for security , good for anyone in fact ?
Well , for a start the actual crack took a huge amount of processing power to generate a massive 5 terabyte password file .
According to Andy Cordial , managing director at Origin Storage , " cracking this crypto system using a 2.2GHz Opteron processor - based PC would reportedly have taken around 1,500 years " .
Of course , using distributed computer resources via a brute force cluster approach reduces the time dramatically .
And that 's good because it makes people think about moving up to stronger encryption .
Which does mean that the debate about what is ' enough ' in terms of encryption will no doubt fire up again .
Some argue that 1024 - bit RSA only has 10 years at the most left in it before the encryption is cracked , while others suggest that it 's probably going to be plenty safe enough for the foreseeable future .
Some talk of quantum computing changing everything , and indeed it will if it ever becomes a reality outside of the lab and that 's a big if right now .
Some suggest that now is the right time to move right up to 2048 - bit RSA , after all why bother with weaker links when the strongest chain is available to lock up your data .
I say that whatever you move up to in terms of encryption , the mere fact that you are talking about it is good news for the security of your data in years to come .
If you can also start thinking about additional measures such as biometric authentication and PIN - based protection alongside that encrypted drive then you really are starting to take security seriously .
Which is why I will suggest that all this encryption cracking is not such a bad thing after all .
After all , does anyone actually use WEP encryption for WiFi or even WPA these days ?
After the widely reported cracking of these technologies , WPA2 is becoming the defacto standard .
“ The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation . ” – Bertrand Russell
By Leo Babauta
As a blogger who has found some success amongst the seemingly endless sea of blogs , I ’ve had to confront some old and rusty ideas I used to have about success and competition .
I examined these long - held beliefs early on in my blogging career , and discovered that they were false .
What I learned that has helped me tremendously , and these ideas can be applied to many fields of work and many areas of life :
Striving for success does not requre competition .
Boosting others actually helps you , in the long run .
Envy of others ’ success and trying to tear others down helps NO ONE .
The last one probably sounds obvious , but is also the idea that ’s least used in reality by many people .
For some reason , many of us get jealous when others are successful , and we try to tear the person down .
We belittle them for their success , we criticize unfairly , we bad - mouth people , we become obstacles to their further progress .
It ’s utterly illogical , and yet you can find it everywhere in life , in many different cultures and industries .
How does someone else ’s success become a bad thing for other people ?
This is a concept I ’d like to explore a little today , and I ’d also like to take a look at the converse : how boosting people actually helps you .
Success Is n’t a Competition
Blogging , for example , is not a zero - sum game .
If I gain readers , it does n’t mean you ’ll lose readers .
In fact , if we as bloggers link to each other , we can help each other gain readers at the same time .
Helping other bloggers , in that sense , does nothing to hurt you as a blogger .
You are n’t competing for readers , even if you ’re both trying to get the same readers , because readers can read multiple blogs .
Sure , you might say that readers can only read so many blogs , so we are competing for their limited attention .
But that ’s a very limited and limiting view .
That ’s assuming that there ’s a very limited pool of readers with a small amount of attention .
That is n’t true : there are lots of blog readers out there , and even more , there are MANY non -blog readers who will soon become blog readers , and that number is increasing all the time .
We are n’t competing for readers — we ’re all trying to gain readership , but we can do that together , cooperatively if we like .
Or we can compete and tear and claw at each other .
This concept can apply to many other industries .
I ’ve been a writer in the field of journalism , and while some journalists think it ’s a competition — you want to beat others by getting the story first ( a scoop ! ) or you ’re competing for limited jobs — I never agreed .
We were all striving for the same goal : to tell the truth , and to get useful information to our readers .
In that light , journalists can cooperate , and some of them actually do cooperate .
Sharing of information is good for everybody .
Think about your field of work : while the mainstream view is probably that everybody ’s competing with each other , is there a way to see it as just the opposite ?
That we can all be successful , and that helping each other is actually a good thing ?
I would bet that you can see it that way .
Think of it in terms of personal success : do you really need to compete with your peers in order to be a success ?
Ca n’t you all be successes , but in different ways ?
Maybe one person makes a million dollars , another successfully starts a small business , another becomes famous for inventing something new , another becomes one of the most solid and hardest working people in his field .
Those are all successes in different ways , and there are many , many more ways to be successful .
There is a lot of use in this kind of view .
Competition can be a motivator , and sometimes can be a lot of fun .
But it can also be destructive , and become an obstacle to success .
And if you see things as not a competition , that can lead to some really great things .
Let ’s take a look at that now .
Boosting Others Helps
You in the Long Run
Let ’s say , as a blogger , that I link to others and send them a lot of traffic so that they get new readers .
Those other bloggers might , over time , become even bigger than me .
Have I just lost a competition ?
Did I just shoot myself in the foot ?
Not at all .
If I help others to become successes , that ’s a good thing .
First , it feels good to make others happy and successful .
Trust me — this is one of the greatest feelings .
But second , if you want to look at things in more of a selfish way ( and you do n’t have to , at all ) , making others successful actually helps you in the long run .
Think of it like this : if I help five blogs become so successful that they each have 5 million readers a month ( oh , we can dream ! ) , they will probably be grateful for my help .
They might remain close friends with me , even though they are now out of my league .
They might even see me as a mentor .
And as a result , they will probably send readers my way from time to time , when I have good posts their readers might like .
And wham !
I now have five major blogs sending their readers to me , after I helped them grow by sending readers to them !
I am rolling in traffic !
Yee hoo haw !
Of course , there ’s no need to see things in such a quid pro quo way , but you can see how this example illustrates the way that helping others can come back to help you in many different ways .
And this does n’t just apply to blogging — it can apply to anything .
Imagine if you had helped Bill Gates to create his first software company , and he went on to become bigger than you .
It would be cool to be the guy who made Gates successful , would it not ?
He might even help your little company and invite you to party on his yacht sometimes .
Sure , you lost a competition by helping a competitor — but you also gained a life - long friend who is now a billionaire and seems to be on good terms with Jerry Seinfeld .
Hard to beat that !
By freeing yourself from the bounds of competition , you free yourself to help others , even if they might be competitors .
And in doing so , you gain relationships , and those can be amazingly valuable — in terms of having great friends , and maybe gaining something in the long run .
Friends , of course , are much , much more than what they might give you ( and you should n’t make friends because they might give you something ) , but you can see the point : it certainly does n’t hurt you to help others .
Do n’t Tear Others Down
So if boosting others can help you , what about the converse ?
What does tearing others down do for you ?
Well , tearing others down might make you feel better .
I doubt it , but it might .
It might also stop a competitor from succeeding , and maybe in the short term that ’ll help you .
I also doubt that , but it might .
The truth is , no one likes a person who tears others down .
If you are bad - mouthing someone , it might make you feel better , but others wo n’t like it .
You will gain a bad reputation , and your bad - mouthing will come back to hurt you .
If you are sabotaging others , that ’s even worse .
If you become an obstacle to others ’ success , they will despise you for it .
They will try to get around you , and failing that , will try to go through you .
Your energies and time will be spent trying to stop others , and defending yourself against their attacks .
What a waste of precious time and energy !
Could n’t you spend that better on building things yourself ?
On creating something beautiful and truly useful ?
On helping others to succeed ?
Of course you can !
Tearing others down is destructive .
It hurts other people , and in the long run , it ’ll hurt you .
Do n’t waste your time and energy on it .
Instead , build others up .
Praise their success .
Learn to be truly happy for the successes of others , rather than envious .
Be a part of their success , rather than an obstacle .
Participating in something great , including the successes of others , is a wonderful thing to have accomplished .
Hollywood Producer Jon Peters Slapped With Another Sexual Lawsuit
is amassing sexual lawsuits with amazing regularity .
The latest disgruntled working partner is the co-producer of his current film project Superman : Man of Steel , .
The suit , filed in Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this week claims that Peters engaged in continuous and pervasive sexual harassment .
According to court documents , Quintana was groped , physically and sexually harassed in multiple instances by Peters and by others at Peters urging .
He also charges that Peters sexually roughed him up and threatened to break his legs and fired him when he refused to lie about the number of community service hours Peters had completed for a DUI conviction .
Peters , the one time boyfriend of Barbara Streisand , has two other lawsuits pending against him , initiated by staffers who are also claiming sexual harassment .
One female employee , Bianca Hernandez , claims that he inappropriately touched her and offered her money for sex .
Quintana enjoys a high profile in Hollywood , and has raised $ 5.2 million for various charities and also serves on several national boards .
He is pictured below with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton .
Peters ' office phone has been disconnected .
Republican strategists have worked their typing fingers to the bone since the election , arguing over how to fend off the collective nightmare they envision if Democrats put no brakes on their agenda .
Trouble is , nothing looks likely to work .
Nothing , that is , except the one strategy that conservatives seem to be coalescing around : Begging .
Since the results of Nov. 4 have yet to take effect , few outside the Capitol - and , really , precious few even there - yet appreciate the totality of Democratic ownership of Washington , D.C .
Republicans and Democrats in Minnesota are entering a death struggle right now not all that different from the political war in Florida following the 2000 presidential election .
Lawyers and activists from both sides are pouring into the Twin Cities , desperate to nudge either Republican incumbent Sen. Norm Coleman or Democratic challenger Al Franken over the top .
Why the intensity ?
Because a Democratic win in Minnesota effectively hands the Dems de facto control of the entire legislative process .
With 57 Senate seats already in Democratic hands , a Franken win in Minnesota essentially assures the Democrats that the bulk of their agenda is theirs for the having .
In order to hurdle the 60 - vote supermajority necessary to bypass a minority - party filibuster , all the Dems will need is the help of one or two occasional friends like independent socialist Bernie Sanders of Vermont , semiostracized independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut or liberal Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine .
It 's not quite like having the entire show under a single roof , but it is a virtual guarantee that all but the most outre elements of the Dems ' agenda will sail through .
A lot of economists are pointing to the self - destruction on Wall Street - the biggest post- election belly flop in stock - market history - and are claiming it is a direct response to the Democratic takeover described above .
Some of that reaction is irrational , just like so much of what 's happening to the financial markets .
Barack Obama has made a determined effort thus far not to become a president - in - waiting .
That has included a resistance to issuing declarations of his intentions regarding economic and tax policy .
The president - elect is committed to some firm ideas that a lot of conservatives fear could stagnate the economy for years to come .
But he is not oblivious to certain economic realities .
However one defines that Joe the Plumber - era line about " spreading the wealth around , " ( as either socialism or simple fairness - ism ) , it is a policy that requires wealth that can be spread around .
In a train - wreck environment like this one , there just is n't any .
This is the line of argument that conservative strategists are raising against the coming Democratic dominance in Washington .
They are raising the specter of a long recession and begging the Dems to not make it worse .
And so we have the astonishing spectacle of seeing the likes of conservative historian Amity Shlaes urging Obama and the Democrats to resist raising capital - gains taxes by quoting ( of all people ) Paul Krugman of the New York Times - the liberal columnist who , to my recollection , has never before met a rich capitalist whose face he did not wish to grind into the gravel with his boot heel .
Krugman and Shlaes are of one mind in arguing that Franklin D. Roosevelt exacerbated the Great Depression with his tax hikes .
And it seems the Dems may be listening .
The proposed economic - stimulus package that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been promoting ( half - a - trillion dollars , anyone ? ) now includes a second element . . . a permanent capital - gains tax cut .
Sounding more Republican than some Republicans , Pelosi said shortly after the elections that she believed a tax cut would be more effective at boosting the economy than another tax rebate .
Shlaes , the recent author of a sobering history of the Great Depression , seems leery of the tax - friendly faces on the new Obama economic team .
But she also seems optimistic that they can be talked out of their most destructive inclinations .
" The rest of us just have to help them figure out a graceful way to do so , " wrote Shlaes .
Like . . . oh , begging .

Ham Sandwich McCain's Actual Choice for Veep
John McCain has revealed that his apparent choice of Sarah Palin as his Vice Presidential running - mate was , as many observers predicted , a carefully - staged hoax .
" Yeah , right , " McCain campaign manager Rick Davis said of Palin , laughing with reporters .
" As if !
What do we look like , a bunch of complete lackwits ?
You guys will believe anything . "
McCain 's actual running mate will be a ham sandwich .
The sandwich , said by analysts to be " a little light on the ham , " has never held any public office and is incapable of speech or rational thought .
It is thought that the choice will solidify McCain 's credentials as a " maverick . "
" John McCain makes decisions with his gut , " said Davis .
" That 's what Americans like , right ? "
Some Democrats questioned whether a sandwich was qualified to be the Vice President of the United States , let alone President if anything should happen to McCain , 72 .
Republican spokesmen fired back that any attempt to criticize the sandwich in any way would constitute a display of bigotry .
" Sandwiches are as American as apple pie , " said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers , " and it 's just like the Democrats to attack them , and , by implication , our entire American way of life , and , by further extension , the very human act of eating , and , by even further extension , life itself , and , by extensive extension , the very concept of existence , both for human beings , and indeed , for the entire universe and , perhaps , even alternative universes . "
He suggested that Democrats would probably favor some more " Middle - Eastern - sounding food , " such as " kabobs or tacos or something . "
GOP surrogates soon fanned out to cable news networks to sing the praises of the sandwich .
" This is a bold and visionary choice by John McCain , " said Republican commentator William Bennett , appearing on CNN .
" The trade in pork and pork products is absolutely central to America 's military might and economic development in the 21st century .
There is simply no better choice for Vice President , and , in fact , any objective observer must question why there is nothing made of pork -- nor , in fact , anything that is consumable in any way -- on the Democratic ticket . "
Fresno priest comes out as gay , opposes Prop.

Two Sundays ago , the Rev. Geoffrey Farrow stood before his Roman Catholic parishioners in Fresno and delivered a sermon that placed him squarely at odds with his church over gay marriage .
With California Proposition 8 on the state 's November ballot , and his own bishop urging priests to support its definition of traditional marriage , Farrow told congregants he felt obligated to break " a numbing silence " about church prejudice against homosexuals .
" How is marriage protected by intimidating gay and lesbian people into loveless and lonely lives ? " he asked parishioners of the St. Paul Newman Center .
" I am morally compelled to vote no on Proposition 8 . "
Then Farrow - who had revealed that he was gay during a television interview immediately before church services - added a coda to his sermon .
" I know these words of truth will cost me dearly , " he said .
" But to withhold them ... I would become an accomplice to a moral evil that strips gay and lesbian people not only of their civil rights , but of their human dignity as well . "
Thursday , Fresno Bishop John T. Steinbock removed Farrow , 50 , as pastor of the St. Paul Newman Center , which primarily serves students and faculty at California State University Fresno .
" Your statement contradicted the teaching of the Catholic Church and has brought scandal to your parish community as well as the whole church , " Steinbock wrote in a disciplinary letter that also admonished Farrow against " using the Internet as a means of continuing your conflict with the church 's teaching . "
The priest was stripped of his salary and benefits and ordered to stay away from all church communities he served in the Central Valley .
Farrow 's comments at the end of the Oct. 5
Mass have left his congregation bitterly divided .
Reaction varied
Over the weekend , some parishioners praised Farrow 's courage for defending the rights of gays and lesbians , while others condemned him for challenging church doctrine without giving warning .
" It upsets me that we are allowing a ballot proposition to come into our church and divide us , " Teresa Huerta , who teaches at Cal State Fresno , said Sunday .
" We are going through changes right now in society , and the church needs to recognize that . "
Frank Gallegos , a parishioner for 24 years , said he was dismayed that Farrow used the pulpit to deliver his message .
" He ambushed us , " Gallegos , 44 , said while leaving the white concrete - block church with his wife and two children .
" I do n't wish him ill .
I just wish he had n't done it during Mass . "
Parish leaders concluded two morning Masses on Sunday with an apology to parishioners .
Farrow 's statements , they said , were not in accord with church teachings .
Also , the priest did not inform church elders about his plans before delivering his sermon , said Deacon John Supino , who read a letter from Steinbock reaffirming the Catholic Church 's support for Proposition 8 .
Quoting Steinbock , Supino said the church teaches that sex is a gift from God to be acted on only by a man and a woman within marriage .
Proposition 8 , he insisted , does not represent a condemnation of gays or lesbians .
" The teachings of the church on these matters did not arise with Proposition 8 but have been in place for over 2,000 years , " Supino said .
Several parishioners inside the church applauded when Supino finished Steinbock 's statement Sunday .
A few rose and left as he was reading it .
Katherine Allison , 46 , hurried out of the church at the end of the 11 a.m .
Mass with her 14 - year - old son and 7 - year - old daughter .
She said she did n't want to stay to hear the bishop 's letter .
Allison said her entire family liked Father Geoff , as he was known .
He taught a Bible history class Tuesday nights and seemed to be passionate about his work , she said .
' Nothing to apologize for '
" There is nothing to apologize for , " she said .
" God tells us to speak the truth , and that 's what he did . "
Farrow became a priest 23 years ago and has worked in several California parishes .
A graduate of St. John 's Seminary in Camarillo , he served as an Air Force chaplain , stationed during the early 1990s at Edwards Air Force Base .
Farrow , who said he realized he was gay in boyhood , never revealed his sexual orientation to anyone .
He told his parents only four years ago .
" This was the secret I was going to take to my grave , " he said .
That changed when he received a June 30 " pastoral letter " from Steinbock 's office in which the bishop condemned the California Supreme Court 's ruling in May legalizing same - sex marriage , and supported the passage of Proposition 8 .
The bishop compared the court 's action to efforts by Nazi Germany and the communist regimes in Russia and China to alter family arrangements .
" Let us pray for our Christian marriages and our Christian families , and for our children who will be subjected to brainwashing in our public school system regarding this matter , " Steinbock wrote .
A moral quandary
Steinbock 's letter threw Farrow into a moral quandary and prompted his sermon .
" At what point do you cease to be an agent for healing and growth and become an accomplice of injustice ? " he asked .
Farrow said he knew his comments would cause an uproar .
He started to pack up his office the night before his address .
He cleared his belongings from the church rectory just hours after greeting parishioners outside the church at the end of services .
He left town so quickly that he was unable to find one of his two cats .
He drove to Los Angeles , where he is staying with friends .
Farrow sent Steinbock a letter last week saying that he would resume his pastoral duties unless he heard otherwise .
He said the bishop voiced frustration over his refusal to speak with him other than through a lawyer .
In his disciplinary letter , Steinbock said Farrow had abandoned his assignment without offering an opportunity to discuss the issues .
Steinbock said he had no choice but to suspend Farrow , and he hinted that other penalties could follow , including defrocking him .
Steinbock did not return calls to the Fresno diocese .

From the Alaska governor 's interview with Wolf Blitzer to air today on The Situation Room :
BLITZER : Because , you know , during a campaign , every presidential campaign , things are said , it 's tough , as you well know , it gets sometimes pretty fierce out there .
And during the campaign , you said this , you said : " This is not a man who sees America as you see it and how I see America . "
And then you went on to say : " Someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect that he is palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . "
PALIN : Well , I still am concerned about that association with Bill Ayers .
And if anybody still wants to talk about it , I will , because this is an unrepentant domestic terrorist who had campaigned to blow up , to destroy our Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol .
That 's an association that still bothers me .
And I think it 's still fair to talk about it .
However the campaign is over .
That chapter is closed .
Now is the time to move on and to , again , make sure that all of us are doing all that we can to progress this nation .

Lipstick Jungle NOT Canceled Says NBC
NBC Entertainment co-chairsays that Lipstick Jungle may have new life with its recent move to the Friday night lineup .
Late last week rumors were running rampant that the show , in it 's first season , had breathed its last .
Not so .
Lipstick Jungle is a comedy drama about three high powered women , played by Brooke Shields , Kim Raver and Lindsay Price .
Filmed in New York City , the network has aired nine or the first seasons 13 episodes .
The remaining four shows will definitely air , with the hope that if they see viewership growth more episodes will be ordered and the crew can go back into production .
The show actually picked up 50 percent more viewers this past Friday when delayed viewing ( DVR's and other devices ) was included in the measuring equation .
The network also received an outpouring of support from fans .
Both are promising 11th hour developments .
Brooke Shields had this to say when questioned over the weekend : " Our bosses are saying , ' You 're not canceled , do n't worry .
We 're just trying to figure out how to make this make sense . '
I mean , we 're basically No. 1 if you look at DVR .
And you look at all that .
So the public IS watching it . "

The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) organization on Friday announced plans to sell its XO notebook via Amazon.com .
The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) organization on Friday announced plans to sell its XO notebook via Amazon.com .
When OLPC designed its low - priced , low - watt , neon - green XO laptop , the company never intended to make it commercially available to consumers in developed countries .
The purpose of the program , after all , was to benefit children from poor nations .
When consumers began asking for the computer , however , OLPC got a idea :
Why not let people buy one notebook for the price of two ?
One would go to the consumer and the other to a child in need .
Dubbed Give One Get One ( G1G1 ) , the program was a marked success , generating a good deal of money and raising the company 's profile even higher .
In fact , the program 's success pushed the organization 's shipping infrastructure to its limits , and OLPC received a number of complaints from customers lamenting the company 's inability to ship units in a timely matter .
The laptop will be available on Amazon to consumers who participate in the G1G1 proram .
If anything , it seems that such availability could increase the potential demand for the low - cost , low - powered system .
Volunteers excepted , the organization employs about 25 workers .
Is OLPC more prepared to meet the demand for its product this time around ?
We put the question to an OLPC spokesperson , who answered simply , " OLPC has factored increased volume into its plans . "
Quanta in China will continue to manufacture the systems , and Amazon will be handling the shipping to customers in the U.S. , according to the spokesperson .

Seems that swanky new LCD on Sony 's PSP - 3000 could be garnering more complaints than anything else .
If you 'll recall , the aforesaid system was touted as having a brighter , better screen than the PSP - 2000 , but now the PlayStation forums are filling up with irate PSP - 3000 buyers who are experiencing unexplained scanlines and totally peculiar interlacing problems .
As you can see above , the 3000 's screen looks noticeably worse than that of the 2000 , and while we always hope that these issues are contained , we have at least one Engadget staffer and a Joystiq comrade who can attest to this being real .
SCEA has been contacted and is currently " looking into " the matter -- we wo n't dare say that r-word just yet , but this does n't look particularly good on the surface .
We 'll keep you posted . [ Via Joystiq : A Japanese Sony Computer Entertainment representative has informed us that the interlacing - like lines are just " features " of the new LCD , and currently , there are no plans to fix it with a future software update since it is in the hardware .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - More than 17 percent of HIV patients being treated for their infection in China developed resistance to available drugs by 2006 and 2007 , according to a new nationwide survey .

With only seven of the more than 20 different HIV drugs available in China , the finding , announced by Chinese government researchers at an international AIDS conference in Mexico City , means these patients quickly end up with limited options .
HIV infection is incurable but cocktails of the drugs can control it .
And the finding is surprising because the virus usually mutates into drug - resistant form only after people have been taking the drugs for a while .
China began its national free HIV drugs program in 2003 and very few people had access to drugs before then .
Chinese government researchers said those who developed drug resistance tended to be from families with low and unstable incomes .
“ When we first started , we did n’t have much experience and patients tended to be suspicious if these medications would work .
So their adherence was not good and that resulted in higher rates of drug resistance , ” said Liao Lingjie from the National Center for AIDS / STD Control and Prevention at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention .
The Chinese government estimated at the end of 2007 that about 700,000 people were infected with HIV , up from an earlier estimate of 650,000 .
According to official Chinese media , about 20,000 Chinese were receiving free HIV drugs by the end of 2006 .
It is not clear how many people in China need to buy their own drugs .
The World Health Organization , however , estimated earlier that 122,000 people in China would have required HIV drugs by the end of 2004 .
Liao said the survey covered 28 provinces .
She said in an interview that “ 17.6 percent of patients were found to be resistant to at least one drug , ” but stressed that this has since improved .
“ People who began treatment later are responding better , ” she said .
Liao said authorities are now following up on those patients who have become resistant to the available drugs and a small number of them have been put on a pilot trial .
“ A small number of people are now trying out second - line drugs to see if the medication is suitable , ” she said .
China has been battling an acknowledged rise in HIV infections , which are now mainly sexually transmitted .
In the past , most infections were caused by intravenous drug use .
But the AIDS epidemic really took off in the 1990s in China ’s central province of Henan because of unhygienic commercial blood donation schemes that resulted in entire villages becoming infected .
In recent years , China has given free medicines to many rural AIDS patients , as well as some economic help , and national leaders have held public meetings with patients to ease the stigma that many still suffer .
But patients and rights advocates complain that they are blocked from suing hospitals and officials they blame for helping spread HIV .
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , whose reformer image took a hit in a report concluding she abused her powers to settle a family score , has skirted state ethics rules before for personal benefit and used her office to help friends and supporters , according to an Associated Press review of records .
Palin ’s first try at statewide office , after six years as mayor of Wasilla , was an unsuccessful run for lieutenant governor in 2002 .
To raise money , she improperly used her City Hall office and equipment , city records show .
A year later she would make headlines by blasting a fellow Republican for , among other things , improperly using his government position to boost his campaign .
Then , in 2006 , Palin won the governor ’s race with a vow to reform state ethics .
But in less than two years , she has repeatedly taken actions that violated her own stated standards for ethical behavior _ if not state law .
In the process , the Republican vice presidential nominee has become much like the old - school politicians she attacked during her rise to power .
Some examples :
_ She pummeled opponents for giving oil companies and other businesses too much control of state government .
Yet she appointed the founder of an engineering firm that received $ 6.8 million in state business as head of the transportation department .
_ She has accepted dozens of gifts worth tens of thousands of dollars since taking office , including two free trips last year that she failed to report on disclosure forms , despite criticizing state legislators for the gifts they take .
_ She is under another investigation , accused of misusing her office to campaign against a voter referendum calling for tighter mining regulations .
Her husband , Todd , has accepted free trips from a mining company to look at their proposed new site .
_ Another ethics complaint , unresolved , accuses her staff of finding a state job for a friend and campaign contributor .

Despite the Supreme Court ’s ruling Wednesday that the nation ’s security outweighs the need to protect marine mammals from high - powered sonar during Navy training exercises , environmentalists said the fight was far from over .
The court immediately lifted limits on the Navy exercises now being held 12 miles off the Southern California coast , in a victory for the outgoing Bush administration .
But the decision does n’t bind the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama to follow the same policy .
Another set of Navy exercises is scheduled for February .
“ We do n’t know what the Supreme Court decision means for the next go - round .
We will have a new commander in chief .
It ’s a new game , ” said Mark Delaplaine , an analyst with the California Coastal Commission .

Lawrence J. Korb , a former Defense Department official who has been an advisor to the Obama campaign , said , “ This says the Navy can do this .
It does n’t say they should do it .
The new people could come in and say , ‘ OK .
Let ’s find a way to do this differently . ’ ”
Saying the court should defer to the military , Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the Navy needs to train its crews to detect modern , silent submarines , and it can not be forced to turn off its sonar when whales are spotted nearby .
“ The public interest in conducting training exercises with active sonar under realistic conditions plainly outweighs ” the concerns voiced by environmentalists , he said , speaking for a five - justice majority .
This “ does not strike us as a close question , ” he added .
Environmentalists contend that the sonar has a possible deafening effect on the whales .
Roberts questioned whether whales have indeed been harmed by sonar .
He said the Navy had been operating off the California coast for 40 years “ without a single documented sonar - related injury to any marine mammal . ”

The Natural Resources Defense Council and other environmentalist groups strongly disagreed .
They said studies conducted around the world have shown the piercing underwater sounds cause whales to flee in panic or to dive too deeply .
Whales have been found beached in Greece , the Canary Islands and in the Bahamas after sonar was used in the area , and necropsies showed signs of internal bleeding near the ears .
Last year , the NRDC and several other groups went to court in Los Angeles to challenge the Navy ’s plans to conduct 14 training exercises off the Southern California coast .
They said the Navy failed to prepare an environmental impact statement and therefore had violated the National Environmental Policy Act .
Citing Navy estimates , the NRDC said the use of high - intensity sonar could disturb or threaten 170,000 marine mammals , and it predicted the exercises would cause permanent injury to more than 500 whales and lead to temporary deafness in at least 8,000 whales .
U.S. District Judge Florence - Marie Cooper agreed with the environmentalists .
She did not tell the Navy to halt its exercises but instead ordered it to take steps to protect the whales .

For example , the Navy was told not to use sonar within 12 miles of the coast or in areas near Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands , where marine mammals congregate .
More controversially , she said crews must turn off the high - intensity sonar when a marine mammal was spotted within 1.2 miles of a ship .
She also said sonar power must be reduced when sea conditions allow the sonar blasts to travel farther than usual .
After her order was upheld by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , the Bush administration appealed to the Supreme Court on behalf of Navy Secretary Donald C. Winter .
It said the extra conditions -- such as the sonar shutdown when whales are seen nearby -- would jeopardize the training exercises .
Roberts and the court moved quickly to overturn key parts of the judge ’s order .
In Winter vs. NRDC , he stressed the military threat posed by modern subs .
They “ can operate almost silently , making them extremely difficult to detect and track , ” he said .
“ The president -- the commander in chief -- has determined that the training with active sonar is ‘ essential to the national security , ’ ” he said .
“ We give great deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest , ” Roberts said .
Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony M. Kennedy , Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. agreed .
Advertisement
The four more - liberal - leaning justices were divided .
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David H. Souter dissented and said the Navy should be required to complete an environmental impact statement before going ahead with its final training exercises .
Justices John Paul Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer agreed with the majority that the judge ’s order went too far , but Breyer said it should be modified so the Navy ’s exercises can proceed .
Stevens concurred in overturning the judge ’s order .
The two restrictions on sonar were immediately lifted as the Navy aircraft carrier the John C. Stennis and 11 accompanying ships continue war games off Southern California through Saturday .
The last set of exercises in the current series is set to begin in December .
NRDC lawyers described the ruling as narrow and said it could have been worse .
The court did not , for example , exempt the Navy from conducting environmental impact studies , nor did it say the president and the Defense secretary can ignore the environmental laws by invoking the needs of the military .
Advertisement
Los Angeles lawyer Richard B. Kendall , who represented the NRDC , said it was “ gratifying that the court did not accept the Navy ’s expansive claims of executive power . ”
He also said protections such as the 12 - mile coastal zone and the exclusion zone around Catalina remain in place .
In February , the next set of training exercises begins under a new set of rules laid out in a massive environmental impact statement that has already been challenged by the California Coastal Commission .
Last month , the 12 commissioners nudged the Navy to again turn off sonar any time a whale or dolphin is spotted within 1.2 miles or a reasonable distance away , among other considerations .
The Navy only wants to shut down its sonar when a marine mammal is seen within 220 yards .
“ This Supreme Court decision does n’t necessarily give the Navy a green light to do what it wants , ” said Delaplaine , who managed federal matters for the commissioners .
This could end up in court again , he said , or the Navy could decide to negotiate with the commission , which has certain powers to weigh in on federal activities under federal law .

Since the beginning of the year , local and national newspapers have painted many compelling portraits of average Americans overwhelmed by the foreclosure crisis .
Last week , for instance , the Wall Street Journal told of two sisters whose families bought homes using subprime mortgages side - by - side in Los Banos , Ca. , where they ultimately defaulted on their loans when their husbands lost their jobs as painters .
Also , the San Antonio Express chronicled the story of a middle income family whose woes began after the family ’s husband lost his job as manager of a local call center .
The New York Times weighed in with the sad tale of Patricia Reyes , who lost her home of five years when she fell ill last year and lost her job .
Though these are recent stories , their type have been a staple for months now among newspapers .
Last February , just as the foreclosure story was starting to gain traction , the Newark Star - Ledger chronicled the plight of Charmaine Perryman -- who could n’t make payments on her subprime mortgage after she lost her job as a child - care provider .
That same month , as defaults were growing in Minnesota , the Minneapolis Star - Tribune told the story of Michael Kelley , a respiratory therapist whose credit fell apart in 2004 after a divorce that ultimately cost him his home , and Sarah Shannon , who got hit with a big bill for emergency dental work , then lost her job and eventually her home .
No one will ever accuse our media of a lack of compassion , but still , in reading over these stories and dozens of others like them , I ca n’t help but notice how frequently they mischaracterize the foreclosure crisis in America .
The central illustration in these articles and many others like them is of Americans overwhelmed by circumstances beyond their control , from job losses to health problems to personal crises like divorce which ultimately cost them their homes .
But this is not what this foreclosure crisis has been about up to this point .
At any time , including the best of times , one can find homeowners struck by unanticipated personal reversals who lose their homes .
That does n’t account for the foreclosure mess we ’ve seen .
In particular , job losses have not been at the root of this problem , even if they are central to so many media tales .
As Prof. Stan J. Liebowitz of the University of Texas points out in his study , “ Anatomy of a Train Wreck , ” the foreclosure problems began in mid-2006 when the nation ’s unemployment rate was holding steady at a mere 4.6 percent .
What triggered the crisis were not layoffs but an end of the rise in home prices .
By contrast , in the economic slowdown that began earlier in this decade , unemployment started rising in early 2001 and peaked at 6.3 percent in mid-2003 but resulted in only a modest uptick in foreclosures by today ’s standards .
There are many clues about what has actually been going on that do n’t make their way into the media ’s stories .
One compelling piece of evidence is the sharp divergence in the performance of fixed - rate vs. adjustable - rate prime mortgages .
As Liebowitz observes , what we are currently seeing is often characterized as a subprime crisis , but in fact , it is an adjustable - rate mortgage problem .
Starting in mid-2006 , foreclosures jumped sharply for both prime and subprime ARMs , but not for fixed - rate mortgages of any kind , including subprime ones .
What ’s the difference ?
Well , ARMs draw a different kind of buyer , one who is often intent on selling or refinancing before rates re-set .
We have some idea of the extent to which this kind of buyer drove sales at the height of the housing bubble .
In 2005 , according to data from the National Association of Realtors , speculative home purchases , that is , purchases of homes for investment purposes that the buyer did n’t intend to live in , amounted to a whopping 28 percent of all deals , and 22 percent in 2006 .
“ These numbers are large enough that if only a minority of speculators defaulted when housing prices stopped increasing , it could explain all or most of the increases in foreclosures started , ” writes Liebowitz .
The data suggest that speculation was rampant among average Joes and Janes and not something primarily that high - end buyers or ‘ yuppie flippers ” engaged in ( as a hilarious Saturday Night Live skit suggested a few weeks ago ) .
Indeed , one thing that probably accounts for the large number of defaults in lower income and moderate income neighborhoods is that these buyers were most likely to engage in speculation , according to the data that Liebowitz has crunched .
He found that speculative purchases during the current bubble were higher as a neighborhood ’s average income decreased .
In neighborhoods where household income was about $ 40,000 , or about one - fifth below U.S. median family income , speculative mortgages accounted for one - third of all loans , while in census tracts where average income was nearly double the nation ’s median , speculative loans accounted for well under 10 percent of all mortgages .
Although you will rarely find a straightforward and accurate accounting of this and other issues , if you read press descriptions of the foreclosure crisis carefully , you can find all sorts of hints about what ’s really going on .
For instance , a number of stories point out that the foreclosure problem is persisting in part because so few people qualify for the federal government ’s bailout plan .
Typically these stories quote frustrated mortgage counselors at local community groups who say they would like to help more homeowners .
But many buyers do n’t qualify precisely because they made speculative loans or were intent on flipping their homes , and they instead walked away from their mortgages at the first sign of home depreciation .
These folks are n’t current on loans that have n’t even reset yet , and are n’t about to tough it out on a loan even if they can negotiate a lower monthly payment , because it will take years for the value of some of these homes to get back to the original selling price .
Why pay back a loan even at a lower rate courtesy of Uncle Sam if you can walk on it instead and suffer at most a hit to your credit score ?
Indeed , even before some of these folks bailed on their mortgage payments , they were looking to bail on their mortgages contracts .
In March of 2007 , the Miami Herald noted in one of the few realistic stories about how we got in this mess that buyers were flooding local real estate lawyers with requests to get out of contracts because home prices had hit the skids in Florida .
'' The scary thing is , people who have flaked on me tell me they have like five other contracts in other buildings under construction , ” one real estate developer told the paper .
Added a local lawyer : '' These are not people who have been wronged .
These are flippers who would n't be saying anything if the market was going well . ''
As Prof .
Liebowitz notes , markets where speculative buying went on are n’t a small part of this problem , but a big chunk of it .
Defaults in California and Florida alone have accounted for 42 percent of subprime ARM defaults nationwide in the second quarter of 2008 .
Of course , rising unemployment may play a role in the next round of foreclosures , especially as the larger implications of this credit mess have spread throughout the economy and driven down the stock market , bankrupted financial institutions and cut people ’s equity in their homes .
But that ’s speculation about the future of foreclosures , not a description of the immediate past .
Why , then , is the typical media narrative so at odds with the facts ?
Knowing the way reporters work , I ’m guessing that in many of these stories , the press finds their examples by calling their local social service agency specializing in mortgage counseling , which promptly serves up a compelling example of someone subjected to sudden , Dickensian reversals of fortune in their lives .
By contrast , finding your typical home speculator and flipper , the kind inspired by TV shows like Flip This House and by infomercials on how to make loads of money in real estate , is n’t all that easy .
Even if you can track someone like that down , he is n’t about to expose himself willingly to the sharp glare of media scrutiny .
Besides , focusing on buyers who are bailing on their mortgages at the first sign of trouble dramatically changes the tone of a story , especially when you find that many of these people are not slick out - of - town investors or greedy yuppie flippers , but maybe just the folks next door .
There are many types of people whom your local reporter and editor are pleased to characterize as greedy and irresponsible , but the working - class guy across the street or the retired couple down the block rashly playing the market are not among them .
When it comes to the roots of the crisis , to echo Jack Nicholson ’s character in A Few Good Men , I wonder if the media can handle the truth ?

A former aeronautics and Formula 1 engineer with the seemingly crazy idea of building cars that run on compressed air has convinced a European airline to use his " AirPods " to ferry passengers around airports in France and Amsterdam .
Guy Nègre has been tinkering with compressed air vehicles for about 20 years , but he and his company , Motor Development International , have done little more than build some prototypes that have garnered interest from the likes of India 's giant automaker Tata Motors and an American startup called Zero Emissions Motors .
With Air France / KLM officials announcing they will give the vehicles a six - month test in the rough - and - tumble environment of two busy airports , Nègre may finally prove his vehicles are more than hot air .
The airline says AirPods will carry passengers between departure gates at Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris and Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam .
The AirPods slated for airport duty will be the first operational version of MDI ’s Air Car concept , which is vying for the Progressive Automotive X - Prize .
The AirPod carries four people in a vehicle that is about 6 feet long and weighs roughly 450 pounds .
Its single - piston engine is driven by compressed air .
The tank holds 175 liters of compressed air , according to Zero Pollution Motors , and can be filled to 350 bar ( 5,076 psi ! ) in as little as 90 seconds .
That 's enough to give the AirPod a range of about 135 miles and a top speed of 43 mph .
MDI wo n't be building Air Cars .
Rather , it 's counting on licensing agreements with Tata and Zero Emissions Motors to bring the world Air Cars by 2010 or 2011 .
If the idea of a zero-emissions car that runs on air sounds too good to be true , we share your skepticism .
Besides the continuing production delays , a promised top speed of 90 MPH and range of 848 miles for the AirFlow model seem — to put it mildly — over promise .
Tata is n't convinced the technology is quite ready for prime time , and Andrew Frank , a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California at Davis , told The New York Times , “ It 's a losing game because the efficiency is just not there . ”
Everything about the Air Car seems to suggest an “ It ’s a Small World ” - sort of innocence .
MDI 's industrial model for “ micro production ” imagines incredibly green cars being produced all over the world at fractions of typical costs .
But none of the technology has ever been proven , which is why the tests of the AirPod at Schiphol and de Gaulle airports are so important .
Yet even the limited scope of the AirPod ’s test run at two airports seems to speak to a major lag in a technology that may fill little more than a tiny niche .
A car that runs on air is a cool idea in theory .
But as the battle to replace gas heats up , it looks the AirCar could be little more than vaporware .

As the Thanksgiving holiday approaches , there 's a lot of talk about what we 're thankful for .
It 's not a religious holiday ( one thing many atheists and agnostics are thankful for ) .
Thanksgiving is n't in holy books .
It centres on getting together to eat yourselves silly .
If you 're so inclined , Thanksgiving can be religious .
Giving thanks is an excellent theme for prayers .
It 's a harvest festival , and in my California school we were taught to sing that God , our maker , doth provide the harvest .
This meant no more to me than the part about all being safely gathered in ere the winter storms begin .
Those were n't my beliefs , and that was n't my climate .
( Good song , though . )
But atheists , agnostics , and other non-devout people also feel the urge to give thanks .
It 's sometimes odd to hear this , because " thank " is a transitive verb .
It takes an object , implying someone being thanked .
Whom is an atheist thanking ?
There are lots of work - arounds for this difficulty .
Instead of thanking God , you can thank goodness or your lucky stars .
You can just exclaim " thanks be ! "
You can thank specific people : thank Jim and Mary for bringing the marshmallow sweet potatoes ; thank Pat for making the long drive ; thank Ted for shutting the cat in the bedroom so the cat - allergic people can come .
But for such wonders as health and friendship , assigning credit is more difficult .
The best dodge is simply to say that you 're thankful .
Name what you 're full of thanks for , without saying full of thanks to whom .
What it comes down to is that an atheist is generally thankful for good luck , serendipity .
Luck is often personified , but I do n't know anyone who believes in Lady Luck .
" Somebody out there likes me ! " people joke .
Does it make sense to thank chance ?
" Thank you , dice ! " " Thank you , California state lottery ! "
People do it all the time .
I suspect that the urge to give thanks is a hardwired thing that helps us live as social animals .
It 's part of a suite of perceptions and behaviours that enable reciprocity and altruism .
The impulse to thank those who 've done good things for us , which happens to help us live comfortably with each other , is extended to religious realms .
Just as we seem to be hardwired to keep track of and punish those who cheat us , I suspect we 're hardwired to keep track of and thank our benefactors .
So perhaps emotions encourage us to feel thankful even if we do n't believe in a deity suitable for thanking .
It does n't make sense to thank chance , since chance did n't go out of its way for us .
But though it 's irrational to thank chance , I think there 's intellectual value to acknowledging it .
In the endless wrangles about the relative roles of genes versus environment in making us what we are , chance sometimes does n't get the credit it deserves .
Chance may be folded into the environment side of the equation , and geneticists recognise chance when they talk about genetic drift or founder effect .
But in our lives – and especially when assessing the lives of others – we often forget chance 's role .
We inspect the lives of the poor , unsuccessful , and sick for signs of bad upbringing , lack of initiative , and shallow values , and neglect to examine the role of fortune .
And what 's merely annoying when we smugly observe our neighbors and think " that could never happen to me , " is iniquitous when we bring it into public policy .
So if , in the general chitchat about thankfulness that comes at this time of year , our emotional heritage prompts atheists and agnostics to increase their intellectual focus on the role of chance – that 's something I 'm grateful for .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A government report released Thursday paints an alarming picture of an unstable future for international relations defined by waning American influence , a fragmentation of political power and intensifying struggles for increasingly scarce natural resources .
The report aims to better inform policymakers , starting with the administration of President - elect Barack Obama .
The report , " Global Trends 2025 : A Transformed World , " was drafted by the National Intelligence Council to better inform U.S. policymakers -- starting with the incoming administration of President - elect Barack Obama -- about the factors most likely to shape major international trends and conflicts through the year 2025 .
" Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor , the United States ' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained , " says the report , which is the fourth in a series from the Intelligence Council .
The report argues that the " international system -- as constructed following the second World War -- will be almost unrecognizable by 2025 owing to the rise of emerging powers , a globalizing economy , an historic transfer of relative wealth and economic power from West to East , and the growing influence of nonstate actors . "
It argues that the world is in the midst of an unprecedented " transfer of global wealth and power " -- from West to East -- that is being fueled by long - term " increases in oil and commodity prices " along with a gradual shift of manufacturing and certain service industries to Asia .
And yet , while American power and influence are projected to decline , America 's burdens are not .
" Despite the recent rise in anti-Americanism , the U.S. probably will continue to be seen as a much - needed regional balancer in the Middle East and Asia , " the report notes .
The American military will continue to be expected to play a leading role in the war against global terrorism , though the United States as a whole will be less able to " call the shots without the support of strong partnerships . "
America 's biggest rival by 2025 , the reports says , will be China .
" China is poised to have more impact on the world over the next 20 years than any other country , " it notes .
The report projects that China will have the world 's second largest economy by 2025 and will be a leading military power .
Equally problematic for U.S. policymakers is the fact that China is expected to become the world 's biggest polluter and largest importer of natural resources .
China will not be alone , however , in terms of its desire to provide a consumption - oriented American lifestyle to a rapidly growing population .
Countries such as India and , to a lesser extent , Indonesia , Iran and Turkey , will also likely see their power -- and desire for natural resources -- increase .
The report predicts that , the recent economic downturn aside , " unprecedented global economic growth " will mean that the demand for basic resources such as food , water and oil " will outstrip easily available supplies " over the next decade .
As an estimated 1.2 billion people are added to the world population over the next 20 years , the demand for food will rise by 50 percent , the report projects .
The lack of access to stable water supplies will also worsen due to rapid global urbanization , it says .
Further complicating matters is the fact that while demand for energy is projected to rise , oil and gas production will continue to be " concentrated in unstable areas , " it says .
The world in 2025 is therefore likely to find itself in the midst of a " fundamental energy transition away from oil toward natural gas , coal and other alternatives . "
Such a transformation , however , may not stave off armed conflict driven largely by the struggle for scarce resources , the report says .
While conflicts are still most likely to " revolve around trade , investments , and technological innovation and acquisition , " the report states that " we cannot rule out a 19th century - like scenario of arms races , territorial expansion , and military rivalries . "
Terrorism is also expected to remain a major issue through 2025 , though its appeal could be significantly reduced if economic and political liberalization accelerates in the Middle East .
" In the absence of employment opportunities and legal means for political expression , conditions will be ripe for disaffection , growing radicalism and possible recruitment of youths into terrorist groups , " the report argues .
Adding to complications in the always - volatile Middle East will be Iran 's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons , which could trigger a regional nuclear arms race , the report says .
Continuing tensions between India and Pakistan also add to concerns regarding nuclear proliferation , it says .

5w30 vs 10w30 – What ’s the Difference Between These Motor Oils
By David Broder - October 17 , 2008
WASHINGTON - John McCain 's answer to the first question in Wednesday night 's debate was an acknowledgment that " Americans are hurting right now , and they 're angry . "
He said it twice , so there could be no missing the message .
Barack Obama quickly agreed .
" Everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , " he said .
The answers were typical of the personality differences that voters have learned from watching these three debates .
McCain dealt with the shattering economic news by focusing on the emotional reactions , while Obama , professorial as usual , wanted to put it into a historical context .
But the larger point for both the candidates and the country is that real - world events are driving politics far more than politicians can affect the course of events .
As they quickly confirmed , neither candidate has much more to offer than modest variations on the actions already undertaken by the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve .
George Bush 's job approval ratings hit new lows in last week 's polls , but in this economic meltdown , his is the only game in town .
McCain and Obama -- two of the less influential senators when it comes to issues of banking , budgets and taxes -- can no more seize the moment with decisive action than can the plumber Joe Wurzelbacher , who became a foil for their debate .
When McCain tried three weeks ago to insert himself into the drama by announcing that he was suspending campaigning and flying back to Washington , he ended up simply dramatizing his own irrelevance .
Obama was smarter to play it cool , and the polls show he has benefited .
Confidence in his performance has grown and his margins over McCain have improved nationally and in most of the battleground states .
As the race comes down to the final two weeks , the tactical advantages are almost all on Obama 's side .
Having broken his word on public financing , he has vastly more money than McCain to flood the airwaves with ads , and a deeper field operation of volunteer - staffed local headquarters .
The public distemper with George Bush is so pervasive now that nearly all the candidates running on the Republican ticket -- not just McCain but senators and representatives who thought they were well ahead -- have seen their polls turn sickly .
When Obama accused McCain in the debate of offering nothing but a continuation of Bush 's policies , McCain protested , " I am not President Bush .
If you wanted to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago .
I 'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country . "
But his protestations are in vain .
So far as the voters I 've interviewed are concerned , there has been only one economic policy for the past eight years and it bears the name of George Bush .
Even now , with the bankruptcy of that policy , it is only the Republican White House calling the signals .
Given the near - impossibility of McCain 's position , Obama should be enjoying a near - waltz through every possible challenge .
The topics on the final debate were made - to - order for any Democrat .
Once they quit arguing about the economy , and the character of their own campaigns , they turned to trade , health care , the Supreme Court and education .
Despite the fact that he was playing on the Democrats ' turf , McCain made a spirited case for himself on all these topics .
And he made a better case for Sarah Palin than she perhaps deserved -- given the damage her candidacy has caused McCain among suburban independents .
But whether they have been standing or seated , rooted in place or wandering the stage , Obama has usually managed to assert his presence forcefully but quietly , no matter what McCain has tried to do .
McCain 's real opponents in this race are the economic collapse and the shattered political reputation Bush has inflicted on Republicans .
But Obama has done his part by avoiding any errors and presenting a minimal target to the opposition .
As a first - time candidate , he has looked consistently self - assured .
And assurance is a valuable commodity in times like these .
Congressman says civil unrest after meltdown could lead to martial law
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Friday , September 26 , 2008
Congressman Ron Paul says that the bailout bill is likely to pass , heralding a 10 - year plus economic depression for America and the potential for martial law should civil unrest arise as the financial meltdown worsens .
Speaking on The Alex Jones Show , Paul said of the bailout , “ They want dictatorship , they want to pass all the penalties and suffering on to the average person on Main Street , ” adding , “ We will have a depression or recession , it ’s locked in place due to previous Federal Reserve actions . ”
“ When they say that if we do n’t do exactly as they say and turn over more of our money and more of our liberties and exempt themselves from any court in the whole nation , they ’re trying to intimidate us and lead us into doing the wrong thing , ” said Paul .
The Congressman added that serious problems would arise if nothing was done to address the problem , but that more serious consequences would follow should the bailout be passed .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Paul warned that the only question was whether the meltdown would last one year or ten years and how much liberty would be lost in that time frame .
“ It looks like from I see in Congress , that they ’re opting for a decade plus of depression rather than saying let ’s correct our ways , let ’s balance the budget , let ’s bring our troops home , ” said Paul , adding that the same course of printing money would continue – prolonging the agony and preventing a necessary correction .
Asked if civil unrest was a possibility in the midst of an economic depression , referencing a recent Army Times report concerning the use of active duty military being brought back from Iraq for “ Homeland patrols ” and “ crowd control , ” Paul questioned , “ Are we going to have martial law or are we going to have more freedoms ?
The more problems that we have , the more likely it is that we ’re going to have martial law , so I do think they anticipate and they plan for these things . ”
Asked if criminal investigations and prosecutions of individuals on Wall Street should commence , Paul agreed but said that the main target of criminal inquiry should be the Federal Reserve board itself because , “ That ’s where the fraud is . ”
“ They want to be lawless , they do n’t want to be held accountable , ” he added .
Paul said that grand juries should be convened to take on prosecutions rather than the FBI becoming involved , stating , “ We have proper authority with that and experience with it and the Enron case is a good example . ”

The Congressman said that Greenspan and Bernanke should be criminally charged but that such an effort would be largely symbolic .
“ Morally speaking , they ’re the culprits , ” said Paul .
Asked what his solution to the crisis would be , Paul said , “ I think the most important thing to do is to send the message that we ’re going to quit living beyond our means and the president can set the standard for that and he has the most control under the Constitution on foreign policy – he can say no more wars , we ’re done with the wars , we ’re not going to take on the Russians , we ’re not going to take on people in Venezuela , we ’re going to start talking to the Cubans and bring our troops home and save hundreds of billions of dollars – that would send a powerful message that the dollar would respond to and oil prices would come down . ”
Paul said that Americans had to accept a new idea of government that harked back to what the founders envisaged and that the welfare state would have to unravel along with aspirations of building a geopolitical empire .
“ In the meantime the policy ought to be – shrink the size of government , decrease regulation , work towards sound money , remove the authority of the Fed to create money out of thin air and get tax reduction , ” stated the Congressman .
Paul added that eliminating the income tax would mean everybody becoming a lot richer and more money would be ploughed into the economy .
“ It will not solve the problem , it just delays the inevitable , ” said Paul of the bailout , adding that he expects the bill to pass in a move that would , “ Defy the American people . ”
“ I think they get to the point where they think they ’re like God and can control everything and they do n’t realize that the market really is more powerful than all the bankers and all the politicians … .
Ultimately the underground economy is the real economy and I think they could over step themselves and hopefully we could come out with a better world afterwards , ” concluded the Congressman .

On a daily basis as a straight person … Crossposted Via The The Painted Turtle
In 1970 , a Japanese roboticist named Masahiro Mori described what he called the " uncanny valley " - a point on a graph relating human affinity for a machine to its likeness of humans themselves , where human affinity plummets as the likeness becomes nearly indistinguishable from ourselves .
As robots become more humanlike , our fondness for them increases .
But when machines reach a point where they look so much like us that we can barely tell they 're different from us , Mori postulated that we 'll feel repulsed instead of affectionate .
Since we have n't been able to produce robots that are nearly indistinguishable from humans yet , it 's somewhat difficult to know whether Mori is correct .
However , with a new empathetic humanoid robot , researchers at the Bristol Robotics Laboratory in the UK have brought us a step closer to the rim of the uncanny valley .
A graphic representation of the uncanny valley .
Notice that if the object moves , the affinity or revulsion caused by the machine becomes much more pronounced .

The last decade or so has seen an explosion in the development of humanoid robots .
For instance , in 2003 the University of Osaka unveiled Actroid - a lifelike robot modeled after a Japanese woman who was able to understand and respond to 40,000 different phrases in four languages and perform natural movements .
The newest version of the Actroid , the DER2 , is capable of numerous facial expressions as well .
Actroids are now in production and available for rent in Japan , where they are rented by companies for events .
Bristol 's Robotics Lab has been working on a similar project .
They 've just demonstrated a new prototype of a robotic head and face that can produce non-repetitive facial behavior designed to generate empathy by taking cues from the person speaking to it .
" Our particular interest is in how , and to what extent one can achieve the illusion of psychological attending and understanding even though it lacks ' true ' intelligence .
We aim to find new approaches towards enhancing human - likeness by generating genuine , non-repetitive facial behaviour that conveys a certain underlying emotional state .
" The BRL projects that household robots will be ubiquitous in the next 25 years , just as personal computers are today : " It seems very likely that robotic devices will be a pervasive element of our future society ; there are many indications that this will be a huge opportunity for life enhancement and commercial exploitation .
" Left : The Actroid DER Robot .
Right : The BRL's Empathetic Robot Prototype .

In a future where service robots are used frequently , empathy may turn out to be important in a variety of situations , such as providing companionship for the elderly or as a tour guide .
The BRL researchers stress that there is much work to be done before even the illusion of empathy can be accurately created .
" This will require ‘ theory of mind ’ models as well as dynamic emotional models .
We are collaborating with computer graphics specialists who are able to extract ‘ characteristic ’ features from images and use these to create novel action sequences with qualitatively the same behaviour as the example set . "
In short , a large part of the challenge is identifying the huge number of complex facial expressions humans make and providing the robot with an accurate framework for identifying and reproducing those expressions .
The researchers are getting close - a video of the prototype contemplating its existence is posted on YouTube , and it shows a machine that 's impressively human but still easily distinguishable from a real person .
The BRL also has groups working on creating robots that can make life - like human gestures and can receive tactile feedback , all of which will hopefully be integrated into a complete robot .
Whether any robot will fall into the uncanny valley soon is impossible to determine .
We may be decades away from a robot even remotely real enough to inspire the sort of revulsion Miro predicted .
On top of that , it 's possible that the uncanny valley does n't even exist since we have n't created machines close enough to reality to test it .
Either way , we may never know until the technology gets better .

Link of the day - The Paradox of Choice : Why More Is Less
On a shady lane in New Hope , Pa. , a quiet revolution in American culture may be taking shape .
Here , a family of four lives in a white , colonial - style house in a manner that once would have been considered All - American but more recently has been seen as just plain weird :
They 're frugal .
Meet Leah Ingram , Bill Behre , and daughters Jane , 13 , and Annie , 11 .
They walk most everywhere , they rarely eat out , they sometimes buy clothing at consignment shops , and they turn the lights off when they leave a room .
Theirs is no hard - luck - in - a- recession story .
The Ingram - Behre family is solidly middle - class , fully employed , and not especially threatened by the conniptions gripping Wall Street .
Behre , 43 , is a dean at the College of New Jersey , while Ingram , 42 , is a successful freelance writer and etiquette expert .
They have no credit card debt .
That 's now .
A little more than a year ago , the family was ensnared in America 's consume - at - all - costs culture .
During the days of soaring home prices and easy credit , they took out a $ 101,000 home - equity loan on a previous house and spent lavishly on a lifestyle upgrade — going on three cruises in two years and taking the kids on annual pilgrimages to Disney World .
" After 9/11 it became patriotic to shop , and we became as patriotic as anybody , " laments Behre , sitting in the dining room after a meal of chicken stir - fry — washed down with tap water .
Ingram and Behre are harbingers of a dawning Age of Frugality .
People who overconsumed during the past decade are now rejecting extravagant lifestyles .
They 're spending less , and more wisely .
Some are getting their finances in order .
Others are fearful of losing their jobs , shocked by investment losses , or hunkering down amid the general uncertainty .
The penny - pinching is already showing up in the numbers ; this quarter could mark the first fall in personal consumption in 17 years .
And with credit tight and Americans loaded down with $ 2.6 trillion in personal debt , consumer borrowing dropped in August , the first such contraction since 1991 .
Menzie D. Chinn , who teaches economics at the University of Wisconsin , figures consumers wo n't be in a position to spend freely for five years .
Which brings us to what John Maynard Keynes called the paradox of thrift .
What 's good for the individual , argued the famous economist , can ignite or deepen a recession .
But that wo n't deter the newly thrifty .
" I ca n't help the economy , " says Kim Schultz , a resident of hard - hit Avoca , Mich. , who with her husband , Jon , owes $ 40,000 in credit - card debt .
" I 've got to help myself . "
On the other hand , this newfound austerity could — emphasis on could — rewire Americans as savers rather than spenders .
And that would help put the economy on a sounder footing over the long haul .
Thrift has gone in and out of style since the founding of the republic .
In the McGuffey Reader of the 19th century , Benjamin Franklin was held up as a paragon of virtue for his frugal ways .
Later , people who lived through the Great Depression were in some cases marked for life by the experience .
Typical of them is Bernard Handel , an 82 - year - old resident of Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , who grew up poor in the Bronx .
In the early 1930s , his father 's grocery store failed and his dad could n't find another job for several years .
To this day , even though Handel became very wealthy , he shops for food with coupons , drives a Honda , and takes the subway rather than taxis .
" I just do n't believe in throwing money away , " he says .
A RUDE AWAKENING
Handel 's baby - boomer children grew up without psychological scars from the Depression .
And the boomers ' children have come of age in an era of abundance , easy credit , and a taste for luxury .
So it 's no wonder that the sudden need for thrift comes as an upsetting shock for many .
Some are calling for a massive public education effort on the level of the anti-drunk - driving and anti-smoking campaigns that have been so successful .
" We want to build a culture that 's more hospitable to thrift , so it 's not seen as odd but fostered and nudged along , " says Barbara Dafoe Whitehead , co-author of For a New Thrift : Confronting the Debt Culture , a new report from The Institute for American Values , a think tank .
To be sure , there are odd moments on the journey to a thriftier lifestyle .
To demonstrate , Bill Behre pulls out a mobile phone and twists it back and forth so the light glints off of rhinestones glued on by daughter Annie before she got a new phone .
Behre 's own phone was ruined in a rainstorm , so he 's using this gaudy hand - me - down until he can get a free replacement in March .
" This is the ultimate in frugal , " he says .
It was Ingram who got things started .
She was raised by a thrifty mother , but by the time she married Behre , mom 's influence had worn off and she 'd amassed $ 30,000 in credit - card debt .
Controlling spending was hit or miss until the early 2000s , when the family embarked on a shopping spree .
Things nearly spun out of control after they upgraded to a better house .
Despite raiding their retirement funds to help with the down payment , they ended up with higher monthly payments .
Ingram remembers the day , May 24 , 2007 , they sold their previous home , and realized her family would take away only $ 60,000 even though the place had nearly doubled in value , to $ 490,000 .
" I was practically nauseated when I realized what our out - of - control spending had done , " she says .
She and Behre made a pact :
They would live more frugally .
Then they broke the news to the kids .
No more cruises or Disney vacations .
They 'd get an allowance of $ 20 a month .
And they'd be walking to school , the store , and friends ' houses .
The girls were intrigued at first .
Then they realized their comfortable , materialistic lives were really changing .
Annie , whose shopping - for - pleasure habit had been indulged by her parents , suddenly had to make do at a secondhand store called Plato 's Closet .
Now the girls are resigned to this new way of life .
Sticking to the program requires vigilance .
When Ingram does drive , she calculates the relative costs of traveling a few more miles to get gas for a few cents cheaper .
And on the rare occasions they do go out to dinner , she feels guilty .
" I want to keep myself accountable , " she says .
" I do n't want to backslide . "
So far , the plan is working .
In the old days , the family overspent their checking account by an average of $ 300 a month — dipping into the home - equity funds to make up the difference .
Now they 're in the black by about $ 800 a month .
Since making their big changes , they accelerated payments on a car loan and managed to pay it off .
Ingram has started a blog , The Lean Green Family , where she encourages others to be more frugal .
She and Behre say they 've learned valuable lessons .
One is to be flexible : Give yourself a treat every now and then .
Another is to have a goal .
They 're saving for a new recreation room .
" Being frugal is like dieting , " says Behre .
" It 's more sustainable if you have a target you 're aiming for . "
As joblessness creeps up , many more Americans will receive their own crash course in frugality .
It has already happened to Ned Penberthy , 53 , a salesman who lives in Pelham , N.Y .
He recently got a new job , took a cut in base pay , and has been living the frugal lifestyle ever since .
Penberthy says he's in it for the long haul — willing to spend more up front to reap savings over the next several years .
He installed expensive but energy - sipping CFL light bulbs in his house , and replaced some of his appliances with more efficient ones .
For him , every penny counts .
For instance , he switched from shaving cream to a bar of shaving soap .
He figures he saves $ 6 a year that way .
" It 's not much , but there 's a psychological benefit , " he says .
Like a lot of boomers , Penberthy has a nest egg , but many people in their 20s and 30s have little to fall back on .
To get on track , they have to learn the difference between necessities and discretionary spending .
" They need to go back to [ psychologist Abraham ]
Maslow 's hierarchy of needs — food , clothing , shelter , and transportation , " says Kristine E. Miele , a financial planner .
She 's offering " Lessons for Life " classes , gradually weaning young people off their spending habits one luxury at a time .
In the past , consumers have gone shopping the moment the sun came out .
But this time ?
Market researchers trying to divine the consumer psyche are picking up signs that attitudes are changing .
Booz & Co. recently conducted a survey of nearly 1,000 households .
Among other findings , 43 % of respondents said they are eating at home more and 25 % said they were cutting spending on hobbies and sports activities .
In both cases , most said they 'd continue doing so even when the economy improves .
Much the way pump prices have prompted many Americans to forsake SUVs for small cars , the collapse of home values and 401 ( k ) s will make consumers think twice before hitting the mall .

Geek Armageddon : " Watchmen " Case Reaches Its Climax
Posted by Zach Lowe
In our short life , the Am Law Daily has never read two motions for summary judgment as different as those filed by legal teams for Warner Bros . and 20th Century Fox in their rights dispute over " Watchmen , " the movie due in March based on the famous 1986 graphic novel about a disgraced band of superheroes .
It 's as if the two sides are talking about completely different movies .
The two sides filed their motions Tuesday , and the suit will come to a head during a hearing on Dec. 15 -- a hearing that could derail the unveiling of a movie that comic book geeks have waited two decades for .
In one corner , we have Warners , the studio producing the $ 100 million - plus movie .
Originally represented by Glaser , Weil , Fink , Jacobs & Shapiro , the studio was confident in its claim that Fox gave up all rights to the film in a convoluted series of deals with an independent producer , Lawrence Gordon , in the early 1990s .
They were confident , that is , until August , when a federal judge ruled that Fox may have a claim and refused to grant Warners ' motion to dismiss the Fox suit .
It was a huge victory for the Fox team from Alston & Bird , which claims the studio still has distribution rights and that Warners was required to give
Fox the right of first refusal before going ahead with the film .
Perhaps taken aback , Warners reached out to a big Hollywood gun : Irell & Manella 's Steven Marenberg .
Marenberg most recently guided " Lord of the Rings " director Peter Jackson to a $ 40 million settlement with New Line Cinema over payouts from the blockbuster " Lord " trilogy ( an Am Law Daily favorite ) .
New Line at that point was a Warner subsidiary ; apparently they liked what they saw across the table in Marenberg .
Marenberg , like all the lawyers the Am Law Daily has tried to interview about the " Watchmen " case , declined to comment .
The two sides take very different strategies in their motions filed this week .
Warners comes out firing , saying Fox , even if it did once own a right of first refusal , gave it up by not exercising it for more than a decade while three different studios batted around possible " Watchmen " projects .
They characterize Fox 's suit as a last - minute attempt to attach itself to a film that looks like it will be a hit .
But later in their motion , the studio says it 's willing to accept a partial summary judgment ruling .
What that means is unclear ; it could mean that Fox will end up with a percentage of distribution rights or that Warners will pay Fox an unknown amount to secure full rights to the movie .
Fox , on the other hand , is going for a home run .
They ask for nothing less than the sole right to produce " Watchmen " and distribute it in the U.S. and abroad .
The eyes of comic book geeks around the world will be on Judge Gary Feess 's courtroom in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California next month .
( For a full history of the " Watchmen " film , see this long but thorough story in the Los Angeles Times ) .

McCain's Concession Speech
Tonight in Phoenix , Arizona , John McCain conceded the election to Barack Obama .
Following are excerpts from an interview with Abd Al - Bari ' Atwan , editor - in - chief of the London daily Al - Quds Al - Arabi .
The interview aired on BBC Arabic TV on November 7 , 2008 :
To view this clip on MEMRI TV , visit http://www.memri.org/legacy/clip/1906 .
Interviewer : " Is it really so difficult to achieve a breakthrough in the Arab ruling system , similar to what happened in the U.S ?
Will it take decades or centuries , Abd Al - Bari ' Atwan ? "
Abd Al - Bari ' Atwan : " By coincidence , at a time when a black president was elected in the U.S. , President Bouteflika amended the Algerian constitution so that he could remain in power for the rest of his life .
" What a paradox this is .
In the U.S. , not only is the change of power carried out by peaceful means , but there is [ now ] a black president - [ who came ] from the lowest ranks of society to the top .
" If Obama was in an Arab country , like Saudi Arabia or one of the Gulf states , they might have required him to have a ' guarantor ' [ like any foreign worker ] .
Under no circumstances - even if he died - would they have given him citizenship .
They 'd say to him :
You are a slave , you are black , you need a ' guarantor , ' you are a Kenyan , and your origins are unknown .
" I 'm sad to say that we Arabs are the epitome of racism .
Look at the foreign [ workers ] in the Gulf - they have no rights .
These workers demonstrate , demanding to be placed 10 , rather than 20 , in a room , demanding to be transported in buses like human beings , rather than in trucks like beasts .
" We are the epitome of racism , and I believe that Obama will demand that these Arab countries carry out reforms : First , to abolish the ' guarantor ' system , and then to grant rights not only to the blacks , but even to the Arabs themselves , to the whites .
The whites in the Arab world are humiliated .
Unless you have the ' holy ' citizenship of a certain country - you are humiliated .
Republican caught on tape stealing opponent 's campaign signs David Edwards and Nick Juliano

It 's not unusual for political miscreants to steal campaign signs from neighbors ' yards when election time comes around , but rarely is it done by the candidate himself .
That did n't stop a Republican county commissioner in Kansas .
Unfortunately for the candidate , who decided to take the mischief - making into his own hands , he was caught on tape in the process .
The Kansas City Star reported : " Olathe police cited Johnson County Commissioner John M. Toplikar of Olathe on a charge of misdemeanor theft over the weekend after he allegedly stole two campaign signs belonging to his opponent , Calvin Hayden of De Soto .
" Hayden 's wife , Kelly , and a campaign volunteer videotaped the thefts Saturday afternoon across the street from the Johnson County Election Office .
She notified police , who found the signs in Toplikar 's van .
" Hayden , who retired this year after a 27 - year career with the Johnson County Sheriff 's Office , has filed four police reports for stolen and damaged signs .
He is pressing charges against Toplikar , who has been on the County Commission since 2003 . "
While the position is non-partisan , John M. Toplikar was listed as Republican in 2006 on Johnson County 's website .
KansasCity.com also identified Toplikar as a Republican .
YouTube hosts dozens of videos documenting the theft or vandalism of campaign signs .
In most instances it is signs advertising presidential candidates that are targeted , and supporters sometimes retaliate against the vandals .
In Ohio , a man became so frustrated at teens who knocked over a John McCain sign in his front yard that he fired a rifle at the teens ' car , wounding one of them .

I t's been said a certain percentage of auto racing fans go to these events to see a crash .
The more mayhem , the better .
They do n't necessarily want to see people die , but as the old adage of a gaper 's block applies , people can't take their eyes away from a good accident .
I suppose individuals like myself must fall into the same category .
I just finished watching Treasury Secretary Pat Paulson 's press conference where he discussed just who would be entitled to the first installment of over $ 350 billion targeted for the Wall Street bail - out .
I 'm sorry , Pat Paulson was a comedian who frequently appeared on the Smothers Brothers show back in the late ' 60's , but Henry M. Paulson 's act was nearly as comical , except for the fact King Paulson 's decisions will affect America for generations to come .
In essence , Secretary Paulson told a multitude of reporters gathered the bail - out money was beginning to flow out of the U.S. Treasury .
He had some bad news , at least temporarily , for the auto industry .
GM , Ford and Chrysler will only be receiving $ 25 billion in American tax dollars .
But never fear , there is always hope the auto industry , encouraged by the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) Union , will get the other $ 50 billion they are seeking in the second half of the bail - out money which has to be approved for release by Congress .
Oh , by the way , for you home owners in danger of going into foreclosure , Paulson said you 'll have to bite the bullet like the rest of ... oops .
Too bad you did n't need a few billion because then you 'd have money to give back to the politicians .
Remember , quid pro quo .
I have only one question for the Bush administration and both Democratic and Republican elected officials :
Where will the gravy train stop and , for that matter , where did they receive the mandate from voters to turn America 's economy into a bastion of socialism ?
We have all learned some interesting things about the bail - out which were conveniently shared with the American people after Congress stamped its approval on this give away of all give aways .
Americans have learned banks and financial institutions who did n't need government assistance will receive a nice stipend any way , permitting such institutions to buy out other banks , share vast increased profits with their CEO 's and more .
In addition , it has been revealed corrupt officials who helped lead the United States into this financial crisis may be prosecuted by the federal government .
The only problem is , these same corrupt officials can use the bail - out money to pay for their defense through the hiring of high - priced legal representation .
Only in Washington would this make sense .
But if we look deeply behind the reason for the bail - out in the first place , the pieces of the puzzle all fit together .
Before the election , both Senators Barack Obama and John McCain were in favor of the bail - out .
However , for those who follow politics closely , this did n't make sense from the start .
Democrats hate big corporations .
They see such institutions as the root of all social evils .
Yet Obama supported nearly $ 1 trillion of taxpayers money going to the Darth Vaders of the economic world .
In contrast , McCain and Republicans allegedly hate regulations .
One of the themes of the Reagan era said we needed to get big government out of our lives .
Yet John McCain not only supported the government give away , but suspended his presidential campaign at the most crucial of times and returned to Washington to make sure the legislation was passed .
Later on , McCain tried to claim he was against the bail - out .
But his words fell on deaf ears with the public and well they should .
The truth of the matter is all Americans received an unsavory look at how Washington , D.C. and Wall Street have combined forces in the effort to secure the solvency of the good ole boys club .
You see , there were financial fat cats who had dipped their grubby hands into the financial till too may times .
They were in trouble .
They were in big trouble and a few millions shifted around here and there would not solve their problem .
At the same time , Washington , D.C. politicians saw the end of their financial gravy train may be at hand .
If New York fat cats did n't have the money , there would be an end to the cushy deals U.S. Senators and U.S. Representatives have become accustomed to .
Fat cat lobbying jobs were at stake .
There would be less positions on the boards of financial institutions which guaranteed the future of every elected official and crony that made it to Washington .
It was a crisis .
As it was once said in Mel Brooks ' Blazing Saddles , the chant went up , " Gentlemen , we have to protect our phony baloney jobs " and there was no better way to do so than by propping up corrupt and failing financial institutions and the people who ran them .
For the first time , Americans had a chance to see the classic " I 'll scratch your back , if you scratch mine " scenario performed right in front of their eyes .
The only problem is , and do n't get me wrong , this is a big enough problem now that there are other industries with their hands out , including the auto makers , credit card companies and the list will get larger as time goes on .
The auto makers want relief because they have made deals with the UAW which are preventing them from seeing profits .
In comparison , an average member of the UAW makes $ 40 an hour with benefit packages that would make members of Congress salivate with envy .
When you buy a car from Toyota , roughly $ 400 of that price tag goes toward the health plans of auto workers .
When you buy a car from the big three auto makers , $ 1,500 of that cost is allocated for the health plan of its auto workers .
Is it any wonder why Chrysler , Ford and GM are on the brink of bankruptcy ?
By no fault of our own , we have all become part - owners of many financial institutions and the auto industry .
But none of us will see the profits from our taxpayer investment .
Oh yes , we are told the American taxpayer will eventually see a financial windfall from the bail - out , but that promise can go along with the assurance that " the check 's in the mail . "
I guess the individuals we are sending to Washington are playing us for fools and , if we keep sending the same people back , I guess we are .
Apple may not have wanted you to be able to check out the streets and buildings from up close in Google Maps but there ’s not much they can do to stop the hackers from figuring out ways around the artificially imposed restraints .
It did n’t take long for someone to come up with a workaround that enables Street View and other new features that Apple withheld from iPod touch users in the software update 2.2 .
As you might expect , it ’s a fairly complicated process which requires having jailbroken your device and the ability to modify system - level files on it remotely using the Terminal .
If that sort of thing is right up your alley and you do n’t mind the potential voiding of warranty coverage , check out this post from iPod touch Fans Forum member ‘ timmyj9 ’ .
Now that it ’s clear that the new features are already there on the device and have intentionally been disabled by Apple , I ’m starting to believe that it might indeed have something to do with the Sarbanes - Oxley Act after all ( which restricts Apple from adding new features to products after they ’ve been sold unless the sales are being accounted for on a subscription basis ) .
I was a bit suspicious because Apple did add the new podcast download feature in the last update while omitting this one , but if they have it disabled on intent , I ’m pretty sure they intend to enable it in a future ( possibly paid ) update .
I do not , however , suspect that they are doing it to avoid feature parity between the iPhone and iPod touch .
That said , it still is weird that Apple can account for the iPhone and Apple TV on a subscription basis to work around the Sarbanes - Oxley limitation but not for the iPod touch .
Is it because the former two are brand new platforms and need this added incentive to catch on , while the iPod lineup does n’t ?
Let us know your thoughts in the comments below .

We do not assume any liability should your iPod touch suffer any damage as a result of your trying the process mentioned above .
We assume you already know that but we ’re just too darned scared of those lawyer - types to take any chances .

Maintaining skill in both layouts
When I first started learning the Colemak keyboard layout , I tried to maintain a skill in both QWERTY and Colemak simultaneously .
This was actually not too difficult to do since Colemak keeps many keys in the same place , and the result after 30 days of practice was 104 WPM for Colemak and 95 WPM for QWERTY ( down from 104 WPM at the start ) .
After this little experiment , I discovered a nice way to switch to Colemak on other computers that did not have it installed : simply type in http://www.ryanheise.com/colemak.exe ( provided that computer has Internet access ) and the layout will automatically change .
For computers without Internet access , you might carry the exe on a USB disk .
Now , I do not bother with QWERTY anymore ( although it seems my fingers still have the muscle memory ) .
For those interested in maintaining a skill in both layouts , my strategy was to type in QWERTY for about 5 - 10 minutes each morning immediately after waking up , and then to switch to Colemak for the rest of the day .
You may find it surprisingly easy to switch back and forth .
Tips for learning
After the plateau at 50 WPM , I decided to pay attention to my weaknesses , and I noticed that my most commonly mistyped character was " G " .
After simply focusing on " G " as I typed , my speed instantly jumped up into the 60s .
When I got into the 90s , progress was quite slow getting up above 100 WPM .
What helped was to practice by typing with a steady rhythm , using the same amount of time to think about each character .
This forced me to take the time I needed to catch common mis-presses before they happened , something that I think would have taken much longer to correct otherwise .
Now that my speed is above 100 WPM , my typing technique works something like this : by default , force myself to type at a steady pace -- but , when I see words or strings of words that I know I can type very quickly ( e.g. using known finger rolls ) then I remember to speed up on those , -- and , when I see words that I know I have problems with , I remember to slow down and type carefully .
This , I have found , is the fastest way for me to type , as it tends to eliminate a lot of wasted time introducing and correcting mistakes .
However , it requires being aware of your strong and weak words .
What is my current typing speed ?
My current typing speed record can be watched below .

Keyboard bindings for Vim
Vim is an extremely efficient text editor that I use for writing emails and editing any sort of text file .
Vim 's commands are all controlled from the keyboard : ' d ' for delete , 'w ' to move the cursor forward one word , ' dw ' to delete the text moved over by 'w ' , ' 2dw ' to delete two words , etc. Left / Down / Up / Right navigation is located on the QWERTY keys H/J/K/L so that the typist 's hands never need to reach for arrow keys or the mouse .
Unfortunately , these navigation keys are not so intuitive under Colemak and so I needed to find some more appropriate mappings .
After experimenting with many alternatives , here is what I finally decided on and am very happy with :
noremap n j|noremap < C-w>n <C-w>j|noremap < C-w >< C-n > < C - w>j noremap e k|noremap < C- w>e <C-w>k|noremap < C-w > < C- e > < C - w> k noremap s h noremap t l noremap f e noremap k n noremap K N noremap U < C - r >
I saw the picture below yesterday and my heart sank .
I found it here , and while the article was powerful in relation to what ’s going on with the large plastic dumps on either side of Hawaii , the turtle is what broke me .
I ’ve been trying to figure out why .
Maybe because I had turtles as a kid ?
Maybe because they ’re iconic to me for peaceful , laid - back creatures .
1
Who knows , and who cares : the fact is that the turtle moved me to action .
Think about it for a second :
That poor turtle has lived the majority of its life constricted by the plastic band .
Its entire skeleton has had to restructure itself to keep the being alive .
Also think about it as a metaphor of how we ’ve altered the planet as a whole .
After being heartbroken from seeing and thinking about the turtle , another one of my frustrations and disappointments with myself came up : my omnivorism .
What ’s the connection ?
I ’m starting to become more activistic about our need to be more mindful of the environment in our everyday actions .
I feel torn in being a true advocate , however , when I ’m aware of the toll that eating meat has on the environment .
I ’m not trying to leverage facts and present an argument here – I ’m just drawing loose connections and may present an argument later .
( Here ’s a start , though . )
So , while my first reaction was indignation and wanting to pick up the torch to raise awareness about this plastic dump and the turtles – by God , the turtles !
– the part of me that hates cognitive dissonance and hypocrites rightly pointed out that it ’s inconsistent to champion the preservation of the environment while my habits are part of the problem .
Here ’s the deal , though : we have to start somewhere .
Yes , I eat meat , and I ’m working on that , for more reasons than the turtles .
But it does n’t need to stop me from spreading the word about this plastic soup in our lovely oceans .
Or about the plight of the turtles , birds , fish , and other assortment of animals that are living painful lives and dying painful deaths because it was just too damned inconvenient for ships to haul their trash with them .
Of course , while the plastic soup and turtle serve as the context for this particular problem , the larger issue is how much we let our personal frustrations , disappointments , and fear of being flawed beings hold us back from spreading value throughout the world .
Rather than acknowledging that we have some areas to work on while we ’re helping others , we allow ourselves to bottle up , hide behind our perceived failings , and fret while other beings suffer .
We ’re not perfect , and we never will be .
We have to fix this plane while we ’re flying it .
And maybe we can save some turtles while we ’re at it .
: Yes , I know about alligator snapping turtles , but let ’s save them for another conversation involving shovels , good will , and golf courses .
The New York Times tells us today that the poker boom is dead , which means it actually died about year ago .
A year ago , you still could n't turn on the TV without seeing some poker programming , whether it was the World Series of Poker , High Stakes Poker , The World Poker Tour , Bring It To The Table ( hip - hop poker ) , The Heartland Poker Tour ( poker playing farmers from the midwest , seriously ) , ad infinitum .
It was just too much .
On Tuesday , the final table of this year 's World Series main event will be aired , and it 's doubtful many of you will be watching .
For an eerily good proxy of the boom , check out the chart of publicly traded World Poker Tour Entertainment ( WPTE ) .
The stock currently resides at a $ .32 , having hit a high of $ 26.50 in July of 2005 .
The Times article helpfully points out that ratings for ESPN 's broadcast of the WSOP peaked in 2005 .
It also notes that the number of entries into the tournament this year was down 22 % from its 2006 peak ( note : the peak in players lagged the peak in viewers by a year ) .
So why has poker fallen on hard times ?
Let 's think of a few reasons
For the vast majority , poker is a money - losing habit .
On TV it looks easy .
Wear some mirrored - eyeglasses , push all - in with two rags and double up when a miracle hits on the river .
Of course , the majority of the game is quiet drudgery .
A few sharks eat the majority of fish .
Eventually , people get tired of wasting their money .
This is probably the big killer .
The Law .
The UIGEA made it hard for people to fund their online poker accounts .
It 's still not that hard , but it takes some effort .
That means the people who would impulsively start playing and immediately lose all their money are n't playing as much .
The ones who do go through the hoops are more serious players , thus reducing the profitability of the game for everyone .
That also helps to explain the decline in World Series of Poker Entries .
There are n't that many people who will pay $ 10,000 to enter a poker tournament , but the big poker sites used to hold a lot of satellites ( $ 100 - entry , winner gets a trip to the WSOP ) , and send thousands of people to Vegas .
Now , not so much .
Alternatives to online gambling .
Why play legally dicey poker when you can just trade FOREX ?
You 'll ; ose your money just as fast , but it 's much easier to transfer money into the account .
Here 's a NYC - centric explanation : shootings and club busts .
We used to go to quasi - underground poker clubs all the time , and it was easy to find them on Craigslist .
Then there were a few high - profile busts , a couple of gunpoint robberies , and in one instance a club patron was killed when the robber accidentally fired his gun .
News like that will make people think twice about finding a game .
Of course , poker is n't over entirely and the final table actually starts in about an hour ( 10:20 AM Pacific Time ) .
You can wait until it airs on Tuesday , or you can follow PokerNews , which does an awesome job liveblogging tournaments .
Also follow Pauly at Tao of Poker , who 's already liveblogging and doing a great job conveying the atmosphere of the event .
The myth of the values voter
If Sen . John McCain pulls out a stunning upset next Tuesday , he 'll have the country club , not Sam 's Club , to thank for it .
Conversely , if Sen. Barack Obama maintains his lead and coasts to victory , it will likely be because he was able to persuade wealthier voters to take a chance on his economic vision .
That 's because while wealthy states remain firmly in the blue column , wealthy voters run deep red .
In 2000 , the poorest voters in Mississippi ( 50th in nation in per capita income ) , Ohio ( middle of the pack ) and Connecticut ( first in per capita income ) were equally likely to vote for George W. Bush .
The richest residents of the same three states diverged sharply , with more than three - quarters of wealthy Mississippians voting Republican , 60 percent in Ohio and less than half in Connecticut .
This pattern held in 2004 .
It turns out the mythical lower - income " values voter , " who puts " God , guns and gays " before economic concerns is just that .
The Republican edge in poorer states has little to do with the cultural concerns of lower - income voters , and far more to do with the intensity of GOP support by the wealthy in these states .
In graphical terms , this is represented by a steep incline in the likelihood of voting GOP as you move up the income scale in the classic red states .
Battleground states , such as Ohio , show a more moderate slope .
The urbanized anchors of blue America approach a flat line .
Andrew Gelman , a statistician at Columbia University , and his colleagues have documented these trends in their book , " Red State , Blue State , Rich State , Poor State : Why Americans Vote the Way They Do . "
Their findings answer several questions about the twists and turns of the 2008 presidential election .
And the path to victory for McCain or Obama becomes clearer to imagine .
For starters , how has the seemingly hapless and relatively underfunded McCain campaign kept pace , at least until recently , with a man their own ads famously call " the biggest celebrity in the world " ?
And why is Obama now seemingly pulling away ?
Because , until recently , the patterns that Gelman identified had held .
For example , in early September , Pew Research had McCain leading Obama 53 to 39 among those Americans making $ 75,000 or more .
Their latest poll has Obama up , 52 percent to 41 percent in this category - a 12 - point swing in a matter of weeks .
Pew 's horse - race poll has Obama gaining six points overall during this period .
Another of Gelman 's observations on recent voting patterns found that those who regularly attend church , regardless of what state they live in , are more likely to vote Republican - although the pattern is that much stronger in red states than blue .
According to Pew , Obama has also gained 7 points in the last month with weekly churchgoing white mainline Protestants and 9 points with Catholics who attend weekly Mass , another likely cause for his recent surge .
Returning to a familiar campaign narrative , many ask whether Obama has n't changed the map , particularly in poorer states with relatively large minority populations ?
There is little evidence that this is the case .
In the 10 lowest - income states , McCain leads by an average of 16 points , trailing only in New Mexico , a classic battleground state .
Similarly , nine of the 10 richest states look firmly Democratic in 2008 .
If you discount traditionally red Wyoming , which has catapulted from 28th in per capita income in 2000 to sixth today , based on natural gas revenues , it is a clean sweep .
Among these , Obama has swung Colorado and Virginia into his column from the 2004 GOP column .
So , in the 10 richest and 10 poorest states , only three look to be moving away from the party they favored in previous elections .
Of these , two are simply falling into line with their fellow wealthier states , and one is continuing a pattern of vacillation between parties ( although looking solidly Democratic at this point ) .
Hardly a seismic shift between red and blue .
So , then , what should we look for in trying to figure out whether Obama 's momentum will lead to a Reaganesque landslide or another electoral nail - biter ?
RealClearPolitics.com lists 85 electoral votes not solidly in the GOP or Democratic column - Florida , Georgia , Indiana , Missouri , Montana , North Carolina and North Dakota .
If Obama can smooth the curve in the poor toss - up states ( Georgia and North Carolina ) , and steepen it in richer ones ( as he has done in Colorado and Virginia ) , he may well get a landslide .
On the other hand , if McCain can maintain President Bush 's popularity with wealthy churchgoers , particularly in the low - to moderate - wealth states still up for grabs , we could be in for a long night .
Instead , the populists ' manifesto called for the readmission of more plentiful silver coinage into the system – a point captured by Dorothy 's silver slippers ( Hollywood changed them to ruby ) as she skipped along the yellow brick road ( the gold standard ) .
Print more money and remove us from penury .
Consecutive presidential elections were contested on such a return to bimetallism in 1896 and 1900 .
Surprisingly , the easy - money crowd , proved unsuccessful ; they were defeated by powerful bankers such as JP Morgan .
However , the story ends with the good witch of the south ( the populace ) prophesying that Dorothy 's silver slippers ( easy - money policy ) are so powerful they can fulfil her every wish .
This utopia was made possible just 13 years later with the formation of the Federal Reserve .
The tin man and the scarecrow would have a more forgiving lender of last resort after all and 71 years later the wizard , called Nixon , went one step further and abolished the need for gold and silver ounces ( Oz ) when the US reneged on its Bretton Woods commitment to sound money .
John Gruber over at Daring Fireball has an interesting article about how the new Google app uses an API function call that is otherwise prohibited for developers to use .
The feature in question is the ability to initiate a voice command simply by lifting the phone up to your face via the proximity sensor .
“ The voice prompt is never triggered by motion alone , nor by covering the proximity sensor without first having moved the phone .
The only way it is triggered is by moving the phone and then triggering the proximity sensor .
It ’s very clever , and the resulting user experience is very nice .
But here ’s the intrigue :
There is no public API in the iPhone SDK for using the proximity sensor in this way . ”
So what gives ?
Gruber raises three potential explanations .
1 . Apple knew about the private function call and gave Google its blessing
2. Apple had no idea what Google was up to
or
3 . Apple knew about it , but given the recent press about the app , was n’t in a position to reject it , especially after the extraordinary outcry that followed its rejection of other iPhone applications .
Gruber does n’t believe that Apple would give Google its express permission for that feature , and even indicates that such a scenario would be a blight against Apple as it would indicate that not all developers have access to the same tools when coding their programs .
While his point makes sense , Google seeking and obtaining special permission from Apple would n’t be that surprising .
If there was any one company for which Apple would make a special exception , it ’d be Google .
It ’s well known that Google CEO Eric Schmidt sits on Apple ’s board of directors , so Google clearly would have a more open channel of communication with Apple than your average developer .
Furthermore , Google has helped out Apple in the past by encoding its YouTube videos in H.264 format , which makes them playable on the flash - less iPhone .
Apple ’s in no rush to make flash capable iPhones , so the H.264 encoding done by Google is extremely significant .
Apple knows how popular YouTube is , and it ’s easy to see how important Apple thinks its inclusion with the iPhone is .
For starters , YouTube has , from the beginning , had its own application icon on the iPhone homescreen ( the only non-Apple app by the way ) .
And second , Apple has touted YouTube streaming as a desirable feature in some of its iPhone commercials .
Long story short , Google has helped Apple work around the roadblock that is flash , and Apple helping Google out in return by giving it permission to access otherwise prohibited API function calls is n’t that unthinkable .
Also , Apple ’s handling of the SDK in the past indicates that it ’s not opposed to playing favorites when it comes to iPhone development .
And lastly , read into this however much you want , but Apple ’s App Store Pick of The Week is , you guessed it ! , Google Mobile .
On a different note , Gruber raises an interesting theory suggesting that Apple allowed the app instead of risking a public backlash should it reject it .
“ … the Google Mobile team followed the adage that it ’s easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission .
If this is the case — if — it might explain why Google started publicizing the voice search feature several days before it actually appeared in the App Store .
The publicity from John Markoff ’s feature in The New York Times put pressure on Apple to accept the app .
If there was any internal debate within Apple about whether to allow this , it might explain why the app took several days longer to appear in the store than Markoff ’s story indicated Google expected . ”

Senator Joseph McCarthy ( R - WI ) accuses Edward R. Murrow of associating with a “ terrorist organization . ”
The vile fear - mongering of John McCain , Sarah Palin , Nancy Pfotenhauer , Michele Bachmann et al reminded me of Joe McCarthy ’s reign of terror in the 1950s .
Speculation is rampant about the “ real ” America , who is “ anti-American , ” and on the illusory “ associations ” of a United States Senator .
Americans shout “ kill him ! ” and “ terrorist ! ” at political rallies .
Is this what we want in our country — again ?
Really ?
Enough with the “ us ” and “ them ” mentality , or the “ red states ” and the “ blue states . ”
This country is in an economic crisis now , but we ’re also in a social and cultural crisis .
We must all hang together , or assuredly we shall all hang separately .

Hank Paulson is a dirty rotten liar .
In July , along with Fed chairman Bernanke , he assured Congress that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not in danger of failing .
His testimony before Congress was instrumental in getting Congress to approve Treasury Department and Federal Reserve proposals to make sweeping changes to the relationship between the two institutions and the government .
Within 7 weeks , Uncle Sam took over the mortgage giants preventing their inevitable collapse .
Then at the beginning of October , the dynamic duo was swindling Congress again .
This time Paulson and his banker buddy Bernanke told Congress that it had to act quickly and approve a $ 700 billion package to buy the bad assets ( mortgages ) of failing Wall Street firms otherwise America faced calamity – civil unrest , economic collapse , and extinction of our blessed ( debt ridden ) lifestyle .
This past week Paulson announced that he would use the taxpayer assets not to buy troubled assets as he told Congress in October , but to inject capital into struggling banks by acquiring equity stakes in them .
Now , perhaps calling Paulson a liar is harsh .
Maybe he just does n't know what he is doing .
For instance , in a recent interview on National Public Radio , Paulson said , “ I believe the banking system has been stabilized . ”
Oh really .
Just this week , Citi Group , one of the biggest financial services companies in the country , indicated that it would cut at least 10,000 jobs .
In October , foreclosures grew 25 percent nationally over the same month in 2007 .
Yet to come is the impending auto loan , student loan , and credit card crisis .
Given his track record and the current circumstances it is amazing that anyone even listens to Paulson anymore .
But , there is more .
In his “ I changed my mind about how to use the taxpayers $ 700 billion ” speech this week , Paulson indicated that the economy was in better shape than it was two weeks ago .
Again , the facts tell a different story .
The Labor Department reported this week that the number of newly laid - off workers seeking unemployment benefits increased to a seven - year high .
The big three automakers are on the verge of bankruptcy and the mayors of 3 American cities petitioned the federal government to use a portion of the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout plan to assist cities with pension costs and cash flow problems .
This news indicates that we are headed in the opposite direction of Paulson 's analysis .
Naturally , through his comments , Paulson is trying to justify his actions in handling the economic crisis to this point .
Here is a summary of Treasury actions since March : · $ 29 billion for Bear Stearns · $ 143.8 billion for AIG ( and growing ) · $ 100 billion for Fannie Mae· $ 100 billion for Freddie Mac· $ 700 billion for Wall Street , including : Bank of America ( Merrill Lynch ) , Citi Group , JP Morgan ( WaMu ) , Wells Fargo ( Wachovia ) , Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , and others · $ 25 billion for the Big Three in Detroit· $ 8 billion for Indy Mac· $ 150 billion for stimulus package ( from January ) · $ 50 billion for money market funds· $ 138 billion for Lehman Bros .
( post bankruptcy , through JP Morgan ) · $ 620 billion for general currency swaps from the FedRough total : $ 2,063,800,000,000 — Two trillion and still spending !

When will the madness end ?
The federal government ran a deficit of $ 237 billion just in the month of October .
It is well on its way to the unthinkable $ 1 trillion budget deficit by the end of the fiscal year .
All of this money , created out of thin air by the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve with the blessings of Congress , is not stabilizing the markets as Paulson suggests .
It is simply throwing good money at companies that deserve to go bankrupt .
The current economic crisis is proof that debt does matter .
At some point , it has to be paid back .
The U.S. government is bankrupt , but it continues to spend money like a gambling addict in a casino .
Months from now , when the economy is in even more of a mess and we are laden with even more debt , think back to the comments of Hank Paulson .
At that point , it still might be hard to decide if he was lying or simply just did n't know what he was doing .

A climate change scientist says real estate agents have threatened to make his life difficult if he continues to publish research about how vulnerable particular properties are to rising sea levels and coastal erosion .
Professor Andrew Pitman works at the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales .
He says real estate agents do not like potential buyers asking questions about climate change based on his research .
Professor Pitman has told the ABC's Local Radio that several agents have asked him to stop talking about how vulnerable certain properties are .
" More explicitly [ they said ] ' We 're nervous about our particular market niche in a particular suburb ' , " he said .
" And , ' We are going to start making your life difficult if you keep pointing to climate change affecting our particular location ' . "
Professor Pitman says he will now change the way he refers to his research even though the science is robust .
" I feel fairly secure in general statements about sea level rise and general statements about properties that are very close to the water being more vulnerable , " he said .
" But I wo n't now point to specific locations as being a particularly sensitive , although it 's not very difficult to find out what those [ properties ] would be . "
He says with an expected 40 per cent rise in sea levels by 2050 , properties that are close to the water will be more vulnerable .
Professor Pitman says he suspects the owners of beachfront properties that are at risk , or shoreline properties that are already frequently flooded , already know that they are at risk from rising sea levels .
Tim McKibbon from the Real Estate Institute says it is the first he has heard of agents trying to silence Professor Pitman .
" I have no knowledge of it .
He has n't named anybody , " he said .
As a result , Mr McKibbon says it is difficult to substantiate the claim , but he is not aware that Professor Pitman 's research is under threat .
Its one thing for Sundance to argue against canceling their entire festival in January , there are good arguments on both sides , but it ’s quite another for them to say they ’re going to continue using the cinema of a man who gave $ 9,999 to the anti-gay bigots supporting Yes on 8 .
( And it ’s not just “ a ” cinema among many , it ’s “ the ” main Sundance cinema . )
Your Sundance registration money is quite literally helping to subsidize a donation to Yes on 8 .
And a local organizer is coordinating a campaign against Cinemark .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Tuesday called Democrat Barack Obama to congratulate him on winning the presidential election , the White House said , adding that Bush invited him and his family to visit to the White House soon .
“ You are about to go on one of the great journeys of life .
Congratulations and go enjoy yourself , ” Bush said to Obama according to White House spokeswoman Dana Perino .
Obama will be sworn in as the 44th U.S. president on January 20 , 2009 .
Bush , whose job approval ratings have been at record lows , spent little time on the campaign trail with Obama ’s opponent Republican candidate John McCain as a result .
He watched election returns with friends and staff at the White House .
Bush also called McCain after his concession speech to praise his campaign , Perino said .
“ John , you gave it your all .
I ’m proud of you , and I ’m sorry it did n’t work out , ” Bush said according to Perino .
Bush plans to give a statement on the election on Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. in the Rose Garden , she said .
Vice President Dick Cheney called Obama ’s running mate , Joe Biden , to congratulate him , his spokeswoman Lea Anne Foster said .
He also was trying to reach McCain ’s running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
The Russian parliament approved a constitutional amendment Friday to extend the presidential term from four to six years .
Vladimir Putin was barred constitutionally from seeking a third consecutive term as president .
There is widespread speculation in Russian media that the change is aimed at paving the way for a return to the Kremlin by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who remains a popular and powerful figure since leaving the president 's office in May .
The Kremlin maintains the amendment -- along with other proposed changes to the terms in office for elected officials -- is necessary to ensure the stability of future Russian governments .
President Dmitry Medvedev announced the measures just two weeks ago , in his first state - of - the - nation speech on November 5 .
The lower house of the Russian parliament had its third and final reading Friday before putting the measures to a vote .
It passed by a vote of 392 to 57 , with those against representing the Communist Party faction .
There were no abstentions .
Further approval is needed from the upper house of parliament and regional councils before the changes become law .
The amendments will come into force when at least two - thirds of the nation 's 83 regional parliaments and assemblies -- or 56 -- approve them .

Russia edges closer to six - year presidency Russian president seeks 6 - year terms
Analysts have expressed concern about the rapid movement of the measures through parliament .
They say the government may be seeking to capitalize on Putin 's popularity amid the financial crisis , which has dented support for the current leadership .
The next Russian presidential elections are scheduled for 2012 .
There is speculation in Russia that the new measures could set the stage for fresh elections , allowing Putin to sidestep a ban on a third presidential term and stand again for president .

SACRAMENTO —
Less than two weeks before Election Day , the chief strategist behind a ballot measure outlawing same - sex marriage in California called an emergency meeting here .
“ We ’re going to lose this campaign if we do n’t get more money , ” the strategist , Frank Schubert , recalled telling leaders of Protect Marriage , the main group behind the ban .
The campaign issued an urgent appeal , and in a matter of days , it raised more than $ 5 million , including a $ 1 million donation from Alan C. Ashton , the grandson of a former president of the Mormon Church .
The money allowed the drive to intensify a sharp - elbowed advertising campaign , and support for the measure was catapulted ahead ; it ultimately won with 52 percent of the vote .
As proponents of same - sex marriage across the country planned protests on Saturday against the ban , interviews with the main forces behind the ballot measure showed how close its backers believe it came to defeat — and the extraordinary role Mormons played in helping to pass it with money , institutional support and dedicated volunteers .
“ We ’ve spoken out on other issues , we ’ve spoken out on abortion , we ’ve spoken out on those other kinds of things , ” said Michael R. Otterson , the managing director of public affairs for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , as the Mormons are formally called , in Salt Lake City .
“ But we do n’t get involved to the degree we did on this . ”
The California measure , Proposition 8 , was to many Mormons a kind of firewall to be held at all costs .
“ California is a huge state , often seen as a bellwether — this was seen as a very , very important test , ” Mr. Otterson said .
First approached by the Roman Catholic archbishop of San Francisco a few weeks after the California Supreme Court legalized same - sex marriage in May , the Mormons were the last major religious group to join the campaign , and the final spice in an unusual stew that included Catholics , evangelical Christians , conservative black and Latino pastors , and myriad smaller ethnic groups with strong religious ties .
Shortly after receiving the invitation from the San Francisco Archdiocese , the Mormon leadership in Salt Lake City issued a four - paragraph decree to be read to congregations , saying “ the formation of families is central to the Creator ’s plan , ” and urging members to become involved with the cause .
“ And they sure did , ” Mr. Schubert said .
Jeff Flint , another strategist with Protect Marriage , estimated that Mormons made up 80 percent to 90 percent of the early volunteers who walked door - to - door in election precincts .
The canvass work could be exacting and highly detailed .
Many Mormon wards in California , not unlike Roman Catholic parishes , were assigned two ZIP codes to cover .
Volunteers in one ward , according to training documents written by a Protect Marriage volunteer , obtained by people opposed to Proposition 8 and shown to The New York Times , had tasks ranging from “ walkers , ” assigned to knock on doors ; to “ sellers , ” who would work with undecided voters later on ; and to “ closers , ” who would get people to the polls on Election Day .
Suggested talking points were equally precise .
If initial contact indicated a prospective voter believed God created marriage , the church volunteers were instructed to emphasize that Proposition 8 would restore the definition of marriage God intended .
But if a voter indicated human beings created marriage , Script B would roll instead , emphasizing that Proposition 8 was about marriage , not about attacking gay people , and about restoring into law an earlier ban struck down by the State Supreme Court in May .
“ It is not our goal in this campaign to attack the homosexual lifestyle or to convince gays and lesbians that their behavior is wrong — the less we refer to homosexuality , the better , ” one of the ward training documents said .
“ We are pro-marriage , not anti-gay . ”
Leaders were also acutely conscious of not crossing the line from being a church - based volunteer effort to an actual political organization .
“ No work will take place at the church , including no meeting there to hand out precinct walking assignments so as to not even give the appearance of politicking at the church , ” one of the documents said .
By mid-October , most independent polls showed support for the proposition was growing , but it was still trailing .
Opponents had brought on new media consultants in the face of the slipping poll numbers , but they were still effectively raising money , including $ 3.9 million at a star - studded fund - raiser held at the Beverly Hills home of Ron Burkle , the supermarket billionaire and longtime Democratic fund - raiser .
It was then that Mr. Schubert called his meeting in Sacramento .
“ I said , ‘ As good as our stuff is , it ca n’t withstand that kind of funding , ’ ” he recalled .
The response was a desperate e-mail message sent to 92,000 people who had registered at the group ’s Web site declaring a “ code blue ” — an urgent plea for money to save traditional marriage from “ cardiac arrest . ”
Mr. Schubert also sent an e-mail message to the three top religious members of his executive committee , representing Catholics , evangelicals and Mormons .
“ I ask for your prayers that this e-mail will open the hearts and minds of the faithful to make a further sacrifice of their funds at this urgent moment so that God ’s precious gift of marriage is preserved , ” he wrote .
On Oct. 28 , Mr. Ashton , the grandson of the former Mormon president David O. McKay , donated $ 1 million .
Mr. Ashton , who made his fortune as co-founder of the WordPerfect Corporation , said he was following his personal beliefs and the direction of the church .
“ I think it was just our realizing that we heard a number of stories about members of the church who had worked long hours and lobbied long and hard , ” he said in a telephone interview from Orem , Utah .
In the end , Protect Marriage estimates , as much as half of the nearly $ 40 million raised on behalf of the measure was contributed by Mormons .
Even with the Mormons ’ contributions and the strong support of other religious groups , Proposition 8 strategists said they had taken pains to distance themselves from what Mr. Flint called “ more extreme elements ” opposed to rights for gay men and lesbians .
To that end , the group that put the issue on the ballot rebuffed efforts by some groups to include a ban on domestic partnership rights , which are granted in California .
Mr. Schubert cautioned his side not to stage protests and risk alienating voters when same - sex marriages began being performed in June .
“ We could not have this as a battle between people of faith and the gays , ” Mr. Schubert said .
“ That was a losing formula . ”
But the “ Yes ” side also initially faced apathy from middle - of - the - road California voters who were largely unconcerned about same - sex marriage .
The overall sense of the voters in the beginning of the campaign , Mr. Schubert said , was “ Who cares ?
I ’m not gay . ”
To counter that , advertisements for the “ Yes ” campaign also used hypothetical consequences of same - sex marriage , painting the specter of churches ’ losing tax exempt status or people “ sued for personal beliefs ” or objections to same - sex marriage , claims that were made with little explanation .
Another of the advertisements used video of an elementary school field trip to a teacher ’s same - sex wedding in San Francisco to reinforce the idea that same - sex marriage would be taught to young children .
“ We bet the campaign on education , ” Mr. Schubert said .
The “ Yes ” campaign was denounced by opponents as dishonest and divisive , but the passage of Proposition 8 has led to second - guessing about the “ No ” campaign , too , as well as talk about a possible ballot measure to repeal the ban .
Several legal challenges have been filed , and the question of the legality of the same - sex marriages performed from June to Election Day could also be settled in court .
For his part , Mr. Schubert said he is neither anti-gay — his sister is a lesbian — nor happy that some same - sex couples ’ marriages are now in question .
But , he said , he has no regrets about his campaign .
“ They had a lot going for them , ” Mr. Schubert said of his opponents .
“ And they could n’t get it done . ”
Mr. Otterson said it was too early to tell what the long - term implications might be for the church , but in any case , he added , none of that factored into the decision by church leaders to order a march into battle .
“ They felt there was only one way we could stand on such a fundamental moral issue , and they took that stand , ” he said .
“ It was a matter of standing up for what the church believes is right . ”
That said , the extent of the protests has taken many Mormons by surprise .
On Friday , the church ’s leadership took the unusual step of issuing a statement calling for “ respect ” and “ civility ” in the aftermath of the vote .
“ Attacks on churches and intimidation of people of faith have no place in civil discourse over controversial issues , ” the statement said .
“ People of faith have a democratic right to express their views in the public square without fear of reprisal . ”
Mr. Ashton described the protests by same - sex marriage advocates as off - putting .
“ I think that shows colors , ” Mr. Ashton said .
“ By their fruit , ye shall know them . ”

Oct 8 , 2008  --
The McCain campaign has made no secret of its plans to spend these final weeks of the election going negative -- attacking Sen.
Barack Obama on his judgment , questioning his associations and unleashing self - described " pitbull " Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to do much of the dirty work .
" For me , the heels are on , the gloves are off , " she told a group of Republican donors in Naples , Fla. , on Monday .
As the rhetoric at Palin 's rallies has ratcheted up , so too has the language of supporters in the crowds coming to see her .
At rallies in Florida , supporters were heard yelling " treason " and " traitor " when Obama 's name was mentioned .
At a rally on Monday in Clearwater , one man shouted " Kill him , " according to the Washington Post , after Palin mentioned Obama 's association with 1960s radical Bill Ayers .
It was not clear who made the comment or if the man was referring to Ayers or to Obama , but the Secret Service says it will investigate .
" One of [ Obama 's ] earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers , " she said Monday , eliciting boos from the crowd .
" And , according to the New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ' launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol , ' " she said to more boos and the one man 's call to " kill him . "
Palin 's speeches and a series of recently released negative ads , some pundits say , are all par for the course in the waning days of a closely fought contest .
Now questions are being raised , by the opposition and by outside observers , about whether Palin is stoking people 's worst natures and , more broadly , about when a candidate should take her supporters to task when they go too far .
" At some level , negative rhetoric is part of the game .
But is it truly dangerous ? " asked Kimberly Gross , a professor of political communication at George Washington University .
" Is someone going to kill Barack Obama because they went to a Palin rally ?
Probably not , and if they do it is more likely because they 're crazy than because they heard someone tell them to do it at a Palin rally .
It is dangerous in a bigger sense that it is bad for politics . "
Making the rounds on today 's network morning shows , Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden of Delaware called Palin 's attempt to link Obama and Ayers " mildly dangerous , " on CBS's The Early Show
On ABC News 's " Good Morning America " he said : " This really is a case where when you do n't have anything to talk about , attack -- and I think that 's really over the edge "
" Some of the stuff she 's saying about Obama and some of the stuff people are yelling from the crowd , if she hears it she should be able to say ' Whoa whoa whoa , that 's overboard . '
This is volatile stuff and I thought we were kind of beyond this place , " he said .
Gross said politicians had a responsibility to call out their supporters when they say offensive things , not only for the good of their own electoral chances but for the good of the political system .
" In my opinion candidates have a responsibility to say something , " she said .
" Negative campaigning per se is not absolutely a bad thing , and can be informative .
But candidates do us disservice when they create the conditions that can allow a crowd to get out of hand .
It just reinforces a cynicism about politics . "
Though much of the negative campaigning has fallen to Palin and the crowds who attend her rallies tend to come from the further right wing of the Rupublican base , McCain had a moment recently in Albuquerque , N.M. , when a member of the crowd shouted a smear , which the candidate appeared to hear but said nothing about .
" In short , " McCain asked the crowd , " who is the real Barack Obama ? "
" A terrorist , " yelled someone from the crowd , eliciting a laugh from others in the hall and a perplexed look from McCain , but he continued his speech without comment .
On NBC's " Today " show , Biden called some of the language being used by crowds at Republican rallies " semi-vile " and said Palin should have condemned those who shouted provocative epithets .
" Heard that a couple of people hollering from the audience , you know , semi-vile things about , you know , ' terrorist ' and things like that .
And the idea that a leading American politician who might be vice president of the United States would not just stop mid-sentence and turn and condemn that , you know , I just -- this is -- this is a slippery slope .
This is a place we should n't be going , " he said .
Calls for comment from the McCain - Palin campaign were not yet returned .
Reporters following McCain and Palin say that crowds have become increasingly hostile towards them , yelling at them as they get off the press bus to cover events .
The Palin crowds , they say , are typically more aggressive than those found at McCain - only events , especially since Palin 's interview with CBS 's Katie Couric in which she appeared to be uninformed on major policy issues .
In Clearwater , reporters were taunted by the crowd of about 3,000 people .
Palin blamed Couric for her " less - than - successful interview with kinda mainstream media . "
One Palin supporter used a racial slur against an African - American sound technician working with a television crew and told him to , " sit down , boy . "

With production costs still a formidable challenge , Sony has said not to expect Christmas price cuts for the PlayStation 3 -- but EEDAR analyst Jesse Divnich believes the PS3 may be taking a big hit from recent Xbox 360 price reductions .
Ahead of September 's NPD results expected next week , analysts are bracing for a mixed bag in video game performance .
The month 's results are expected to suffer greatly in year - over - year comparisons to last year 's September , whensaw its record - breaking launch .
Despite this , Divnich estimates that Xbox 360 sold 320,000 units in September -- a new monthly record for the console , and a 31 percent weekly sales increase over August .
On the other hand , Divnich anticipates PS3 sales to decline 7 percent to 43,000 units a week .
While the analyst says the surge in sales is largely attributable to mainstream consumers attracted to the Xbox 360 Arcade SKU 's sub -$ 200 price point , Divnich warns the monthly NPD may turn out to show the PS3 suffering by comparison .
"
We still urge Sony to consider a possible hardware price cut this holiday season , " says Divnich .
If September hardware sales fall below our estimate ( under 200,000 units ) , it could be an indication that the Xbox 360 price cut played a bigger role on hindering PS3 sales than what we originally expected .
"
In stating that it had no plans to reduce PS3 prices , Sony has instead touted its software lineup as its primary strength for the crucial holiday season .
While Divnich agrees that titles likeandare likely to drive core adoption of the PS3 , he also expressed " doubts that either title will lure in casual and mainstream gamers . "
" The $ 399 price point is simply too steep to entice the casual and mainstream markets , regardless of how greatandmay be , " he says .
Moreover , Divnich anticipates thatwill be the season 's top - selling game -- and if the rest of Microsoft 's first - party software outperforms Sony 's in quality and popularity , it could spell further trouble for the PS3 .
" We could begin to see a considerable amount of potential PS3 owners , who may be waiting for a PS3 price cut , to choose the Xbox 360 over the PS3 , " says Divnich .
Musing from across the pond
CAMDEN , New Jersey ( Reuters ) -
The trial of five men accused of plotting an armed attack on a New Jersey army base opened on Monday with a prosecutor saying they were inspired by al Qaeda and the idea of Islamic “ holy war ” against America .

The five men , all Muslims born outside the United States , were charged in May 2007 with planning but not executing an attack on the Fort Dix army base , near Philadelphia .
A defense attorney for one of the five said recordings obtained by paid FBI informants that are key to the prosecution case merely showed the “ fake bravado ” of men who “ talk the talk ” of militancy but would never “ walk the walk . ”
Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick said the defendants were inspired by “ jihad , ” an Arabic word for spiritual struggle that is frequently used by al Qaeda and by counter - terrorism specialists to denote “ holy war . ”
“ Their motive was to defend Islam .
Their inspiration was al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden .
Their intention was to attack the U.S. , ” Fitzpatrick told the Federal Court .
He told the jury that prosecutors would present about 90 recordings of the plot obtained by two paid FBI informants during a 16 - month undercover investigation .
“ They are not shy about saying who they want to shoot : American military personnel , ” Fitzpatrick said .
Fitzpatrick said that the five defendants amassed an arsenal of weapons with which they were planning to attack Fort Dix and kill as many soldiers as possible .
The defendants , all in their 20s , are Yugoslav - born ethnic Albanian brothers Eljvir , Dritan and Shain Duka , illegal immigrants who ran a roofing business in New Jersey ; Mohamad Shnewer , a Jordanian - born taxi driver from Philadelphia ; and Serdar Tatar , a Turkish - born convenience store clerk .
Rocco Cipparone , an attorney for Shnewer , said his client never intended to carry out the attacks referred to in the taped conversations .
“ He talks the talk but he ’s never going to walk the walk , ” Cipparone told the jury .
“ REPUGNANT ” VIDEOS
Michael Riley , attorney for Shain Duka , said prosecutors would show militant videos , including some about the September 11 hijackers , that were found on one defendant ’s computer .
Riley said they were “ unpleasant , shocking , repugnant and offensive , ” but that such videos were designed to manipulate the emotions of jurors and did not mean the defendants would ever have carried out criminal acts .
“ They want you to see these videos and hate these young men , ” he told the jurors .
Cipparone attacked the credibility of one of the FBI informants , Mahmoud Omar , an Egyptian illegal immigrant who was spared deportation in return for cooperating with the FBI .
Cipparone said Omar was only interested in the $ 238,000 that he was paid during the investigation and had a criminal record that was much more serious than prosecutors alleged .
“ These informants are lifelong criminals , ” Cipparone said .
“ Their goal was to take the ego - building fake bravado of these young men and turn it into a terrorist plot . ”
A trip to a Pennsylvania firing range taken by the defendants in February 2007 was not a training camp for their plot , as prosecutors allege , but a vacation by a group of men who were good friends and loved guns , Cipparone said .
“ What you are going to see is a bunch of men clowning around on vacation , ” the attorney told jurors .
A sixth man who pleaded guilty to supplying firearms to the group was sentenced in March to 20 months in prison .

Netizens slam auction of cheerleaders ' unwashed clothes for charity
HONGKONG : After staging a spectacular Olympics that wowed the world , China was hoping to savour the sweet smell of success .
But it ’s raised a stink instead .
A posting on China ’s leading auction site Taobao for the sale of Beijing Olympics cheerleaders ’ uniforms , including their unwashed bras and panties , has whipped up a minor storm on China ’s Internet .
An agent claiming to represent one of the many international teams of Olympics cheerleaders put up the intimate innerwear items for auction and “ guaranteed their authenticity ” and their “ unwashed ” status .
In language intended to appeal to panty fetishists , the agent wrote , “ They are sure to excite you :
When you hold them up to your nose and sniff , you ’ll smell the youthful fragrance of the young girls . ”
It turns out that the uniforms and innerwear had been offered for sale by some cheerleaders , a few of whom had come from Japan — in response to a call to contribute some personal effects for auction to raise money for the Sichuan earthquake victims .
Some donated dolls , jewellery and other trinkets ; others donated intimate apparel .
Predictably , the auction listing has been flamed by incensed Chinese netizens as a “ vulgar , shameless insult to the Olympics spirit . ”
One blogger ranted that the language of the listing was “ inflammatory and obscene ” and had “ tarnished the purity of the Olympics . ”
Being a part of the Olympics , another commentator noted , “ came with a high sense of honour and self - esteem ” and for someone to offer their used underwear for cash was “ a stain on the reputation of the volunteers . ”
From all accounts , the ‘ panty donors ’ may have been cheerleaders from Japan , where there exists a thriving market for used innerwear that are used in auto -erotic practices .
In fact , so - called ‘ burusera ’ ( literally , bloomers - seller ) shops in Japanese cities and towns cater to the kinky needs of hormonally driven men to this day .
Typically , the merchandise is sold with a photograph of the girl wearing it , which works like a ‘ certificate of authenticity ’ .
Up until a few years ago , there were even vending machines that dispensed used panties .
Japanese director Takeshi Miyasaka ’s 1996 film Burusera : Shop of Horrors depicts three schoolgirls who sell their underwear for pocket money , only to realise that the fashion lines had changed from merely soiled underwear to blood - stained ones .
Japanese cities have been attempting to crack down on this fetishist trade , in which sometimes even schoolgirls are complicit because it is an easy source of pocket money .
In 2004 , for instance , the Tokyo metropolitan administration banned the sale of used underwear from women under age 18 , but buyers and sellers have found inventive ways to beat the ban .
Chinese Internet users are now worried that the panty fetish may make the crossing from Japan into China .

Canada Has Spent Billions On Carpool Lanes , But The Courts Are Now Forbidding Their Use By An Online Ridesharing Website .
[ social_buttons ]
The ridesharing website PickupPal ( as reported in a previous post ) was struck down by a Canadian court in a case brought against them by bus giant Trentway - Wagar .
The company took PickupPal to the Highway Transport Board complaining that the ride - matching service fell afoul of the province ’s obscenely strict ride - sharing laws which were adopted in the 1970s .
Sit down , these rules are crazy ( it ’s like those crazy sodomy laws no one follows ) :
You must travel from home to work only – nowhere else !
You cannot cross municipal boundaries
You must ride with the same driver each day
You must pay the driver no more frequently than weekly
The issue is not only that PickupPal ’s site allows drivers and passengers to connect for carpooling .
While it is up to the users to determine compensation , apparently the site “ does nothing to check on insurance , roadworthiness of the vehicles , driving history , or anything else . ”
This worried the Highway Transport Board most .
As we all know that carpooling or public transport can lead to things like decapitation or movies like Speed – no one wants that .
So the court ruled that PIckupPal owes CAN $ 2,836.07 to the province and another CAN $ 8,500 to Trentway - Wagar .
But Trentway - Wagar says its beef was simply that it is unfair they have to meet labor , environmental , and equipment standards to haul passengers around when services like PickupPal can arrange rides without doing any of that .
Hey , I can get behind that ( insert sodomy joke here ) .
And while your inner-hippy might be annoyed by this bump in the road , know that small ( and totally unlicensed ) businesses have developed around websites like this , and Craigslist .
And it ’s these illegal ventures that have led to serious tragedies in the past .

A few weeks ago Google released the beta of Google Chrome , a new Web browser based on WebKit .
Since then there has been a lot of interesting hype and backlash against the hype about Chrome .
Two great examples of the hype and the corresponding backlash are Mike Arrington 's Meet Chrome , Google ’s Windows Killer and Ted Dziuba 's article Chrome - fed Googasm bares tech pundit futility in response .
The best way to think about Google Chrome is to understand how Google thinks about the Web .
Nick Carr has a post entitled The Omnigoogle which does a great job of capturing a sentiment I 've seen expressed by every Google employee I 've ever talked to from senior people like Sergey Brin and Vint Cerf to front line folks Dewitt Clinton and Kevin Marks .
Nick Carr writes
But while Google is an unusual company in many ways , when you boil down its business strategy , you find that it ’s not quite as mysterious as it seems .
The way Google makes money is straightforward :
It brokers and publishes advertisements through digital media .
More than 99 percent of its sales have come from the fees it charges advertisers for using its network to get their messages out on the Internet .
Google ’s protean appearance is not a reflection of its core business .
Rather , it stems from the vast number of complements to its core business .
Complements are , to put it simply , any products or services that tend be consumed together .
Think hot dogs and mustard , or houses and mortgages .
For Google , literally everything that happens on the Internet is a complement to its main business .
The more things that people and companies do online , the more ads they see and the more money Google makes .
In addition , as Internet activity increases , Google collects more data on consumers ’ needs and behavior and can tailor its ads more precisely , strengthening its competitive advantage and further increasing its income .
As more and more products and services are delivered digitally over computer networks — entertainment , news , software programs , financial transactions —
Google ’s range of complements expands into ever more industry sectors .
That 's why cute little Google has morphed into The Omnigoogle .
Because the sales of complementary products rise in tandem , a company has a strong strategic interest in reducing the cost and expanding the availability of the complements to its core product .
It ’s not too much of an exaggeration to say that a company would like all complements to be given away .
If hot dogs became freebies , mustard sales would skyrocket .
It ’s this natural drive to reduce the cost of complements that , more than anything else , explains Google ’s strategy .
This boils down to the corporate ideology that " anything that is good for the Web is good for Google " .
This means Google is in favor of anything that increases the breadth of the Web which explains why it is investing in O3b networks in an effort intended to bring the Web to 3 billion people in emerging markets .
The more people there are using the Web , the more people there are viewing ads on Google 's services and on pages of sites that use AdSense and DoubleClick ads .
This also means that Google is in favor of moving as much media consumption as possible to the Web .
This explains why purchasing YouTube was so important .
In addition to purchasing the number one video site on the Web , Google also ensured that it would be on the front line of defending video on the Web given that YouTube was in the cross hairs of various corporate content owners .
This focus on expanding the breadth of the Web also explains why they have purchased startups like Zenter , Upstartle and 2 Web Technologies to create a Google office suite in an attempt to unseat the current breed of desktop based office productivity software .
It explains why they created Gmail as a way to make Web - based email as satisfying or even more satisfying than desktop mail experiences especially when compared to other Webmail offerings at the time .
This ideology also explains why the company invests in Android and so on ..
The media has tried to make it seem like Google spits out a bunch of random , unfocused projects without much thought besides " shipping something cool " .
However this is far from the case .
Google is the most successful company on the Web and it believes that its fortunes are directly tied to the increased usage and evolution of the Web .
This means Google has a strong incentive to improve the capabilities of the Web as a delivery vehicle for user experiences .
Google had telegraphed their intent to take a more direct role in the evolution of Web technologies in a few ways .
For one , the company hired Ian Hickson who had been rallying browser vendors to start improving Web technologies like HTML via the Web Hypertext Applications Technology Working Group ( WHAT WG ) .
His success in these efforts since joining Google has led to HTML 5 becoming an official W3C effort .
Secondly , Google also heavily supported Firefox both by hiring developers who worked on Firefox full time and via a search affiliate program that brings in millions for the Mozilla corporation [ Ed note – Google has a similar deal with Opera ] .
However the relationship with Firefox clearly was not evolving the Web at a pace that Google found satisfactory as evidenced by the creation of Google Gears a product which Google evangelists have positioned as a bleeding edge HTML 5 implementation even though it implements capabilities not mentioned in HTML 5 .
However even with having a seat at the table in defining HTML 5 and being a significant sponsor of the second most popular Web browser , Google still did not have a direct way to push the evolution of the Web directly to users .
They were still dependent on the pace of innovation of incumbent browser vendors or figuring out how to distribute a browser plug - in by convincing companies like MySpace to take a dependency on it .
This was clearly an uphill battle .
Thus creating their own Web browser was inevitable .
So why is this significant ?
It is n't because " Google Chrome is going to replace Windows " or some other such silliness .
As it stands now , Google Chrome is a Windows based application whose most interesting features exist in other browsers .
A Web browser cannot replace an operating system any more than an automobile can replace an Interstate highway .
The significant end user innovation in Google Chrome is that it is bundled with Google Gears .
This means that Google Chrome has a mechanism for delivering richer experiences to end users out of the box .
Google can now use this as a carrot and a stick approach to convincing browser vendors to do what it wants .
Google can make its sites work better together with Chrome + Gears ( e.g. YouTube Uploader using Gears ) which could lead to lost browser market share for competing browser vendors if this becomes a widespread practice among Google 's offerings .
Even if Google never does this , the implied threat is now out there .
Chrome will likely force Google 's competitors to up their game with regards to adopting newer Web standards and features just to stay competitive .
This is similar to what Google did with online mapping and Web mail , and what the Opera browser has been doing by pioneering features like " pr0n mode " and tabbed browsing .
So even if Google loses because Chrome does n't get massively popular , Google still wins because the user experience for browsing the Web has been improved .
And at the end of the day , if more people are using the Web because the user experience is better across the board that 's just fine for Google .
The same way the fact that all online mapping experiences and Web mail experiences have improved across the board is also good for Google .
Now Playing : Metallica - The Judas Kiss
We are already busy preparing our team of liveblogging ninjas for tomorrow 's Apple notebook event , which takes place at 10 am Pacific Time on Apple 's campus in Cupertino .
This event has been rumored since just after Apple 's last special event wherein the company introduced new iPods , but updated MacBooks and MacBook Pros have been on many Apple fans ' wishlists for quite a while longer .
So , what do we expect to see out of tomorrow 's announcements ?
The existence of these new notebooks is a given — they are , after all , acknowledged right in Apple 's invitation for the event , as well as an Apple support document accidentally posted on the company 's website over the weekend .
But it 's what 's on the inside ( and outside ) that has people really buzzing .
Reports surfaced in July that Apple would use a mobile chipset from NVIDIA in its redesigned notebooks instead of adopting Intel 's Montevina platform .
Then last month , we heard a rumor that the chipset would in fact be from NVIDIA 's MCP7 x series .
The latest info from today pinpoints the NVIDIA MCP79 as the lucky winner .
Besides the improved graphics performance over Intel 's offering , NVIDIA 's chipset offers the benefit of using only one discrete IC instead of two .
That allows Apple to save some space on the motherboard and should ideally draw less power .
Various leaked photographs of the new MacBooks lend credence to long - whispered rumors that the MacBook line will be moving away from plastic casings and adopting the aluminum case of its siblings , the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air .
The future of FireWire in the MacBook is unknown , as these photos seem to suggest that the entry - level systems will no longer have any FireWire support .
The 15 " MacBook Pro is supposedly losing FW400 support and will now only have one FW800 port .
There are a handful of other , less - predictable rumors about what we might see tomorrow , too .
Digg founder Kevin Rose claimed last week that a source told him that the new notebooks would sport Blu-ray drives .
If true , then the announcement will finally put to rest a rumor that has been making the rounds for years now .
And of course , there 's the rumor from July that the updated notebooks might have glass trackpads and that a Mac tablet might finally make an appearance .
Finally , on the craziest end of things , Weblogs , Inc. founder Jason Calacanis made headlines recently by saying that Apple plans to introduce a line of networked HDTVs that will be able to stream content from Macs and PCs , Apple - TV style ( but sans the Apple TV ) .
Let 's just say we 're not putting our money on that one .
With so much speculation going around , some more off - the - wall than others , prospective Apple notebook buyers can't decide whether to be excited about tomorrow or not .
As for us , we 've learned our lesson the hard way — all we 're expecting are new notebooks , and everything else is gravy .
Be sure to check back on our front page tomorrow morning for our live coverage of the notebook event as it unfolds so we can all be surprised ( or not ) together !
The era of 8 bit music
Before the 1980 ’s , games had no background music apart from the beeps heard when moving from one level to another .
But background music for games is undeniably thrilling for any gamer .
Gradually the 8 bit music developed , which finds its origin in Europe .
Especially the well - known background music of Super Mario is a characteristic 8 bit music .
But what exactly does 8 bit music mean ?
8bit music ( also known as chiptunes , bitpop , or chip music ) is a computer - generated music .
What distinguishes this music genre from any other kind of music is the technology used to produce it .
8 bit music is made using the technology of vintage video games and computer tools .
There are many systems associated with 8 bit music as the Amiga 500 , Nintendo Entertainment System or Famicom , Commodore 64 , and the Nintendo Game Boy .
History of 8 bit Music
The first home computers , such as the IBM PC and Apple 2 , had system speakers installed , which were directly controlled by the CPU .
Thus , it was possible to produce clicks and certain tones .
Therefore some very advanced sound of music could be produced this way .
But the problem here was , that it required almost the entire CPU ’s runtime to accomplish it .
So the computer had nothing left over to do anything else .
To take this load away from the CPU , a special sound chip was created .
This chip became the basis of the popular 8 bit music .
The very first chiptunes were simple and only involved beep sounds .
However , as time progressed , the computers became more powerful and could produce different sound waves .
Thus , it became possible to play a variety of different soundtracks at the same time .
With time the music spread to America and Japan through sharing of sounds among the countries .
From the 8bit music many Chiptune - musicians established themselves .
Their sounds range from rock to pop or even dubstep .
Chiptunes in video games
By the early 1980 ’s computers had become cheap , and that enabled people to upgrade their machines .
As such , chip music producers made use of the abandoned computers and game consoles .
Especially the use of chiptunes in video games became very popular .
The first video to use chip music was Nishikado ’s arcade game , Gun Fight .
The first game with an opening melody was released in 1975 .
In 1978 , Nishikado released Space Invaders , a game which had bass notes that increased pace as the invaders attacked the player .
The chip music on the video game interacted with the players , and that made it more engaging as opposed to a game with no music .
Rally X , another popular game , was released in 1980 by Namco , and it had uninterrupted background music throughout the play time .
Use of consoles instead of computers
Spectrum was the earliest hardware used to produce chip sounds .
The device had a three channel sound , a beeper , and a 128 k – AY - 3- 8912 chip .
Later , the Commodore 64 was introduced , and it had SID chip filters instead of wave sounds .
The Commodore Amiga was then developed .
This home computer originally had a four - channel sound system .
The consoles were introduced as an improvement .
These consoles had a five - channel sound , used 2 x pulse wave , 1 x triangle wave , 1 x noise , and 1 x low - quality sample data .
With time , there have been hacks by different artists that have made the chiptunes better .
For instance , Tim Follin hacked the 48 k beeper to play polyphonic sounds .
Chris Huelsbeck also hacked a seven - channel sound to work on a four channel Amiga .
Since the 1980 ’s , 8 bit music in video games has made significant improvements .
Artists have been coming up with better tunes , converters and trackers that can emulate the original hardware .
How to Make 8 bit Music
Basic 8 bit music makes use of waveforms such as Pulse , Sine , Triangle , Sawtooth and Noise .
Each chiptune is formed using a specific chip sound .
When you decide to follow a specific chip sound , you should stick to its requirements and waveforms to achieve the desired results .
There are trackers that can help you adhere to the limitations of a specific chip sound .
The trackers are used with the hardware to ensure that the sound produced is the actual sound of the hardware you are using .
When creating 8 bit music , it is necessary to follow a pattern that contains several tracks playing at once to form a song .
Each pattern has a particular order that determines when the songs should be played , for how long , and whether it should be looped or not .
As mentioned earlier , each waveform gives a specific chip sound :
The sawtooth waveform is sharp and can be used either for melodies or bass .
Sawtooth is mainly supported by the Famicom Disk System but can also be used partly on NES applications .

Sawtooth is mainly supported by the Famicom Disk System but can also be used partly on .
Pulse waveform , on the other hand , can vary its cycle to produce either hollow or sharp sounds .
, on the other hand , can vary its cycle to produce either hollow or sharp sounds .
Sine waveform produces soft , even sounds , and it mostly sounds like an acoustic guitar .
This particular waveform sounds better when used on high frequencies because it is only then that you can tell the difference between the notes .
produces soft , even sounds , and it mostly sounds like an acoustic guitar .
This particular waveform sounds better when used on high frequencies because it is only then that you can tell the difference between the notes .
The triangle waveform is typically used for the low bass notes and has a more reedy , thin sound .
The notes adjust the chip sounds and match them to musical notes , allowing artists to come up with tunes of various complexities .
Effects are also used alongside the notes because they act as commands given to the notes instructing them to play a particular sound such as pulse , sawtooth or noise .
Software Tools
Trackers are the primary software used in the creation of chip music .
Whereas trackers are different from each other , the methodology applied in the making of chip music is practically the same on all trackers .
Tracks are vertical strips onto which one constructs the music .
Modern trackers can make more tracks compared to the older ones .
MOD
Karsten Obarski invented 1987 the MOD format for his Ultimate Tracker running on Amiga computers .
Since then many songs , especially for the demoscene , were created .
All MOD samples are stored in 8 bits and the number of voices is limited to four .
To have something similarly to chords , the three notes of it are repeated very fast .
This makes MODs sound so freaky .
One of the most popular Flash - Modplayers was 8BitBoy , an amiga modplayer for the flash9 player .
Famitracker
Famitracker is a free windows tracker .
It works as a windows application and can help music composers come up with chip sounds without hardware .
The tracker has NSF - file exporting capability that allows the sounds created to be played on real hardware or to be used in NES - applications .
Famitracker produces chips similar to 2AO3 chip .
Open Modplug Tracker
Open Modplug Tracker is Another widely - used software is the Open Modplug Tracker .
It is available on Windows , and it supports Virtual Studio Technology ( VST ) effects .
Instruments supported by the Open Modplug Tracker include synthesisers and drum kits .
The tracker can work with ITP , MOD and XM files .
SonantLive
Another software 8 bit music artist ’s use is the SonantLive .
This one works on the browser .
The software gives essential guidance on the use of patterns , waves and sequences .
Most importantly , SonantLive offers details on the process of constructing patterns .
SunVox
SunVox software can also be used to compose music .
It has more synthesisers and effects as compared to SonantLive .
The software is flexible in architecture and allows users with older versions of windows to use it .
It works on mobile devices .
The software is supported by both Windows and Android devices .
Conclusion <
8bit music has evolved over the years and has continually been used by gamers as a background for various games .
Currently , it is possible to produce the chiptunes using software such as SonantLive and Sonvox .
The tunes are enhanced by effects that make games more engaging for the players .
DFLer Al Franken asked Monday to have rejected absentee ballots be considered in the U.S. Senate election results that are to be certified today by a state board , a move later blunted by an attorney general 's opinion that the issue should be left to the courts .
The eleventh - hour maneuvering occurred as the five - member state Canvassing Board prepared to meet at 1 p.m. today in St. Paul to review results showing Republican Sen.
Norm Coleman with a lead of 215 votes out of more than 2.9 million cast .
That margin includes the canvassed results submitted by Minnesota 's 87 counties , plus an additional nine votes in Coleman 's favor that emerged from a post-election audit conducted in a sampling of about 200 precincts to check the accuracy of voting machines .
The difference is well within the one - half percentage point required to trigger an automatic hand recount , which Secretary of State Mark Ritchie said he was " absolutely " certain will begin Wednesday morning despite the last - minute challenge .
The Franken campaign filed a brief Monday asking the Canvassing Board to consider including improperly rejected absentee ballots in today 's official tally .
Granting that request would make it practically impossible to proceed to the recount on Wednesday .
However , the state attorney general 's office later issued a three - page opinion requested by Ritchie that said the board 's job today is purely administrative , not to determine the eligibility of a voter or whether absentee ballots were properly accepted .
Wrote Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Raschke Jr. : " Courts that have reviewed this issue have opined that rejected absentee or provisional ballots are not cast in an election . "
Improperly rejected absentee ballots can be challenged in court , he wrote .
Ritchie , who will chair the Canvassing Board , which also includes two state Supreme Court justices and two Ramsey County district judges , said the panel will hear presentations of vote results from the counties and the equipment audit .
Those numbers will be combined to provide the tally officially accepted by the board , he said .
The board also will approve a list of recount procedures -- already reviewed by the rival campaigns and state legal officials -- that assigns duties for officials at each location , details how the ballots will be handled and documented , and allows the public to attend the counting .
The panel also will serve as the canvassing board for the recount .
Ritchie released a final list of 107 sites across the state where recounts will take place and when they will begin .
To help the public follow the recount 's progress , his office is creating a special website that will keep an unofficial running tally of the number of votes counted for Coleman and Franken , the number of ballots challenged by each campaign and the number cast for other candidates .
The website , which will update figures at 8 p.m. every day , will include a breakdown of the count by counties and precincts as the work is finished , Ritchie said .
Franken camp 's position Franken spokesman Andy Barr said Monday that the campaign knew of " hundreds " of absentee ballots that had been rejected by election judges , and that at least a dozen counties had so far complied with the campaign 's formal request to each Minnesota county for lists of rejected ballots .
He said a hearing is scheduled Wednesday in the campaign 's lawsuit seeking Ramsey County 's list .
The 18 - page legal brief that the campaign filed Monday with the state Canvassing Board included four examples of absentee voters said to be disenfranchised when their ballots were rejected .
Jessup Schiks , of Kandiyohi County , had his absentee ballot rejected because officials ruled the signature did n't match the registration card ; campaign officials said Schiks later signed an affidavit confirming the ballot was his .
In another case , Bruce Behrens , a Goodhue County resident , said his absentee ballot was rejected because officials believed his girlfriend , who vouched for him , was n't a registered voter even though she is .

Anne Applebaum and Joe Klein , like countless others , cannot support McCain because of his repulsive , vicious , negative , McCarthyite campaign and his unvetted spur - of - the - moment decision to pick Sarah Palin , an unhinged , know - nothing , delusional religious fanatic , as his veep .
But Mickey argues that none of this matters - because McCain is really a good government liberal who just had to be mean to stand a chance .
Does Mickey really believe that ?
Does he believe that McCain 's campaign and his pick of Palin tell us nothing about what kind of president he'd be ?
Does he believe that we have learned nothing about McCain 's character in this campaign or that character is irrelevant in a president ?
Mickey , of course , is obsessed with immigration and believes that McCain would actually support a Bush - style immigration law were he to win next week .
Really ?
Really ?
You see : what I 've learned from watching McCain these past two months is that there 's nothing he would n't do if it could get him a small bump in a news cycle , polarize the electorate , and appeal to a rabid base that is now his only source of power .
In my view , McCain would clearly be prepared to veto such a bill if it helped bring his party base behind him .
He would also have a veep who is running from Day One to succeed him and eager to play the most revanchist elements in her base against her boss .
She 'd become an anti-immigration hawk as soon as you can say " you betcha " - especially if threatened by a Dobbsian primary challenger in 2012 .
I mean : if she 's prepared to undermine him in a national campaign , when he 's the only reason she is n't still padding her expense account in Alaska , why would n't she do it in office ?
One thing we have also learned from the campaign is that Palin would work to undermine McCain from the very start .
I think even the McCain camp has figured that out by now .
Emotions run hot on election eve , and few emotions are more a - boil right now than liberal paranoia .
I hear it constantly : I do n't care about the polls .
I wo n't believe it until I see it .
The Republicans stole 2000 and 2004 , and they 'll steal this one .
This dark pessimism is fortified by a corollary anxiety that each new revelation about Barack Obama will surely bring the whole enterprise crashing down and make middle Americans wake up and say to themselves , " Of course .
What was I thinking ?
Back to McCain ! "
This past weekend it was the story about Obama 's auntie in Boston , a woman living in the US illegally for the last four years .
But Zeituni Onyango is fading into the background , just another element of the farrago of last - minute titbits that make for future trivia questions .
Her name may have been unlawfully leaked to the press by officials seeking to do Obama damage .
But whatever the truth of that matter , the injury to Obama would appear to be minimal .
And yet , some liberals feared that this revelation would be the death knell .
But in their terror , they have probably not stopped to ask themselves : if Bill Ayers and Jeremiah Wright and Rashid Khalidi - the Palestinian rights advocate with whom Obama is friendly and whom McCain smeared last week - did n't blow up this campaign , why would Onyango ?
Face it , liberal paranoiacs : the swift - boating of Barack Obama clearly is not working .
That it would work - indeed that it would define the contest - was the greatest fear of liberals everywhere as it became clear last spring that this somewhat unusual creature would carry the Democratic standard into battle this autumn .
Many foresaw an October full of racial innuendo , Obama - Osama Freudian slips and worse .
Sure enough , we did see a lot of it .
John McCain and Sarah Palin worked overtime to try to persuade Americans that Obama shared Ayers 's radical world view .
McCain 's disgraceful comparison of Khalidi to a " neo - Nazi " - this about an American citizen by birth who teaches at an Ivy League university and has no record of extremism beyond that which can be conjured on rightwing websites on the basis of the odd out of context quote - was perhaps the lowest point of his whole campaign .
And the Republicans have used race in subtle ways - the argument that Obama would take people 's hard - earned tax dollars and hand them to idlers on " welfare " is a very old racist trope in the US .
Here in the 11th hour , we are hearing that Obama is unpatriotic and a friend to criminals ; that he's not really a citizen of the US ( disproved over the weekend by birth registrars in the state of Hawaii ) ; and that his election will lead to a second Holocaust .
Yes , the voting is still a day away .
But so far none of it has amounted to a single point in the polls that I can see , except perhaps in some southern states where tradition dies hard .
Why ?
Three reasons .
First , the Obama team has responded quickly whenever such allegations have arisen .
John Kerry 's advisers let a fateful 15 days of swift - boating pass before they even addressed the issue .
Obama 's people have n't made that mistake .
They 've answered all charges and usually turned around and levelled a few charges of their own .
Second , the economic crisis really has fixed many voters ' minds on more germane questions .
Voters are more susceptible to character attacks when times are good and they do n't have real bread - and - butter issues to worry about .
But when times are tough , they actually do listen a little harder to discern which candidate seems to be more serious about addressing their problems .
The third reason is historical and is just my theory , but I think it 's right .
Broadly speaking , the American electorate consists of three chunks : committed conservatives , committed liberals and the uncommitted swing voters in the middle .
When Ronald Reagan realigned American politics in 1980 , he did so by forging a strong emotional alliance between the right and the middle .
Centrist voters gave Republicans and conservatives the benefit of the doubt and looked upon Democrats and liberals , whom Reagan successfully discredited , with deep suspicion .
In that context , charges that Democrats were n't good Americans tended to stick .
Whether it was Michael Dukakis 's membership in the American Civil Liberties Union in 1988 or Kerry and the swift - boaters last time around , conservative allegations that Democrats seem alien and elitist and not fully American took hold with voters in the middle .
They accepted terms of argument set by the Republicans .
But post - George Bush we 're in a new context .
That coalition of affinity that Reagan created between right and middle , Bush has put asunder .
His failures have made the average , apolitical American as distrustful of conservatism as he or she once was of liberalism - indeed somewhat more so , since the memory of conservative failure is fresher in the mind .
This is a new context .
Many experts have yet to grasp it .
Certain elements within the mainstream media have n't quite got it yet .
And clearly some liberals just can't believe that it might be the case .
This is not to say that negative campaigning will disappear as of tomorrow .
But it is to observe that political contexts change , and eras end .
I 'm still suspicious enough to use the conditional tense , but by Wednesday morning even the most paranoid liberals may be forced to accept that fact .

S.F. considers congestion tolls on cars Board looks hard at congestion - based tolls for cars in popular areas during rush hour
Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close S.F. considers congestion tolls on cars 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Drivers could pay $ 3 to enter , leave or pass through parts of San Francisco during morning and evening commutes under a proposal designed to push motorists out of their cars .
The San Francisco County Transportation Authority , which has been studying the idea of imposing congestion - based tolls on city streets for nearly two years , released some of the details of its study Tuesday at a meeting of its board , which is made up of the 11 members of the Board of Supervisors .
The board wo n't consider recommending a congestion toll plan until February , but members nodded their heads during the report , and at least three , Jake McGoldrick , Tom Ammiano and Ross Mirkarimi , offered words of support .
" Clearly , I like where this is going , " said Mirkarimi .
The congestion toll , if implemented , would be the first in the nation .
Similar tolls , also known as cordon tolls , have been used in London and Stockholm , where they 're credited with reducing traffic congestion , air pollution and miles driven .
They also have raised tens of millions annually for public transportation improvements .
While many of the details are still being studied , Zabe Bent , principal planner for the authority , said a $ 3 toll was chosen because it would probably influence how many people choose to drive versus walking , biking or taking transit .
However , the actual toll price will be determined by the mayor and Board of Supervisors if they choose to move the plan ahead , said Jose Luis Moscovich , executive director of the authority .
Long process ahead
" There 's going to be a long process of determining the toll , " he said .
" There are many variables , including social variables .
The amount we arrive at may be very different . "
The $ 3 toll would be collected on weekdays between 6 and 9 a.m. and 4 and 7 p.m. - meaning the average car commuter would pay $ 6 a day in congestion tolls .
The fees would be collected using FasTrak transponders and a network of cameras .
Motorists would be able to pay via phone , the Internet or retail outlets .
Drivers interviewed downtown Tuesday said having to pay an additional $ 6 probably would prompt them to take public transit , drive when the tolls are n't charged or skip San Francisco altogether .
" I wo n't come here , " said Chris Concepcion , who is retired and lives in Pleasanton .
" I 'll go somewhere else .
There 's nothing unique about some of the things in San Francisco .
You can find them elsewhere . "
But for those occasions when he really wants to come downtown , Concepcion said , he 'd probably take BART .
Brian Gigliotto , a financial adviser who lives and works in San Francisco , was n't sure if it would affect his commute to downtown .
" I 'd either suck it up and pay it if it were a small amount , " he said .
" Or I 'd take public transit . "
Selecting a route
Planners are still considering where to collect the tolls .
Initially , they considered establishing a downtown zone - a twin triangle area bounded by Washington , Jones , Turk and Harrison streets and Van Ness Avenue .
Then they looked at charging fees at the city 's major gateways : the Bay and Golden Gate bridges , Highway 101 and Interstate 280 .
But the downtown zone was too small , and drivers would just avoid it , causing problems in adjacent neighborhoods , Bent said .
And charging at the gateways would reduce traffic from outside San Francisco but might end up encouraging more driving among city residents , she said .
So the study is focusing on two other scenarios :
-- The " double - ring , " which would charge a toll at gateways and another toll at the downtown zone .
Tolls at one of the areas would be higher than the other - perhaps $ 1.50 at the gateways and $ 3 downtown , or vice versa .
--
The northeast cordon - a larger toll zone that would include downtown and Civic Center but also Fisherman 's Wharf , North Beach and a number of other neighborhoods .
The boundaries would include the waterfront on the north and east , Divisadero and Castro streets on the west and 18th Street on the south .
The congestion toll could raise between $ 35 million and $ 65 million a year - money that could be invested in transportation improvements , with an emphasis on boosting service and capacity on Muni , BART and other transit agencies that serve San Francisco .
Tolls pay for improvements
Transit improvements that could be funded with the toll include bus rapid transit on the Van Ness Avenue and Geary Boulevard corridors , more frequent local and regional service , more regional transit parking , electrification of the Caltrain line , bicycle lanes and a bike - sharing program .
Drivers interviewed said better transit service will be necessary if the plan is to work .
Tom Radulovich , a BART director from San Francisco , told the board that trains are already crowded and urged investments in BART and Muni Metro as part of the plan .
" We 've already reached our design capacity , " he said , " and are going to need to make investments in expanding rail capacity . "
He also suggested the city consider a free - transit zone downtown - something offered in Seattle and Portland - to entice commuters .
Moscovich said the transit improvements are likely to focus on increasing the amount of transit available and the frequency of service " to be competitive with the auto . "
The congestion toll plan would also offer discounts to some drivers - including taxi drivers , who would not have to pay .
Low - income and disabled drivers and residents of the toll zone would pay half , and drivers who paid bridge tolls would get a $ 1 discount .
Commercial vehicles , rental cars and car - sharing vehicles would pay a lower fleet rate .
The authority will hold public meetings on the plan in December , narrow down the options being studied in December and January , and issue its final recommendations to the Board of Supervisors in February .
If the plan moves forward , environmental studies would need to be done - a process that would take two to three years .
" This is not something we 're doing tomorrow , " said Moscovich .
" But we need to think about it today in the middle of warnings of a recession because we need to plan it today to be ready for tomorrow . "
What 's next Early December : Four public workshops and meetings will be held to discuss the proposal .
Dec. 16 : The Transportation Authority board will vote on which geographic toll approach should be pursued - where tolls should be collected and transportation improvements planned .
January : Transportation Authority planners will conduct additional studies on transportation improvements , toll rates , and discounts or exemptions .
February :
The board will make its final recommendation to the Board of Supervisors and Mayor Gavin Newsom .
Despite these high - profile solar energy projects , Strong says there 's been little commitment to renewable energy since the 1970s .
“ Each administration since Richard Nixon has championed a goal of American energy independence , ” says Strong .
“ There ’s been a great deal of talk , and the first world oil embargo we were importing about 15 percent of our domestic demand in the U.S. , and now it ’s about 70 percent , so you can see there ’s been no progress — none . ”
Strong spoke to CNBC about advancements in the renewable energy space , the challenges renewable energy is facing currently and what the next presidential administration can do to help renewable energy reach its potential .
What are some major advancements that have been made in solar energy in the past 5 years ?
It 's mainly been a volume - building exercise , as more companies come into the marketplace , and everybody that 's established tries to build production volume , and that ’s for two reasons : the market demand is finally there ; and second , as we know from many other technology booms , for example the personal computer , the iPhone or PDA , volume increase reduces individual unit cost ... There have been efficiency upgrades all along the way , those have been evolutionary or incremental .
We have n’t seen any major breakthroughs but mainly incremental progress and the steady reduction in cost as volume builds .
What are some important misconceptions about solar energy ?
It ’s free .
The fuel is free , but the investment in the equipment and system is significant , and it ’s a capital investment that you make all up front .
You 're buying decades worth of free energy once the systems are in place and operational , but you need to pay for that in advance , and we as Americans are n't used to paying for anything in advance , so it 's a bit of a conundrum for people to get their arms around .
When , if ever , do you see price parity with conventional types of energy ?
I see price parity absolutely , but keep in mind there are two factors that contribute to that .
One is the reduction in cost of the alternatives and the other is the rising cost the conventional energy sources , and I ’m afraid that the rising cost of conventional energy sources are going to drive the price parity crossing point probably as much or more than the price reduction of solar or wind for that matter , although wind - big wind , utility - scale wind - is likely to reach cost parity sooner than distributive solar .
An LGF reader contacted Columbia University ( and a lot of other potential sources , including the LA Times ) with a polite request that they help release the tape of Rashid Khalidi with Barack Obama ( the video the Los Angeles Times has … unbelievably … decided to suppress during a hotly contested election ) :
From : [ redacted ]
To : [ redacted ]
Sent : Mon Oct 27 18:28:41 2008
Subject : Please release Khalidi ’s 2003 tape
Dear Madam or Sir ,
It has come to my attention that the LA Times in in possession of a tape recording a 2003 farewell party for Rashid Khalidi .
In an article , the LA Times said :
“ The event was videotaped , and a copy of the tape was obtained by The Times . ”
This event was attended by Senator Barrack Obama .
As this is an election period , as journalists , you have the moral obligation to release any and all information you possess about both candidates .
I would be grateful if you can release the videotape .
It ’s our right as Americans to learn about our candidates .
Cordially ,

this may sound good and all , but in the then end costs much more to the end user .
the user has to invest in a different processor , motherboard and RAM .
anyways very thoughtful of BFG .

They might not necessarily need a new cpu , some boards come as S775 and AM2 .
Although this would be good for those who are thinking about upgrading and can get a better gpu for free while moving to pci-e .

On the other hand , if you were planning on doing an upgrade from an old AGP system anyway , this is actually a pretty cool deal .

Bin them I guess .
Since this is about improving the companies image they do n't care if they make a loss as long as people associate BFG as that company that gave them a free card , in otherwords a PR stunt .

Yeah they have such big hearts .
lol
They most probably desperately need those cards , that 's why they are doing this .
If you have stuff like life time warranty written on some of your products stuff like this happens .
They give those PCIE cards " away " because they could n't convince someone else to trade in their AGP cards .
Why do you think they have to be in working condition ?
Eh ?

Where 's the catch ?
This is one heck of a deal by BFG .
Not really sure it makes economic sense to them except for some free marketing and perhaps some brand loyalty ?
Perhaps they have a lot of stock they need to shift , and hope that most peeps will go for the $ 50 upgrade .
Or
Perhaps those terms and conditions require you to buy a new motherboard to get the AGP swap deal .
Anyone applied for it , and received a copy of the terms and conditions ?

I have the impression Katanai is spot on .
Maybe it even costs them more to support those AGP cards than giving the new ones away .

Marketing is the only reason I can see .
So that the next person you tell to be a video card from would be from them .

Maybe they are getting rid of cards that ar n't selling and getting thier name out there .
As for the old cards they just bin them and they save themselves a little more money than if they kept all the new cards : confused :

I get the strange feeling they 'll somehow be converted to a hefty tax write - off . . . it's that time of year for business to make some " investments " that 'll cover their butts in the next few months .
The cards going out can probably be written - off as charitable donations , the AGP cards can probably be parted and sent out for recycling ( another tax - break ) . . . the coolers can probably come off and be sent for scrap metal , plastics can be melted down for recycling . . .
there 's something that will go on behind the scenes , but we 'll never know it .
It 's still an awesome deal on their part , though .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. Sen .
Hillary Clinton left the door open to becoming secretary of state on Friday , a day after a meeting with President - elect Barack Obama at which a Democratic official said they discussed the job .
Obama ’s selection of Clinton would be a bold move that would bring into his coming administration a high - profile former rival who had questioned his level of experience and his foreign policy ideas in the Democratic primary battle earlier this year .
In introductory remarks at a speech in Albany , New York , Clinton , wife of former President Bill Clinton , did not confirm or deny that she had a secret meeting with Obama on Thursday .
Democratic officials said the meeting did take place .
“ I ’m not going to speculate or address anything about the president - elect ’s incoming administration .
And I am going to respect his process and any inquiries should be directed to his transition team , ” Clinton said .
The Obama ’s transition office in his hometown Chicago refused to comment .
The Washington Post , meanwhile , said Obama met on Friday with another former rival , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson , and that they talked about the secretary of state position .
A Democratic official told Reuters that Clinton and Obama “ had a serious meeting but the question was whether an actual offer was made . ”
CNN quoted Democratic sources as saying Obama and Clinton had a serious discussion to gauge her interest in becoming secretary of state and that she left the meeting with the impression the job was hers if she wanted it .
Nominating Clinton for the job would be a dramatic step by Obama as he seeks to build a high - powered team in Washington .
He defeated the New York senator in a sometimes bitter duel for the presidential nomination , then miffed her supporters by not choosing her as his vice presidential running mate .
Obama also scheduled a meeting in Chicago on Monday with Republican Sen.
John McCain , their first face - to - face talks since Obama defeated him in the presidential election on November 4 .
Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said Obama and McCain would discuss ways to bring about a “ more effective and efficient federal government . ”
McCain had campaigned on reforming government by cutting out programs and reducing spending .
WOULD CLINTON TAKE THE JOB ?
Washington was abuzz with the news that Clinton might be on Obama ’s short list and be a member of a “ team of rivals ” in much the same way Abraham Lincoln consolidated power by bringing his opponents into his Cabinet .

Many experts thought she would be a strong choice for secretary of state -- she would be the third woman to hold the job after Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice .
“ You need someone who can be taken seriously internationally , who has that kind of experience and policy ability , but also has the gravitas to make people sit down at the table , ” Democratic strategist Liz Chadderdon said .
But the question was whether she would take the job if offered .
An alternative could be to remain in the Senate and use her clout to have a say in Obama ’s proposals and keep an independent platform for another possible run for president .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
There were also questions about how her spotlight - loving husband would be managed if his wife were the top diplomat .
Obama has already turned to many former members of Bill Clinton ’s administration for help in his transition to power , including his chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , and co-chairman of his transition team , John Podesta .
Considering Clinton for secretary of state would mean Obama was expanding his search beyond other candidates mentioned for the job , such as Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry , a Democrat who lost the 2004 presidential election to George W. Bush ; Nebraska Sen.
Chuck Hagel , a Republican who backed Obama over McCain this year ; and Richardson , who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during Bill Clinton ’s presidency .
Obama has been closeted all week in meetings in his transition office in Chicago as he prepares to take over the presidency on January 20 .
New Jersey Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine said on MSNBC that Clinton would be great as secretary of state .
“ She probably knows every major foreign leader .
There ’s already a relationship where she can sit and talk directly about the problems that exist either on a bilateral or multilateral basis , ” he said .
Corzine would not address speculation that he is a candidate to be Obama ’s Treasury secretary , amid reports that another candidate for the position , Lawrence Summers , was fading due to opposition from women ’s groups upset at him during his tenure as president of Harvard University .
In 1990 , a new species was born .
It was not formed from the cross - breeding of existing creatures .
It did n’t evolve from a simple to a complex organism .
It sprung from the hands of a Dutch artist whose imagination and technical knowledge somehow turned plastic yellow tubes into graceful beach faring creatures .
( image via : Loek van der Klis )
Theo Jansen calls his kinetic sculptures “ Animari . ”
The creatures walk in herds on beaches , powered only by the wind .
Some of them are able to capture and store the wind , then keep moving for extended times .
Some even have the ability to anchor themselves in the sand when the wind threatens to blow them away – allowing the plastic - tube critters to engage in active self - preservation .
( images via : Strandbeest )
Jansen was n’t always a creator of life .
He once studied physics , later quitting to become a painter .
He caused near - panic in a town with his homemade “ UFO ” and invented an amazing painting machine in the following years .
In 1990 , he found the happy medium between physics and art with the creation of Animari .
The number of tubes and the length of each tube determines the genetic “ code ” of each strandbeest ( or beach animal ) , dictating how it will move and interact with its environment .
If you think the idea of wind - powered beach crawling creatures sounds odd , you ’ll be amazed at the artist ’s vision of their future .
He theorizes that one day the animali will be able to evolve just like the organic beings on earth : by challenging each other .
The winner will absorb the loser ’s “ DNA ” and continue to grow and learn new things .
Theo Jansen says that the creatures will one day have muscles , as well as brains complicated enough to allow them to perform complex actions .
This video gives a glimpse into the lives of animari and their creator .
Whether these strandbeest continue to evolve or not , they are compelling on their own as art and as a beautiful example of inventive engineering .
0:36 Intro . Kling podcast : thanks for feedback .
Timely stuff : slim operation , taping in advance , editing , changing .
Clay Shirky .
Role of technology and allowing spontaneous organizations to emerge .
Why do they emerge and what stops them ?
Famous observation , Coase , 1930s : organizations exist to lower transactions costs .
If markets are such a good idea , why do we have firms ?
If everything were a market , the cost of discovering opportunity and writing a contract for every little thing would swamp the ability of the organization to get anything done .
Pencils for desk .
Markets exist where level of transaction is large enough and complexity of interacting actors large enough that you can't have an organized firm .
Communism .
Internet mobile phones applications : finding things easier because of search engines ; transactions easier .
Easier to find people interested in what you are interested in or who have skills complementary to yours .
Sharing , collaboration , social tools .
What we did n't notice :
In additional to nominal Coasian ceiling , also a Coasian floor .
There is a set of transactions that no one engages in because you have to be organized to engage in them but no organization is willing to eat the costs .
Transactions costs are too high .
Middle management is the requirement .
4:45 Overhead of maintaining an institution that can lower those costs itself entails costs .
Example : 2005 , Coney Island , run-down amusement park , Mermaid Parade .
On Flickr , photo - sharing , thousands of pictures of the Mermaid Parade .
Flickr had added tagging .
Automatically got this aggregate view .
Cost of doing this institutionally would have included advertising and doing something to coordinate and extract those people 's motives .
No profit motive ; no one would stand up on floor of House of Representatives .
What Flickr did was something no institution could do : side - effect .
Gap between a bunch of people want to look at this a little bit and bunch of people are willing to pay a lot of money to look at this .
There is value there , but not enough to overcome the transactions costs of putting that produce together .
Completely unintended .
Beyond Flickr 's staff 's capabilities .
Beta program that allows people to aggregate photos and create a 3 - D image .
Photosynth .
Need multiple exposures of a single space to knit together .
Average city block , need amateurs involved .
Aggregating step is the missing piece .
Coasian floor has dropped .
Words becoming less important , images becoming more important .
Flickr , over 3 billion images ; Facebook over 5 million .
Most totally uninteresting .
Big change here is the fusing of the old pattern of a broadcast network and a communications network .
TV different from phone .
Now all coming into the same box .
Cognitive dissonance .
Photo of someone else 's niece is totally uninteresting ; but the people who do care are very interested .
Things are in public but not for the public .
Something does n't have to be interesting to more than two people to be worth putting up on line .
Creates incentive to create more pictures .
Plus , looking at pictures of other people 's families teaches how to take better pictures , greater interest in photography .
Old model : had to join a photo club , subscribe to a magazine -- high threshold .
Gap is now a spectrum .
14:28 Economics of organizations : birthday paradox , choosing a movie .
What happens to social complexity as the size of the network goes up ?
Standing in line with 35 other people .
Guy next to you says " I 'll bet you $ 100 bucks that 2 people in the line have the same birthday . "
Most people wo n't take it because they think there 's only a 1 in 10 chance .
They are thinking about the wrong thing .
Does n't count individuals .
Counts pairs .
For three people , three pairs of birthdays ; four people , six pairs of birthdays ; five , 10 pairs of birthdays .
Number of pairs rises with the square of the number of participants , not at the same rate as the number of participants .
By the time you get 36 people , over 80 % chance that two share a birthday .
Nodes .
Large organizations are qualitatively different from small ones .
Big city is not just a small city on steroids .
If you and a friend want to go to a movie , relatively easy .
Try to get 10 friends to agree on a movie : 45 comparisons .
Soon get to a point where there has to be some formal mechanism like voting , or governance , like " I 'm going to this movie . "
Requirement for unilateralism is n't like it 's politically evil ; it 's the only way to organize large groups in an institutional setting .
Different on the web because web privileges strategies of effectiveness over efficiency .
Wikipedia : roughly 2 million contributors in English , something like 5 million across multiple languages .
Managerial group is tiny by comparison .
Much smaller relative to newspaper writers vs. managerial staff .
Registering every user , even if it cost only a nickel , would cost a million dollars .
Would bankrupt the organization .
Wisdom of crowds , Hayek .
Sounds more Age of Aquarius : when we see organized behavior we assume someone is organizing it ; not old way hierarchies , new way networks .
20:40 10 - person example : collective action is difficult because of our differences , different preferences , different costs .
Democracy : high transaction cost , inefficient ?
Two kinds of democracy : direct and representative .
Direct : Swiss canton system , town meetings , specifically limited by scale .
Certain sizes of cantonships that are not allowed to have direct democracy .
Ditto in Massachusetts .
Sometimes a family has trouble ; often done autocratically .
Can you do a better job of representing people 's preferences in such a way that relies less on representatives .
New York City : council may vote to overturn term limits although public has voted for term limits , Mayor wants to run another term and also offering another term to council members .
Bug in representative system .
Email , mobile phones are a possibility now .
Gory action film versus romantic comedy as movie choices , vote produces not will of the group but will of the majority .
Where you do n't have to have collective action , strange .
Live and let live decoupling .
Bunch of places where the government has to decide : garbage collection , school .
Why ?
Cheaper to do that way .
Flip side of the birthday paradox , Mancur Olson , logic of collective action .
Public goods exist in part because if they 're to be privately provisioned past a certain scale , everybody has an incentive to opt out .
Public goods get undercreated in purely voluntary situations .
Problem is that what is defined as a public good seems a stretch .
Throughout U.S. history , private schools .
Use of the Internet to turbocharge the home schooling movement .
Dropped out of state sponsored society but deeply in touch with each other .
Infrastructure that could only be provisioned by the state is now being provisioned by families who are networked with one another .
Pulling out of the compound versus social component .
End of cyberspace : People are using the Internet to augment their real - world activities rather than provide an alternative to them .
28:24 Creation of community , new social technique .
Pushback , probably from older folks , looking at it saying it 's creepy .
Low quality , misspelled communications , geeky warped people who do not interact with other human beings .
Extreme view .
Communication vs. broadcasting ; used to spell - checking .
People are writing more now .
Many criticisms are not directed at the Internet but at the culture of television .
Battle fought and lost by the 1960s .
Complaints have now shifted to the Internet .
Half - time job to watch television , 20 - 28 hours a week .

Sometimes , even if there is no conflict of interest or corruption going on in news , the perception that there might be a guiding hand behind editorial or reviews can be enough to damage the reputation of a site .
Full disclosure is incredibly important , and if readers get the whiff of something being kept from them , there is often hell to pay .
Such is the odd tale of GameCyte , a new gaming site that seems to be suffering the mother of all problems with disclosure : it 's owned by a gentleman named Richard Kain .
You might not know that name , but all gaming writers know the name TriplePoint , a PR company that handles clients such as EA Mythic , D3 Publisher , and Nyko .
Kain is also the General Manager of that company .
In other words , his gaming site is running stories and reviews on games that his PR company is paid to make popular .
Can you play both sides against the middle ?
We asked Kain point blank if it was ethical for him to publish a game news and review site with his strong financial interest in the industry .
"
If the product is independent , then of course , " he told Ars .
This issue came to light when Joystick Division , the gaming blog of the Village Voice , dug into the background of the site , and found that the domain was registered using domain privacy services that obscured who owned the site .
The link between TriplePoint PR and Pantheon Labs , the LLC that Kain owns that GameCyte operates under , is even stronger than it at first appears : the site 's writers are all ex-employees of TriplePoint , and while , by Kain 's own admission , the writers mostly work from home , they sometimes use the TriplePoint offices to conduct business meetings .
If you think the layers can't get any deeper , just wait .
The site gave a glowing review to Strong Bad 's Cool Game for Attractive People .
That 's not rare ; it 's a fun and amusing title , but the problem is , again , the lack of disclosure .
Telltale Games used to be a client of TriplePoint , but the relationship is much deeper than that : Kain is an investor in the Telltale games .
This presents a quagmire of ethical issues that went completely unaddressed by the site ; there is no disclosure of any kind in the review .
Kain is willing to accept full responsibility on this issue . " I was in huge error to not disclose that I own some Telltale shares .
I had too cavalierly assumed that because I was not involved in the article , it 's not material ; I did n't influence the article , " he told Ars .
" For that matter I did n't tell [ the writer ]
I owned Telltale shares for fear of influencing him .
Looking at how other sites treat this where proprietors have investments I see that 's still not up to snuff .
I have listed all my video game investments and in the future writers will mention that if an article touches on them . "
We contacted Telltale games , and the company was unaware of the issue until earlier this week .
" We look at GameCyte like any other site , and we deal with many sites ...
I do n't know who owns any of them , " Dan Connors , the CEO of Telltale Games told Ars .
" I do n't think there 's any evil corporate thing happening here . "
He points to the quality of the games Telltale releases ; a good game getting a positive review is slight evidence for any wrongdoing , and he does n't feel like this issue should reflect poorly on the company .
" When we met with them , there was nothing that was sketchy , " Emily Morganti , the marketing coordinator for Telltale said .
" There was nothing strange with the interaction .
All game sites are owned by a bigger entity .
It 's up to the gaming site to maintain the editorial 's integrity . "
The most important lesson : disclose , disclose , disclose
Kain does stress that disclosure is an open topic at the site .
" We clearly have to err on the side of doing even more disclosure than is perhaps standard in the future to ensure the reputation of the site survives , " he tells Ars .
" I want to be thoughtful about this and we 're making changes as we think them through .
What they , or anyone else who joins the site , may not do is write on something they had promoted in the past . "
The about page now features more disclosure , but none appears in the articles
This story is a bit of a PR problem , especially now that the names of clients and past associations are involved in a story about a conflict of interest .
It also appears as if the site has been invited to events or demos that provided strong coverage opportunities , which is rare for a gaming site of its size — Kain claims it has just 62,000 unique readers per month .
Kain seemed to bristle at the implication that he 's using his PR connections to get stories .
" [ The writers have ] done a ton of reviews with Nokia .
Nokia is not a client , " Kain told Joystick Division .
A quick search shows Nokia used to be a client .
" But Nintendo feels the site is big enough , " he goes on .
Yet again , however , one finds a connection with TriplePoint .
Julia Roether , TriplePoint 's Vice President , has a history with the company .
" Prior to joining TriplePoint , [ Roether ] worked for Golin / Harris where she oversaw public relations activities for Nintendo in the United States , " her bio reads .
Kain again addressed these points directly , and publicly in the story 's comments .
" I do stand corrected : Nokia was a client briefly three years ago for some N - Gage titles .
Julia did work for Nintendo's PR firm a year ago but had no role in getting a couple of free Wii points . "
What happens now ?
Ars asked Kain if he believed GameCyte now has a damaged reputation . "
That is an unfortunate possibility which I bear responsibility for .
So far , according to Jesse and Sean , we have n't seen any impact in the willingness to take their calls .
Time will tell , and the answer will be whether people read GameCyte and see the quality , diversity and independence of their work , and we better announce any relationships that could possibly be of concern , " he said .
" I understand the furor , it was avoidable because the inference of corruption is n't accurate and I could have easily solved that in advance . "
It 's this main point where Kain still does n't seem to understand the reaction of many gamers : even with no direct evidence of editorial corruption , the conflict of interest is massive , and the disclosures may have to be nearly constant .
If TriplePoint sits down with a publisher in hopes of representing it , do they have to disclose to the potential client the editorial coverage from GameCyte , or do they have to put the disclosure of potential business relationships in editorial coverage of those games ?
A teenage cheerleader was kicked off the New England Patriots ' squad after pictures of her crouched over an apparently unconscious man surfaced on Internet .
In two pictures , Caitlin Davis is shown brandishing a Sharpie over a man whose skin is covered in drawings and graffiti , among them two swastikas and the words " Im[ sic ] Jew .
"
( The images are posted at left , with explicit language intact .
Discretion is advised . )
“ She is no longer with the squad , ” Pats spokesman Stacey James told the Boston Herald yesterday .
Davis ' story fits an arc –– moving from obscurity to Internet infamy in a matter of hours –– that Americans are increasingly familiar with .
In April , an upbeat Davis told a local paper that she wanted to join team owner Bob Kraft 's organization because , " in addition to spreading a good image for the Patriots , you do some good things for others . "
Weeks later , she became the youngest cheerleader ever to make an NFL squad .
When the pictures -- originally posted to Facebook but then spreading across the internet –– became public on Tuesday , the Patriots were quick to react .
News of the firing was particularly unsurprising given that Kraft is a major benefactor for multiple Jewish causes .
To be fair , there is no proof that Davis wrote or drew any of the offending bits of graffiti on the man in the picture , but the scandalous story has brought her career with New England to an end .
Lieberman reckoning nears as Dem ally calls for ' consequences '

Will he stay or will he go ?
Tuesday morning , Democratic senators are expected to decide whether they want to keep Joe Lieberman in their caucus and allow him to remain chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
There have been calls to strip the Independent Connecticut senator of his powerful post or even boot him from the caucus , although few Democratic senators have been willing to go on record against Lieberman .
Delaware Sen .
Tom Carper became the latest Democrat to condemn Lieberman 's actions during the presidential campaign .
Carper told The Hill on Monday that there needs to be " consequences " for Lieberman , although he did not directly call for stripping his chairmanship .
" There need to be consequences , and they cannot be insignificant , " Carper said in a Monday interview with The Hill .
Carper , a fellow centrist who was Delaware campaign chairman for Liebermans failed bid for president in 2004 , said he and many other Senate Democrats are disappointed and even angered by their colleague 's sometimes - inflammatory rhetoric during this year 's presidential campaign .
Lieberman reportedly plans to address the caucus before their meeting , although it remains unclear if he will apologize or otherwise make amends for his early and enthusiastic endorsement of John McCain 's presidential campaign .
In myriad campaign appearances , including a prime - time address to the Republican National Convention , Lieberman led the charge in criticizing Barack Obama 's views on the war on terror and raising questions about his support for Israel .
Few details have emerged about just what will transpire at Tuesday 's meeting , and it 's unclear whether Democratic senators will be asked just to strip Lieberman of his chairmanship or expel him from the caucus altogether .
Several Democrats -- including President - elect Obama , who resigned his Senate seat Sunday -- have called for Lieberman 's continued presence in the caucus .
So far only Sens. Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders , Vermont 's two senators , have explicitly called for Lieberman to lose his chairmanship .
On Sunday , Sen. Byron Dorgon ( D - ND ) said it would be unacceptable for Lieberman to remain chairman .
Lieberman and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid met two days after the election , in what Reid said he hoped would be the " first ... of several conversations . "
An aide to the majority leader says the two have not sat down together since then , although the two have reportedly spoken by phone .
A spokesman for Lieberman did not return a phone call from RAW STORY Monday .
Senate Democratic leaders plan a press conference in the Capitol following the conclusion of Tuesday morning 's meeting .

A decision has been made .
The California Supreme Court has decided to hear the legal issues over Prop. 8 , the same - sex marriage ban which passed by razor - thin 52 % of the vote , but said it wo n't issue a stay against the voter - approved same - sex marriage ban .
Which is to say , county clerks will not be allowed to resume issuing licenses to queer couples until the case is decided .
Prop. 8 is still in effect .
Court spokeswoman Lynn Holton , according to the The Sacramento Bee , said the court asked the parties who filed the suits to write briefs on three issues :
(1) Is Proposition 8 invalid because it constitutes a revision of , rather than an amendment to , the California Constitution ?
( 2 ) Does Proposition 8 violate the separation - of - powers doctrine under the California Constitution ?
( 3 ) If Proposition 8 is not unconstitutional , what is its effect , if any , on the marriages of same - sex couples performed before the adoption of Proposition 8 ?
( Feel free to write your own brief briefs as well in the comments , readers . )
An " oral argument " could happen as early as March 2009 .
