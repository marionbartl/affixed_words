As the Bush family prepares to pack their bags and head back to Texas , some of the retrospectives have been looking at both George W Bush and wife Laura Bush ’s pasts , and some media reports and an episode of The Family Guy mentioned the fact that Laura Bush killed a guy .
It ’s a sad story , but also completely true : First Lady Laura
Bush did kill a guy , although a very long time ago .
In 1963 when then 17 , Laura Bush ran a stop sign in a crash that killed a friend in another car .
Some reports say it was her then boyfriend in the other car .
The police report was released in 2000 , and noted that Laura was n’t charged with a crime for the death .
“ It was a terrible , terrible thing , ” she said .
“ I know this as an adult , and even more as a parent , it was crushing … for the family involved and for me as well . ”
The big question though is why she was n’t charged way back then .
Perhaps the rich got even better treatment in Texas back in 63 .
Update : here ’s the clip from The Family Guy
The schoolchildren bounded up the rickety steps and followed the path of shattered glass into the two - story house on Laguna Salada Street .
Two boys in neatly pressed gray pants flipped open their cellphones and took pictures of the pools of sticky blood .
One teenager with a blue backpack pounced on a mangled bullet lying near a stained mattress .
In the living room , someone slipped on a pile of human entrails .
Downstairs , girls in blue skirts and white socks carefully avoided the blood dripping through the ceiling .
The “ Scarface ” poster hanging on the pockmarked wall disappeared .
The day before , a shootout between Mexican soldiers and drug cartel suspects had left three suspects and a soldier dead in the safe house at the end of a quiet cul - de-sac .
Police had cleared the bodies , including the corpse of a kidnapping victim stuffed in a refrigerator .
But someone had left the door open .
“ Look , intestines ! ” yelled one teen , who was among dozens of children who streamed through the house between classes at nearby Secondary School 25 .
“ I think I ’m going to be sick , ” said one boy , covering his mouth .
“ It ’s shocking , ” said Victor Rene , 14 .
“ I saw four dead guys last week , but that was clean .
Their heads were wrapped in tape . ”
As Tijuana ’s latest flare - up in the drug war rages into its fifth week , with the death toll approaching 150 , violence is permeating everyday life here , causing widespread fear , altering people ’s habits and exposing the city ’s youngest to carnage .
Civic leaders are calling for a 9 p.m. curfew for children .
Archbishop Rafael Romo has asked the media to refrain from showing gruesome photographs .
One priest halts his sermons every week to demonstrate proper shootout - safety behavior :
He cues a drum roll , then throws himself to the floor .
But these and other measures have n’t been able to shield children from the violence near schools , neighborhoods , busy streets and popular restaurants .
Grisly public displays of death have been the hallmark of the killings since the latest violence between rival drug cartels started Sept. 26 .
Bodies have been hung from overpasses .
Twelve corpses , some with their tongues cut out , were tossed into a vacant lot across from an elementary school .
Several men have been beheaded , and killers have left behind acid - filled barrels containing dissolved human remains .
The toll of innocent victims has also been rising .
Gunmen burst into the El Negro Durazo seafood restaurant and killed two rivals and a photographer who tried to run away .
A 24 - year - old teacher was kidnapped outside her school .
Gunmen wielding AK - 47s killed two teenagers sitting outside their home after they witnessed a drug - related killing .
A toddler died this week when his mother crashed her car trying to avoid a shootout between state police and suspected cartel hit men .
Tijuana has endured years of violence and waves of kidnappings that have led thousands of people to move across the border to San Diego suburbs .
Still , the recent violence is unprecedented in scale and brutality .
More than 460 people have died violently so far this year , a record , according to the Baja California state attorney general ’s office .
“ It makes your hair stand on end , ” said Father Raymundo Reyna , a popular radio show host who keeps a muertometro -- death meter -- tally .
Reyna is the priest who demonstrates to parishioners how to duck when gunfire breaks out .
“ We show people how to prepare for an earthquake .
Now we need to train them for a shootout , ” Reyna said .
Many people simply avoid public places .
Families have cut back on going to restaurants .
Some parents forbid their children to go to nightclubs , preferring they attend parties at the homes of people they know .
More parents pick up their children from school rather than letting them take public transportation .
After eight people were killed in neighboring Rosarito Beach on Thursday , some panicked parents kept their children home , reacting to rumors that children were going to be kidnapped .
Cops , or anybody in a law enforcement uniform , are avoided ; at least 10 security personnel have been gunned down in recent weeks in the Tijuana metropolitan area .
Ana Luisa Angulo , a mother of four , said her daughter was recently pulled over by an officer for speeding .
“ She did n’t even argue , ” Angulo said .
“ She just wanted to get the ticket and get away from him as quickly as possible . ”
For some youngsters , Tijuana ’s battlefield is a playground , another childhood experience .
Down the street from Reyna ’s Monte Maria Church in a tough hillside slum , kids play in another bullet - riddled former hide - out , where a family was killed this year .
Then there are the wakes and funerals , among the few nighttime events that parents allow their children to attend .
Around the corner from the hide - out , teenagers last week stared glumly into the open caskets of Isabel Guzman Morales , 14 , and Victor Corona Morales , 17 , cousins who were shot to death outside their home .
More than 100 people squeezed into the tiny front yard of a relative , where the caskets had been placed side by side under a tent .
Later , the teenagers climbed down staircases made of rubber tires to another wake .
Inside a teetering house made of wood scraps , the kids looked into the open casket of another friend , 19 - year - old Felipe Alejandro Prado , who was also fatally shot with the cousins after being chased down by unknown assailants .
While family members served coffee and cookies , relatives and friends tried to piece together the tragedies .
“ The killers were probably outsiders , ” said Prado ’s father , Martin Gomez Mejilla .
“ They ’re taking so many innocent lives . ”
Friends suggested that Prado was not an innocent bystander ; he was a drug dealer who fearlessly roamed the neighborhood ’s dirt streets , they said .
One 11 - year - old visitor seemed to want to emulate the dead teen .
“ When I grow up I want to be a narco , and get all the women and the money , ” he said .
Such shows of bravado from youngsters , say parents and psychologists , could mask deep - rooted trauma .
Many children ’s anxieties are increasingly manifesting themselves in eating and sleeping disorders , they say .
“ At night , some kids have nightmares , ” said David Sotelo , a psychologist , “ but what worries me more than the trauma is the social costs , the desensitization and the low value some kids have for human life . ”
Even more troubling , say some , is a growing exhaustion bordering on indifference .
Teachers have twice had to evacuate Secondary School 25 , where a razor - wire fence rings the playground .
The first time , police had opened fire at the state prison a few blocks away , killing at least 20 rioting inmates .
Two weeks later , a body was tossed in the street outside the school .
Last week ’s shootout at the safe house forced teachers and students to hit the floor again .
When the youngsters returned for afternoon classes after visiting the house , teachers had trouble getting their attention :
The students were showing off their cellphone pictures of the carnage .
A teacher asked an assistant principal to confiscate the kids ’ phones and give them to their parents , so they could lecture their children .
The assistant principal , Marcos Alvarez Guardado , just shrugged : “ I ’m sure they ’ve already posted the images on the Internet , ” he said .
“ What more can we do ? ”

Low wages in developing countries are among the many sins allegedly committed by global capitalism , but few of those making the charge really stop to think about why wages are so low in some developing countries .
In his 2007 book The Myth of the Rational Voter , economist Bryan Caplan proposes an interesting thought experiment which suggests that people implicitly accept the results of competitive markets .
Caplan asks if those who criticize companies that pay low wages overseas feel that they could get rich quick by investing all of their resources in overseas enterprises — specifically , enterprises in poor countries .
After all , it stands to reason that if workers in developing countries are underpaid and exploited , a profit - seeking businessperson would be able to reap immediate profits by hiring the workers away from their current occupations and re-employing them elsewhere .
If people pass on the opportunity , Caplan argues , then they implicitly accept the tragic - but - nonetheless - real fact that workers in very poor countries simply are not very productive .
Low wages , then , are not the product of exploitative multinational corporations but of extremely low productivity .
The relevant question for those concerned about the very poor is not " how do we convince ( or force ) multinational corporations to pay more " but " how can we improve the productivity of the world 's poorest workers ? "
This is where there is room for improvement , and this improvement should come by improving contracting institutions in poor countries .
I do n't have the specific local or cultural knowledge to know exactly how these institutions will evolve , but socially conscious investors or activists should try to encourage the development of institutions that constrain coercion and limit fraud .
Suffice it to say that the strategy of blocking overseas investment is ineffective at its best and positively harmful at its worst .
I 'm willing to grant the possibility that global labor markets are monopsonistic rather than competitive , but international capital flows suggest that this is not the case .
In a study of wages and working conditions in developing countries , economists Benjamin Powell and David Skarbek found that the textile sweatshops derided by rich westerners offer higher wages and better working conditions than the alternatives in very poor countries .
People in developing countries need more sweatshops rather than fewer .
On the domestic front , people have argued that they are for " free trade " but that environmental standards should be improved so as to ensure that workers in poor countries are not exploited and their environments pillaged .
But this eliminates poor workers ' competitive advantage , reduces the possible gains from trade , and relegates them to an underground labor market of prostitution or picking through garbage dumps .
Regulation also will not change the productivity of very poor workers .
It will only change the incentives , and this will likely produce unwanted consequences .
Environmental regulation and onerous labor laws will alter the incentives in such a way as to increase the relative profitability of evading the law , tilting the competitive balance in favor of the relatively unscrupulous .
" That might be true , " people might respond , " but ca n't multibillion - dollar multinational corporations afford to pay more ?
Is n't it unconscionable that CEOs are able to take home millions while workers in underdeveloped countries earn mere cents per hour ? "
Is it sad ?
Yes .
Is it unconscionable ?
No .
Can companies " afford to pay more ? "
Again , the answer is no .
Firms might be able to pay above - market wages in the short run , but in addition to operating in internationally competitive labor markets they also operate in internationally competitive capital markets and internationally competitive goods markets .
Firms that sacrifice profits in order to pay higher wages will reduce their ability to earn profits , attract capital , and expand in the future .
In the short run , we can improve standards of living for some people .
In the long run , this illusory prosperity comes at the cost of increasing future poverty .
The current crisis faced by American automakers provides a useful and tragic case in point .
For years , they were able to pay some workers at union pay scales with union benefits .
Over time , however , they were undercut by competitors who were unhampered by these costly restrictions and they were themselves sharply restricted in their ability to expand .
Now , apparently , there is n't anything left to loot .
$ 58 $ 39 " People in developing countries need more sweatshops rather than fewer . "
Finally , when it comes to a firm 's production decisions , wages are not all that matters .
Firms will invest in inputs — say " unskilled labor " and " skilled labor " — until the ratio of the marginal products of the factors to the prices of the factors are equal for all inputs .
If an American worker earns $ 30 per hour while a Chinese worker earns $ 1 per hour , this is not by itself sufficient to show that investing in China is in a firm 's best interests .
If the American worker can produce 120 units of output in an hour while the Chinese worker can only produce two , then producing the good in the United States is actually cheaper .
Each unit produced in the United States costs twenty - five cents , while each unit produced in China costs fifty cents .
The idea that expanding and integrating the global marketplace exploits the poor is a myth that causes avoidable misery .
Protesting and trying to slow the advance of international capitalism is not the solution .
Encouraging the development of institutions in which the world 's poor can increase their productivity is .
Abramoff said he had agreement with White House aide just a month after Bush took office Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Monday November 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Email noting relationship with White House came just a month after Bush took office Convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff told his colleagues at his former law firm that he had an agreement  regarding communications with a former assistant to then - Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove , perhaps the most substantial documented tie between Abramoff and the White House to date .
In the email , dated Feb. 27 , 2001 , Abramoff reprimands a colleague who asked him to use Susan Ralston  Special Assistant to the President George W. Bush and then - Bush senior adviser Karl Rove  to arrange a meeting with the President for one of his clients .
In response , Abramoff writes that Ralston and he have an agreement with her as to what we are going to ask her and when . 
Prior to joining the White House staff , Ralston was Abramoffs assistant at the lobbying giant Greenberg Traurig .
Prior to Greenberg , she had also worked with Abramoff at the lobbying shop Preston Gates & Ellis .
 This is not the proper way to go about this ,  Abramoff writes when a colleague suggests that he approach Ralston himself about setting up a meeting for a client and the President , through Rove .
 Susan is not going to be able to do things like this , and we have an agreement with her as to what we are going to ask her and when . 
The email was obtained by RAW STORY from an individual close to the federal investigation that has netted Abramoff , several of his staff , members of Congress and Bush Administration officials in a wide - ranging bribery probe .
Coming just a month after the Bush Administration took office , it suggests that Abramoff 's relationship with the White House began earlier and was more substantial than has previously been disclosed .
[ Click to enlarge . ]
Certain parts of the email have been redacted to protect individuals not under investigation .
The White House has previously denied any significant relationship between Bush administration officials and Abramoff .
Asked about the nature of the agreement last Tuesday , Abramoffs attorney , Abbe Lowell , declined to comment .
 I cant comment on any of this ,  Lowell said .
Ralston did not return calls seeking comment .
Ralston told Abramoff , associates to use other email accounts Ralston 's name previously surfaced in an investigation into deleted White House emails .
The emails accounts were hosted on Republican National Committee servers , which some believe were set up as a way to for the White House to avoid Congressional oversight .
In a June 2007 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , 88 White House officials were identified as having had RNC e-mail accounts .
Included among them were Ralston and Rove .
Under the Presidential Records Act , the White House is legally obliged to maintain backup records of emails .
Because the emails are sent using taxpayer resources , many of them are open to Freedom of Information Act Review .
The White House , however , has argued that in an effort to comply with laws that disallow use of government resources for political activities the Republican National Committee set up separate email accounts for numerous Bush Administration officials .
When the Democratic - controlled Congress sought emails relating to the US Attorney firings , the White House said millions of the emails had been accidentally deleted .
According to the Washington watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ,  the Executive Office of the President had lost over five million emails generated between March 2003 and October 2005 . 
Ralston had two accounts hosted on RNC servers : [ email protected ] and [ email protected ]
According to an investigation by the House Committee on Oversight , Ralston told Abramoff and two of his colleagues at Greenberg Traurig , to use her RNC accounts as well as her private AOL account .
According to a March 2007 letter sent to the White House by Rep. Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight , Ralston asked two Abramoff associates at Greenberg Traurig to use her RNC account because there are no security issues like my WH email . 
 Susan Ralston , who was Karl Rove 's executive assistant , invited two lobbyists working for Jack Abramoff to use her RNC e-mail account to avoid " security issues " with the White House e-mail system , writing : " I now have an RNC blackberry which you can use to e-mail me at any time .
No security issues like my WH email ,  the report said .
In another email exchange , this one directly with Abramoff , Ralston alerted him to do the same in the event that she could not be reached on her AOL account .
 Ms. Ralston similarly wrote Mr. Abramoff : " I know [ sic ] have an RNC laptop at the office for political use ,  the report added .
 I can access my AOL email when necessary so if you need to send me something that I need to read , you can send to my AOL email and then call or page me to check it . 
Of the emails that were preserved by the RNC , only 130 emails sent to Rove were provided to the Committee and none of them prior to 2005 , despite Rove sending email through RNC servers 95 percent of the time .
Federal authorities were already investigating Abramoff in 2005 , the point at which all emails were deleted by the RNC .
The agreement email acquired by RAW STORY is dated at 2001 , suggesting that the bulk of correspondences between Abramoff and Ralston would have taken place between 2001 - 2005 .
In 2006 , Abramoff plead guilty to several counts of bribing political officials and defrauding his American Indian tribal clients .
That same year , Ralston  who resigned from her White House post in 2005  started a lobbying firm called SBR Enterprises , LLC .
SBR Enterprises is registered in Virginia .

Edward I would see many parallels between his economic travails and ours
Hear the phrase " medieval credit crunch " and you might think of a row about peasants not being paid or a local merchants running out of gold coins .
But an unusual new research project at Reading University reveals that the medieval economy was a lot more sophisticated than we might think , with international crises to match ours today .
And one of its principal victims , the English King Edward I , would have clear views on how Gordon Brown should be handling things now .
The Reading team of Dr Adrian R Bell , Professor Chris Brooks , and Dr Tony Moore has studied trading involving monks and monarchs as well as bankers .
Complexity
As early as the thirteenth century , innovative practices had been developed to deal with unpredictable and unreliable cash flows experienced by large institutions and governments .
Interest could not be charged directly on loans , because of religious restrictions on charging interest .
Edward dealt with his Italian bankers " immediately , unilaterally and without sympathy "
So forward contracts were used in the wool market between monasteries in England and Italian merchant societies , where cash loans would be repaid in wool .
Religious communities also pioneered their own pension schemes .
At the heart of the new medieval financial industry was merchant banking , including government finance .
Edward I had an early form of current account with the Ricciardi of Lucca that incorporated an extensive overdraft facility , so he could fund the armies and castles that helped conquer Wales .
To meet Edward 's demands , the Ricciardi could raise additional funds from other merchant societies across Europe , in the same way as modern banks turn to the interbank lending markets .
Parallels " All this demonstrates " , says the Reading team , " that medieval merchants , using abaci and roman numerals , were just as capable of calculating forward prices and interest as modern financiers using mathematical models and computer spreadsheets " .
But this system could be thrown into disarray by credit crunches like one in 1294 , which " shares remarkable parallels with today 's difficulties - the main cause being a lack of liquidity in the money market " .
FIND OUT MORE ...
What can history teach us about the credit crunch ? is in the January issue of BBC History Magazine On sale 30 December , 2008 After a period of easy money in the 1280s , major financial players including the Pope called in their money , the French king levied a huge tax on the Italian merchants in France , and war broke out between England and France in 1294 .
So when Edward I called on his bankers to raise the money needed to fund his armies , the Ricciardi were caught unprepared .
Normal markets and communications seized up in the crisis conditions .
" It seems that money has disappeared " said the Ricciardi , just like a modern banker complaining that everyone has stopped lending .
When the Ricciardi could not come up with the money , Edward in effect froze all of their assets in England , and did the same to all other Italian merchant societies .
As the Reading team put it , Edward dealt with his Italian bankers " immediately , unilaterally and without sympathy " .
The Ricciardi were in effect bankrupted by the crisis of 1294 , and they were followed by a string of other leading banks .
Leniency
So if Edward I faced today 's crisis , what might he do ?
His initial advice in today 's crisis , the Reading researchers suggest , " would probably be to place senior executives under house arrest - most likely without trial , until the government could recover as much as possible from their assets and estates " .
But the King known as the " hammer of the Scots " could not afford simply to become the hammer of every banker .
He soon realised that he would need new sources of finance in the future .
Edward may indeed have regretted allowing the Ricciardi to fail .
During the war of 1294 - 7 , he was forced to turn to moneylenders who both lacked the resources of the Italians and charged much higher rates of interest .
And he did pay huge compensation to the Ricciardi 's successors as royal bankers when they complained that he had caused a run on their bank .
So whatever the frustrations during a credit crunch , Edward might have counselled that some leniency towards bankers is justified .
However tempting a political target bankers may make during a crisis , medieval as well as modern rulers know they will still need financial friends for the future .
What can history teach us about the credit crunch ?

Today I decided that I had enough time to get bugs for the 3.5 RC , so I fixed all the remaining bugs , updated the Rhino Mocks 3.5 Documentation , and put the binaries out the site .
For this release , I actually have 4 binary packages .
One for .NET 3.5 and one for .
NET 2.0 , but I have an additional criteria , with the castle assemblies merged ( default ) and with the castle assemblies included ) .
The reason for having those two options is that people who want to extend Rhino Mocks directly can do it more easily .
In general , I suggest using the merged version .
So , what do we actually have here ( feature differences from 3.4 ) ?
Features :
Assert Act Arrange syntax for mocking Including support for .NET 2.0
Added a way to access the mocked method at runtime , using WhenCalled ( similar to Do ( ) , but without the pain of having to specify a special delegate ) .
CreateMock ( ) is deprecated and marked with the [ Obsolete ] attribute .
Use StrictMock ( ) instead .
Support for mocking interface in C++ that mix native and managed types .
( Note , may require that you install kb957541 to get around bug introduced to the framework on SP1 ) .
New event raising syntax :
eventHolder .
Raise ( stub => stub .
Blah += null , this , EventArgs. Empty ) ;
eventHolder .
Raise ( stub => stub .
Blah += null , this , EventArgs . Empty ) ;
Better support for multi threaded replays .
Note that access to the mock object is now serialized .
Support AssertWasCalled on parial mocks .
Patches :
From Sebastian Jancke , adding support for SetPropertyAndIgnoreArguments ( ) and SetPropertyWithArguments ( o ) ;
From Yann Trevin , adding support for List.
Element ( " MyKey " , ... ) , so we are not limited to just integers .
From David Tchepak , adding support for ctor arguments when creating a mock using static method .
From Stefan Steinegger - much better support for creating inline constraints .
Improvements :
Better handling of exception in raising events from mock objects
Better error message when trying to set expectation on properties of a stub .
Better error handling for AAA syntax abuse
Will give better errors if you call Verify on a mock that is in record mode .
Allowing to return to record mode without losing expectations .
BackToRecord extension method .
AAA syntax now works with Ordering
Better error message if trying to use SetupResult on stubbed mock properties .
Better error message when trying to mock null instance .
Bug fixes :
No one is more surprised than Shlomo Sand that his latest academic work has spent 19 weeks on Israel ’s bestseller list  and that success has come to the history professor despite his book challenging Israel ’s biggest taboo .
Dr. Sand argues that the idea of a Jewish nation  whose need for a safe haven was originally used to justify the founding of the state of Israel  is a myth invented little more than a century ago .
An expert on European history at Tel Aviv University , Dr. Sand drew on extensive historical and archaeological research to support not only this claim but several more  all equally controversial .
In addition , he argues that the Jews were never exiled from the Holy Land , that most of today ’s Jews have no historical connection to the land called Israel and that the only political solution to the country ’s conflict with the Palestinians is to abolish the Jewish state .
The success of When and How Was the Jewish People Invented ?
looks likely to be repeated around the world .
A French edition , launched last month , is selling so fast that it has already had three print runs .
Translations are under way into a dozen languages , including Arabic and English .
But he predicted a rough ride from the pro-Israel lobby when the book is launched by his English publisher , Verso , in the United States next year .
In contrast , he said Israelis had been , if not exactly supportive , at least curious about his argument .
Tom Segev , one of the country ’s leading journalists , has called the book " fascinating and challenging . "
Surprisingly , Dr. Sand said , most of his academic colleagues in Israel have shied away from tackling his arguments .
One exception is Israel Bartal , a professor of Jewish history at Hebrew University in Jerusalem .
Writing in Haaretz , the Israeli daily newspaper , Dr. Bartal made little effort to rebut Dr. Sand ’s claims .
He dedicated much of his article instead to defending his profession , suggesting that Israeli historians were not as ignorant about the invented nature of Jewish history as Dr. Sand contends .
The idea for the book came to him many years ago , Dr. Sand said , but he waited until recently to start working on it .
" I cannot claim to be particularly courageous in publishing the book now , " he said .
" I waited until I was a full professor .
There is a price to be paid in Israeli academia for expressing views of this sort . "
Dr. Sand ’s main argument is that until little more than a century ago , Jews thought of themselves as Jews only because they shared a common religion .
At the turn of the 20th century , he said , Zionist Jews challenged this idea and started creating a national history by inventing the idea that Jews existed as a people separate from their religion .
Equally , the modern Zionist idea of Jews being obligated to return from exile to the Promised Land was entirely alien to Judaism , he added .
" Zionism changed the idea of Jerusalem .
Before , the holy places were seen as places to long for , not to be lived in .
For 2,000 years
Jews stayed away from Jerusalem not because they could not return but because their religion forbade them from returning until the messiah came . "
The biggest surprise during his research came when he started looking at the archaeological evidence from the biblical era .
" I was not raised as a Zionist , but like all other Israelis I took it for granted that the Jews were a people living in Judea and that they were exiled by the Romans in 70 AD .
" But once I started looking at the evidence , I discovered that the kingdoms of David and Solomon were legends .
" Similarly with the exile .
In fact , you ca n’t explain Jewishness without exile .
But when I started to look for history books describing the events of this exile , I could n’t find any .
Not one .
" That was because the Romans did not exile people .
In fact , Jews in Palestine were overwhelming peasants and all the evidence suggests they stayed on their lands . "
Instead , he believes an alternative theory is more plausible : the exile was a myth promoted by early Christians to recruit Jews to the new faith .
" Christians wanted later generations of Jews to believe that their ancestors had been exiled as a punishment from God . "
So if there was no exile , how is it that so many Jews ended up scattered around the globe before the modern state of Israel began encouraging them to " return " ?
Dr. Sand said that , in the centuries immediately preceding and following the Christian era , Judaism was a proselytizing religion , desperate for converts .
" This is mentioned in the Roman literature of the time . "
Jews traveled to other regions seeking converts , particularly in Yemen and among the Berber tribes of North Africa .
Centuries later , the people of the Khazar kingdom in what is today south Russia , would convert en masse to Judaism , becoming the genesis of the Ashkenazi Jews of central and eastern Europe .
Dr. Sand pointed to the strange state of denial in which most Israelis live , noting that papers offered extensive coverage recently to the discovery of the capital of the Khazar kingdom next to the Caspian Sea .
Ynet , the website of Israel ’s most popular newspaper , Yedioth Ahronoth , headlined the story : " Russian archaeologists find long - lost Jewish capital . "
And yet none of the papers , he added , had considered the significance of this find to standard accounts of Jewish history .
One further question is prompted by Dr. Sand ’s account , as he himself notes : if most Jews never left the Holy Land , what became of them ?
" It is not taught in Israeli schools but most of the early Zionist leaders , including David Ben Gurion [ Israel ’s first prime minister ] , believed that the Palestinians were the descendants of the area ’s original Jews .
They believed the Jews had later converted to Islam . "
Dr. Sand attributed his colleagues ’ reticence to engage with him to an implicit acknowledgement by many that the whole edifice of " Jewish history " taught at Israeli universities is built like a house of cards .
The problem with the teaching of history in Israel , Dr. Sand said , dates to a decision in the 1930s to separate history into two disciplines : general history and Jewish history .
Jewish history was assumed to need its own field of study because Jewish experience was considered unique .
" There ’s no Jewish department of politics or sociology at the universities .
Only history is taught in this way , and it has allowed specialists in Jewish history to live in a very insular and conservative world where they are not touched by modern developments in historical research .
" I ’ve been criticized in Israel for writing about Jewish history when European history is my specialty .
But a book like this needed a historian who is familiar with the standard concepts of historical inquiry used by academia in the rest of the world . "

The Marble Notebook
Q : " What is The Marble Notebook ? "
A : The Marble Notebook is a place where creativity breaks boundaries ; a place where rules are always broken ; a place where art , freethought , imagination , and topics with no point are ' the norm ' .
Q : " Where did the idea for The Marble Notebook come from ? "
A : The Marble Notebook is the homage to an old notebook my best friend and I had when we were young .
It contained everything from conversations we had together , things we were taught and didnt agree with , drawings , comics , stories , goals , anything we wanted to put on paper , we did .
Now , nearly a decade after the original marble notebook 's destruction , it has been resurrected as this Marble Notebook
Q : " What does it mean when a story in The Marble Notebook is ' a work in progress ' ? "
A : It means that I either have yet to finish the story , and intend to , but may not get to due to a lack of inspiration anymore .
You may find many short stories , or long stories with no ending , or that seem to just stop .
I assure you this is normal .
It 's either that I lost inspiration to write further , I ran out of time to continue that day / hour , or because I realized I had somehow ended up writting the story so far off topic that it was hardly the original story I had started with , and promptly chose to stop

Chili con carne was introduced to America by the " Chili Queens , " women who served food in San Antonio 's Military Plaza as early as the 1860s .
Chili stands were also common in Galveston and Houston ; they were the taco trucks of the 1800s .
Tamales with chili was the most common order -- beans were often added .
Laborers counted on the chili vendors for a quick meal .
Adventurous eaters loved them .
And the upper classes tried to chase them away or get them shut down .
Chili con carne is not an import from Mexico , it is uniquely Texan .
In The Tex - Mex Cookbook , I explore the contention that the unusual seasonings were influenced by immigrants from the Canary Islands , a Spanish possession off the coast of Morocco .
In the 1700s , the government of New Spain recruited Canary Islanders to move to San Antonio .
Canary Island women made a tangia - like stew with meat , cumin , garlic , chile peppers , and wild onions that they cooked outdoors in copper kettles in their settlement , La Villita .
Their peculiar , chile and cumin - heavy spice blend resembled the Berber seasoning style of Morocco .
The invention of chili powder by William Gebhardt and others around 1900 standardized the flavor of chili and made it very easy to prepare in any restaurant or home kitchen .
In early Tex - Mex restaurants chili was ladled over tamales , used as an enchilada sauce and offered in dishes like eggs with chili , macaroni with chili , and chili with beans .
By the 1920s , chili started turning up all across the Midwest - - on top of spaghetti in Ohio , on hot dogs in Michigan , and in omelets and casseroles .
The Doolan family of San Antonio whose Fritos corn chips were becoming popular , promoted a dish of chili and corn chips they called " Frito pie . "
The one - pot meal of ground beef , canned tomatoes and kidney beans that became known as chili in the much rest of the country is a perfectly legitimate version of the dish .
It just does n't lend itself very well to other uses .
Chili dogs , Frito pie , cheese enchiladas in chili sauce and tamales covered with chili are still popular in Texas restaurants today .
Which is why we still make chili the way the Chili Queens did -- without beans .
Truck Stop Chili ( from The Tex - Mex Cookbook )
Here 's a more elaborate diner - style chili made with bacon and chipotles .
It tastes great all by itself , over tamales , with a side order of beans , or as an enchilada sauce for Truck Stop Enchiladas .
Makes 9 - 10 cups
3 pounds trimmed beef brisket , cut into 1/4 - inch cubes 1 / 4 pound bacon 1 pound onions , chopped 1 1/ 2 tablespoon ground cumin 3 1/2 tablespoons chili powder 2 teaspoons paprika 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 / 2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 1 / 2 teaspoon salt 4 large garlic cloves , minced One 13.75 - ounce can beef broth One 28 - ounce can plum tomatoes in purée 2 dried chipotle peppers
In a large skillet , cook the bacon until crisp .
Remove the bacon and reserve .
Over high heat , brown the beef in the bacon drippings left in the skillet and set the meat aside .
Over medium heat , sauté the onions in the remaining drippings for 8 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned .
In a small skillet over medium heat , toast the cumin , stirring constantly for 1 minute until fragrant .
Add the toasted cumin , chili powder , paprika , oregano , black pepper , thyme , salt , and garlic to the cooked onions and sauté 1 minute .
Crumble in the bacon , add the beef broth , 1 cup of water , tomatoes , chipotle peppers , and the beef .
Bring to a boil , reduce the heat , cover partially , and simmer for 3 hours or until the meat is very tender , adding water as needed to maintain the desired consistency .
Truck Stop Enchiladas ( from The Tex - Mex Cookbook )
I had a plate of cheese enchiladas in chili con carne like these at the Texas Grill , an old - fashioned roadside diner on Highway 90A in Rosenberg .
They were topped with cheddar and sprinkled with raw onions .
Makes 24 enchiladas
24 corn tortillas for enchiladas
1/2 cup vegetable oil Truck Stop Chili 2 pounds grated Cheddar , Velveeta or a blend of the two 2 large onions , chopped
Preheat the oven to 400° F .
Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium heat .
Dip each tortilla in the oil .
Then place the tortilla in a Pyrex baking pan and put a 1 / 4 cup of cheese , a 1 / 4 cup of chili and a tablespoon of onions across the middle of the tortilla .
Roll up the tortilla , placing the seam side down in the Pyrex pan .
Continue filling and rolling the tortillas until the pan is full .
( You will need about 3 pans . )
Pour 1/2 cup chili on top of the enchiladas .
Sprinkle generously with cheese and bake in the preheated oven .
Cook until the cheese on top begins to bubble ( about 10 minutes ) .
Remove from the oven , top with remaining chopped onion and serve immediately .

The holiday called Christmas is an amalgam of many winter holidays from around the world .
The name is designated as a celebration of the birth of Jesus , although the date is not recorded in the Bible , and people at that time did not place particular important on birth dates .
Scientists say the actual date was June 17th , 2BC because of the appearance of the star that beckoned the Magi .
December 25th was set as the date for Christmas in the 4th century by Pope Julius I as an attempt to Christianize midwinter pagan holidays such as Solstice and Saturnalia .
Customs such as bringing evergreens inside , eating fat - laden foods , and hanging lights are universal responses to the cold , dark winter season .
Some of the stranger Christmas traditions are remnants of those older pagan holidays , and some have been changed over the centuries until their origins are hard to discern .
Others were just made up to boost business !
1. Krampus
St. Nicholas , Father Christmas , or Santa Claus is the weirdest Christmas tradition ever , but he is so well known and so well documented that his origins are beyond the scope of this particular post .
As a tool to encourage good behavior in children , Santa serves as the carrot , and Krampus is the stick .
Krampus is the evil demon anti-Santa , or maybe his evil twin .
Krampus Night is celebrated on December 5th , the eve of St. Nicholas Day in Austria and other parts of Europe .
People dress as Krampus and roam the streets looking for someone to beat with a stick .
Since it is also a night for drinking , the beatings probably do n't hurt much .

2. Caga TiÃ³
In English , Caga TiÃ³ is " the pooping log " .
Really .
The Catalan custom is still celebrated in Spain , where you can buy your own el Caga TiÃ³ .
The log is hollowed out , with legs and a face added .
You must " feed " him every day beginning on December 8th .
On Christmas Eve or Christmas Day , put him in the fireplace and beat him with sticks until he poops out small candies , fruits , and nuts .
When he is through , the final object dropped is a salt herring , a garlic bulb , or an onion .
Oh yeah , there is a traditional song the family can sing to encourage the process .
poop log ,
poop turrÃ³n ,
hazelnuts and cottage cheese ,
if you do n't poop well ,
I 'll hit you with a stick ,
poop log !
3. Caganer
Another Catalonian tradition is the Caganer , a Christmas statue found in nativity scenes in Andorra and parts of Spain , Italy , and Portugal .
The scenes depict the entire town of Bethlehem , and the Caganer is usually tucked away in a corner , far from Mary and Joseph .
The Caganer needs privacy , because he is defecating .
There are quite a few explanations for this custom , but none have been confirmed as the original source .
Caganers have been used for at least a couple hundred years .
You can even buy Caganers that resemble modern - day celebrities .

4. The Pickle Ornament
The story goes that when German families decorate the Christmas tree , the last ornament to be hung is the Christmas pickle - usually a blown glass ornament that may have been passed down through generations .
It is tucked away in a hard - to - see spot ( it is green , after all ) .
The first child who finds the pickle on Christmas morning gets a special gift and good luck all the next year .
The trouble with this legend is that people in Germany were unfamiliar with it .
Glass tree ornaments were indeed made in Germany , in the shape of fruits and vegetables and other objects .
These ornaments became very popular in America when F.W. Woolworth began importing them in the 1880s .
An old German legend no doubt helped to sell more glass ornaments !

5. Kentucky Fried Chicken
The celebration of Christmas in Asia usually involves imported western traditions , but in Japan those traditions have been shaped by commercial interests .
The holiday places special emphasis on romantic love , so it 's a day to spend with a sweetheart or spouse .
Bakeries sell Christmas cakes as traditional sweetheart treats .
And you might have to make reservations to get a table at KFC .
Yes , Kentucky Fried Chicken .
The fast food franchise let it be known that fried chicken is traditional for the Christmas feast .
And so it is - in Japan .

6. Zwarte Piet
Zwarte Piet , or Black Peter is Santa 's helper in the Netherlands .
Sinterklass arrives on the eve of St. Nicholas Day in a steamship with his slave Zwarte Piet , portrayed in public processions in several cities .
Since about 1850 , children who do n't behave during the year were told that Black Peter might take them back to Spain , where Sinterklaas lives .
The racist aspects of the custom have been downplayed in recent decades , and the tale of Black Peter now describes him as a chimney sweep instead of a slave , which explains the blackface .
But charges of racism still follow Black Peter , as he is often portrayed with an Afro and exaggerated features .
7. TV Yule Log
The Yule Log is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years .
The Yule Log on TV is a relatively new tradition for those who have no fireplace to burn their own log .
WPIX in New York has broadcast 24 hours of a burning fireplace on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day since 1966 .
The original film was shot at Gracie Mansion , but a carpet fire during the first filming made the mayor wary of a reshoot a few years later , so the loop seen now was filmed in California .
8. Mari Lwyd
Mari Lwyd , an old midwinter custom in Wales , is a holdover from pagan celebrations before Christmas was introduced .
Mari Lwyd means " gray mare " in English .
In its purest form ( still to be seen at Llangynwyd , near Maesteg , every New Year 's Day ) the tradition involves the arrival of the horse and its party at the door of the house or pub , where they sing several introductory verses .
Then comes a battle of wits ( known as pwnco ) in which the people inside the door and the Mari party outside exchange challenges and insults in rhyme .
At the end of the battle , which can be as long as the creativity of the two parties holds out , the Mari party enters with another song .
The horse in the above scenario is made of a horse 's skull attached to a pole .
The person operating the horse is concealed by sheets , and sometimes has a contraption to work the horses jaw !

In his victory speech on Tuesday night , Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January .
It 's a good thing Obama said " Yes , we can "  to the girls ' request ; for all of his charm , ability , and oratorical flair , he could never be our nation 's chief executive without a White House pet .
Counting Obama , the country has had 44 Presidents , and only two of them — Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce — left no record of having pets .
Like Obama himself , the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill .
Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high .
Here are a few of our favorites :
1. Billy : Calvin Coolidge's Pygmy Hippopotamus
Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence , but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets .
After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding , Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos ' collections .
He had six dogs , a bobcat , a goose , a donkey , a cat , two lion cubs , an antelope , and a wallaby .
The main attraction in his personal zoo , though , was Billy , a pygmy hippopotamus .
Billy was born in Liberia , but was captured at a young age .
He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone , who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift , possibly because Firestone did n't want to feed the critter .
( Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund ; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds . )
Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park .
Since there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time , Billy quickly went to work as a stud , an endeavor at which he found some success .
He sired 23 little hippos , and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring .
2. The White House Gators
Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot , a car in every garage , and " ¦a gator in the Oval Office ?
It 's true .
Hoover owned a slew of dogs , but those were n't his only pets .
His second son , Allan Henry Hoover , owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds .
Sound crazy ?
Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent .
The sixth president also had a pet gator .
His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette ; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House .
According to some reports , he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests .
3. Fala : FDR 's Traveling Companion
What do you get the Depression - conquering president who has everything ?
A lapdog .
In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend .
FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill , after a Scottish ancestor .
For the sake of simplicity , though , he called his new pal Fala .
After that , Fala became FDR 's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went .
The dog " gave "  $ 1 a day to the war effort , generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army .
Each morning when FDR 's breakfast tray came in , it included a bone for Fala .
Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master 's speeches .
When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents , he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him , but leave Fala alone .
" You know , Fala is Scotch , and being a Scottie , as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him — at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three , or eight or 20 million dollars — his Scotch soul was furious .
He has not been the same dog since ! " 
Fala stayed with FDR until the President 's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952 .
4. Millie : Literary Sensation
When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989 , he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House .
The bubbly canine won over the nation 's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie 's Book : As Dictated to Barbara Bush .
Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989 .
Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House , so did Millie : when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office , so did his dog , Millie 's son Spot Fetcher .
5. Barney , Miss Beazley & India : The Current Residents
Sadly , Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004 , but the Bushes are n't pet - deprived now .
They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley , both of whom have websites and appear in White House - produced web videos .
( Your tax dollars adorably at work ! )
The Bushes also have a black cat named India , who also goes by " Willie . " 
The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs " Bush . " 
The name was n't meant to be controversial , though ; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben " El Indio " 
Sierra , who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team .
Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher .
Other First Pets of Note :
Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection " “ Benjamin Harrison 's two opossums .
Harrison 's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers .
Pauline " “ The last cow to live at the White House .
She made milk for President Taft 's consumption .
Old Ike " “ To save cash during World War I , Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House 's groundskeeping duties .
Old Ike , a ram , supposedly chewed tobacco .
Laddie Boy " “ Warren G. Harding 's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 " interview "  with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs .
Liberty ( pictured ) " “ Gerald Ford 's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests — a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President 's conversations .
Socks and Buddy " “ President Clinton 's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office .
Socks did n't like Buddy 's youthful friendliness , so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times .
The tensions were so bad that the family could n't keep both pets at the end of Bill 's second term , so Socks went to live with Clinton 's secretary , Betty Currie .
Gamecocks " “ Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House .
Two tiger cubs " “ Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman .
Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo .
Satan " “ One of Abigail Adams ' unfortunately named dogs .
She called the other one Juno .
Jonathan Edwards " “ Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name , he wrote to a friend , " partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear 's character . " 
Dr. Johnson , Bishop Doane , Fighting Bob Evans , and Father O'Grady " “ Teddy Roosevelt 's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs .
Josiah " “ Roosevelt also had a pet badger , of course .
Bonus Trivia : Checkers
Nixon 's dog was immortalized in the " Checkers speech , "  which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions .
He said the only gift he 'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters .
Checkers , however , was never the White House dog .
This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower 's running mate in the 1952 election , and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket .
Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House , Checkers never got to be First Dog ; he passed away in 1964 .

The latest studies amazingly show that lard is n’t harmful , as it was thought , but healthy !
The lard contains the arachidonic acid that relates to polyunsaturated fatty acids ( Omega - 6 ) .
Omega - 6 is part of heart , brain and kidney tissues and essential for their proper functioning .
The lard has anticancer effect as the most of carcinogens dissolve in fatty acids .
As the arachidonic acid can improve metabolism and dissolve cholesterol , the lard helps remove toxins form our body and lowers blood cholesterol level .
To achieve named health benefits , it is best to eat lard with garlic .
Both garlic and lard are a good source of selenium , and selenium is what we need to strengthen the immune system .
The lard also contains saturated acids that are vital to our health .
Lard Health Benefits
The lard is effective for the treatment of lung diseases .
Bile - expelling properties of the lard make it a good remedy for liver disorders .
The lard also prevents atherosclerosis .
.
The lard does not accumulate radionuclides and parasitic worms can’t live in it .
Even small amount of lard is very nourishing .
So it can help you eat less and keep a slim figure .
You can even find some lard - based diets out there .
How Ukrainians Eat Lard
The lard is a national Ukrainian food .
Ukrainians eat the lard regularly , but they are not less healthy than people in other countries and they also do n’t have nationwide obesity problem .
As with other food , only rational consumption of lard is healthy .
100 g lard supplies : 640 kcal , 6 % proteins , 67 % fat .
The lard contains vitamins A , E , the B vitamins , PP and selenium .
Note : Guideline amount of lard is about 100 g weekly .

MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
One of Osama bin Laden 's sons has been denied asylum in Spain , an Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN on Wednesday .
Omar bin Laden pictured earlier this year during a television interview in Rome , Italy .
Omar bin Laden , who is in his late 20s , stepped off a plane at Madrid 's Barajas International Airport during a stopover late Monday and informed authorities that he planned to request political asylum , the spokeswoman said .
Bin Laden has publicly called on his father to abandon terrorism .
He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator , filing it around 1 p.m. , the spokeswoman said .
The Interior Ministry , which had 72 hours to reply to the request , was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter .
The UNHCR recommended against granting asylum , the spokeswoman said Wednesday .
No reason was given for the denial .
It was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request , and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed .
His flight Monday originated in Cairo , Egypt , and landed in Madrid on its way to Casablanca , Morocco , she said .
The request caught Spanish authorities by surprise , she said .
Bin Laden , who is married to a British citizen , previously was denied asylum in Britain .
He holds a Saudi passport .
Since Spain has denied his request , bin Laden has 24 hours to appeal before he is put on a plane back to Cairo , the spokeswoman said .
If he appeals , the Spanish government has 48 hours to rule on it .
Last year , 7,664 people requested asylum in Spain .
The government granted that status to only 570 , the spokeswoman said .
Al Goodman , CNN's Madrid bureau chief , contributed to this report
All About Osama bin Laden
Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's plan to make every cab in the Big Apple a hybrid or clean diesel by 2012 has hit a big pothole with a judge 's ruling that only the feds can set fuel efficiency rules .
U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty granted a temporary injunction halting the plan after ruling the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade had " demonstrated a likelihood of success " in having it tossed out .
The ruling could have implications beyond New York because Bloomberg 's proposal was considered a model for other cities .
Crotty said fuel efficiency standards are exclusively a federal matter , mirroring the view of the Environmental Protection Agency director who made the same argument last year when he rejected California 's petition to limit vehicle emissions .
Bloomberg has n't said whether he 'll appeal the decision , but he is n't backing down in his campaign to clean up the city 's cabs .
“ Greening the taxi fleet is a major priority and we are going to use every mechanism at our disposal to make New York a cleaner , healthier city , ” he said in a statement .
The mayor 's plan to require every new taxi to get 30 mpg - a target met only by hybrids and clean diesels - is an example of the pragmatic , if limited and imperfect , action that 's needed if we 're as worried about climate change and energy independence as we pretend to be when we see Al Gore or T. Boone Pickens on TV .
The taxi industry is n’t limiting its fight to the courts .
The Taxicab Board , an association representing about 25 percent of the city 's cabs , has launched a PR offensive on the “ hazards ” of hybrids taxis .
The statement it issued last month — “ Hybrid Escape Taxis Getting
Totaled , Rolling Over , Causing Injury and Damage on New York City
Streets ” — shows how far it will sink to avoid the admittedly significant costs of retooling entire fleets .
Granted , the venerable Crown Victoria has a five - star safety rating , but the three - stars the National Highway
Safety Administration gave the Ford Escape Hybrid hardly makes it a deathtrap .
Despite the Taxicab Board 's best ( worst ? ) efforts , Bloomberg has had some success using incentives , including new taxi medallions reserved exclusively for hybrids , to green the fleet .
Some 1,500 of New York City ’s 13,237 taxicabs are hybrids .
The gas - electric vehicles are catching on in other cities , including San Francisco , where Ford says some Escape Hybrid cabs have racked up 100,000 miles , and Boston , where cab drivers are wicked mad about the city 's plan to convert the entire fleet by 2015 .
But the decision Crotty issued last week is a stark reminder of the bureaucratic and regulatory barriers that must be cleared before we begin to put a serious dent in carbon emissions .

Israeli general : Forces ready for Iran attack RAW STORY
Published : Saturday December 6 , 2008
Print This Email This A Saturday afternoon report said that Israeli Air Force Commanding General Ido Nehushtan has declared the country 's forces ' prepared ' at a moment 's notice to ' halt '
Iran 's efforts to enrich uranium .
The claim , which was carried by Persian news network Press TV , was buried in paragraph eight .
The network instead led with Israeli Prime Minister Olmert 's recent demand that US President - elect Barack Obama " face up to Iran " and force the country 's nuclear activities to a close .
The mention appeared to be a reference to a quote published in German newspaper Der Speigel , in which the general said , " We are ready to do whatever is demanded of us " to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon .
" A strike against Iran 's nuclear facilities 'is a political decision , ' the Jerusalem Post reported .
" ' But if I understand it correctly , all options are on the table , ' " the general said .
" ' The Air Force is a very robust and flexible force .
We are ready to do whatever is demanded of us . ' "
A recent report ( PDF link ) by the International Atomic Energy Agency declared , " Since March 2007 , twenty unannounced inspections have been conducted at FEP ...
The Agency has been able to continue to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran . "
The Agency claimed there to be " no indication " that Iran is reprocessing materials for a nuclear weapon .
The news received little mention in the mainstream United States press , but was widely discussed in Arabic media .
" Tehran has been accused of launching a ' green salt project , high explosives testing , and the missile re-entry vehicle project , " reported Press TV .
" Iranian officials say the allegations are based on ' fabricated data ' and have requested the UN nuclear watchdog to provide Tehran with the original documents .
" The International Atomic Energy Agency , however , says it is in no ' position ' to do so due to US reluctance to provide the agency with the original copies of the documents . "

Optimizing GCC
By Justin Piszcz
I have a Pentium 3 866MHZ CPU .
After reading the freshmeat article on optimizing GCC a few days ago , it got me thinking .
So I posed the following question :
How much faster would gcc compile the kernel if gcc itself was optimized ?
I chose to benchmark kernel compilation times , because I think it is a good benchmark , and many other people also use it to benchmark system performance .
Also , at one point or another , most Linux users will have to take the step and compile the kernel , so I thought I 'd benchmark something that is useful and something that people have a general idea of how long it takes to compile without optimizations .
So my test is comprised of the following :
Run 10 kernel compilations and calculate the average time .
Regular GCC build .
Optimized GCC build .
The kernel in question is the latest stable Linux kernel .
At this time , 2.4.20 remains the latest stable Linux kernel .
The GCC used with this test is the latest stable gcc .
At this time , 3.2.2 remains the lastest stable gcc .
With an non-optimized compiler , ( configure ; make ; make install )
Average of 10 ' make bzImage ' :
TIME : 12.42 minutes ( 762 seconds )
With an optimized compiler , I specifically used :
- O3 - pipe - fomit - frame - pointer - funroll - loops - march=pentium3 -mcpu=pentium3 - mfpmath=sse -mmmx -msse
. / configure ; make BOOT_CFLAGS=" optimization flags " bootstrap ; make install
I compile almost everything I run on my Linux box .
I use a package manager called relink to manage all of my installed packages .
Optimizing the compiler alone : offers a speed increase of : 33 % ( or 3:11 minutes , 191 seconds faster ) .
This may not seem like a lot , but for compiling big programs , it will significantly reduce compile time making those QT & Mozilla builds that much faster :)

Number 655321 Dec 8 , 2005
This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition .
Plans were made on the visiting yard over the next few weeks .
I 'd show them , oh yes I would .
After paying several of my inmate friends large amounts of money to assist and maintain secrecy , one day a ball went behind a backboard , my papers and important items were shoved under some bushes , and so was I .
I leapt into the trunk of my Girl 's waiting car , closed it above me , and she drove .
And drove , and drove .
We could n't go back to her place , really , so I got on a bus and high - tailed it to my brother 's house in another state , where I stayed until she could tidy things up and move inconspicuously to a town out west .
My brother describes it as the most surreal moment in his life .
He 's at home , minding his business when he gets a call .
" Hey , its me . " " HEY !
you 're out of prison ?
Where are you ? "
" Oh , downtown XXXXX , I need you to come pick me up " , " When did they let you out ? "
" Oh , they didnt let me out . "
" Then how ... OH MY GOD , I'LL BE RIGHT THERE " .
My brother was a saint taking care of me for the next few weeks while we awaited my girl 's arrival .
When she showed up she stayed for a couple days and we relaxed , put our minds together , and got on the next Greyhound out west .
When we arrived at our desination we immediately set about getting poo poo together .
We both got jobs -
She at a camera store , and I used my previous retail management experience to land a full time job as a manager in training for a chain music store .
I got a second job as well , at a resale shop , sort of an upscale salvation army - Rich people would donate their clothes , computers , toys , etc , and we 'd resell them to generate funds for a battered womens ' shelter .
This resale place was right around the corner from that place 's county jail .
So we were dealing with lawyers , deputies , jail employees , judges coming in and browsing during their lunch breaks .
I could n't help but bask in the surrealness of looking people who would be my future captors in the eye knowing I was an escaped convict .
I made pretty good friends with some , even went out to coffee on the corner with some deputies and shot the poo poo .
This all went on for months , both of us working our lil ' tails off , me doing 70 + hours a week .
I didnt know how it would end but I knew it couldnt go on forever .
My intent was n't to evade capture forever .
My intent was to PROVE to them what I was capable of .
And yeah , life was pretty good - A decent roof over our heads , thanks to some caring souls , money in our pockets , regular sex , decent food , etc .
One morning we were walking from our place to catch the bus for work , standing there just talking about mundane life - things , when out of all directions comes a poo poo-load of city cops , about five federal agents , and a god damned tv news crew , guns and cameras pointed , shouting different things all at the same time .
Jesus christ they had GUNS pointed at my girl .
The only thing I could think to do was drop all my stuff , show my hands and step in front of her , in case one was trigger happy .
She did n't deserve to get shot for being a supportive , caring girlfriend .
So they dropped me and cuffed me .
One of the cops knew me from the resale store .
" I would have never guessed in a million years " , he said - he was good enough to fish my keys out of my pocket and give them to my girl .
She , poor thing , in tears , went at my instruction to my store , called my manager , and , bless her heart , OPENED the store with my manager on the phone , until she could get there .
This is the real weepy and like tragic part of the story beginning .
O my brothers and only friends .
Well sort of , anyway .
So into the county jail of THAT state I went to .
But I was n't without allies !
I was placed into the " pod " with high - profile offenders .
If you 'd been on the news or had a high - profile case in any way , you went into this pod .
So here we had a seventeen year old parental muderer , a multimillion dollar embezzler , a couple other hackers , etc .
Interesting to say the least .
My cell had a great view of the corner , some many stories below , as well as the river .
My girl would come and stand on the corner , and tie large flowers to the lamp post every day .
and wave .
She could see my cell by counting windows up and over .
She could only see me backlit and we would do puppet shows for an hour or so at each other .
Pantomiming drawing hearts in the air .
She 'd come visit me , through the glass again , sadly - but if I was REALLY good , I 'd get a panty shot or two to keep my mind occupied during the week .
Having lost more than half of our income , she had to move to a hostel , but her work was kind enough , after hearing our story to allow me two collect calls during the week , on them .
Meanwhile , turns out my case manager was one of my regular customers and borderline friends from the resale shop !
I fought extradition , she even wrote letters to the governor of BOTH states ( the one I was in and the one I 'd escaped from ) , asking them not to extradite me , as I was a fully rehabilitated upright citizen , and no further incarceration was necessary .
All this support from my " host " state really lit a fire under the governor of my escaped state and they accellerated my extradition hearing - which I of course , lost .
So I was extradited back to the state from who 's loving arms I 'd escaped from .
Since my neither the original crime nor my new charge ( Escape from a State Correctional Facility ) were not Federal , I did n't get to go Con Air .
They stuck me in a van which drove all around the country .
But i did n't go directly to my Home state .
it took TWELVE days of driving through states all over the place to get me back .
TWELVE DAYS in a van with full shackles on .
Handcuffs with the immobilizer , Leg irons , and a chain that connected the two .
The county wherein the facility was located that I escaped from was a verrrrry small county .
Wich meant they had a verrrry small jail .
Pretty much a mom and pop operation .
I had to stay in jail to face the new charges and could n't go back to a yard until that matter had been settled .
Funnily enough I earned myself the position of " trustee " , having experience in legal matters , I was a needed resource - So eventually I got to be outside of my cell , helping other inmates with their things , and doing other chores , like laundry , etc .
Again , like I said , this was a tiny little jail - so I knew everyone from the sheriff on down to the dispatchers in no time .
Before long I had free reign of the place , and hardly ever had to go back to my cell , only to sleep .
I was also still rather handy with computers , and through doing some big favors with their system , I slowly earned priveledges .
Within a couple of months my cellmate and I had in our cell WITH PERMISSION from the jail staff : Carpet .
Pictures .
A laptop computer .
A large color television .
Real blankets .
Tools . tapes and CD's , handheld video games .
A microwave and our own food .
Weekly trips to the local market to buy said food .
You name it -
And we could call anywhere we wanted provided we had a calling card , and we could wear street clothes , provided our shirts were stencled with " XXX County Jail Inmate " on the back , which we did ourselves .
So my Girl and I decided to stick this out - and we also decided to get married and make it official .
So we registered with the county clerk in the same building , got our blood tests , and got hitched , in the recieving area of the jail with the Jailer and a Deputy as our witnesses ( She ( The jailer ) was in tears as we said our vows ) .
Of course , what good is a wedding w/ out consummation , right ?
Remember I had free movement until 2300 .
So one night when I was supposed to be cleaning out the courthouse side of the building I snuck my Wife in through a side - door , and we scurried up some stairs , into the court records office and into a closet .
So , yeah .
We honeymooned in a courthouse closet .
This was to become a regular occourance while waiting for my trial to come up .
it was funny making appearances for motions in court , standing near a closet I 'd hosed in the night before .
Never hosed on the judges bench though - I wanted to , but they lock that specific part with another key .
By the time it came for my sentencing hearing on my escape - which carried typically five to seven years ADDITIONALLY , I had a two page letter from the Jailer on sherrif 's department stationery , stating how they 'd never seen an inmate so determined to get his life on track , etc etc , and to please go lightly , and it was signed by about fifteen members of the jail staff .
The judge was amazed that I was working while escaped , and asked me why I did what I did , and I told him , to show that I could be a productive member of society .
So he said " I 've never said this before , but I wish I could get away with dropping this .
But I can't , so I 'm going to fine you court costs and give you two years ' concurrent to your remaining three on your original sentence " .
What this meant is that it would run along with my remaining sentence .
Essentially he sentenced me to NOTHING , except a fine .
So back through the assesment part again , head shaved again .
Poked , prodded again .
This time I was assessed at Maximum Security .
Not only that but I was going to a particularly notorious yard .
Rumored to be the " hardest " yard in this entire section of the country .
There were pretty regular killings , and a riot some ten years before burned down over a third of the prison .
Hostages were taken .
Inmates were killed .
I almost peed myself when they told me what yard I was going to .
I was going to get assraped and murdered .
I was sure of it .
I later learned that the Governors office had an indirect hand in this .
So off I went to Maximum security .
When you arrive at the facility you get off a bus , and go through the main reception office where your identity is confirmed , your property box is taken , you 're unshackled and officially booked into the facility .
Then you do " the walk " .
" The walk " is when your group , usually about 20 or thirty skinners are walked through the middle of the yard toward the orientation dorm .
All the inmates line up on either side of the sidewalk on the way and stare you down , to put the fear of god into you .
One inmate with a missing loving ear asked me , as we were walking " HEY !
You play baseball ? "
" OH MY GOD NO , I DON'T PITCH OR CATCH OKAY gently caress YOU " .
Razorwire .
Oh god was there ever fences , coils of shiny razorwire , on top , then a loving PILE of razorwire on the ground , then an outer fence with razorwire and barbed wire on top of all that .
Gun towers .
Yep. 40 foot high towers with men with guns pointed at you in them .
Rapists .
Killers .
Murderers .
people serving life sentences without parole .
People who were seventy years old who had been in since they were fifteen .
This was the Real loving Deal , Bubba .
I took about a week to settle in in the orientation dorm .
It was built in the early twentieth century , and looked like it .
It used to house Germans during world war two while they were " relocated " during the war .
( Up to that point I thought they 'd only done that with the Japanese ) .
There were places you could still see German words scratched into the walls back behind the Charlie 's office .
After a week in the kitchen I was assigned to the Law Library once I proved my worth to the Boss .
From there I started working some cases .
The trick to being a skinny whiteboy in the pokey and not being raped is this : Become a law clerk .
Then , get the cases of someone in the Black faction and someone in the white faction .
Therefore , nothing will happen to you during this time .
This way they wo n't surprise sex you because you 're working on one of their cases and if you catch out , nobody will .
This gives you time to prove yourself on the yard , but do it without rectal penetration .
Use this " grace " period to buddy up with someone of your own race .
( You have to - this is n't a racist statement - its the way things work behind the wire ) .
Preferrably someone who weilds power on the yard .
In this case , my saviour was Lefty .
Remember that guy who asked if I played baseball ?
Turns out he was sincerely curious if I played baseball , the game .
They were building teams since spring was upon us .
His name was Lefty .
" ' cause I only have one ear left , " said he .
Well I didnt play baseball , but gently caress was lefty ever smart .
And he saw pretty much instantly that I was no dumbass myself .
We 'd talk philosophy , music , etc .
His story was simple , and later I 'd confirm it was absolutely true .
He was seventeen , and somebody sold his sister some bad poo poo .
It killed her .
He killed the person that sold her the poo poo .
He was sentenced to death .
In the '70s the death penalty was overturned for a brief while , so his sentence was commuted to life w/ out parole .
Later they reinstated the death penalty , but the law prevents anyone from being put back " on " a death sentence .
So here he was , forty - something , I guess .
And one of the kindest , smartest , wizest people I 've ever met .
If there 's anyone that deserves to be out in the free world it is that man .
He took me under his wing , and introduced me to the guys .
A mix of Aryan brotherhood and lifers .
These were the people that ran the yard .
And they all liked / respected me .
I was safe .
Everywhere I went one of them always had an eye on me .
If I was out walking the track , one of them on the hill playing dominoes was watching .
As long as I was here , nothing bad would happen to me .
Let it be said here , though .
Prison is prison .
You have to handle your poo poo .
So when a black guy tried cutting in the lunchline , you have to speak up or be shamed .
So we were set to fight .
The way prison fights work is like this : everyone gathers out in the domino hut ( a little covered place with benches , outside by the band room ) .
Blacks behind their guy , whites behind theirs .
What this is for is to ensure a fair fight .
the rule is , when a man goes down , the fights over .
No weapons , no bullshit .
The " groups " of people are there to ensure that .
If the fight gets dirty , your guys jump in .
This is often how people get killed .
You 're not armed , but the men behind you sure as gently caress are .
Well I lost .
I was the man that went down .
Busted a tooth and my lip .
" You know what though , " said lefty - " You fought , you took your hits , and you went down .
This is over - thats all there is to it .
Had you run away or hid or tried to get one of us to settle your poo poo for you , it'd have been a different story and you 'd be on your own . "
This is one of the many lessons I took with me .
You may lose , but standing your ground and stepping up for yourself is what matters .
A year passes .
In this time I get really situated in the Law Library , gaining my certification , litigating like a motherfucker .
I win cases , get inmates out of prison who had been fighting for years , I even have a few cases that are now caselaw in p2d , with regard to Double Jeopardy as it relates to administrative punishment .
My wife visits every weekend , I join the band - actually join several , as there 's a shortage of drummers on the yard .
I'm in the rock band , the blues band and the OTHER Rock band .
I eventually take over band room maintenance , too .
Larry was the singer and guitar player for the blues band .
He had been in for most of his life - he was almost 70 .
But that motherfucker could sing like no other .
I 'd have been proud to take that band out and play " real " shows , we were that good , particularly him .
Lefty was in the rock band .
He was a great guitarist and had an outstanding work ethic .
Nate was someones punk , but still a good bass player .
I 've got money coming in from law clerkin ' , my lockers are all chock full of goodies , I 'm getting letters from inmates on other yards for help with their cases via my reputation .
( the letters are removed and destroyed , as inter- facility communications are forbidden ) , and I 've " settled " into accepting this is my fate for a couple years .
My cellmates range from good to horrible .
Jason was in for murder , he was stinky and messy .
Ron was the leader of the AB , he was in a wheelchair from being stabbed to much .
Chris was the Second in command of the AB , he ran dope , but he was my favorite cellmate , he had good porn , and was also pretty bright .
Inevitably one of you will ask for some gross stuff I saw .
Heres the story of a young kid named Jake .
He came in from another yard , but really didnt have a clue .
He fell in with the AB guys , and was really desperate to fit in .
So he went and paid a TON of money to get AB tattoos on his arms and legs and back so he could be accepted with them .
He was the kind of guy like on the forums " HAY GUYZ ! " type .
Nobody liked him , and he was too much of a pussy to gently caress with the big boys .
Word gets around the yard about what he 's done .
One thing you DON'T do is get a set 's tattoos without someones approval .
So when it gets to Ron that he 's gone and gotten AB ink , he is confronted in the cell ( I 'm on my bunk trying to read ) and told that he has one week to get them covered up or its going to be done FOR him .
Well unfortunately he 'd spent all of his money on getting the tattoos in the first place .
He was broke , and in debt .
A week passes .
Two .
Three , and still he has his tattoos .
One day I 'm sleeping in my cell and hear a scuffle and the door slams shut .
I open my eyes and see three AB 's pushing the kid onto the bed .
I really cant get off my bunk because the cell is very small and full of people and I do NOT feel that it would be a good idea to try to say " excuse me " through a pile of enraged racists .
The next twenty minutes I spend under my covers , listening to the muffled shreiks of this kid , as he is , literally , skinned alive .
Guitar strings are superheated , and dragged over his skin , burning off the tattoos , like some kind of heated cheesegrater .
Finally they all leave , and the kid is discreetely dragged to his cell , and told to keep quiet .
He ends up cellbound for a week with " the flu " while he peels and grows new skin .
The people I saw killed or stabbed were killed for being dumbshits .
Not much to say there .
Then one day I saw a kitten .
I was walking from work to my cell .
I saw him in a little drainpipe .
Scrawny .
A runt .
THe mother abandoned it because it was n't going to live .
I picked it up , put it in my jacket and it mewed , I could n't just leave it .
At this time Jason was my cellie .
It is a violation to have pets in your cell , but what the gently caress were we going to do ?
I called my gangster racist murderer friends over and we made a plan .
Cell inspections happen twice a week .
Different days for each unit .
Lefty would take the kitten on inspection days since he was in another unit and they did n't inspect on the same day .
It was sickly .
It was mostly blind .
It had poor muscle control .
It could barely hold its head up , and whenever it tried to jump up on something , it would miss , usually hitting a wall .
But every day , someone who worked in the kitchen would come by with bits of stolen food .
And guys would bring milk from their breakfast every day for the kitten .
And every day , guys would pop in to see how he was doing .
One day we had a random cell inspection , and we tossed the kitty in the locker when we saw the Unit Manager coming our way .
But it was NOT sleepy time for kitten , because he was getting better !
Healthy kittens love to play and talk !
So while the unit manager was in our cell inspecting our beds , cleanliness , flushing our toilet , etc , the kitty wanted to come out and play .
I never thought it would work and it probably didnt , the unit manager probably knew , but every time the kitty would go " merewlll " WE would cough or shuffle our feet or say " HAY WHATS UP UNIT MANAGER ? " " DID YOU SEE THE NEWS ABOUT THE WEATHER !!!!? "
Yeah .
close call .
Since I was a short - timer , I decided I did n't want the heat for the kitty .
But I could n't let him go either .
He may be a little better but he was still half blind and retarded .
I did the only thing I knew to do .
I went to my boss at the Law Library .
" Ron , " I said ... " I 've got a problem ... "
" oh no 655321 !
Is someone threatening you ? "
" no "
" Are you in trouble ? "
" not yet "
" WHAT , FOR GODS SAKE IS THE PROBLEM , 655321 ? "
" I have a kitten , boss . "
" You ... have a .... kitten ?
As in a cat ? "
" yessir .
It was sick .
I found it by the admin building .
I brought it to my cell and it wa .... "
" You know that if a Law Clerk gets even a MINOR misconduct they 're fired , right ? "
" Yessir .
And I had a close call , today , sir - That is why I need your help "
" How the hell can I help you with a kitten 655321 ? "
" Well if I could just somehow get it to my wife , sir ....
She could take care of it "
Thus began operation Smuggle a Kitten out of Maximum Security Prison .
So Ron ( not the cellmate , My boss ) , sent me with a box to my cell , under the pretense of getting some papers that I 'd been working on .
One of the new guards stopped me with my box , on my way to the unit .
Because an inmate should NOT be carrying a box .
If it were a guard that had been there for a while it would n't be a problem , most of them liked me and let me get away with poo poo .
Like me and bezo 's spider fights .
Some would even bet with us .
Anyway this new guard stopped me with my box and asked me where I was going , and I said " to my cell to get my papers - I'm a Law Clerk " .
" I dont care if youre the goddamn pope you should n't have a box " .
I said " call Ron at the Law Library , he can verify " .
So he does , and ron confirms I should , indeed have a box .
But he doesnt let me go until he is satisfied that I dont have contraband in my box , by looking inside .
" poo poo , " i thought , this fucker better be gone when I 'm on my way back up .
So I make it to my cell , and put the pussy in the box .
I get back up the hill without incident and surrender the pussy laden container to Ron .
Ron then puts his career and everything on the line and meets with the wife of an inmate , off prison grounds , some days later , to deliver the kitty .
It was really loving great , to hear that the kitten had made it home .
A part of all of us , that we had nurtured and helped thrive and petted and played with was on the outside , a free " creature " .
It meant so much to all of us .
Especially me .
Every time I would call my wife , or see her , people would pass and ask " hey , hows the kitty doing ? "
Word on kitty 's progress would spread like wildfire with every update .
Every new eccentricity the kitty developed ( It would hypnotize itself watching the ceiling fan and get so dizzy it would fall over ) , would come back to me from total strangers .
" Hey I heard about dizzykitty ! " , or when he decveloped some kind of lump on his neck and had to have a shunt attatched and my wife had to drain the kitty daily ...
" How 's ol ' spigotkitty ? " .
He got bigger , and dumber .
More and more stories passed , even the guards were hip to it by now , so some of the " cooler " guards would ask about it , too ...
Guards and inmates ....
You know , one said to me once " the only difference between you and me , is you got caught " .
They 're like inmates .
Some have been there long enough , that they just want to do their time , get their paychecks , go home and watch the game and gently caress the wife .
So long as we 're not up to anything TOO awful , they turn their back to little things - Tattooing , smoking in the cells , weed , even consentual buttsex between a man and his punk , so long as they didnt have to hear about it .
Or see it .
Some would bring us little things , like good tattoo ink , or bits and parts of stuff for us to use in our hobbycraft , etc .
Some would sit and chat it up with us on a loving hot summer day out on the hill .
Some would play bones with us , or say " hey , a little bird told you to get your tattoo poo poo out of the cell , you 're up for a shakedown tonight " .
Others .
Well others were straight FUCKS .
They 'd write you up as soon as look at you .
When it was shakedown time , instead of taking your books off your shelf neatly to see if there 's contraband in / behind them , they 'd toss them onto the floor .
They 'd try to instigate fights .
They 'd lock you down for no loving reason , etc .
We made the best of it .
We just watched from the hill , observing , listening .
Going home ...
My time finally came .
All my good - time was revoked over the escape .
But in the two years I was at MAX , I earned enough for the day to finally come , nearly four years after it had all begun .
You mark down the days on your calendar and it all seems like it will never end .
You calculate and re calculate , and you note six months left ( it might as well be six years ) -
Three months left ( it 'll never get here ) , One month left ( Something is going to happen ...
Something will go wrong ) ...
Two weeks left ( your fellow convicts begin to detatch a little from you - they 're still your friends but you can tell somethings a little different ) , Seven days left ( you 're waiting for a note on your bunk telling them that your Pre-release W&W check came back with a detainer in some fuckoff county ) ,
Three days left ( each hour is two hours long and you can't sleep for poo poo ) , TOMORROW YOU'RE GOING HOME .
You can't believe it .
They begin the process - Your outgoing physical , all the signing of forms and papers , packing up the things that have become your worldy posessions over the years , saying goodbye to those that will be at work when you do the " walk " .
The morning of .
You pick up your box from the property office .
You go to the main office where you 're given your street clothes .
You 're shaking .
Youre loving scared to death .
What 's changed in the world ?
How am I going to get a job ?
Holy gently caress I now have a WIFE to look after !
You go through the first gate , with a guard .
it closes behind you .
" Excited ? " says the guard .
you hear some disembodied voice answer in the affirmative , but everything in you wants to drop that box and go running back to where everything is regimented , where you knwo exactly what each day will bring , like clockwork .
The second gate opens .
You step beyond it .
twenty yards away there 's a yellow line .
On the other side of that yellow line are your wife and a guy who you got out of prison seven years early with your law clerking , here to show his appreciation .
Off to your right is the razor wire .
Through that you can see fifty people , who have all gotten permission from their bosses to wave you off .
Many of them will never see this side of the wire again .
Many of them will never go home .
Many of them , to this day , six years later , are still in the band room , playing awful covers .
Many of them are still sneaking a quick grope or a little through - the - jeans handjob on the visiting yard .
They 're having lunch at twelve - oh - five .
Fridays they have fish .
Sometimes , just sometimes , I want to go back .
Here in the world it 's all me .
It 's all under my control .
Sometimes I 'm lonely .
I was somebody there .
I was the smart guy on the yard .
I was the one to talk to if you needed help , and could afford me .
Then I remember how it felt when I got out .
That I could just open my door any old time and step outside .
Any time I wanted to .
My first week or so home , my wife told me she would wake up and see me opening and closing our front door , just because I could .
I do n't remember this , though .
Who am I now ?
I 'm your neighbor .
I 'm the guy with a nice car , the good house , the good job .
You 'd never guess me for an ex-con , unless you saw my well - hidden tattoos .
I wo n't get them removed , I need them .
My wife and I are now divorced .
It 's hard to tell somebody who broke you out of prison that you dont know where your relationship is going ....
But it was for the best .
Sometimes , I 'll dream that I 'm back there , that some freak of the law brought me back there .
That the governor is loving with me some more .
that my life is on hold , again .
That I 'm just some guy in a box behind some wire .
I wake up in a cold sweat , leap out of bed , dash down the hall ...
... and open my door .
( CNN ) -- Stray gunfire struck two girls at a civilian displacement camp in eastern Congo , killing one and wounding another , the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday .
Congolese walk on a road near the front line near Kibati .
Fighting between government troops and rebels has raged near two U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees displaced persons camps in Kibati -- located in the Democratic Republic of Congo 's war - ravaged North Kivu province .
The warfare has prompted the displacement of 250,000 people since August .
The two girls were shot around 1 a.m. Friday , with a 5 - year - old dying instantly .
A 7 - year - old remains alive but " is fighting for her life , " said UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond .
" It does not appear they were targeted , " Redmond told CNN .
The agency also said armed men near the camps raped a woman on Thursday night .
" We remain extremely concerned for the safety of the displaced Congolese population in Kibati as the civilian character of these two UNHCR - run camps north of Goma is continually violated , " the UNHCR said in a statement .
The United Nations has been working to relocate the many displaced people in Kibati to other locations , including a new camp .
The U.N. Security Council recently approved sending more than 3,000 troops to bolster the 17,000 - strong peacekeeping force already in the region .
The United Nations has been mediating talks between the Democratic Republic of Congo 's government and its main rebel group to stop the violence .
Fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between government forces and CNDP rebels under the command of Laurent Nkunda .
It was sparked by lingering tensions over the 1994 slaughter of ethnic Tutsis by majority Hutus in neighboring Rwanda .
Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo .
Nkunda declared a unilateral cease - fire on October 29 , but it failed to stop the fighting and reports of atrocities .
CNN 's Joe Sterling contributed to this report .

Food Rules : Labels Must Now Give Origin Manufacturers have 6 months to comply with new labeling rules for food .
Oct. 5 , 2008 -- New regulations at U.S. supermarkets are giving consumers the knowledge they have been asking for — where the fresh food they buy originates .
Recent food contaminations have made headlines across the globe causing deaths , illness and overall unease .
Most recently melamine has tainted dairy from China , salmonella was found in peppers in Mexico , there were cases of E. coli infected spinach from California and beef originating in Omaha .
The country of origin labels will now be on beef , pork , lamb , chicken , goat meat , perishable agricultural commodities , peanuts , pecans , ginseng , and macadamia nuts .
The labeling will provide a sense of safety and accountability to concerned consumers .
For safety advocates it is a huge step forward .
" It 's vitally important to ensure that products coming in from other countries as well as ones growing here are quickly identified in an outbreak , " says Caroline Smith DeWaal , Director of Food and Safety Center for Science in the Public Interest .
But some food safety advocates say country of origin labeling is not specific enough .
They want to see labels containing bar codes that can automatically trace foods all the way back to the farm .
The tomato industry was furious with the Food and Drug Administration when their crop was wrongly targeted this past summer in one of the nation 's largest salmonella outbreaks .
Better labeling , and especially the use of barcodes in labels , could have streamlined the investigation and saved millions of dollars when perfectly good tomatoes were left to rot .
The labeling law passed in 2002 , but food producers fought it until now because of the cost and burden .
" The industry has fought labeling tooth and nail because if you have labeling … people could decide whether they wanted to eat this food or not , " says Michael Pollan , author of " In Defense of Food . "
There are worries that though peppers from Mexico are safe now , as is spinach from California , consumers might not be interested in buying these foods from these locations .
There are loopholes in this new labeling system .
Foods produced in the United States but packed in Mexico can still be labeled " product of USA . "
This common practice hindered government investigators when they were searching for tainted tomatoes .
If a product like hamburger meat contains ground beef from the U.S. and another country , both will be listed but there wo n't be specific indication of what percentage comes from each country .
Processed foods like bacon need no labeling ; nor do foods used as ingredients in other products .
For instance , lettuce must now be labeled , but salad mixes containing lettuce and carrots will not be .
Raw shrimp requires a label but if the store adds spices , it then becomes unnecessary .
" We need to go much farther to have a system of traceability that consumers can really trust , " says DeWaal .
Food producers have up to six months to comply with the new law .
After that they could face fines up to $ 1,000 .
Besides being a better way to track meats and produce the law could make people more aware of their actions .
Buying locally grown products could infuse the local economy .
It also lessens the food 's carbon imprint since the trip from the farm to the market is shorter .
Rainer Joswig sent me a link to Back to the Future : Lisp as a Base for a Statistical Computing System .
I have n't read it , but Rainer helpfully summarized it on comp.lang.lisp .
Here 's part of his summary :
These guys moved away from XLisp to languages like R. Now they feel that R has not a bright future as a implementation of an efficient programming language .
Going back to XLisp is no option , since it is no longer used / maintained and also relatively ' slow ' .
The authors of the paper argue that by using Common Lisp :
they can write more code in Lisp and less code in C. since Common Lisp implementations have a wider range of performance ( due to providing optimizing , incremental , native code compilers ) and the implementations are mostly written in Common Lisp themselves .
they get the choice of several Common Lisp implementations that are maintained , so they do n't have to maintain the language implementation .
they get a standard language with features and extensions that XLisp does not provide or in a more primitive form .
They do n't have to maintain / invent their own programming language .
Their goal is to get an interactive system and reasonable performance at the same time - something that several Common Lisp implementations can provide .
A statement by the
December 10 , 2008 -- The Australia - Venezuela Solidarity Network condemns the murder of Venezuelan trade unionist Simon Caldera , who was shot in Aragua state on December 4 . Caldera was a leader of the pro-revolution Bolivarian Construction and Industry Union .
Caldera is the fourth trade unionist to be murdered in one week in Aragua .
His murder follows the shocking killings of three pro-revolution militants from the National Union of Workers ( UNT ) – Richard Gallardo , Luis Hernandez and Carlos Requena – on November 27 .
All four were victims of drive - by shootings .
The assassination by hired killers of activists organising oppressed people to win their rights has mainly been used in recent years by large landowners against supporters of land reform in Venezuela .
More than 150 land reform activists have been killed since the revolutionary government of President Hugo Chavez began its land reform policies in 2001 – policies that benefit impoverished campesinos at the expense of large landowners .
Such murderous actions are an attempt by the rich elite to use violence and terror to protect their interests against the advances of a powerful movement of the oppressed in Venezuela .
Under the revolutionary leadership of Hugo Chavez , Venezuela now has the highest minimum wage in Latin America and many pro-worker laws have been implemented .
The capitalist bosses ' attacks on these union activists follows the elites ’ defeat at the ballot box .
On November 24 , more than 5 million people voted for the pro-Chavez candidates in the regional elections , winning 17 out of 22 states and more than 80 % of municipalities in a poll that was understood as a virtual referendum on constructing " socialism of the 21st century " .
In Aragua , the anti-worker , pro-capitalist governor Didalco Bolivar lost the elections to a member of Chavez ’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) .
This vote clearly indicated the people ’s desire for change in a state where the police have a history of repressing workers ' struggles .
The Bolivarian revolution has made enormous steps forward in tackling poverty and securing basic human rights for the majority in Venezuela .
However , the murder of these activists makes it clear that there remains in Venezuela powerful counter - revolutionary forces willing to use any means to destroy the movement of the oppressed and maintain their own privileges .
Gallardo , Hernandez and Requena were all participants in an industrial dispute involving the Colombian - owned Alpina food processing company , leading to speculation that the attack was carried out by right - wing Colombian paramilitaries hired by the company .
The day before , the Alpina workers had also been attacked by the police .
Workers in Aragua responded to the killings immediately , with 17 trade unions taking to the streets and blocking major highways in days of protests .
Speaking at the inauguration of the new governor of Aragua , Chavez called for a full investigation into the killings , declaring : " In Venezuela we cannot permit the installation of this perversion , these hired assassinations . "
Chavez also said that the Aragua police force must be completely transformed and threatened to nationalise any company that violated workers ' rights .
These responses of the working people in Aragua and the revolutionary Chavez government show the determination of the Venezuelan people to defeat such violence .
All trade unionists and other supporters of workers ' rights and social justice should stand with the Chavez government and Aragua ’s workers to condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of such terrorist acts against the people , and to demand that those responsible face justice .
The AVSN offers its condolences to the families and comrades of the four murdered trade unionists — killed for their courageous struggle for working people ’s rights .
This tragedy only strengthens our determination to build greater international solidarity with the Venezuelan people and their Bolivarian revolution .

The Pakistani President , Asif Ali Zardari , will plead with President George Bush today to change a policy which is being blamed for one of his country 's worst terrorist atrocities .
" We hope the US will change policy because this is what is needed , " said Pakistan 's ambassador to the UK , Wajid Shamsul Hassan , after 53 people were killed and more than 250 injured in the bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad .
He argued that the Bush administration 's decision to allow cross - border incursions from Afghanistan into Pakistan , including by ground forces on at least one occasion , had been counterproductive " because they are not killing high - value targets , they are killing civilians " .
Mr Zardari's talks with President Bush in New York , on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly , have been scheduled amid heightened security fears in the wake of the bombing .

Yesterday BA cancelled all flights to Pakistan as a precaution , although a spokesman said there was no direct threat against the airline , which operates six flights each week .
A number of foreign embassies and businesses in the country are also said to be re-examining the security situation .
In the north - western city of Peshawar , Abdul Khaliq Farahi , Afghanistan 's designated ambassador to Pakistan , was kidnapped and his driver killed by unidentified gunmen .
Overnight on Sunday there was further tension on the border when Pakistani troops reportedly fired shots to warn off two US helicopters that were attempting to cross into Pakistan at Alwara Mandi in North Waziristan .
A senior Pakistani official claimed that Pakistan 's senior leaders were to have attended a dinner at the Marriott Hotel but changed their venue to the Prime Minister 's house just hours before the massive bomb devastated the building .
The Interior Ministry chief , Rehman Malik , said the decision to move the location of the dinner for the President and Prime Minister had been kept secret but did not provide details of why the switch was made .
However , it later emerged that the invitations to the Prime Minister 's residence were sent out 10 days ago .
" The dinner was never going to be at the Marriott , " said Talat Hussain , a political analyst and director of current affairs at Aaj TV .
" We were all issued invitations well in advance that it was to take place at the Prime Minister 's house .
And by claiming that they had managed to move the political leadership to another location , it asks the question , if there is a security threat , is it only for VIPs ?
Are the rest of us children of a lesser god ? "

Mr Malik could not be reached for further clarification last night .
Who carried out Saturday night 's attack remains unclear .
Mr Malik had previously said the hotel was attacked by Taliban or al - Qa'ida militants simply because it was a Western target .
But his remarks raise the question as to why – if the government had received intelligence that the Marriott might be attacked – was security at the hotel not immediately increased .
The attack on the hotel and the shockwaves it has sent through Pakistan are just the latest challenges confronting the country 's civilian leadership and its recently elected president , Mr Zardari .
Under pressure from the US , Mr Zardari , the widower of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , has vowed to continue the battle against Islamic militants operating in the country 's tribal areas despite growing resentment inside Pakistan about interference from Washington .
Mr Hassan said that the Pakistan President had gained the support of Gordon Brown in opposing the US raids on Pakistani territory , during talks in London last week .
Mr Zardari is to chair the first meeting of the Friends of Pakistan – grouping the US , Britain and the other G8 countries as well as the United Arab Emirates , Saudi Arabia and China – in New York on Friday .
Pakistan is looking for short - term help for economic measures to stimulate employment , and longer - term assistance for social development in deprived areas .

Mumbai : A 51 - year - old deputy general manager of Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) committed suicide by jumping from his office at BKC on Wednesday afternoon .
S K Pattnaik handled the inspection department and was in his eighth - floor office in the RBI building .
A bank employee said , " At lunch time , around 1.30 pm , he was in the office gallery when he suddenly jumped out . ''
Pattnaik sustained multiple injuries and died on the spot .
The bank informed his family in Goregaon and the police about the incident .
The statements of the staff were recorded and the body was sent for post - mortem .
Pattnaik 's wife Reeta and two sons , Aditya and Anshuman , rushed to the hospital after learning about the incident .
They , however , refused to talk to the media .
The police found a suicide note in Pattnaik 's pocket , in which he wrote that no one was to be held responsible for his death .
The note had his signature on it .
Pattnaik used to work at RBI 's Fort office before being shifted to BKC .
Sources said Pattnaik had an accident a year ago and sustained leg injuries , which turned gangrenous .
He stayed at home for 10 months and resumed duty recently .
He used to find the pain unbearable , the sources said .
The police suspected that Pattnaik was depressed and were trying to find out if any official or personal matter drove him to suicide .
RBI chief general manager Alpana Killawala said the police were probing the case .
" We will come to a conclusion after recording his family 's statements , '' said senior inspector R Pereira .

Gassy signature of habitability spied in the atmosphere of a ' hot Jupiter ' .
Carbon dioxide , one of the telltale signs that a planet may be able to support life , has been spotted in the atmosphere of a gas giant orbiting a star 63 light years from Earth .
Although there 's no way that this particular planet could support life , being able to spot carbon dioxide in its atmosphere offers hope for probing the atmospheres of planets more like Earth — and so bolstering the search for life outside the Solar System .
Carbon dioxide has been discovered in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b — a ' hot Jupiter ' exoplanet like the one in this artist 's impression .
NASA , ESA and A. Schaller
HD 189733b is a hot Jupiter — a planet similar in mass to Jupiter in our Solar System , but one that orbits much closer to its star , and so is much hotter .
Giovanna Tinetti from University College London , UK and her colleagues have managed to measure the spectrum of the light coming from the day side of the planet using a technique called ' secondary transit ' .
This involves recording the light spectrum of the planet and its star , and then measuring the spectrum of the star alone while the planet is hidden behind it .
The difference of the two spectra is the spectrum of the light coming directly from the planet .
Tinetti used the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer ( NICMOS ) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope .
What emerged was a spectrum that , after its absorption and emission part were disentangled and it was compared with theoretical models , revealed the presence of carbon dioxide in the planet 's atmosphere .
" This is an exciting result , " says Tinetti .
" This is the first near - infrared spectrum of a planet .
Even from a technical point of view it 's a nice result . "
Spectacular finding
" Carbon dioxide is one of the big four biomarkers for a habitable , if not inhabited planet , " says Alan Boss from the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington , who was not involved with the work .
The other three are water , methane and oxygen – and now oxygen is the only one left to be observed in the atmosphere of a planet outside the Solar System .
" They really have nailed it , " Boss says of the result .
The NICMOS instrument looks at the near - infrared part of the spectrum whereas previous studies of this planet using the Spitzer Space Telescope have been looking at different areas of the spectrum where a carbon dioxide signature would n't show up , such as the mid-infrared region .
These different instruments also probe different layers of the atmosphere so that ultimately a picture of the chemistry going on between them can be gleaned .
ADVERTISEMENT
" It 's a spectacular data set , " says Sara Seager from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge .
" It 's astonishing that we can detect molecules in exoplanet atmospheres . "
The detection of carbon dioxide is particularly surprising , Seager says , because other forms of carbon , such as carbon monoxide or methane , would be expected to dominate in the hot , hydrogen - rich atmosphere .
Tinetti and her colleagues put this down to an unusually high carbon - to - oxygen ratio in this planet 's atmosphere .
Boss is impressed that even with the low resolution of this spectrum , the carbon dioxide signal is so clear .
" It 's amazing what you can do with a telescope like Hubble that was never designed to do planetary observations like this , " he says .
Softly softly
Tinetti and her team are being cautious about inferring too much from their results , but they hope that with more observations they will be able to work out the origin of this carbon dioxide , and whether it comes from a photochemical or thermochemical reaction .
They have managed to roughly calculate the abundance of carbon dioxide in this atmosphere as being about 0.00001 times the amount of the most abundant gas , molecular hydrogen .
The results were presented at a meeting about molecules in extrasolar planetary atmospheres held in Paris from 19 - 21 November , and will be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
" This planet we keep observing is nowhere near habitable , " says Tinetti , " but all these measurements give us an opportunity to train ourselves . "
And with that training , astronomers will be able to go and find , and characterize , planets that are just like our own .
" We 're extremely close to the moment when we find a one - Earth - mass planet , " Tinetti says .

Being a gamer over 30 means that you likely fell in love with gaming a long time ago .
For me , that affair started around age 6 , as my uncle showed me the Atari and I prowled through his Commodore 64 collection , wondering what the stone that came with Wishbringer was really for and fantasizing about kicking the sh*t out of Zork for not understanding my commands .
While a lot of kids turn to games as a way to share fun with their peers , in the time period I discovered games , they were very much the opposite for me -- since I was a bookworm and a bit of a loner , games were more like an escape -- a place where I could be alone and yet not quite alone , and have an adventure with friends that , while not real flesh - and - blood people , provided some of the most important friendships I ever had .
Twenty years later , the future is pointing at an age of gaming in which all of our activities are shared -- from friend lists to Microsoft 's recent addition of parties , you are always accessible for multiplayer games , chat and more .
In fact , games , like LittleBigPlanet focus mostly on user content and online play , taking all focus away from the single - player adventure .
These are all great advancements and certainly follow the flow of current technology to interconnect our world as completely as possible , but where in this new world is there a place for the solo gamer , one who not only enjoys the experience of playing a game alone , but actually ( gasp ) holds those gaming experiences above those he or she has with other players ?
[ photo by Adonis Werther ]
It all started here .
People who are fans of multiplayer games are already talking back , I know it -- you 're saying , " If you do n't want to play with other people , just do n't sign into Xbox Live ! "
And you know , you 're right .
I do n't have to do that .
In fact , despite the fact I love to game alone , I do also sometimes enjoy playing with other people , and I do enjoy the ability to interconnect with them so easily at any time .
The thing is , people who have never been heavy into the solo experience in a game are just not going to get it .
Why play a game alone when you could play it with other people ?
That 's like watching a movie alone .
Which , of course , I also enjoy doing .
Often .
A common complaint about the recent RPG Fallout 3 touches a little bit on the " why " of what solo gamers passionately pursue .
Some gamers said they disliked the beginning of the game in which your character grows up in the Vault , where you are surrounded by other people .
Personally I found that when I escaped the Vault and got out into the open landscape , I found what I was looking for : the experience of feeling completely alone on an adventure that you are wholly responsible for .
I suppose it 's a lot like reading a book .
There 's an almost reverential quality to the experience , because even though thousands of other people will read the same book , the unique way you will process it and how it will affect you is all yours .
While total immersion into a game environment is being praised in games like Dead Space , solo gamers have to laugh -- we 've had total immersion in the games we 've played for a few decades now , not because of advanced graphics or sound , but because of our isolation and imaginations .
Because of my experiences as a solo gamer , I traveled with Crono and his friends and enjoyed their company as if they were my friends , I mourned the death of Nei in a way that actually prepared me to face real loss later in life ( laughable , I know , but true ) , and I learned some pretty valuable lessons about life in general .
Sniff ...
I think if I had had friends to share these games with at the time , I would n't have had the amount of free time to devote my attention to them in the same way .
I would have been more distracted by those real - life interactions , and while that would n't have been a bad thing , I do n't regret being an isolated gamer back then .
I think the inability to share these gaming experiences with other people made them even more special to me -- and I believe the people who listen faithfully to RetroforceGO !
on a weekly basis may understand exactly what I am trying to say here .
So yeah , I 'm glad that today I can turn on my 360 and be instantly connected to a hundred friends who can invite me to parties , chat with me and enjoy games with me in real time .
I think that rocks , and I 'm so grateful that I 'm getting to experience something like that in my lifetime .
At the same time , some days I 'm going to go buy a game , come home , turn out all the lights and make sure that I 'm not signed on to anything that shows other people I 'm there .
While it may not measure up to being verbally abused by strangers on Xbox Live , I still kind of enjoy it .
The slimmed - down choice of pens in office supply cabinets : one each of black , red and blue .
" It seems trivial , but when you have 100,000 employees or however many using supplies , they do n't need to be that prolific .
It adds up , " spokeswoman Renee Rashid - Merem said .
All the while , the once - mighty icon of American industry and its smaller competitor Chrysler edge closer to bankruptcy .
Experts say their best shot is for President - elect Barack Obama to persuade the outgoing White House to free emergency loans from the $ US700 billion ( $ 1.04 trillion ) federal bail - out , or to have the Federal Reserve make a loan .
The $ US14 billion car - industry bail - out bill died in the Senate late on Thursday after the United Auto Workers refused to accept Republican demands for swift wage cuts to bring UAW workers ' pay in line with Japanese carmakers .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he hoped President George Bush would tap the Wall Street bail - out fund for emergency aid to the carmakers .
Barring that , GM and Chrysler must continue to cut even the smallest expenditures and hold off payments to parts suppliers as they hoard cash and try to stay alive until Mr Obama takes office on January 20 and could take his own action .
GM has hinted it might not make it through the end of the year before running out of cash .
But GM board member Kent Kresa said this week that the company might make it into the first quarter , depending on car sales .
" Certainly it has been stated that we need the money quite soon , " Kresa said .
" I can't specifically state before the end of the year , but certainly in the first quarter and early in the first quarter . "
GM wants a total of $ US18 billion in government loans , including $ US4 billion before this year runs out .
And Chrysler , which is looking for $ US7 billion in loans , may be even closer to the edge .
Its CEO , Robert Nardelli , said its cash would drop to $ US2.5 billion , its minimum to survive , at the end of the year .
It has cut 32,000 workers since private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP took over control in August of last year , including 25 per cent of its salaried workforce last month .
The other of the Detroit Three , Ford , is not yet seeking government loans but wants a $ US9 billion line of credit that it might need to tap if the depressed US car market does n't recover .
It says it can last through next year because it borrowed billions two years ago , when credit was freely available .
The possibility remains that a deal can still be worked out in the Senate .
Republican opponents , mainly from Southern states , probably do n't want to bring the industry down , said David M Hart , associate professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia .
" It 's certainly not beyond the scope of possibility that they 'll get this thing through , " Hart said .
" I think it 's hard for Republicans to have this on them .
There 's a lot of pressure .
They might work out a deal . "
Hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance .
The Detroit Three employ 239,000 workers in the US .
Counting other businesses that depend on the carmakers , economists estimate that 2.5 million jobs would be lost if all three companies went out of business .
Susan Helper , a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has studied the car industry , said GM and Chrysler 's suppliers are the key to keeping the carmakers out of bankruptcy protection if they are forced to stretch and try to make it past Obama 's inauguration .
Suppliers , also cash - strapped , may start demanding payment in advance before shipping parts .
If enough suppliers get nervous and start demanding cash , the companies could run short .
" Then you have this game of musical chairs where everyone wants to make sure they 're not the one left without a chair , " she said .
" That very process can bring the whole structure down .
Right now the suppliers have been incredibly disciplined and not saying , ' Hey , pay us first ' , " she said .
Already , a small number of GM suppliers have sought cash on delivery , but the company is working through the situation , CEO Rick Wagoner said last week .
" I would say there are a couple situations that we are managing , but on balance I 'd say it 's really held in there quite well , " he told the AP .
When Chrysler tried to stretch its money until it could get a government - guaranteed loan in 1980 , it ran short of cash two weeks before the loan came through , said Steve Miller , an assistant treasurer at the time who now is executive chairman of Troy - based Delphi Corp , GM 's former parts wing .
" Any one supplier could have pulled the rug out from under us and prevented us from building cars , " Miller said in an interview .
But suppliers , he said , knew their futures were dependent on Chrysler 's financial health .
" We hung in there and the suppliers stayed with us , " Miller recalled .
If , for whatever reason , the companies go into Chapter 11 protection , credit is so tight that they might not be able to get bankruptcy financing , Helper said .
A bankruptcy judge , she said , could hold off creditors and possible liquidation until the companies arranged financing , most likely from the government .

" It seems pretty clear that the only potential provider of the [ bankruptcy ] financing is the Government , " she said .
" You 'd have some period of figuring out the terms under which that ... financing is going to be offered . "
John McCain selected a " maverick " but it turns out Sarah 's about as much a " maverick " as McCain himself .
The AP just reported the Troopergate verdict and its not good for Palin : " Panel finds Palin abused her power in safety official 's firing . "
Now both candidates on the Republican ticket have an ethically questionable mark on their political resume .
No longer can they pretend to carry the baton for reform .
The McCain campaign 's response by Meg Stapleton :
" Today 's report shows that the Governor acted within her proper and lawful authority in the reassignment of Walt Monegan .
The report also illustrates what we 've known all along : this was a partisan led inquiry run by Obama supporters and the Palins were completely justified in their concern regarding Trooper Wooten given his violent and rogue behavior .
Lacking evidence to support the original Monegan allegation , the Legislative Council seriously overreached , making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact .
The Governor is looking forward to cooperating with the Personnel Board and continuing her conversation with the American people regarding the important issues facing the country . "
There 's just one problem with spinning this as a partisan result : " The council include [ d ] 10 Republicans and four Democrats . "
I also watched a little analysis on FOX News .
They continually pointed out that the trooper Palin wanted to fire tasered a ten year old .
This is a truthful statement but does not in anyway counter the findings of the report .
The council ruled that Palin 's dismissal of Monegan was " proper and lawful , " but this was not the principal result of the conviction .
Palin " knowingly ... permitted Todd Palin to use the Governor 's office and the resources of the Governor 's office , " in direct violation of state 's ethical codes .
How many times has Obama or Biden been convicted of ethical violations ?
Zero .
Case closed .
Today the Republican Party lost .

The Environmental Protection Agency is considering rules that could cost Colorado ranchers millions of dollars each year .

Any rancher with more than 100 head of cattle could be charged between $ 80 and $ 100 a head for methane and carbon dioxide production .
Colorado ’s ranchers could pay $ 240 million in federal taxes .
The cost to the dairy industry would be $ 20 million and pork producers would pay $ 17 million each year .

It is a punishment tax , so is the goal to punish farmers ?
Or is it to punish people who eat meat ?

Will the government charge themselves for the herds of elk and buffalo in national parks ?
This whole idea seems really wacky , especially to those of us who are not convinced that global warming is a threat , or that it is man made .
Even if you believe in man made global warming and believe that a sin tax on emissions is a good idea , can emissions from a cow or a pig be considered man made ?
Can someone who believes this tax is a good idea explain why ?
Another gatekeeper illustrates the intellectual cowardice of the establishment left

World renowned peace activist and left - wing anti-war icon Howard Zinn recently told an audience that he did n’t care if 9/11 was an inside job , echoing the disdainful and apathetic rhetoric of fellow liberal gatekeepers Noam Chomsky and Alexander Cockburn in dismissing the efforts of the 9/11 truth movement .
Buddy Moore , Independent Candidate for US Senate in Colorado , asked Zinn if he would join him in voicing doubts about the official 9/11 story and in particular the demolition of the twin towers and Building 7 .
Zinn said he was skeptical of the official story but then stated , “ I do n’t know much about the situation and the truth is , I do n’t care that much about it , that ’s passed …. that ’s a diversion from what we really have to do , ” adding that debating who was behind 9/11 , “ gets in the way of dealing with the immediate situation ” .
Moore attempted to ask Zinn a follow up question about allowing the perpetrators to go free but was largely shouted down by Zinn ’s fawning army of left - wing sycophants .
Watch the clip below .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Zinn ’s comments echo similar sentiments expressed by fellow left - wing luminary , Noam Chomsky , who has repeatedly expressed arrogance and contempt towards the 9/11 truth movement while invoking apathy towards the contention that there was government complicity in the attacks , despite the fact that the 9/11 attacks happening exactly as the government maintains was key to launching the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq , as well as the massive rollback in civil liberties that has occurred over the last seven years .
During a 2006 Internet forum event , Chomsky claimed that the 9/11 truth movement peddled “ arcane and dubious theories ” and had distracted activists from pursuing “ crimes that are far more serious than blowing up the WTC , ” presumably belittling the deaths of around 2,000 Americans , along with hundreds of thousands of Afghanis and Iraqis , as well as thousands of U.S. troops in the wars that followed that could not have been launched without the pretext of 9/11 .
When a critic asked Chomsky why he was so dismissive of the supposition that 9/11 was a false flag event , pointing out numerous other examples throughout history including the bombing of the Maine , the Gulf of Tonkin incident and Pearl Harbor , Chomsky merely reiterated his insolence , stating , “ The concept of “ false flag operation ” is not a very serious one , in my opinion .
None of the examples you describe , or any other in history , has even a remote resemblance to the alleged 9/11 conspiracy .
I ’d suggest that you look at each of them carefully . ”
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Chomsky actually dismissed U.S. government complicity in 9/11 a mere four months after the event , and over a year before it was again invoked as a reason to invade Iraq , when he told an audience at a FAIR event at New York ’s Town Hall , 22 January 2002 , “ That ’s an internet theory and it ’s hopelessly implausible .
Hopelessly implausible .
So hopelessly implausible I do n’t see any point in talking about it , ” in response to a question about U.S. government foreknowledge .
Note that Professor Chomsky also vehemently maintains that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman in the JFK assassination , even despite polls showing that around 80 per cent of the American public believe otherwise .
Chomsky was presented with convincing evidence for a wider plot by JFK assassination experts as far back as 1969 and according to Selwyn Bromberger , an MIT philosophy professor who had sit in on the discussion , Chomsky indicated that he believed there was a conspiracy , but has failed to voice his conclusion for nearly 40 years .
It ’s painfully clear that the likes of Zinn and Chomsky are intellectual cowards who , despite being abundantly aware of the fact that both 9/11 and the JFK assassination represent far wider conspiracies than the official version of events dictates , they are afraid of using their prominent soapboxes to bring either subject to wider attention for fear of whatever reprisals might ensue .
As Vincent Salandria enunciates , this makes them worse than disinformation agents .
“ I agree that Professor Chomsky is not a CIA agent , ” states Salandria , “ But with respect to his pronouncements on the JFK assassination he is worse than a CIA agent .
Without being an agent , with his enormous prestige as a thinker , as an independent radical , as a courageous man , he does the work of the agency . ”
Indeed , at the time of the release of Oliver Stone ’s JFK movie , Howard Zinn , Noam Chomsky and another liberal luminary , Alexander Cockburn , went on a seemingly orchestrated media campaign in an attempt to convince the public that the JFK assassination was not a wider conspiracy and also that it did n’t matter even if it was .
“ When cornered themselves , Chomsky and Cockburn resort to rhetorical devices like exaggeration , sarcasm , and ridicule .
In other words , they resort to propaganda and evasion , ” notes one blogger .
The same rhetoric was utilized when questions about 9/11 reached a crescendo .
Cockburn , Zinn and Chomsky not only dismiss clear evidence that the official story is demonstrably false , but in addition attempt to generate apathy around the whole issue , classic gatekeeper behavior in preventing the left from becoming active in pursuing the truth about 9/11 .

DC likely to gain voting member of Congress Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 1 , 2008
Print This Email This Utah , too ;
First new voting seats since 1959 Eleanor Holmes Norton 's schedule is likely going to become a lot more crowded in the next year .
With Barack Obama 's election , along with Democratic gains in the Senate , Norton -- the District of Columbia 's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives -- is poised to become a full - fledged Representative , giving DC a voting member of Congress for the first time in the nation 's history .
Senate Democrats have added at least seven members to their caucus this year , with two races yet to be decided .
While a filibuster - proof 60 - vote majority remains elusive , the gains should be enough to move forward a DC voting - rights bill , among other measures that are supported by moderate Republicans , the Washington Post notes Monday .
Under a measure that passed the House by a wide margin last year , Norton would receive a vote in the House on behalf of the District 's nearly 600,000 residents .
The bill also would give Utah an additional House member , bringing the total in the House to 437 .
The bill fell to a Republican - led filibuster in the Senate on a 57 - 42 vote , but this year 's Democratic pick - ups seem likely to assure its passage if it returns to the floor .
All seven Republicans who were replaced by Democrats voted against the measure .
President - elect Barack Obama co-sponsored the Senate bill and would be expected to sign the measure into law .
Norton , who co-sponsored last year 's measure , says she will reintroduce it sometime in the next session of Congress , although the timing has yet to be decided .
 After 209 years , District residents will have not only a president who has already changed America , and the president that our residents most wanted , but they will have a Democratic president , who , as senator , co-sponsored the District of Columbia Voting Rights Act , and has told me he will sign our bill ,  Norton said in a statement , released after Obama 's victory .
Congress fixed the number of House seats at 435 in 1911 .
The body temporarily increased to 437 members in 1959 to give Alaska and Hawaii one member each , then returned back to 435 members after the next census .
A lot of portable computer manufacturers seem to have been losing focus lately , releasing netbooks at near - notebook prices .
Not Belco !
Their Alpha 400 MIPS netbook is priced more like a scientific calculator .
Unfortunately , it 's specced like one too .

The components are n't just low end — a lot of them seem like they would n't even be available for purchase anymore .
A 400MHz processor ?
A single , 128 MB stick of RAM ?
A 802.11b wireless adapter ?
Those museum pieces accompany a 7 inch , 800x480 screen , 1GB of flash memory and a few token ports to round out the Alpha 400 , which is admittedly intended for modest browsing and word processing purposes .

At this price , almost any corner - cutting is permissible .
I say almost because the 802.11 b Wi - Fi adapter will make this netbook , which could only really be useful as a portable browsing machine , useless as a portable browsing machine , as many public networks wo n't even allow for standard B connections anymore .
If you 're particularly budget - minded and spend a lot of time around old wireless access points , the Alpha 400 MIPS is available now for $ 170 .

Cycle protesters in Penang , December 5
By Oppressed People ’s Movement ( Jaringan Rakyat Tertindas , Jerit )
December 6 , 2008 -- The Oppressed People ’s Movement ( Jaringan Rakyat Tertindas , Jerit ) is conducting a cycling campaign throughout Malaysia to highlight demands for workers ' right , which will be presented to the prime minister of Malaysia .
The campaign officially began on December 3 at Wisma Darul Aman Kedah , where 50 cyclists were flagged off .
They will cycle for 16 days through Kedah , Penang , Perak and Selangor .
On December 18 , they will hand a memorandum to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim , at the national parliament in Kuala Lumpur .
The six demands are : 1 . Legislate a Minimum Wage Act ; 2 . Abolish draconian laws ; 3 . Adequate housing for the people ; 4 . Control prices ; 5 . Stop the privatisation of public services ; 6 . Revive local municipal council elections .
The cyclists are riding the unique route to advocate change .
The ‘ People the force of change ' campaign is one of the Jerit 's ways of raising awareness about issues like food shortages , global food shortage , environmental problems , draconian laws and the financial crisis -- in an eco-friendly way to boot .
The cycling campaign is inspired by the class struggles of the Bukit Asahan estate workers in Malacca in the 1970s , who then marched to Kuala Lumpur to meet the prime minister to resolve their problems .
On December 5 , police stopped the Jerit cyclists from leafleting in Teluk Kumbar , Penang .
The whole team was asked to go to Teluk Kumbar police station .
Inspector Lokman ( the police officer on duty ) stopped the cyclists and warned them not to continue and threatened them to arrest them if they ignored the order .
A bus and lorry containing riders ' bicycles was also brought to Teluk Kumbar police station .
The police have continuously intimidated and threatened the cyclists since the campaign started on December 3 .
On December 4 , Ruben a/l Loganathan was arrested by the police in Merbau Pulas , Kedah , for handing out leaflets containing the demands of Jerit ’s bicycle campaign .
The most serious police attack came on December 6 , in the vicinity of Skudai in Johor .
The area turned into an emergency zone , when the police units mobilised , from the Light Strike Force , the Federal Reserve Unit to traffic police , erecting road blocks which caused a massive traffic jam and massive public nuisance .
This was to prevent the young and energetic young cyclists entering the area .
When the riders attempted to negotiate with the police , they were threated with arrest for illegal assembly .
At least 12 people were arrested , including Socialist Party of Malaysia ( Parti Sosialis Malaysia , PSM ) secretary general S.Arutchelvan , PSM treasurer A.Sivarajan , Jerit coordinator K.Simon and a 13 - year - old boy .
Another four Jerit and Suara Rakyat Malaysia ( the human rights group Suaram ) coordinators , including Ngo Jian Yee and Nyam Yee Han .
While the 16 people were held in Skudai police station , the police put the others under " house arrest " at the Suaram office .
After negotiations between police and S.Arutchelvan , the police allowed everyone to leave with the condition that no cycling would continue in Skudai .
Police said they would arrest any person found cycling , even after assurances that the cyclists would travel in a single line .
The only assurance the police gave was that the cyclists and their lorries would be allowed to leave the district without problems .
However , police then intimidated one of the lorries and plainclothes police harassed the cyclists by snapping photographs .
With less bicycles and after the bullying by the police , the Jerit southern team decided to cycle one by one , even if it meant arrest .
The team was met by the Kulai police , who allowed the cyclists to continue but warned them that they would be arrested if they committed any traffic offences .
Braving the intimidation , the Jerit team cycled on but after less than 2 kilometres the police once again diverted all the cyclists to the police station and this time said that they had been stopped because they did n't have reflectors .
This further delayed the journey .
The lorry carrying the remaining cyclists was again harassed .
With this , since it was getting dark , the organisers decided to move on to their next destination , Simpang Renggam .
On arrival , the police were once again harassing the team .
The cyclists were met by some supporters from the opposition People 's Justice Party ( PKR ) , and the team stayed in its local office .
It was a day when the police from three districts in Johor had nothing to do except monitor a group of cyclists , a day when it seems no other issues mattered in Johor .
For the cyclists , it was a frustrating day , yet their spirits remained high .
By midnight , the young cyclists were putting on their reflectors and and were ready to pedal the next day .
Suaram has strongly condemned the police for their ongoing intimidation and attacks on the freedom of expression , a fundamental right which is guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the federal constitution of Malaysia .
Suaram demands that Malaysian government allow the cyclists to continue their ride and respect their freedom of expression as stated in the constitution .
Despite constant police harassment , the cyclists are determined to reach parliament house as scheduled .

A physics - based puzzle game in which you have to guide your character to the goal by cutting wooden objects and joints .
Two days after Obama and the Democratic Party won a ringing 7 million refusal of rightwing fearmongering and hate , the extreme right are unrepentant and none the wiser .
Smintheus at Unbossed writes :
This evening James Dobson 's Focus on the Family Action sent out a fundraising email to members that likened the victories of Barack Obama and congressional Democrats in Tuesday 's election to the Nazi bombing of England during World War II .
The author of this vile letter is Tom Minnery , Senior Vice President of Focus on the Family Action .
It was nearly inevitable that anger over losing the 2008 election would soon provoke right - wing extremists to violate Godwin 's Law .
Obama 's victory in Colorado may have been particularly galling for the Colorado Springs based Focus on the Family , which has been heavily involved in the political campaign this year advocating for conservative issues .
James Dobson personally endorsed the McCain - Palin ticket this fall .
Focus on the Family has not so far posted this hateful fundraising letter on the web .
Here is the opening section of the letter : Dear Friend ,
The spirit of Winston Churchill was alive and well on Tuesday night at Focus on the Family Action headquarters .
You may recall that in the most desperate days of World War II – when Great Britain was being pounded daily by Hitler ’s Luftwaffe – that Winston Churchill called on his countrymen not to despair from danger but to rise to the challenge .
It goes on in exactly the same vein , saying that :
Our nation has never faced the kind of anti-family , pro-abortion assault that we ’re likely to see in the coming weeks and months .
We do n’t have to guess what the Left will do now that they control Congress and the White House ; they ’ve told us .
What are FoF so upset about ?
Freedom of choice , freedom of marriage and legislation to combat discrimination against gays in the workplace .
The last , according to FoF , will be an assault on FoF members ' religious freedom .
Nice of them to state so clearly that theirs is a path of bigotry .
Obama has their number .

But the story disappeared because the lady disappeared .
And I ’d like to know how you killed her .
Did you bury her under one of your 13 houses ?
Or stuff her in the trunk of one of your 11 ca rs ?
Jim Bob Billy Bob of Clearfield , Pennsylvania , a McCain supporter , asks : Senator Obama , why are you so black ?
Tony B. from Brooklyn , an Obama supporter , asks : Sen. McCain , you dragged your adorable 96 year old mother around with you to show us that in McCain years , you ’re still a teenager .
Which would explain your behavior .
But did being 72 give you pause when you chose Gov. Palin ?
And a followup question : Sarah Palin , are you fucking kidding me ?
A Mr. Ice Cold Ghost Killa from Compton , California , who is a McCain supporter , that ’s a surprise , and his question to Obama is : Sen .
Obama , that old white man and his bitch keep lying about you and you never call them out on it .
Does your wife keep your balls in her purse or does she keep them in a box at home ?
And Gordie Levinson , an Obama supporter from Seattle , asks Sen. McCain : Senator , you preface every remark with “ my friends ” .
If I am truly your friend , can I crash in one of your houses for a while because I just lost mine to a bank that imploded .
Thanks for the regulation , numbnuts !

NRA Misfires against Obama
By Michael Dobbs
" Now I learn that Barack Obama supports a huge new tax on my guns and ammo . "
-- Karl Rusch , National Rifle Association " Hunter " video , September 22 , 2008 .
The National Rifle Association has opened fire on Barack Obama for allegedly supporting a " huge new tax " on gun owners .
The charge is contained in a series of new TV ads attacking the Democratic presidential candidate for his " anti- gun " stance .
While it is clear that Obama is no friend of the NRA , the tax hike charge rests on very flimsy evidence .
There are other problems with the ads as well .
The Facts
The NRA video shows a Virginia hunter and Iraq war veteran , Karl Rusch , complaining about the high cost of gas and accusing Obama of planning a " huge new tax " on " guns and ammo . "
" Where is this guy from ? "
Rusch asks .
" He 's probably never been hunting a day in his life . "
The video cites a decade - old clip from a Chicago newspaper to support its claim that Obama favors a huge new gun tax .
The December 13 , 1999 article in the Chicago Defender said that the then Illinois state senator supported a " 500 percent " increase in the federal tax on the sale of " weapons he says are most commonly used in firearm deaths . "
It is unclear from the article exactly what weapons would have been covered by the proposed tax .
Most of the article deals with proposals by Obama to " increase the penalties on gun runners who are flooding Chicago 's streets with illegal weapons . "
Even if Obama did support a big tax increase on the sale of certain types of assault weapons back in 1999 , that is hardly evidence that he will move as president to tax the " guns and ammo " most commonly used by hunters like Rusch .
The NRA video also accuses Obama of voting " to ban virtually all deer hunting ammunition " and supporting " a ban on shotguns and rifles most of us use for hunting . "
The deer hunting claim is based on Obama 's support for an unsuccessful Senate amendment by Sen .
Ted Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) that would have expanded the definition of " armor - piercing " ammunition .
The shotgun claim refers to semi-automatic rifles and pistols covered by the assault weapons ban , which expired in March 2004 .
Contrary to Rusch 's claim , the Kennedy proposal of July 2005 , SA 1615 , was not aimed at " virtually all deer hunting ammunition . "
Instead , it would have authorized the attorney general to define types of illegal ammunition capable of penetrating body armor commonly used by law enforcement officials .
During the Senate debate , Kennedy said that his amendment would " not apply to ammunition that is now routinely used in hunting rifles , " a point contested by the NRA .
Rusch did not respond to a telephone message left with his wife requesting comment .

The Pinocchio Test
While it is true that Obama favors tighter gun laws , it is a huge stretch to argue that he wants to take away the guns and ammunition most commonly used by hunters .
The claim that he favors " a huge new tax on guns and ammo " rests on a confusingly worded 9 - year - old newspaper article that has little relevance for Obama 's platform as a presidential candidate .
The NRA misfires on this one .
( About our rating scale .
Tyler Cowen makes the case in Sunday ’s New York Times that if the Federal Reserve had just let the hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management fail in 1998 — preferably in a messy and disorderly fashion — we’d be much better off today :
With the Long - Term Capital bailout as a precedent , creditors came to believe that their loans to unsound financial institutions would be made good by the Fed — as long as the collapse of those institutions would threaten the global credit system .
Bolstered by this sense of security , bad loans mushroomed .
Sure , he goes on , a “ rapid financial deleveraging ” might have followed in the wake of an LTCM failure , probably plunging the economy into recession .
But that would n’t have been all bad :
In 1998 , there was no collapsed housing bubble , the government ’s budget was in surplus rather than deficit , bank leverage was much lower , and derivatives markets were smaller and less far - reaching .
A financial crisis related to Long - Term Capital , however painful , probably would have been easier to handle than the perfect storm of recent months .
Cowen is saying that occasional financial crises are healthy , even if they lead to recessions , because they teach market participants to take risk seriously .
By averting crises and recessions so successfully over the past quarter century , the Fed thus laid the groundwork for the current megacrisis .
It ’s an argument that makes a lot of intuitive sense , and appeals to practical students of the market — like Barry Ritholtz , who devoted a long , approving post Sunday to Cowen ’s article .
It also shares much with the no-pain , no - gain Austrian theories of the business cycle that Cowen , while not a true believer , treats with far more respect than most academic economists do .
More typical is Paul Krugman , who once charmingly described Austrian business cycle theory as being “ about as worthy of serious study as the phlogiston theory of fire . ”
Krugman was back on the topic Saturday with a blog post tearing into the idea that a downturn could ever be healthy .
I ’ve written about this debate before , in particular the fact that European economists do n’t seem so deathly afraid of recessions as their American counterparts .
I ’ve never really picked a side , though , and I still can’t .
It seems clear to me that smallish financial crises and concomitant recessions might actually be healthy , or at least necessary evils .
But it seems even clearer that really big financial crises cause so much collateral damage as to swamp any salutary effects .
And it ’s really hard for Fed policymakers to know ahead of time which sort of crisis they are facing .
For a little while , the late summer and early autumn of 1998 felt like the end of the financial world .
In retrospect , it looks like it would have been a much better time for a full - on financial panic than 2007 - 2008 has turned out to be .
That does n’t provide a very useful guidepost , though , for economic decisionmakers who do n’t possess the gift of clairvoyance .
It is very easy and convenient to operate the garage door by using a handy remote without leaving the vehicle .
But what happens when a garage door remote does not work ?
There are two possible solutions .
One is you can start parking your vehicle on the drive - through and use your garage to store other belongings .
The second is that you will start thinking about fixing the garage door remote .
Simple garage door remote problems can be fixed easily by DIY techniques but for the major problems , you need to consult with a pro .
But the question is here , who is the reliable garage door technician .
Once I had to repair my garage door , I searched at google for “ garage door repair near me ” and got various solutions .
Common garage door remote problems : Sometimes the problems of remote occur due to the low batteries .
If you have more than one remote , you will have to try both to make sure that the garage door is still in good working order .
The chances of having low batteries in all the remote at the same time are very little but not impossible .
If both the remotes cannot work you will have to try another technique .
Reprogram the remote :
There is a possibility that remote will not work due to the malfunctioned garage door opener .
In some situations , the logic board will delete the codes .
In these cases , you can solve the problems by just reprogramming the remote .
This solution is very fast and easy to do .
Some openers have a learning button placed with the antenna .
This button is assumed to be squared - shaped and bright - colored .
Once you pressed it , it will take about half a minute to reprogram the garage door opener .
To test the remote , push the button on the remote .
You should also see whether the opener is responding or not .
There is a possibility that light will be on but the opener is producing clicking sounds .
It indicates that the garage door opener has been reprogrammed successfully .
If nothing happens , you should replace the batteries as soon as possible .
Getting a new garage door remote :
Once the batteries have been changed .
The garage door ’s remote is supposed to work without any issue if it does not work and you do n’t have spare remote to try , it is the right time to get a new one .
Make sure that you are buying the same model number while shopping for a new remote .
Remember , not all the remotes are the same for all types of garage doors .
Otherwise , each time when you arrived home , all garage doors will open in your neighborhood .
And you will hire security to protect your garage door .
You can test a new remote without removing the packaging .
You can try it to check the functionality of the new remote .
The first thing to do is to reprogram the opener to solve the problems in an aforementioned way .
If it does not respond , it shows that the actual problem is the remote .
If not .
You will have to check the logic board .
If the garage door problems seem very difficult to manage , do n’t try to handle them on your own .
You just need technical expertise to fix your malfunctioned garage door .
NAIROBI , Kenya ( CNN ) --
Somalis are so desperate to survive that attacks on merchant shipping in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean will not stop , a pirate leader promises .
A French warship keeps guard over commerical vessels in the Gulf of Aden last week .
" The pirates are living between life and death , " said the pirate leader , identified by only one name , Boyah .
" Who can stop them ?
Americans and British all put together cannot do anything . "
The interview with the pirate was conducted in late August by journalists employed by the Somali news organization Garowe Online .
The complete interview was provided to CNN last week and provides a glimpse of why piracy has been so hard to control in the region .
Recorded on grainy video , the interview took place in the Somali port city of Eyl , now a center of pirate operations .
Eyl is on the east coast of Somalia in the autonomous territory of Puntland .
It is a largely lawless zone , considered extremely dangerous for Westerners to enter .
The Puntland government said two unidentified Western journalists were taken hostage Wednesday as they attempted to report on pirate activity .
Boyah said that the piracy began because traditional coastal fishing became difficult after foreign fishing trawlers depleted local fish stocks .
Traditional fishermen started attacking the trawlers until the trawler crews fought back with heavy weapons .
The fishermen then turned to softer targets .
Watch why fishermen turned to piracy »
" We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships , " Boyah said .
" For the past three years , we have not operated near the Somali coast .
We have operated at least 80 miles [ out ] , in international waters . "
When merchant shipping started avoiding the Somali coast , Boyah said , " we went to ships traveling other routes . "
Over the past year , the number of pirate attacks has increased dramatically .
The International Maritime Bureau cites more than 90 pirate attacks off East Africa so far in 2008 .
When attacks are successful , the hijacked ships are taken to Somali waters , where the ships and crew are held until a ransom is paid .
See how pirate attacks have increased »
Ships recently captured include a massive Saudi supertanker laden with crude oil valued at more than $ 100 million and a freighter carrying Russian - built tanks .
The hijackings have been profitable .
Kenya 's foreign minister , Moses Wetangula , estimates the pirates have been paid more than $ 150 million during the past year .
One pirate gang wants $ 2 million dollars to release a Yemeni freighter and crew seized last week .
Facing increasing disruptions through one of the busiest sea lanes in the world , several countries have sent warships to patrol the area .
There have been reports of skirmishes between pirates and naval forces , but the military presence does not concern pirate leader Boyah .
He boasts the pirates literally sail in a vast ocean beneath the radar of the warships .
Watch how piracy thrives off Somalia »
" No ship has the capability to see everything , " he said .
" A ship can see 80 miles or so [ on radar ] .
It can not see us at all .
No one can do anything about it . "
Boyah said it is unlikely the Puntland regional government would ever crack down on piracy because government officials are involved in financing the piracy and collect a cut of the ransoms .
" They motivate us .
It 's their money and their weapons , " Boyah said .
" Thirty percent belongs to them . "
The Puntland foreign minister , Ali Abdi Aware , denied government involvement with the pirates , including taking bribes .
The minister cited the arrest of six pirates earlier this year as evidence it is acting to stop piracy .
Pirate Boyah said he is unimpressed with the arrests by Puntland authorities .
" The pirates are at sea and Puntland does not approach them .
The pirates are on land and Puntland does not approach them , " Boyah said .
" They arrest some small people and tell the world that they captured pirates , but they are liars . "
While Boyah may have been outspoken about the government 's ineffectiveness , he did not allow interviewers to show his face , an indication that even in this lawless country , pirates still have some fear .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Three Singaporeans were jailed on Thursday after being charged with contempt of court for showing up at Singapore ’s Supreme Court wearing T - shirts depicting kangaroos in judges robes .
Isrizal Bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad Shafi’ie Syahmi Bin Sariman were sentenced to seven days ’ jail , while Tan Liang Joo John received 15 days imprisonment .
They were each ordered to pay S$ 5,000 ( $ 3,305 ) in costs .
Tan is the Assistant Secretary - General of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party , led by Chee Soon Juan .
The three had worn the T - shirts at a court hearing in May to determine the damages that Chee Soon Juan and his sister Chee Siok Chin were to pay after being found guilty of defaming Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and former leader Lee Kuan Yew .
Singapore ’s attorney - general said in bringing the case to court the trio had “ scandalized the Singapore judiciary . ”
Singapore bans gatherings and protests in all public areas without a permit except Speakers ’
Corner , the country ’s equivalent of the historic free - speech haven in London ’s Hyde Park .
There are signs that the scheme , reported in The Times , could run up against political opposition .
John Whittingdale , MP , chairman of the Culture Media and Sport Select Committee , said : " This is essentially a plan aimed at taking public money surreptitiously , because it take profits away from the BBC , and forces the licence fee to go up .
But I know Channel 4 is keen on it , because it thinks that it would be difficult for it to justify taking public money directly . "

Barack Obama has said repeatedly that he wants to shutter the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , that holds accused terrorists .
But aides cautioned Monday that the president - elect is n’t close to reaching a decision on how to do it .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Associated Press reported advisers to Obama were crafting a plan that would send accused terrorists to the U.S. and try some of them in a new , specially tailored court system rather than the military tribunals currently in use .
But Denis McDonough , a foreign policy adviser to Obama , said the nascent administration would wait until its national security and legal teams are in place before determining how to proceed .
“ President - elect Obama said throughout his campaign that the legal framework at Guantanamo has failed to successfully and swiftly prosecute terrorists , and he shares the broad bipartisan belief that Guantanamo should be closed , ” McDonough said in a statement .
“ There is absolutely no truth to reports that a decision has been made about how and where to try the detainees , and there is no process in place to make that decision until his national security and legal teams are assembled . ”

Another day of vote counting in Alaska today , although it wo n’t all be finished until at least Tuesday .
The trends and the places where votes remain to be counted look good for Begich :
More than half the absentee and questioned ballots still to be counted in Alaska ’s U.S. Senate race come from areas of the state that backed Democrat Mark Begich on Election Day .
That ’s not a good sign for Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens as he seeks to overcome Begich ’s 814 - vote lead when counting resumes today of just over 41,000 remaining ballots .
A Daily News analysis , based on data provided by the state Division of Elections , shows that 56 percent of those ballots come from districts that favored Begich on Nov. 4 .
The state will count about 40 percent of remaining ballots today and the rest early next week .
Democrats like the trend but are wary of expressing too much confidence in a state that for decades has proven a graveyard for their hopes .
“ I ’ll celebrate when I hear the words … ‘ and the winner is , ’ ” Begich said .
The Stevens campaign has fallen silent , offering no comment on the ballot count .
Republican Party of Alaska Chairman Randy Ruedrich said he ’s still a believer in a Stevens victory , and he argues it ’s not all about which districts the votes come from .
Vote totals will be updated here .
The last update was on Wednesday at 7:33 PM Alaska time .
Expect new numbers soon .
This could mean one more Democratic Senator .
And , Begich is actually a Democrat who calls himself a Democrat .
This shows even Ted Stevens is n’t infallible .
Most Democrats will be ecstatic , but , Joe Lieberman will probably be disappointed .
If Begich wins , it short circuits Sarah Palin ’s hopes of getting into the Senate soon .
Lieberman was a surrogate for Palin — even as she fomented negativity and accused Obama of “ palling around with terrorists . ”
Lieberman palled around with Palin .
That alone should disqualify him from the chairmanship of the Homeland Security Committee .
There must be consequences .

The pound has hit a new all - time low against the euro following further warnings that the UK economy is in worse shape than expected .
Sterling fell to € 1.1391 this morning and also hit a record low against a basket of other currencies .
The pound 's latest weakness came as economists warned Britain 's economy was deteriorating faster than expected and could suffer badly in 2009 .
The National Institute of Economic and Social Research warned today that the UK's gross domestic product shrank by 1 % in the three months to November , more than the official estimates .
Howard Archer , the chief European and UK economist at IHS Global Insight , said he expected to see a further " substantial contraction " in the first half of 2009 and that there was unlikely to be any growth until 2010 .
He is predicting a 2 % drop in GDP next year .
The weakness of the pound is a blow to the troubled UK retail sector because it increases the price of imported goods , as well as pushing up the cost of travelling abroad .
It should help exporters compete , but the manufacturing sector has been hit by a fall in demand worldwide .
With the Bank of England expected to keep cutting interest rates , sterling is expected to keep falling .
One trader predicted the pound would soon be worth just € 1.07 .
With little fanfare , Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts , ill with brain cancer , has given up his seat on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
We did n’t want to let the moment pass without taking note .
Mr. Kennedy has served in the Senate more than 45 years , building a vast and admirable record of legislative achievement , much of it as a member and past chairman of that committee .
First elected in 1962 , Mr. Kennedy started building his legacy very quickly .
He pushed for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and led the monumental reform of the immigration system in 1965 , the effects of which are still being felt today .
He has been a progressive stalwart over the decades on civil rights , gender equality , gun control and affirmative action .
He led the fight to raise the minimum wage and to lower the voting age to 18 .
He has fought against bad judicial appointments and the death penalty .
He has defended immigrants , refugees , people with disabilities and the poor .
Any examination of Mr. Kennedy ’s accomplishments would be both exhausting ( a 3,000 - word timeline on his Web site hits just the high points ) and premature — he is still chasing his biggest goals .
His absence from the Judiciary Committee is a huge blow to supporters of immigration reform , one of his signature issues .
There is , however , consolation in knowing that Mr. Kennedy gave up his Judiciary seat in order to focus his time and energy next year on pushing for universal health care , a legislative grail that has eluded him for decades .
The Secrets in Your Stuff Psychologist says he can predict personality by snooping in a home or office .
July 1 , 2008  -- Sam Gosling is a distinguished psychologist who employs an unusual technique to probe personalities .
He likes to snoop , and not just in your medicine cabinet .
Gosling wants to go through all your stuff -- even sit in your bathtub -- to find out what 's going on in your head .
His new book , " Snoop , " is based on the theory that sometimes going through a person 's belongings can provide insight into personality .
" A snooper does what we all do in looking around people 's places , " Gosling said .
" I think we all do it .
It 's a very natural thing to do , but really as a snooper you are trying to bring an understanding of the psychology behind it , what drives the placement of objects . "
The first thing Gosling does is sit down in a space and look around , " giving the salient items time to fade away a bit , and the broader themes to come out . "
" Nightline " decided to test Gosling at the office of his friend and colleague , John Jost , at New York University .
The fellow psychologist did n't mind Gosling 's snooping and said that while he tidied up his office beforehand , he did n't do any major organizing .
Gosling went through drawers , examined pictures , checked the status of office supplies and analyzed the position of Jost 's desk -- all providing clues to Jost 's personality .
The goal , Gosling said , is to " look at the big picture .
And look for themes .
Because any single item could be misleading .
There could be something here that really does n't reflect what the occupant is like .
It 's just there because it's for a teaching demonstration , or a gift for somebody else , or things that are n't really important , or somebody else left it there . "
He wo n't make a judgment about Jost solely based on the fact that he has a book in his office called " Why Men Rebel . "
" It should be one piece of the puzzle , " he said .
" It could reflect many different things , you know ?
There are many different reasons you might have that .
So we have to try to narrow down the likely reasons you have that . "
Gosling noted that Jost 's office is " pretty organized , " and said that he can tell a lot from someone 's music collection .
Jost has a lot of classic rock .
" So people who like rock , they tend to be higher on openness , " Gosling said .
" And also people who like classical ... and jazz , actually . "
On the other hand , he also said that " people who like rock tend to be lower on conscientiousness , so looking at this , I 'd have to combine that with my other rating saying that he was higher on conscientiousness .
So it 's all a puzzle , you 're always combining bits of information here . "
The contents of someone 's office can even indicate how he might vote , according to Gosling , who said that Jost 's openness trait would align him with " people who vote for liberal candidates . "
And indeed , Jost said he is a liberal and is planning to vote for Barack Obama .
" I think Sam is an excellent personality psychologist and a very perceptive person , " Jost said .
" And I think he would get at least an A- , maybe an A . "
Gosling also visited Jamie Napier , a graduate student at NYU .
He described the office she shares with two colleagues as having a " sort of strong , post - feminist kind of strong and sexy look .
...
Competent , but not at the expense of being , you know , glamorous and feminine . "
An empty wine bottle , some hair glitter , mail from 2006 , a few razors in a drawer -- all became part of Gosling 's evaluation .
" She 's sort of disorganized in many ways .
She has broad interests .
I would say that she is OK with some level of glamour going on here , " he said .
" And I think that social relationships are important to her .
She 's not a loner . "
The office was decorated with Christmas tree lights , which Gosling said could be an attempt to brighten up a constrained space with no windows .
" People who decorate places and people who try to create a stimulating place tend to be more extroverted , " he said .
Pictures of Napier 's dogs indicate that " she 's not completely cutting off her personal life from her workplace .
Some people do n't have any evidence of [ their personal life ] , they really keep those things very strict , so she more integrates her work and her home self . "
Gosling evaluated Napier as " someone who 's sort of careless , like scatterbrained . "
Napier agrees that she 's disorganized .
" Yes , I am , I know I am , " she said .
" I tend not to throw things away much . "
And she agreed that she cares about her social relationships , hence the empty wine bottle .
" I have two other officemates , and we 'll have a glass of wine before we go out , or something like that , " she said .
And as for Napier 's political leanings , Gosling said that people who are " broadminded and messy " are usually liberal voters , and he 's right when it comes to Napier .
Snooping can be useful in the office , Gosling said .
" If I really wanted to know who I should promote or who I should n't promote , or who would be best suited for a certain job , I should be making that decision on the basis of what people are really like , not how they appear or how they say they are , " he said .
" And to the extent that the snooping helps me get a more accurate impression , it 's justified . "
So should bosses be walking around looking at their employees ' work spaces ?
" I think if they want to know both what people are like , but also how people want to be seen , " he said .
" Even if people want to be seen how they actually are n't , it 's still useful to know that that 's what they want . "
We thought Gosling might be a little too at home at the psychology office at NYU , so we decided to test his snooping skills at the home of ABC News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi .
It was n't hard for him to discover that she is very organized .
" This is great .
Unbelievable , " he said .
" Glasses all lined up .
Amazing .
Tape measures right next to each other in the tape measure spot .
Office supplies labeled . "
" This is almost an open - and - shut case , I mean , you do n't really need to look for more stuff .
Everything is in its place , it 's just marvelous , " he said .
" Things are not left to chance here .
This could n't be further from Jamie 's response .
" You are clearly a very effective person , you get things done , things are put away , " he said .
Gosling said snooping can be more accurate than talking to someone , in many cases .
The strongest cues come when a space is distinctive , and Gosling said the same rules apply to work spaces and living spaces .
" If you can think of objects , regardless of where they are , be it offices , bedrooms , refrigerators , medicine cabinet , you can apply those principles regardless of where you go , " he said .
" Of course the specific objects vary across these domains , but you can think about these in the same system . "
If he had only 15 minutes to snoop in a home , Gosling would start in the living room ( the public space ) and then move to the private spaces , like a bedroom or office .
" What I really like to do is look at the books that are out for people to see -- ' Look at my highbrow interesting things ' -- and compare them to ones in the private places , " he said .
" I 'm quite conscious about thinking when am I in the place that is for others to see , when am I in the private space ... and that can even be within a room , " he said .
" So when I go to an office , for example , I look at the things that are facing you as a visitor and then crawl underneath the desk , behind and see if that 's where the stuff is being hidden . "
And if you 've been snooping in your neighbor 's medicine cabinet , you might be surprised to learn that is n't the best place to start .
" Medicine cabinets are surprisingly uninformative because there 's such a standard vocabulary of items within that , " he said .
" Same thing goes for the refrigerator .
That 's often thought to be very revealing , but they do n't vary that much . "
And you should n't feel guilty about snooping , because you 're not the only one .
" I think nearly everybody snoops to some extent , " he said .
" If you do n't know why they 're called Danger Dogs then you 've never had one , " says sunnyd1225 on her photo of a tray of Danger Dogs , bacon - wrapped hot dogs topped with sautéed onions and peppers .
The knowledge of its composition plus the sight of the glistening pool of fat in the tray makes the " danger " part pretty clear .
Yet the more I think about it , the more I want one .

Race Summary
In the seat once held by Paul Wellstone , Norm Coleman faces a well - financed and well - known candidate .
Democrat Al Franken , the former Saturday Night Live writer and actor , has been ramping up to run for a few years now .
After Democrat Amy Klobuchar defeated Republican Congressman Mark Kennedy in the 2006 race for Minnesota\ 's other Senate seat , Coleman\ 's vulnerability became apparent , and he immediately began distancing himself from the unpopular Bush administration .
Coleman , the former Demcratic mayor of St. Paul , is well - known across the state and favored to hold his seat , despite the apparent national Democratic tide and Minnesotans\ ' penchant for electing unconventional candidates .
Still , Franken\ 's fundraising accumen will allow him to defend and attack Coleman through the airwaves , and as long as the state can get past any transgressions in his former life as a satirist , a national anti-GOP mood could be enough to send Franken to Washington .

House Minority Leader John A. Boehner is working to oust Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus and Alaska Rep. Don Young from their posts as the top Republicans on the Financial Services and Natural Resources committees .
Power play : Boehner 's revenge
In his latest effort to tighten his grip on the Republican Conference , House Minority Leader John A. Boehner is working to oust Alabama Rep. Spencer Bachus and Alaska Rep . Don Young from their posts as the top Republicans on the Financial Services and Natural Resources committees .
Boehner has arranged for “ no confidence ” votes on Bachus and Young to be taken by the Republican Steering Committee , which makes recommendations on committee assignments to the full GOP Conference .
Advertisement
The votes could come as early as Wednesday .
Young is expected to lose his spot , paving the way for a different Republican to take his place as the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee .
Bachus ’ fate on Financial Services is unclear , but Boehner has told both Bachus and Young that he would oppose any effort to keep them on as ranking members of their committees , GOP insiders say .
Reps . David Dreier ( R - Calif . ) and Steven C. LaTourette ( R - Ohio ) have been mentioned as potential replacements for Bachus on Financial Services , while Reps. Elton Gallegly ( R - Calif . ) and Doc Hastings ( R - Wash . ) are favored candidates to succeed the irascible Young .
Neither Bachus ’ office nor Young ’s office had any comment at press time .
Boehner ’s office declined to discuss internal Republican Conference actions .
In the aftermath of the November elections , there were rumors that Boehner would face a challenge for his leadership post .
He did n’t , and Reps. Roy Blunt ( R - Mo. ) and Adam Putnam ( R - Fla . ) were instead forced out from their posts as minority whip and Republican Conference chairman , respectively .
Reps. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) and Mike Pence ( R - Ind . ) replaced them in the GOP leadership .
But Boehner still seems to have scores to settle with those who opposed him during the 110th Congress .
The Ohio Republican forced out Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee , replacing him with Texas Rep. Pete Sessions , a close ally .
He then installed Johnny DeStefano , his political director , as deputy executive director of the campaign committee , meaning Boehner will have his own independent channel into the National Republican Congressional Committee .
Now he ’s taken aim at Bachus and Young .
Bachus was widely criticized by House Republicans for his involvement in early negotiations over the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout package in late September .
In what amounted to a public comeuppance , Boehner eventually had Blunt replace Bachus at the negotiating table .
But a senior GOP staffer , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said the problem with Bachus is bigger than that .
“ He ’s proven to be quite inept as [ ranking member ] on that committee , ” the staffer said .
Young has been embroiled in the same federal corruption probe in Alaska that toppled Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - Alaska ) , and the veteran lawmaker has been forced to shell out more than $ 1 million to lawyers to represent him during the investigation .
Young has denied any wrongdoing , but having him around — especially now that indicted Rep. William Jefferson ( D - La. ) has been defeated — would make it harder for Republicans to hit Democrats for keeping embattled Rep. Charles B. Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) on as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee .
“ Young has got to go , ” claimed another GOP insider .
“ It ’s hard for us to go after Charlie Rangel if Don Young is there . ”
Young is also seen as an “ old school ” politician more interested in winning pork projects than enacting the reform agenda that many Republicans believe the party needs to embrace in order to rebound from two consecutive election defeats .
While Boehner , like some other Republicans , has pushed for earmark reform , Young ’s penchant for earmarking federal dollars has led to a Justice Department probe .
The Alaska Republican earmarked $ 10 million for the Coconut Road interchange in Fort Myers , Fla. , while he was chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee back in 2005 .
Young reportedly had language added to a highway bill after the legislation was approved by both the House and the Senate .
A developer who favored the project steered more than $ 40,000 in campaign contributions to Young ’s reelection race .

Environmental educator Noam Dolgin knows that adding more kids to the planet is a no - no for nature .
So when the 32 - year - old East Vancouverite got engaged last month on a bike trip in Israel , he was still waffling on his own reproductive future .
On the one hand , living in a car - centred , disposable - everything society means that bearing a child can be a small environmental disaster .
On the other hand , as a Jewish man , there ’s pressure to maintain the culture .
What ’s a good planetary citizen to do ?
“ There are still many Jews who believe we must repopulate after the Holocaust and those who believe we have a basic religious imperative to have children , ” Dolgin told the Georgia Straight in a phone interview .
“ The question in my life is between rearing children and teaching children . ” ¦I believe in Jewish continuity , but does that necessarily mean I need to bear that child ? ”
This is n’t familiar ground in Dolgin ’s work .
Most environmentalists decide when they ’re young not to have kids , he noted , and then change their mind as the biological clock ticks on .
So he ’s frustrated that the movement wo n’t deal with the big - ticket lifestyle changes needed to avoid a climate apocalypse .
On Christmas , the 76.6 percent of Canadians who identify as Christian , according to Statistics Canada , celebrate a birth that supposedly happened two millennia ago .
But when each Canadian is responsible for , on average , 1,600 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions during their life , according to UBC professor William Rees , are babies worth celebrating ?
Canadian demographer David Foot would n’t answer that question .
Though the Straight asked him repeatedly , he would only giggle and refuse .
“ Population growth is probably the biggest environmental issue in the world , ” Foot said from his office at the University of Toronto , where he teaches economics .
He said that most governments , with the exception of China ’s , wo n’t touch it as a “ green ” issue because “ nobody wants to get into the bedrooms of the nation .
Pierre Trudeau summed it up very well .
It conflicts with religious themes ; it contrasts with ethnicity .
No political party wants to get involved with that . ”
Foot argues that population is a global issue rather than a nationalist issue .
In other words , it does n’t matter if Canada ’s women are bearing , on average , 1.5 children , well below the “ replacement rate ” of 2.1 , while women in Niger bear 7.1 , according to the World Fertility Patterns 2007 report by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs ( see box ) .
What matters , said Foot , is the global rate of 2.6 — enough to propel the world ’s population 40 percent higher by 2050 to a scary 9.5 billion .
That rise could lead to mass unemployment and economic chaos , Foot noted , as is happening in Pakistan .
Or , he said , it could result in even faster economic growth , “ which creates even more demands on resources in the world ” .
The David Suzuki Foundation does n’t comment on population issues , according to communications coordinator Siri Kramps .
On-line , its December 2008 “ nature challenge ” checklist includes cutting down on wrapping paper but not reconsidering reproduction .
Bruce Cox , executive director of Greenpeace Canada , explained why population growth is not a top priority for his environmental group .
“ Look at the time line on urgency , ” he told the Straight .
“ Controlling overpopulation is a long - term solution that will take one or more generations to turn it around .
We are literally counting days on climate change . ”
Beth Cruise , the executive director of the Canadian Earth Institute , told the Straight she ’s “ not surprised it ’s not being talked about by [ most ] environmental groups . ”
¦I think it ’s a core issue at the very heart of being a human . ”
The institute , which promotes environmental change by involving citizens in small group discussions , does address population issues , she said .
But the answer is n’t obvious .
“ Everyone is out buying low - energy light bulbs , ” Cruise said .
“ But we are actually going to have to change our standard of living . ”
Fertility - rate drop is a global phenomenon
> In the 30 years from 1975 to 2005 , the global fertility rate — the average number of children each woman has — dropped from 4.5 to 2.6 .
> Even in least - developed countries , the rate dropped from 6.6 to 5.0 .
> During that period , Canada ’s rate fell from 2.3 to 1.5 .
> In 1975 , 11 countries had fertility rates that were below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman .
> In 2005 , 69 countries were below the replacement rate .
> China ’s fertility rate dropped from 5.7 to 1.4 over those 30 years .
> India ’s rate dropped from 4.9 to 2.8 children per woman .
> The world ’s highest 2005 fertility rates were in Africa : Niger ( 7.1 ) , Angola ( 6.9 ) , and Guinea - Bissau ( 6.8 ) .
> The world ’s lowest 2005 fertility rates were in Asia : Macao ( 0.8 ) , Hong Kong ( 1 ) , and Korea ( 1.2 ) .
> Several European countries also had fertility rates of 1.2 .
> In 2008 , Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed the 1968 encyclical letter prohibiting Catholics from using artificial birth control .

Guess who won Joe the Plumber ’s vote .
Not Joe the symbol and unlicensed tax - dodger coming soon to a garage sale near you , but real people who make about $ 42,000 a year , the median income for plumbers and pipefitters .
Barack Obama carried hard - working Americans of that income stripe by 10 points , according to exit polls .
And the only voters who were told directly that their taxes would go up under a new Democratic president ?
Obama took the rich as well , winning by six points that small sliver of the electorate that makes more than $ 200,000 year .
Soak ’em .
As for the Bradley effect , there was none .
Perhaps a Reverse Bradley – in which more people actually voted for the black guy than they told pollsters .
Witness Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan , three prime states where working - class whites were supposed to be saving their true racial feelings for the privacy of the voting booth .
Obama won Michigan by 16 points , Pennsylvania by 11 and Ohio by four .
In each case , the vote was well above the election eve average of all polls .
Hillary Clinton voters came home .
Ditto Reagan Democrats .
Did I mention that Obama won the Catholic vote — and Scranton , the iconic blue - collar town ?
Overall , the pollsters mostly got it right — and a tip of the hat to Scott Rasmussen for nailing the popular vote , 52 percent to 46 , and to my friend Johnny Verhovek , age 15 , for predicting the exact number of electoral votes in my local betting pool .
In my younger and more vulnerable years , my father gave me some advice on the question of what to do when your dreams come true : do n’t tell anyone .
Conversely , what do we do when our darkest fears , our hardened conventional wisdom and our historic homilies are all found to be hooey ?
Shout it from the rooftops .
This was a transformative election , but not because there was some big lurch to the left or an unequivocal rejection of the right .
The culture is confused , as always .
Gay marriage lost in liberal California , in Florida and Arizona .
But abortion restrictions were voted down in conservative South Dakota .
And 73 percent of voters in Colorado disagreed with a long - held Republican contention that human life begins at conception .
This was the first real 21st - century election — rejecting the incompetence of the Bush years , the race - baiting of Karl Rove ’s majority strategy and the poison of media - driven wedge politics .
As a nation , we rejoin the world community .
As a sustaining narrative , we found our story again .
Obama ’s ascendancy is likely to have the ironic effect of ending affirmative action , and the old identity politics .
He became only the second Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to win more than 51 percent of the popular vote not because he ’s black , but because he is smarter , with better ideas , and showed leadership under fire .
This was a victory for meritocracy .
If affirmative action survives , it will be more class - based , as Obama suggested on the campaign trail .
In losing the urban vote and the suburbs as well , the Republican party is now a shrinking regional party of older white males , represented in the media by talk - radio kooks and far - right women dressed in high couture to sell low - culture friction .
Obama won the New South of Virginia , Florida and perhaps North Carolina .
He flipped three states in the New West , Colorado , Nevada and New Mexico .
He won the fastest - growing ethnic group , Latinos , by better than a 2 - 1 margin .
As for the young , nobody since modern polling of age groups began has racked up a better percentage of the 18 - to 29 - year - old vote .
Obama won 66 percent of the kids .
And sure , the youth vote is only 18 percent of the total electorate , but that ’s still a bigger slice than those over 65 years of age ( one of the few McCain cohorts ) .
See the trend : new , emerging , growing , tomorrow , young .
Dormant for the darkest years of the Bush presidency , the oldest strain of American DNA is evident again .
For Republicans , the trouble is deep and spreading .
They nearly lost Montana , Missouri and the most populous county in Idaho , a state where a Democrat was just elected to Congress .
When this kind of thing happens in Idaho , it ’s time to start reading up on the Whig party for history lessons .
Even Texas tightened from four years ago .
But do 23 percent of Texans really think Obama is a Muslim , as a recent poll found ?
If reality indeed has no home on the Texas plains , it ’s the perfect place for Bush to retire .
One of the better lines in Obama ’s election night speech was a slap to the rejectionist politics of Bush .
Rove always insisted a president only needed 50 percent plus one to win .
And Bush governed that way , permanently angering half the population .
On Tuesday night , Obama reached out to the other half .
For those who did not vote for him , he said , “ I will be your president , too . ”
What an idea — simple and obvious .
But like so much American common sense , it ’s been missing for too long .
The only rings I 've ever liked are nipple rings , The Lord of the Rings , and Ringo Starr .
I love these silver Lego rings , though .
You can customize them putting any brick you want on top .

As you can see in the gallery , you can use any Lego brick or piece you want to change their appearance .
They come in three different models , with one ( $ 140 ) , two ( $ 151 ) and four studs ( $ 165 ) .
Ah , if I only knew when I asked the two ex-wives to marry me .

It has been a tough year for online video portal Joost , and things are n't likely to improve .
The company launched last year with an innovative software client and built a decent catalog that included mainstream content .
But now , Joost has announced that its less - capable website will be the only place to enjoy the company 's content .
As of December 19 , Joost 's Windows and Mac software clients will cease to work , and instead will invite users to visit the company 's site if they want to get access to its catalog of over 46,000 music videos , TV shows , movies , and short films .
A recently release iPhone client will apparently continue to work .
Starting with its private beta launch in January 2007 , Joost offered a unique spin on the video experience by allowing users to add various widgets and chat in real - time while watching mainstream programming , which included content from Comedy Central , CBS , and CNN .
In October , Joost announced a revamped Joost.com website , effectively writing an epitaph for the client software .
Competition in the online video market has exploded in recent years , and Joost 's catalog was eventually eclipsed by efforts like the NBC / Fox joint venture Hulu and its many competitors .
Everyone from user - generated content king YouTube to individual network sites like ABC.com are getting into the mainstream online video business — soon even TV.com will be joining them .
Joost has n't thrown in the towel yet , but the company needs to do something to catch the public 's attention in an increasingly crowded market .
The company may have an easier time making content deals now that its P2P - based software client is getting phased out , but that comes at a significant cost .
The client 's added value — mini-applications and a real - time community — were arguably the service 's defining features .
One of Hulu 's weakest areas is its lack of community , but TV.com is planning on filling that gap through its upcoming redesign , which will also mark the availability of mainstream content .
If Joost wants to survive its rebirth as a web - based video portal , re-envisioning these features — and doing so ahead of the competition — will probably be one key to weathering the storm .
JOURNALISTS sometimes joke that the ideal headline for a science story would be something like “ Black holes cure cancer ” .
Sadly , it will never happen .
“ Nanotechnology cures cancer ” , though , is a pretty good runner - up , and that might just turn out to be true .
In fact , nanoparticles ( ie , objects whose dimensions are measured in nanometres , or billionths of a metre ) have been used to treat cancer for some time .
But these treatments are mainly clever ways of packaging existing drugs , rather than truly novel therapies .
For instance , Doxil , a medicine used to treat ovarian cancer , is wrapped up in naturally occurring fatty bubbles called liposomes .
Taxol , a common breast - cancer drug , is similarly packaged with naturally occurring blood proteins in a product called Abraxane .
In both , the packaging aids the delivery of the drug and reduces its toxic side - effects .
Now , however , a second generation of nanoparticles has entered clinical trials .
Some are so good at hiding their contents away until they are needed that the treatments do not merely reduce side - effects ; they actually allow what would otherwise be lethal poisons to be supplied to the tumour and the tumour only .
Others do not depend on drugs at all .
Instead , they act as beacons for the delivery of doses of energy that destroy cancer cells physically , rather than chemically .
One example of this second approach comes from Jennifer West 's laboratory at Rice University in Houston , Texas .
Building on work by her colleague Naomi Halas , Dr West has constructed gold “ nanoshells ” that either absorb light or scatter it , depending on their design .
The shells are built on a core of silica whose shape can be adjusted to produce the desired effect .
Dr
West then paints a layer of gold , 15 to 20 nanometres thick , over the silica core .
Shell shock
The first nanoshells made by Dr West are designed to absorb infra-red light .
When they do so , they heat up .
And when they heat up , so the theory goes , they will cauterise any nearby cancer cells .
To get them to the cancer , you whip up a batch of , say , 80 trillion of them and inject it into the patient 's bloodstream .
The particles end up in the tumour , rather than in healthy tissue , because tumours have abnormal blood capillaries .
The pores in these vessels are larger than those in healthy tissues .
Make your nanoshells the right size , then , and they can pass through the capillary pores and lodge in a tumour , but not in a normal organ .
Twelve to 36 hours later , when enough shells have accumulated , you insert an optical fibre into the tumour , and deliver an appropriate blast of infra-red .
That heats the particles up and cooks the tumour .
This procedure , known as photothermal ablation , has undergone six years of animal testing .
The results are encouraging .
In mice , tumours disappeared in 10 - 14 days and the animals remained cancer - free thereafter .
Dogs , too , gave “ excellent data ” according to Donald Payne , the boss of Nanospectra Biosciences , Dr West 's commercial partner , although he is cagey about the details , pending publication .
Nanospectra is , however , now conducting trials at three medical centres in Texas on people with head and neck cancers .
One advantage of photothermal ablation is the lack of a chemical agent .
That means no toxicity .
Of course , safety questions about the particles themselves remain , but Dr West and Dr Payne both say they have seen no signs of harmful symptoms .
Surplus particles are cleared away by the liver , spleen and lymphatic system , or are mistaken for bacteria and eaten by macrophages , one of the types of white cell in the bloodstream .
Though they may remain in those macrophages for a long time , Dr West says that this longevity does not seem to cause problems .
Nor is photothermal ablation the only way of heat - treating cancer cells .
MagForce Nanotechnologies , based in Berlin , has conducted three clinical trials of anti-cancer nanoparticles made from iron oxide and is now running another five .
These particles are injected directly into the target tumour , rather than relying on the leaky walls of tumour capillaries to get them to the right place .
Once there , they can be heated using alternating magnetic fields that are easily tolerated by patients .
According to Andreas Jordan , the firm 's chief scientist , this procedure has no side - effects and shows particular promise against glioblastomas , a deadly type of brain cancer , and against prostate cancer .
Other researchers on nanoparticles , though , prefer to put their faith in drugs .
CytImmune Sciences of Rockville , Maryland , has just begun a study of the efficacy of Aurimune , a solid - gold nanoparticle that carries a dose of tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) , a substance that has a natural tendency to stick to gold .
It is also a substance hitherto regarded as too toxic for people to tolerate .
It gets its name because it attacks the blood capillaries that feed a tumour .
It cannot , however , distinguish between the capillaries in a tumour and those elsewhere .
With natural TNF that does not matter , since the substance is produced only in the tumour itself .
But if you inject TNF directly into a patient 's bloodstream he will suffer massive organ failure brought on by a precipitous fall in his blood pressure .
What 's your poison ?
The trick , then , is to concentrate the TNF in the tumour .
That can be done surgically , by a procedure known as isolated limb perfusion .
But this is complicated , and the treatment works only in about three - quarters of cases .
CytImmune hopes that its method will be simpler .
It intends to use Aurimune as a way of delivering TNF to the tumour site , and only to the tumour site , by employing the “ leaky wall ” effect to get the particles to the right place .
According to Lawrence Tamarkin , CytImmune 's boss , when Aurimune was run through safety trials it was able to deliver doses of TNF that were as high or higher than those which isolated limb perfusion could manage , and without serious side - effects .
The only side - effect that has been noted so far is a transient fever that can be treated with over - the - counter medicines .
Calando Pharmaceuticals , of Pasadena , California , is also packing nanoparticles with a substance previously too dangerous to use .
In this case the drug is called camptothecin , and the nanoparticle is made from a strand of sugar molecules .
As the camptothecin is attached to the sugar molecules , the strand folds up into a sphere , hiding the drug inside as a clenched fist might hide a pea .
The result , called Cyclosert by the firm , is being tested to see if it can prevent the progression of ovarian cancer .
Some 150 patients who have completed standard chemotherapy for this disease , which would normally then be followed by a period of what is known as “ watchful waiting ” , will , instead , be given Cyclosert .
Since ovarian cancer often recurs , that will , by dint of comparison with a control group who undergo watchful waiting alone , allow the researchers to assess whether Cyclosert reduces recurrence .
Like Nanospectra and CytImmune , Calando relies on the leaky walls of tumour capillaries to deliver its products .
But nanoparticle therapies of the generation after that may be smarter .
Dr West has now started attaching antibodies to her gold nanoshells .
Since antibodies have specific affinities to particular proteins , any nanoshells covered in antibodies to those proteins found almost exclusively on the surfaces of tumour cells will stick to those cells and no others .
That way , when the light is applied , only the unhealthy cells should be killed .
Moreover , Dr West is also working on particles that both scatter and absorb light .
These would reveal the extent of any tumour if illuminated with a low - power beam .
That would tell surgeons where to point a high - powered killing beam so that no cancerous tissue was missed .
It may , of course , all come to nothing .
The war on cancer is being pursued on many fronts , and this is just one of them .
But the idea looks promising because it is based on a general principle rather than a specific practice .
This means that if one particular version fails , others might still succeed .
Cynicism aside , that fact alone is worth the headline .
All of the wonderful things I can't say to my students .

The investing world is full of cryptic words .
Credit default swaps .
Seasonal adjustments .
Collateralized debt obligations .
But for the average American they are interested in how the economic crisis will impact them on a personal level .
How does the actions of Wall Street impact their daily lives .
It is my belief that by the end of next year , most people will feel this recession as an economic depression .
Many have argued that this housing bubble only started recently but I have argued that this foundation started way back in 1979 .
We hear a lot of these words being thrown around with little data to back up any predictions .
So first , let us define what we will measure as a depression .
For our rubric , we will use the U - 6 broad measure of unemployment which is a wider and broader measure of the employment picture .
First let us look at the current regular measure of unemployment versus the U -6 :
I was encourage to see that the New York Times reported this nuance in one of their latest articles .
The difference between 6.7 % and 12.5 % is large .
So what does U - 6 include that U - 3 does n’t ?
( a) Marginally attached workers who currently are neither working nor looking for work but indicate that they want and are available for a job and have looked for work sometime in the past .
( b) Persons employed part - time for economic reasons but want full - time work .
( c) Discouraged works who are a subset of marginally attached .
These folks have essentially given up looking for work because of the job market .
I think most of us would venture to say those are groups to consider as unemployed .
So our benchmark for depression level is 19 % via U - 6 .
During the Great Depression the rate hovered around this rate for many years :
And it is very possible we will see 19 % next year because the rate is now accelerating .
Just take a look how quickly the U - 6 measure jumped up in one year :
The rate has jumped from 8.4 % to 12.5 % in one year , an increase of 48 % .
If we use only this rate and apply it to next year , the rate by next November will be 18.6 % and we believe the rate will only accelerate .
Why ?
If you look at the early part of the year , job losses started out slowly and then picked up speed toward the end :
Take a look at the above chart .
For the first 8 months of the year 655,000 jobs were lost .
In the last 3 months alone over 1.2 million jobs have been lost .
This is usually what happens with recessions .
Even if you take a look at the mild recession in 2001 you will see how many consecutive months we had job losses and how quickly they escalated and stayed high .
So for our measure , we will say that 19 % via the U - 6 measure will qualify as a minor depression .
Let us now look at the 10 reasons why this recession will turn into a minor depression :
Reason # 1 – Retail Sales
The life blood of our economy is consumption .
GDP estimates put consumption at over 70 % of our fuel running our economy .
That is why all eyes are on the shopping malls during this holiday season ( or people trying to get lucky on bingo ) .
It is one last hurrah before reality sets in during 2009 .
Early indicators are not looking good .
Even if we look at the recent media layoffs and the Tribune Co. bankruptcy , much of this is due to imploding advertising revenues .
Why have ad revenues dropped ?
Because companies are cutting back their marketing budgets .
Why ?
Because they are losing revenue .
Why ?
Because people are not spending .
It is a rather vicious circle that does n’t show signs of improvement .
Much of our employment sector is predicated on high consumption so this is a recipe for further job losses .
Reason # 2 – Motor Vehicle Sales
It should be rather apparent that auto sales are important to the United States .
That is why the above chart is so startling .
Across the board auto sales are falling .
People bought cars on financing and the credit markets are frozen .
It is n’t like people had the money to buy a car especially if you were making $ 46,000 a year like 50 % of the country .
Plus , many people have bought new cars that simply last longer with better technology .
It then becomes a want and not a need to buy or lease a new car .
Even if the big 3 get some help sales are still going to continue to drop and even with a helping hand , thousands will be laid off .
The peak buying cycle is simply gone .
Reason # 3 – Consumer Sentiment
A certain part of the market is driven by consumer sentiment .
I would argue that the reality of the economy is driving consumer sentiment instead of a psychological belief .
However , sentiment does play a major role .
If you are worried about losing your job you probably wo n’t buy a new home or car until things settle down .
Well things wo n’t settle down until people start buying .
You can see the Catch - 22 here .
Yet our massive debt load has caused globally for $ 50 trillion in wealth to be destroyed in the matter of one year .
That will do a number on your sentiment .
Expect consumer sentiment to stay low for the near future thus fueling more cautious spending behavior .
Reason # 4 – Saving More
People in tough economic times save money or at least try to .
This is no exception .
It is n’t like people are saving tons of money but keep in mind a dollar you save is a dollar you do n’t spend .
It was stunning that in 2005 we had a radically low savings rate that was under zero .
We were borrowing to pay for future goods and services .
That is now over .
Americans will be more cautious and many will start saving more simply by force .
If you want something you may need to save a few months in a bank account .
That is also why this number is up a bit .
Reason # 5 – Hours Worked
As you can see from the above chart the hours worked has fallen significantly .
Well you need money to spend .
If you are not working as much , you have less money to spend thus fueling the above contraction in retail sales even further .
This will only accelerate since we are deleveraging the current economy from the finance , insurance , and real estate sectors .
Reason # 6 – Household Debt Burden
It is amazing that after all the debt destruction and deflation , that the household debt burden is still at record highs .
This will only add to the lack of spending .
Keep in mind we have a race to the bottom here .
For example , a mortgage defaults and the balance is no longer a viable indicator of the value of the home .
It sells for $ 100,000 less .
That money was destroyed .
Yet for the borrower that just lost the home , they have lost an asset from their balance sheet .
Their debt burden may have gone away in this sense but the burden was shifted to the lender .
Either way , we ’ll be seeing a lot of this deleveraging in the next few months .
It is expected that 2009 will have the highest number of foreclosures in history and that says a lot given that 2008 will see over 3,000,000 foreclosure filings nationwide .
Reason # 7 – Short - term Interest Rates
There is a global panic .
The above chart shows this .
Short - term treasuries are returning a near zero percent rate .
You may ask why would anyone put their money into a security with such a low return .
Simple .
Panic and security .
That is what the interest rate markets tell us .
The stock market is all over the map but as I have said in detail , market volatility is sign of a sick and desperate market , not a sign of a healthy and vibrant economy .
So until we see the credit markets improving , we can rest assured that people will be hoarding money and not lending it out .
Reason # 8 – Double Stock Bubbles
We went from the technology bubble right into the real estate bubble .
2 decades and 2 bubbles .
I ’m not sure if the global financial system has it in itself to go for a third .
There is talks about certain industries like green energy seeing a bubble but the incentive may be lost for many now that oil is around $ 40 a barrel .
We need it for other reasons but just like the 1970s oil crisis , once the scare is gone people go back to their daily routine .
The stock markets are still off and have still seen $ 32 trillion in global wealth disappear .
Even after this recent run-up , they are still down for the year significantly .
Reason # 9 – Account Balance
No country can go on forever spending more than it makes .
We have been doing that since 1994 .
We now have a trade imbalance of over $ 733 billion .
That is not good .
No dominant society will stay that way for the long - term .
We send our treasuries abroad and we consume locally .
That makes our trading partners wealthier while we get instant gratification .
And here is the irony .
We as a nation need to correct this for long - term sustainability or we are doomed .
Yet if we do address this by cutting back , retail will get hammered and our economy will suffer in the short - term .
That is why we are at the tipping point where hard decisions will need to be made .
Reason # 10 – Commodities Falling
Commodity prices have been in a near free fall .
Oil is now trading at near $ 40 a barrel when just a few months ago it was at $ 147 a barrel .
This has added a few hundred dollars each month into the wallets of most Americans .
This would be interpreted as good in most circumstances but the only reasons we are seeing a crash in commodities is because of demand destruction and deleveraging .
Americans are going to need every penny that goes back into their wallets .
And keep in mind globally many countries rely on oil for revenues and many estimates state that $ 50 a barrel is the breakeven point for many countries .
In addition domestically , many producers need the higher price to be viable so if it stays here for awhile , expect job losses in these industries .
That is the current predicament .
It is rather apparent after looking at the above 10 reasons that we will likely see U - 6 unemployment hit 19 % by the end of 2009 .
Fortunately we have more safety nets than during the Great Depression but to expect this to be a walk in the park is naïve .
We are in a serious situation and things will only get tougher in the short run .

Enlarge Eugenics remains a blot on the history of American science , a pseudoscientific racist movement that led to the sterilization of perhaps 60,000 people nationwide in the first half of the 20th Century .
Support for eugenics came from members of the American Medical Association , the National Academy of Sciences and pillars of " progressive " society ranging from Woodrow Wilson to Alexander Graham Bell .
" Three generations of imbeciles is enough , " declared Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in the 1927 Supreme Court case , Buck v. Bell , that enshrined involuntary sterilization of the " feebleminded " — the long - sought goal of eugenicists — as the law of the land .
The three generations in the case , Carrie Buck , her mother , Emma , and daughter , Vivian , it turns out were n't imbeciles ; Carrie was an average student and Vivian , taken from her mother and placed in the home of the family whose nephew had fathered her , made the honor role once in her short life .
" Buck earns a place in the legal hall of shame not only because Holmes ' opinion was unnecessarily callous but also because it was based on deceit and betrayal , " writes legal historian Paul Lombardo of Georgia State University in Atlanta , in his just - released book , Three Generations , No Imbeciles : Eugenics , the Supreme Court , and Buck v. Bell .
Scientists and lawyers , including Carrie Buck 's defense attorney , conspired against her , Lombardo finds in old records .
Eugenics started with British scientist Francis Galton 's 1869 book Hereditary Genius , where he argued his cousin Charles Darwin 's discovery of " natural selection , " the process by which creatures with genetic traits supporting survival out - reproduced other members of their species , meant bad news for humanity , thanks to civilization .
Without natural selection to remove the congenitally rotten from the gene pool , argued Galton , statistics suggested that virtue and smarts would be trampled by the over - breeding of less wonderful folks .
In 1924 , 18 - year - old Carrie Buck ended up enmeshed in the legal machinations of eugenics advocates .
The physician superintendent of the Virginia Colony for Epileptics and Feeble - minded , Albert Priddy , selected Buck from his charges for sterilization and the subject of the first test of the newly - enacted Virginia eugenics law .
In reality , Buck was at the colony because she had been raped and impregnated by the nephew of her foster family the year before .
The family sent her to the colony , where her mother resided , to escape scandal .
Priddy " quickly began collecting information to demonstrate the hereditary defects he was certain linked Emma and Carrie , " writes Lombardo .
After a July 1924 sterilization hearing , in which Priddy declared Buck " congenitally and incurably defective , " her legal guardian named a defense attorney for her mandatory appeal to oppose the colony 's lawyer , the eugenics advocate Aubrey Strode .
" He chose Irving Whitehead , confidant of Priddy , boyhood friend to Aubrey Strode , former colony director , and sterilization advocate . "
( Priddy died soon after and was replaced as defendant by John Bell , a physician with the State Colony for Epileptics and Feeble - Minded in Lynchburg , Va . )
At the court case , experts included physician Joseph " Sterilization " DeJarnette of the Western Lunatic Asylum in Staunton , Va. ; scientist Arthur Estabrook , who claimed a " regular mental test " given to the weeks - old Vivian demonstrated her feeble - mindedness ; and eugenicist Harry Laughlin whose testimony included articles entitled " Purging the Race , " which supported " the right of the state to limit human reproduction in the interest of race betterment , " writes Lombardo .
Estabrook and Laughlin were both from by the Eugenics Record Office in Cold Spring Harbor , N.Y. , which pioneered the model eugenics law on which Virginia 's legislation was based .
Whitehead objected little to their testimony .
" He offered no witnesses and produced no evidence , " Lombardo writes , conceding the judgment of Buck as a " middle - grade moron . "
After the case , he appeared before the colony board of directors to express his satisfaction with a trial he had lost , and declare it ripe for appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court , set to establish a precedent legalizing forced sterilization of those judged unfit .
" The fix was in , " says Lombardo , in a phone interview .
After proceeding through Virginia 's Supreme Court of Appeals , Buck 's case headed in 1926 to the Supreme Court .
The Supreme Court was then headed by Chief Justice William Howard Taft , the former president , who " for more than 30 years , " writes Lombardo , " lent his support to some of the most prominent leaders of the eugenics movement . "
After hearing arguments from Strode and Whitehead , Taft assigned the writing of the opinion in the Buck case to Justice Holmes .
Holmes " had no compunctions about ' restricting propagation by the undesirables and putting to death infants that did n't pass examination . ' , " writes Lombardo .
Holmes was a friend of the British eugenicist Harold Laski , who often spoke out against charity as " fostering the weaker part of mankind . "
Holmes parroted the writings of earlier eugenicists , Lombardo notes , when he wrote in his famous opinion : " It is better for all the world if , instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility , society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind . "
The American Journal of Public Health praised Holmes as " that great jurist " after the 1927 decision .
Of course , many scientists of the time opposed eugenics , notably Morris Fishbein , editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association , as did lawyers such as Clarence Darrow , who defended evolution in the Scopes Monkey Trial .
But the Buck decision stood , and about 30 states adopted involuntary sterilization laws , all based on the dishonest testimony and deceitful lawyering of Buck v. Bell , says Lombardo .
It was n't until national publicity about sterilization abuse in the 1970s that the practice ended .
In 1942 , the Supreme Court struck down involuntary sterilization of inmates , but the Buck decision has never been repealed .
" Eugenics still fascinates today , " says Lombardo , invoked in debates over genetics testing , abortion and the future of medicine .
" The attitudes are still around that fostered eugenics .
They are n't going away . "
As for Carrie Buck , she was sterilized ( as was her sister , Doris ) and lived her life in poverty before dying in 1982 .
Her young daughter , Vivian , did not live long enough to be sterilized , dying from the complications of measles in second grade .

vimではひとつの画面で複数のファイルを同時に開くことが可能です。僕は大体画面を2つに割ってソースとテンプレートと見比べながら編集、みたいなことをよくやっているのですが、複数のファイルを見ながらの編集はかなり便利です。もちろん開いたwindow間で文字列のYank/Pasteが可能です。
キー操作 内容 : new $ filename 新規window作成（垂直方向） : vnew $ filename 新規window作成（水平方向） :e $ filename 今いるwindowにファイルを開く そのwindowで :q windowの削除 そのwindowで : hide windowを隠す（バッファには残る） ファイル名を指定しないと空のバッファが作成されます

Ctrl+w を押した後に通常の移動キーですね。 キー操作 内容 Ctrl+w h ← Ctrl+w j ↓ Ctrl+w k ↑ Ctrl+w l → Ctrl+w r 左右/上下のwindowを入れ替え
file explorer vimでディレクトリを開くと file explorer になります。 :e / path/to/some/directory/
複数のファイルを同時並行で編集したり参照したりする必要がある場合（よくありますよね）には、vimを一旦suspendして他の文書を開きなおすよりも、vnew等で横に file explorer を開いて目的にファイルを探すほうが速いです。一度開けば次からはバッファ番号でそのファイルを呼び出すことが可能です。 " ============================================================================ " Netrw Directory Listing ( netrw v98 ) " /usr/local/apache2/conf/original / extra " Sorted by name " Sort sequence : [ \/ ] $ , * , \. bak$ , \.o$ , \.h$ , \.info$ , \.swp$ , \.obj$ " Quick Help : : help -: go up dir D:delete R:rename s:sort - by x:exec " ============================================================================

折りたたみ方： 折りたたみたい範囲を領域選択してから zf 展開方法： 折りたたみ行でスペー ス
word completion（単語補完） 単語を途中まで入力すると、その後に続く文字列をvimがバッファの中からさがしてきて補完する機能。長い変数名や関数名等が一気に補完されるので、typoも減ってスピードも上がります。また、開いている全てのバッファを検索するので超便利！ 入力モードで関数名等を途中まで書いて、 キー操作 内容 Ctrl+p 単語補完（前方検索 ）
Ctrl+n 単語補完（後方検索） 上記を複数回入力すると、次々と候補が表示されます。
外部コマンドとの連携 vimは編集中に外部コマンドを実行したり、その結果を取り込んだり出来ます。領域選択後に実行すると、選択範囲が外部コマンドの標準入力に入るので、自作のプログラムをvimのフィルタとして使用できます。perltidy等でソースを整形したり、外部のウェブサービスに内容をポストしたり、色々な用途が考えられそうです。そういった大掛かりなものでなくとも、例えばソース中のちょっとした計算を行ったり（bc）、tsv等のデータを特定の項目で並び替えたり（sort）といった局面でかなり威力を発揮します。

recording （操作記憶） 特定の操作を文字列として記憶し、再生する機能です。決まりきった作業は一度やればOKで、記憶した操作は文字列としてレジスタに記憶されます。操作の記録は文字列なので、ファイルに保存しておけば何度でも使えます。
テキスト処理では単純な反復作業が結構あると思います。で、それ用のスクリプトを書くほどでもないみたいな場面が結構あるのですが、そういったときにrecordingはかなり便利です。1行分の作業を記録しておいて、あとはその作業内容（操作の記録）を他の全ての行に対して実行すれば完了です。簡易マクロですね。
操作開始： qa 操作の記録を開始し、レジスタ a に保存する 操作開始： q 操作の記録を終了する 再生： @a レジスタ a に保存された操作を再生する 5 @a レジスタ a に保存された操 作 を5 回再生する ※a の部分には任意のレジスタ名を入れる 行ごとの処理を行うときには、処理後にひとつ下の行に移るようにしておくと 10000 @a の様に繰り返しで大量に処理できて便利。

A fungus that lives inside trees in the Patagonian rain forest naturally makes a mix of hydrocarbons that bears a striking resemblance to diesel , biologists announced today .
And the fungus can grow on cellulose , a major component of tree trunks , blades of grass and stalks that is the most abundant carbon - based plant material on Earth .
" When we looked at the gas analysis , I was flabbergasted , " said Gary Strobel , a plant scientist at Montana State University , and the lead author of a paper in Microbiology describing the find .
" We were looking at the essence of diesel fuel . "
While genetic engineers have been trying a variety of techniques and genes to get microbes to create fuel out of sugars and starches , almost all commercial biofuel production uses the century - old dry mill grain process .
Ethanol plants ferment corn ears into alcohol , which is simple , but wastes the vast majority of the biomatter of the corn plant .
Using the cellulose from plants — the stalk instead of the ear , or simply wood from poplars — to make liquid fuel is a long - held dream because it would be more environmentally efficient and cheaper , but is far more difficult .
*
First , the cellulose must be broken down into its constituent parts — sugars bearing carbon — and then those pieces must be synthesized into more complex hydrocarbons .
Both steps have proven difficult to do without applying large amounts of heat , pressure or chemicals .
" Traditionally that 's been an energy - intensive process that also involves lots of chemicals , " said Andrew Groover , a plant geneticist studying cell wall formation at the U.S. Forest Service 's Pacific Southwest Research Station .
" So , one approach is to look for situations in nature where there are organisms that can break down wood as part of their natural lifestyle :
wood rot , fungi , termites . "
What 's exciting about the Gliocladium roseum fungus , however , is that it can both break down cellulose and synthesize the liquid fuel .
" A step in the production process could be skipped , " Strobel said in a press release .
That said , the paper 's authors admit that the technique is far from any sort of industrial production .
" This report presents no information on the cost - effectiveness or other details to make G. roseum an alternative fuel source , " they write .
" Its ultimate value may reside in the genes / enzymes that control hydrocarbon production , and our paper is a necessary first step that may lead to development programmes to make this a commercial venture . "
The genome of the fungus is being analyzed at Yale University under the direction of Scott Strobel , a molecular biologist and Gary Strobel 's son .
But beyond the biofuel implications , Strobel said that because the fungus can manufacture what we would normally think of as components of crude oil , it casts some doubt on the idea that crude oil is a fossil fuel .
" It may be the case that organisms like this produced some — maybe not all — but some of the world 's crude , " Strobel said .

Loose wheel prompts lie - detector tests for firefighters
By Elizabethe Holland
ST . LOUIS POST - DISPATCH
10/16/2008
NORMANDY  Firefighters with the Northeast Ambulance & Fire District have been asked by their employer , under threat of termination , to take lie - detector tests to determine if any of them loosened lug nuts on a fellow firefighter 's truck last month .
Firefighter Capt . Joseph McNeal was driving from the Metro East to the firehouse in Normandy on Sept. 28 when a wheel came off his pickup .
McNeal , 30 , told the Post - Dispatch he thinks someone loosened his lug nuts Sept. 26 or 27 while his Ford was parked at the firehouse .
He says he thinks he was targeted because he is African - American .
The department has had a history of racial dissension .
Officials with the St. Louis County and Normandy police , the Missouri Highway Patrol and the FBI said Wednesday that they had n't received any reports of the incident .
And Normandy Police Chief Douglas Lebert criticized the district 's board of directors for threatening to submit employees to polygraph exams instead of involving police .
" We 're dealing with a felony crime here , " Lebert said .
" Anything ( board members ) have done up to this point and anything they do after this point only interferes with any chance of us coming in and criminally finding who 's responsible for this and prosecuting that person . "
McNeal spoke early Sept. 28 with an Illinois State Police trooper who responded to the area where the wheel came off , but said he did n't report to any other police his suspicion that the truck had been sabotaged .
Rather , he said , he told a deputy chief at the fire district .
Within days , firefighters were asked to sign documents telling of " an internal affairs investigation of alleged employee misconduct in the loosening of lug nuts " on McNeal 's truck .
The document says that employees may be required to cooperate with the investigation and the polygraph exam and that refusal to do so " may be grounds for disciplinary action ... including termination . "
District board President Joe Washington , board Secretary - Treasurer Robert Edwards and Chief Peter O'Neal did not return calls seeking comment .
Asked in an email Wednesday about the incident and the polygraph exams , the board 's attorney , Elbert Walton Jr. , responded , " No comments . "
Board member Bob Lee , who is at odds with the board majority and Walton , said he learned of the incident and the plan to test firefighters only last week  from a district resident .
Lee said Wednesday that there had been no discussion in board meetings of the incident or of having employees tested .
Polygraph tests for 30 employees  about the number of firefighters with the Northeast department  could cost $ 6,000 , said John Grogan , executive director of the Polygraph Examiners of America .
McNeal said he parked his 2004 Ford pickup at the firehouse early Sept. 26 .
When his shift ended the next morning , he drove to his home in St. Louis .
A short time later , his wife , with the couple 's baby along , drove the truck to a gas station and a restaurant , McNeal said .
The truck was n't driven again until the next morning , when McNeal drove it to Illinois to help a friend , he said .
On the way back from the Metro East , he heard a rattling noise and then " the wheel just came off , " he said .
An Illinois State Police incident report says the lugs were bent when the wheel assembly came off .
" No lug nuts remained on the rotor lugs , " he report continues .
" This appeared to be the reason the wheel assembly came off the rotor . "
McNeal said he was grateful that the wheel did n't come off when his wife was driving and that the wheel did n't cause a wreck .
" This could have killed somebody , " said McNeal , who added that he now checks his truck closely every time he leaves the firehouse .
Northeast Deputy Chief Airest Wilson said district officials suspected an employee was involved because of " a history " of problems between black and white employees .
All three board members , the board attorney , the fire chief and most of the district officers are African - American .
Wilson said the department was about half black , half white .
Wilson said McNeal 's incident was n't the first such occurrence involving a black district firefighter .
He referred to an incident involving former employee Kevin Henderson , whose tire came off his car several years ago .
Reached last week , Henderson , now with the Spanish Lake Fire Protection District , said he never believed anyone loosened his lug nuts .
The car was about 15 years old and he'd recently purchased it , he said .
Henderson , who was fired by the Northeast board in July , said that Washington  the board president , but at the time the district 's assistant chief  had urged him to make a complaint but that he would not .
Dennis Murray , who heads the union that represents many of the district 's firefighters , criticized the board and its attorney for not calling in law enforcement to investigate what could be a hate crime .
Still , he said , he is recommending that firefighters take the polygraph exam .
" Take the lie - detector test and prove your innocence and move on , " Murray said .

While the 1988 Employee Polygraph Protection
Act prevents most private employers from forcing applicants and employees to submit to the pseudoscientific ritual of polygraph " testing , " the law includes a blanket loophole for federal , state , and local governments .
One rule for the ruled , another rule for the rulers .
A case in Normandy , Missouri showcases the need for a Comprehensive Employee Polygraph Protection
Act to eliminate the loopholes in the current law .
Firefighters are being compelled to submit to lie detector " tests " -- a notoriously unreliable procedure that is without scientific basis -- or face termination , as Elizabethe Holland reports for the St. LouisI have sent a note to the Normandy Fire District at board@northeastfiredistrict.org
We 've all done it — had two tabs or screens open , wishing we could have two screens on our laptop so we did n't have to keep switching back and forth between windows .
Enter Lenovo Group Ltd .
The company 's next ThinkPad laptop is more of a " desktop replacement " than ever .
ThinkPad W700ds ( a follow - on to the standard W700 model we evaluated for you here ) will have a 17 - inch main screen and a 10.6 - inch secondary .
The former is a bit larger than the a mainstream 15.4 " laptop and the latter about the same size as the average netbook today .
It 's far heavier than the norm , too — 11 pounds — and will be a bit pricier than we 've come to expect from laptops — starting $ 3,600 when it goes up for sale in January .
But check out its specs ,
according to ComputerWorld
:
The souped - up " mobile workstation , " as Lenovo calls it , also comes with customers ' choice of quad - core Intel Core 2 processors and Nvidia Quadro mobile graphics CPU with as many as 128 cores .
It also comes with as much as 8GB of DDR3 memory and a pair of hard drive / solid - state drive bays for up to 960 GB of storage .
And know how you always reach for the separate numeric keyboard when you sit down with your laptop , then curse its non-existence ?
This one has it .
More tidbits :
• The secondary screen can be tiled up to 30 degrees .
• The main screen is rated at 400 nits of brightness .
• The ThinkPad has dual fans and dual heat - reduction systems .
• The whole thing measures 16 by 12 inches and is 2.1 inches thick .

What makes this show one of my favorites is that unlike so much fine art which takes itself too seriously this exhibit always has a strong sense of humor and whimsy .
The show is the brainchild of Liz Artinian who is both a fine artist and veteran of a wide range of animated series from Daria to The Venture Brothers .
Shown above is a painting by Brooklyn based Kelly Denato who has done work for Sesame Workshop and Cartoon Network .
Below is a sculpture by Christopher Beaumont which reminded me a great deal of the Memphis design movement from the 80s .
This wonderful painting is by Dagan Moriarty who has worked in the animation industry for over ten years as a character desiger , animator and art director :
This is one of several robot sculptures by David Lipson .
There ’s a real magic to how Lipson has taken every day objects and brings them to life :
This apocalyptic painting by Chris George has a very cinematic flavor to it , although the anime inspired robot and cartoon skull on the mushroom cloud makes the work very inviting :
To view this painting by Todd K Lown you needed to use a pair of 3D glasses , although without the 3D effect his work has a nice Kandinsky flavor to it :
This mural sized drawing by Christy Karacas had an amazing amount of detail in it , this photo graph does n’t quite do his drawing any justice ( which is one of the reasons you should see the show in person if you can ) :
The above photos just show a fraction of the show — if you ’re in town the gallery would be well worth a visit .
Recently , I was lucky enough to chat with theoretical physicist Professor Michio Kaku .
Professor Kaku is one of a rare breed ; working at the cutting edge of complex maths and physics , but also able to talk about his research topics with a layperson , in their language .
He specialises in string field theory , but is also an eloquent populariser of science , having appeared on nearly every major television network in the United States and hosted a number of documentaries .
He also has written numerous popular books on cutting edge science and future thought , the latest being Physics of the Impossible ( Amazon US and UK ) .
Our discussion covered everything from the UFO phenomenon , to whether consciousness defines reality , and also touched on some of the more controversial science stories about today ( most notably , the LHC and Active SETI ) .
Professor Kaku was quick to assure me that the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) will definitely not destroy the world , instead listing some of the benefits that science could reap from the project – not least , a refining of the current understanding of particle physics .
He did n’t shy away from the fact that in its current form “ the Standard Model … is supremely ugly …
It ’s like gluing together an aardvark , whale , and platypus and declaring it to be nature ’s supreme evolutionary creation . ”
We also touched on the ‘ mainstream ’ view that human consciousness is simply an epiphenomenon of the brain – which in many respects , does not match up with the supreme importance that some branches of quantum physics accord consciousness .
Professor Kaku agreed that “ consciousness is one of the great problems facing science , ” and stated plainly that despite the mainstream view , “ most scientists cannot even define it , let alone explain it . ”
To illustrate how consciousness is important to quantum physics , he discussed the well - known “ Schrodinger ’s Cat ” paradox , and then explored various theories which might explain it .
One of those was put forward by Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner – he assumed that consiousness is the key factor in creating reality .
Furthermore , extrapolating Wigner ’s theory means that , as Professor Kaku put it , “ eventually , we need an infinite chain of observers , each watching the other …
Wigner implied that this chain was a cosmic consciousness or even God . ”
One of the main reasons I was interested in talking to Professor Kaku was his openness to some of the more ‘ heretical ’ areas of science .
One of those topics is the scientific investigation of the UFO phenomenon , something which he has gone on the public record as supporting .
Professor Kaku said that generally UFOs were subject to the “ giggle factor ” with scientists , because most assume that the distance between possible civilisations is far too great .
But he thinks differently .
“ Once you imagine a civilization a million years more advanced ( which is a blink of an eye compared to the 13.7 billion year age of the universe ) then new laws of physics and technologies open up , ” Dr Kaku told me .
“ For such a civilization ( a Type III civilization , according to the Kardashev scale ) , travel between stars might not be such a problem . ”
He also pondered on how we might struggle to relate to such technically advanced alien civilisations – or more correctly , how they might fail to recognise our ‘ sophistication ’ .
“ Imagine walking down a country road , and meeting an ant hill .
Do we go down to the ants and say , ‘ I bring you trinkets .
I bring you beads .
I give you nuclear energy and biotechnology .
Take me to your leader ? ’
Or we have the urge to step on a few of them ? ? ”
Given the likely differences between us and alien civilisations , the next obvious question to me was to ask whether Professor Kaku thought SETI was worth the time and effort .
His reply ?
“ Yes , because it ’s all we have today .
So by default , we should fund it , but not expect too much . ”
He was n’t as charitable , however , about the idea of Active SETI ( beaming messages out to space , rather than listening ) .
“ I think it ’s an awful idea to advertise our existence in space , without understanding the motives and intentions of possible alien civilizations , ” he said , comparing us to the inhabitants of the New World encountering “ Cortez and his band of cut - throats ” .
Instead of David vs. Goliath , Professor Kaku suggests it would be more akin to “ a fruit fly versus Goliath ” .
The full interview transcript is after the fold , click ‘ Read More ’ to view it .
Also , there is plenty of wonderful reading on Professor Kaku ’s personal website , for those who want to explore these topics further .

TDG : Thanks for talking with us here at The Daily Grail Michio !
When I read your latest book , Physics of the Impossible ( Amazon US and UK ) , I wondered as to what would have inspired a serious physicist such as yourself to write a book on this topic .
But when we look at your other books – Hyperspace , Visions and Parallel Worlds – it ’s quite obvious that you are fascinated with ideas and concepts at the threshold of ( and beyond ) our current capabilities and understanding .
Have you always been interested in exploring the boundaries of knowledge ?
MK : When I was a child , I was fascinated by the old Flash Gordon series .
I would watch , glued to the TV screen , because it introduced to me an entirely new world .
After a while , however , I had my first insight : I realized that I did not have blond hair and muscles .
I began to realize that although Flash got the girl , the man who actually made the entire series work was the scientist , Dr. Zarkov .
With the sheer force of his intellect , he created the invisibilty shield , the energy for the city in the sky , and other scientific wonders .
Without the science , there was no science fiction .
So I became a science fiction fan .
Then I had my second insight .
I realized that I could daydream all I wanted to about the fourth dimension , about hyperspace , about star ships , but if I did not have the mathematics and the physics background , then I would forever be an outsider , speculating about these fantastic technologies .
That ’s why I decided to get serious and learn as much advanced mathematics and physics as I possibly could .
The language of nature is mathematics , so if I really wanted to know about other universes and other dimensions , I would have to sit down and learn this language .
Now , when I look back at science fiction , I know precisely where modern science and technology ends , and science fiction begins , and even when science fiction may become science fact .
TDG : Heading into the boundaries of science , and starting with a topical subject : the Large Hadron Collider is about to come online , with much confusion and speculation about what this machine might be capable of .
Can you explain – to a layman – what the LHC will contribute to our quest for knowledge and whether it presents any danger at all ?
MK : The LHC , contrary to myth , will not destroy the world .
Each proton in the LHC beam has a lot of energy , but there are very few protons in the beam .
Hence , the energy of the beam is about the energy of a fruit fly .
In fact , you would not light up a light bulb with the energy of the sub-atomic particles created by the machine .
In reality , we want to re-create the temperatures of the big bang .
We hope to find a particle , called the Higgs Boson , which is the last missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle called the Standard Model of particles .
Although the Standard Model has had much success in explaining the sub-atomic world , it has several glaring defects : first , it is supremely ugly ( containing 36 types of quarks , 3 exact copies of sub-atomic particles , and a zoo of particles including neutrinos , leptons , hadrons , gluons , W - bosons , mesons , etc. etc. etc . )
It ’s like gluing together an aardvark , whale , and platypus and declaring it to be nature ’s supreme evolutionary creation .
So we physicists hope to find particles beyond the Higgs boson , such as “ sparticles ” or superparticles which are predicted by superstring theory .
In this picture , the world we see around us corresponds to the lowest vibration of tiny vibrating rubber bands .
Sparticles represent the next set of vibrations .
If true , then superstring theory , being a theory of everything , may reveal the deepest secrets of the universe , such as what happened before the big bang , whether parallel universes and other dimensions exist , whether time travel is possible , and whether wormholes are credible .
All this could have a profound impact on our view of the universe or multiverse .
TDG : Speaking of superstring theory :
You have a running ‘ Long Bet ’ with science writer John Horgan , challenging his prediction that “ By 2020 , no one will have won a Nobel Prize for work on superstring theory , membrane theory , or some other unified theory describing all the forces of nature . ”
Six years into the bet , how safe is your money looking ?
MK :
There are two ways that experiments may find evidence for string theory .
First , we can use earth - bound technology .
The LHC may find sparticles which are predicted by the theory .
Or , we may find evidence of dark matter in our labs ( the leading candidate for dark matter is the neutralino found in string theory ) .
Or , we may find experimental evidence for higher dimensions by searching for deviations in the Newton ’s inverse square law for gravity .
Second , we can use space - basesd detectors , like LISA .
LISA is a laser satellite system , 3 million miles across .
( It consists of 3 satellites connected by 3 laser beams ) .
Any gravity wave left over from the instant of Genesis is still floating around and will disturb these lasers , which will therefore allow us to detect the instant of the Big Bang .
Even better , we may be able to match this big bang gravity radiation with various pre-big bang theories now being proposed .
In this way , we might be able to probe the pre-big bang universe , and hence verify string theory this way .
TDG : Taking a step sideways : the dominant paradigm of consciousness research considers consciousness as simply an epiphenomenon of a biological brain .
Does this position fit with the findings of modern physics , given the role of the observer in quantum decoherence ?
Or does ‘ observer ’ mean something else entirely , unrelated to consciousness ?
MK : Consciousness is one of the great problems facing science .
Some have claimed to have “ explained ” consciousness .
But actually , most scientists cannot even define it , let alone explain it .
Consciousness enters quantum physics because of the Schrodinger cat problem , perhaps the greatest paradox in all of science .
If we put a cat in a box , and point a gun at the cat , which in turn is connected to a geiger counter sitting next to uranium , then we physicists describe the system as the sum of two wave functions .
In one wave function , the cat is dead .
In the other , the cat is alive .
So , before we open the box , the cat is neither dead nor alive , but exists in a nether state .
Once an observation is made , the cat suddenly “ chooses ” one state or the other , and we can then see that the cat is dead or alive ( but not both ) .
( Most people find this paradox silly , but it troubled Einstein for decades .
He would ask his guests at night : does the moon exist because a mouse looks at it ? )
There are several ways to resolve this puzzle .
The standard theory is to say that observation determines existence .
So opening the box and making the measurement collapses the wave function and determines the state of the cat .
This assumes that the sub-atomic world is different from the macroscopic world , that there is a “ wall ” separating the two .
In the microworld , electrons can be two places at the same time , disappearing and reappearing all the time .
But in the macroworld , cats are either dead or alive .
( Lately , this standard picture has fallen into disfavor because , in nanotechnology , we can smoothly go from the macroworld and microworld and we do not encounter any wall .
Another way , pioneered by Nobel Laureate Eugene Wigner , is to assume that consiousness is the key factor .
Only conscious observers can make observations , and hence consciousness causes the wave function to collapse .
But how do we know that we are alive and not dead ?
Hence , we need a third person to observe us to collapse our wave function .
But then we need a fourth person to observe the third person and collapse his wave function .
Eventually , we need an infinite chain of observers , each watching the other .
Wigner implied that this chain was a cosmic consciousness or even God .
There is a third way , which is gaining popularity among physicists .
And this is that the universe splits in half everytime an observation is made .
In one universe , the cat is dead .
In the other universe , the cat is alive .
The beauty of this approach is that we do not have to introduce any “ wall ” or “ collapsed waves . ”
The wave function merrily splits continually , creating infinite numbers of parallel universes .
( We do n’t see all these parallel universes surrounding us , because we have “ decohered ” from them .
Our wave function is no longer vibrating in unison with these other universes , so we cannot easily interact with them .
Otherwise , we would bump into versions of ourselves where we made different choices in life , or bump into universes where people how have died in our universe are still alive . )
TDG : You have been one of the few ‘ mainstream ’ scientists to speak out in support of reasoned investigation of the UFO phenomenon .
What prompted you to take this minority view ?
MK : In science , we have something called the giggle factor .
Scientists giggle when they hear of UFOs .
Most scientists laugh at UFOs because the distance between stars is so great that it would take thousands of years for a UFO to reach the earth .
But I look at it differently .
I ask : what is a civilization a million years more advanced than ours capable of ?
Usually , we think of alien civilizations as being a few hundred years ahead of us , and they would indeed have a hard time reaching us .
But once you imagine a civilization a million years more advanced ( which is a blink of an eye compared to the 13.7 billion year age of the universe ) then new laws of physics and technologies open up .
For such a civilization ( a Type III civilization , according to the Kardashev scale ) , travel between stars might not be such a problem .
TDG : Given the minimal age of human civilisation – and what we have achieved in that time – are we perhaps still ‘ savages ’ compared to the truly ‘ civilised ’ denizens of the cosmos ?
Astrobiologist David Grinspoon speculates that these ‘ Immortals ’ “ are likely to be out there , and they might seem like gods to us if they ever decide that it ’s a good idea for us to meet them . ”
Does this suggest that we should never discount extraordinary experiences – such as UFO sightings – out of hand ?
MK : Imagine walking down a country road , and meeting an ant hill .
Do we go down to the ants and say , “ I bring you trinkets .
I bring you beads .
I give you nuclear energy and biotechnology .
Take me to your leader ? ”
Or we have the urge to step on a few of them ??
Actually , the distance between us and an ant hill is quite small when compared to the distance between our Type 0 civilization and a Type III civilization .
Since the energy difference between each
Type is roughly 10 billion , it means that a Type III civilization has a minimum 10 billion times 10 billion times more energy than us .
At that energy scale , new forms of physics begin to open up , at the Planck energy , where space and time become unstable .
So technologies that we can only dream of today may become common place if one can master the Planck energy ( which is 10 to the 19 billion electron volts ) .
TDG : The other human hunt for alien civilisations is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) .
Terence McKenna once criticised SETI by saying “ to search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant . ”
Is SETI worth the time and expense ?
MK : Yes , because it ’s all we have today .
So by default , we should fund it , but not expect too much .
If ants in an ant hill detect a 10 - lane superhighway being built near them , would they understand how to communicate with the workers ?
Would they assume that the workers communicate only on ant frequencies ?
In fact , the ants are so primitive that they would not even understand what a 10 - lane superhighway was .
TDG : Do you believe the concerns over the dangers of ‘ Active SETI ‘ ( that we should not advertise our presence to possibly hostile alien civilisations ) are valid ?
MK : I think it ’s an awful idea to advertize our existence in space , without understanding the motives and intentions of possible alien civilizations .
Remember what happened to Montezuma and the Aztecs when they encountered Cortez and his band of cutthroats .
Within a few months , the great Aztec civilization was demolished , and Cortez only had technology a few centuries at most ahead of the Aztecs .
Imagine what would happen if we met a civilization a million years ahead of us .
Instead of David vs. Goliath , it would be a fruit fly versus Goliath .
( However , although active SETI is a dangerous idea , I believe that alien civilizations may not want to conquer or eat us , as we see in Hollywood movies .
They will not want to eat us , since we will be made of different proteins and DNA , assuming the aliens even have proteins and DNA .
Also , there are plenty of uninhabited planets with resources without
restive natives , so they would probably not disturb us . )
Also , the main danger faced by ants confronting workers building a 10 lane superhighway is not that the workers want to eat the ants or conquer and enslave them .
The main danger faced by the ants is that they will be paved over .
Think of most animals in a forest .
The main danger they face is not that humans will shoot them and eat them .
No , the main danger is that humans will rob them of their habitat , and they will die as a consequence , even if the humans are not aware of this .
So the main danger we face from an advanced civilization is simply that we might get in their way .
TDG : Our Universe is ideally constructed for order .
The Earth is an oasis perfectly suited for life to evolve .
Humans have evolved consciousness .
And we – of all species on Earth – have now figured out how to leave the planet and venture into the cosmos…and , during * our* lifetime .
Given the above , at some point does the Anthropic Principle just get pushed to absolute breaking point , with the almost ‘ fate - like ’ scenario that we in the 20th century are confronted with ( even moreso for an Apollo astronaut ! ) ?
MK : When I was in second grade , my teacher made a statement which left a deep impression on me .
She said that God so loved the earth that he put the earth “ just right ” from the sun .
If the earth were closer , the oceans would boil .
If the earth were farther , the oceans would freeze .
But the earth is just right from the sun , she said .
This was my first encounter with a scientific statement with religious implications .
Today , however , we have detected almost 300 dead planets in space which are too close , and are too far , from their mother sun .
So we do n’t have to invoke God .
It is just a random event that we are just right from the sun , otherwise , I would not be able to write down this sentence .
The same reasoning applies to the universe .
Our universe is “ just right ” to allow for intelligent life .
If the nuclear force were a bit stronger , the sun would burn out before life gets started .
If it were a bit weaker , the sun would never ignite .
Similarly , if gravity were a bit stronger , we would all perish in a Big Crunch .
If gravity were a bit weaker , the universe would have entered a Big Freeze long ago , and we would all be frozen now .
The conclusion is that there are probably many universes which are lifeless , with suns that never ignited , or universes which have collapsed back .
A multiverse of universes solves the mystery of why our universe seems fine - tuned to allow for life and consciousness .

A Christian counsellor from Bristol is to take a charity to a tribunal after he was allegedly sacked for refusing to work with same - sex couples .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Gary McFarlane , a solicitor and former church elder , will allege the Bristol branch of counselling service Relate refused to accommodate his religious beliefs .
The 47 - year - old , from Hanham , started training with Relate in May 2003 and said he enjoyed good relationships with clients and colleagues .
The father - of - two was suspended after meetings with his manager in October 2007 , in which he claims he was asked to state his views regarding same - sex couples .
Mr McFarlane claims he was harassed and labelled a " homophobe " after his suspension was lifted , and following a further disciplinary hearing , was dismissed on 18 March .
He said : " I love the community of Bristol .
I live in a great city , with a history .
There is no room for oppression of any people and a return to the past .
" The issues are way bigger than one individual .
Society will be the poorer if we do not balance rights fairly and respectfully . "
Mr McFarlane will claim discrimination on the grounds of religion , unfair dismissal and harassment at Bristol Employment Tribunal Centre .
The Christian Legal Centre , which has backed Mr McFarlane throughout the process , has instructed human rights barrister Paul Diamond to represent him in the two - day hearing .

Willard 's Vegetable and Fruit Juice Recipes
Many thanks for the invention of the Champion Juicer .
Recipes
H ow these recipes came about was a result of having successfully recovered from colon cancer surgery in late December 1995 .
After spending one month without solid food , and living off of intravenous saline solutions and liquid vitamins it was extremely disappointing to have to finally drink a small glass of cold apple juice which the hospital provided .
I thought to myself that this was not really going to give me much strength , and I was eager to fortify my body .
When I left the hospital I discovered that when I had my first full glass of fresh juiced organic carrots my entire body came to life instantly .
It was as if electricity shot through my veins , and instantly I felt better .
I knew right then that a new regime of experimenting with fresh vegetable and fruits would be the course I would take to heal myself .
After several attempts to find the right combination of vegetables as well as fruits , and other liquid vitamins , I finally found a vegetable fruit drink that not only made me feel awake and alert , but also vigorous and stimulating .
I named the first juice drink " New Life " .
I share all these recipes for all to enjoy , and discover the magic healing powers of fresh juice .
List of Juice Drinks
The " New Life " Juice Drink
Ingredients
Juice eight large carrots
Juice one half large beet
Juice one half turnip
Juice one half parsnip
Juice five large celery stalks
Juice one quarter rutabaga
Juice one eighth head red cabbage .
Juice five radishes
Juice one large Granny apple
Juice one cup cranberries ( in season )
After these vegetables and fruits have been juiced , and gently stirred , you then put the juice in a blender and add :
Two tablespoons of whole leaf aloe vera concentrate from Aloe Complete , Vista CA , 92085-0067
Two tablespoons of Flor - Essence made by Flora , Inc Box 950 Lyden , WA .
98264
One tablespoon of DeSouza 's liquid chlorophyll .
One teaspoon of BarleyGreen Powder made by AIM , Nampa Idaho .
Put BarleyGreen powder in the juice and blend together in a blender .
One or two ounces of New Vision 's Essential Minerals ( colloidal ) .
One teaspoon of powered vitamin c sprinkle on top
One eighth teaspoon of hot chile pepper sauce .
That 's it .
Get a tall glass , and pour it in , savor the taste , and wait 20 minutes , and you will feel like a new Spring day .
The " Hall of Fame Smoothie "
In making a fresh fruit and vegatable drink I consider several things .
Color Texture Flavor
If an earthy flavor is sought after then the parsnips , turnips , and roots give a deep tone to the drink .
To sweeten the drink there are many ways to do it .
Bee pollen , strawberry 's , apples , and even young carrots .
There is a magic in the way all the ingredients go together so my own recipes come from knowing a little on how to develop a special flavor .
The " Hall of Fame Smoothie " was a special drink for it combined some new combinations .
The color is an indian red and the texture is very smooth .
The taste is remarkably sweet , yet at the same time it has a bottom flavor of root .
In all its a wonderful morning pick me up .
Ingredients
Juice eight young carrots
Juice one small beet
Juice one half turnip
Juice one half parsnip
Juice three large individual celery stalks
Juice one large Fugi apple
Juice one large Comice pear
Juice 2 inches of Burdock root one half inch in diameter
After these vegetables and fruits have been juiced , and gently stirred , you then put the amount you want to drink in a blender and add :
One teaspoon of Bee Pollen by Honey Run Honey Co. of Chico , CA
Two tablespoons of Barley Green by American Image Marketing of Calgary , Alberta , Canada
One scoop of Spiru - Protein powder ( vanilla ) by Nature 's Plus of Melville , NY
One or two ounces of New Vision 's Essential Minerals ( colloidal ) of Tempe , Az .
Put on the puree setting of your blender for 2 minutes and you will have the most delightful drink you could ever imagine .
The " Yin - Yang Fortifier " Juice Drink
The tang and tartness of a juice drink is a very subtle or a very pronounced preference when it comes to flavoring .
These are some roots I have worked with :
Salsify root
Ginger root
Burdock root
Galanga root
Whie raddish root
Roots are extremely pungent and add a definite flavor to the juice drink .
If you are not careful you can completely effect the juice drink with these roots with no ability to alter their earthy and bitter flavor .
The best suggestion I have is to use a small amount each time .
Once the top flavor is discovered in the juice you will find this approach to be a very powerful factor in the overall flavor of the juice drink .
The " Yin - Yang Fortifier " accomplishes this delicate balance between sweetness and tartness .
In this case the strawberrys and the banana help push the galanga root to the back of the taste buds after you have swollowed the first gulp of the drink savoring the sweet strawberrys .
Be careful with the galanga root .
I suggest one to two inches of a section of the root to start with .
Ingredients
Juice10 strawberrys
Juice 12 small carrots
Juice 1/2 purple top parnsnip
Juice 4 individual celerey stalks
Juice 1 small beet
Juice 1 large Fuji apple
Juice a small section of Galanga root .
After juicing with the Champion juicer you are ready for the blender .
Always pour the amount you want to drink into the blender , and save the rest for another time .
I suggest you drink all fresh juice in one or two days and be sure to refrigerate and keep it air tight .
After you have poured the amount you want to drink into the blender you then add :
1 tablespoon barley green powder
1 tablespoon colloidal minerals
1 scoop spiru - protein
1/2 banana
1 teaspoon bee pollen
1 fresh egg
Put the blender setting on whip to make it nice and frothy for about 1 minute and you have an excellent juice drink .
After you pour the juice drink into a glass cut a thin slice of strawberry and lay it gently on the juice froth .
Not only does it look nice , but wait until you taste it .
You may just want to drink the rest .
For added fortification I suggest you also take with the juice drink :
1 tablet of Wellness Formula , a herbal defense complex by Source naturals .
2 Squalene tablets ( shark oil ) as a cancer and radical cell defense preventiative .
The " Strawberry Delight " Juice Drink
The flavoring of a juice drink is a very subtle or a very pronounced preference when it comes to sweetness .
Here are the sweet additions :
Strawberrys
Apples
Pears
Young organic carrots
Pomegranates

Bayer Healthcare to Pay U.S. $ 97.5 Million to Settle Allegations of Paying Kickbacks to Diabetic Suppliers
WASHINGTON - Bayer HealthCare LLC ( Bayer ) has agreed to pay the United States $ 97.5 million plus interest to settle allegations that it paid kickbacks to a number of diabetic suppliers and caused those suppliers to submit false claims to Medicare , the Justice Department announced today .
The settlement resolves allegations that Bayer engaged in a cash - for - patient scheme through which the company paid 11 diabetic suppliers to convert their patients to Bayer ’s products from supplies manufactured by its competitors .
The Tarrytown , N.Y.- based company manufactures diabetic self - testing supplies , including glucose monitors and testing strips .
Bayer contracts with direct - to - patient diabetic suppliers who market and sell these products to beneficiaries and submit claims for reimbursement to Medicare .
Between 1998 and 2002 , Bayer allegedly paid Liberty Medical Supply Inc. , one of the largest direct - to - patient diabetic suppliers , approximately $ 2.5 million to convert its patients to Bayer supplies .
The alleged kickbacks were based on the number of patients that Liberty successfully converted to Bayer supplies and were disguised as payments for advertising .
In addition , Bayer allegedly paid kickbacks of approximately $ 375,000 to 10 other diabetic suppliers to convert patients to Bayer supplies .
" If medical device manufacturers want to serve Medicare beneficiaries they must follow the law , " said Gregory G. Katsas , Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division .
" Paying healthcare suppliers to place a particular brand of device with Medicare beneficiaries violates the law and will not be tolerated . "
The settlement resolves claims submitted to Medicare by the 11 suppliers for Bayer supplies from 1998 through 2007 .
Under the terms of the settlement , Bayer agreed to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) .
" Device manufacturers who pay illegal kickbacks should expect to be held accountable , " said Daniel R. Levinson , HHS Inspector General .
" OIG 's compliance agreement with Bayer includes specific requirements for the board of directors and management that will enable OIG to closely monitor company practices affecting Federal health care programs and beneficiaries . "
The investigation was referred to the Justice Department ’s Civil Division , Commercial Litigation Branch , by the FBI and the Criminal Division of the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Southern District of Florida , in West Palm Beach , Fla .

Katt Williams Missing : Conan O'Brien Talks About Disappearance ( Video )
Comedianis missing and no one seems to know where he is .was forced to fill a time gap when Williams did n't show up for a scheduled appearance on Wednesday .
According to Media Takeout a person close to Katt contacted them today asking if they knew where he was .
The individual , who asked to remain anonymous explained , " No one knows where is ... and we 're worried about him . "
A few weeks ago the 35 - year - old entertainer was embroiled in controversy when he was replaced as host of the BET Hip Hop awards by musician T - Pain .
View video of Conan O'Brien talking about Katt Williams missing below .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A Bush administration plan to let U.S. agencies decide for themselves whether their actions put wildlife at risk is drawing fire from environmental groups , which say this is like letting a fox guard a henhouse .
The Interior Department , one of two federal agencies pushing for this policy change , rejects the environmentalists ’ critique , saying the new rule would cut bureaucratic red tape and free government scientists for more important work .
But a coalition of conservation groups sees the move as an attempt to gut the Endangered Species Act .
“ This is exactly the fox guarding the henhouse , ” Michael Daulton of the National Audubon Society said .
“ It ’s a scary proposition to think about agencies with no wildlife expertise at all making decisions about the fate of species , potentially leading to extinction . ”
The 35 - year - old Endangered Species
Act is meant to protect threatened wildlife by relying on the best available science , the environmentalists noted .
Government scientists must now consult with agencies on projects that could put species at risk .
The rules change could take scientists out of the equation , the conservation coalition maintained .
Audubon , which aims to protect birds , was among more than 120 groups that joined to flood the Interior Department ’s Fish and Wildlife Service with 100,000 negative comments about the plan on Friday .
This flood of paper was timed to coincide with the end of an official “ public comment ” period on the proposed rule change , which ends on Tuesday .
After that , it is unclear when or whether the rule will be adopted .
‘ HAIL MARY PASS ’
“ This proposed rule change is obviously a Hail Mary pass to industry friends in the final days of the Bush administration and it will fail , ” said Janette Brimmer , a lawyer with Earthjustice .
A Hail Mary pass is a desperate last - minute play in American football .
At the heart of the matter is the notion of dropping a requirement for U.S. agencies -- from the Transportation Department to the Army Corps of Engineers -- to consult with scientists before they take on projects that could threaten wildlife on the Endangered Species list .
As the Interior and Commerce departments wrote in their plan , released in mid-August with little fanfare : “ We propose to add language that action agencies are not required to consult on those actions for which they determine their action will have ‘ no effect ’ on listed species or critical habitat . ”
These two agencies set a 30 - day public comment period , which was extended for an additional 30 days .
Conservation groups urged a 120 - day period for comment from the public and Congress , and said comments should be allowed by fax and e-mail in addition to paper letters , the only form now accepted .
“ The abbreviated timeline and restrictive commenting options raise serious concerns that the Department of the Interior is attempting to rewrite a bedrock environmental statute without allowing for anything approaching adequate public involvement , ” the environmental groups said in a letter to the Interior Department ’s Fish and Wildlife Service .
Chris Paolino , an Interior Department spokesman , said scientific consultation occurs in the planning phase of federal projects , and that these scientists do not simply “ rubber stamp ” government efforts .
The aim of the proposed rule change , Paolino said by telephone , “ is to streamline the process a little bit , remove red tape where we can and remove the backlog of consultations that had developed over the last 30 years and allow for those projects where there ’s an accepted ‘ no negative impact ’ to an endangered species to move forward . ”
The Bush administration has been widely criticized for its record on endangered species .
Since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 , 58 species have been added to the list , compared with 522 during the eight years of the Clinton administration and 231 in the four - year presidency of George H.W. Bush , the current president ’s father .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has three options to avoid his political Waterloo and the defeat of the Conservative government in a confidence motion on Monday ( December 8 ) :
1 . He can prorogue Parliament , which basically means shut it down just after it started , and resume in January with a speech from the throne .
2 . He can ask Governor General Jean to call an election and hope she agrees .
3 . He can step down as Conservative leader to make way for a more moderate replacement , such as Jim Prentice or Peter MacKay , and hope that this is sufficient to cause the Liberals and NDP to abandon their plans to form a coalition government .
The opposition parties are doing this in part because Harper has repeatedly demonstrated that he does n't always play by the same rules as other politicians .
The Conservatives under Harper took attack ads to new heights when the bought time on television and radio long before an election to ridicule Liberal Leader Stephane Dion .
The Conservatives also falsely described the carbon tax as a " gas tax " on radio ads during the election campaign , even though the Liberals explicitly stated that it did n't apply to retail gasoline .
Harper claimed that the revenue - neutral carbon tax — which was really a tax shift accompanied by large tax cuts — was going to " screw everybody " .
He should n't be surprised to see the opposition leaders ganging up on him now .
It 's payback time .

Here I had been thinking that the wild - eyed foamers at the mouth who were driven nearly to madness by the prospect of Barack Obama 's election to the presidency were going to wait until Obama actually did something to offend them before going nuts again .
But no .
Those who spent most of the 1990s seething that Bill and Hillary Clinton were serial murderers and who devoted the entire 2008 campaign cycle to painting Obama as a mysterious radical are n't relaxing during the transition .
Much of their energy these days is devoted to the effort to block Obama from assuming the presidency on the grounds that he's not a " natural - born citizen " of the United States , as the Constitution requires .
Their hopes rest on several false and farfetched propositions .
And they rely , in the end , on either the Supreme Court or Congress being willing to create political chaos during already very frightening and perilous times based on various idiosyncratic interpretations of constitutional language and other statutes .
The Tribune has explained the error of their ways in several stories , and after I added an approving " me too " at Change of Subject last week , I was flooded with furious and patronizing e-mail from all over the country .
Many of these zealots claim to be mere defenders of the Constitution .
But poke them , as I did in some instances , and out rushes the gassy blast of Bill - Ayers - Reverend - Wright - Tony - Rezko - Rashid - Khalidi - Occidental - College - Records and other points of concern that did not , to their dismay , turn the electorate against Obama .
Their little crusade wo n't go anywhere .
But to them that will mean only that the Supreme Court has joined the mainstream media and perhaps Congress in a great conspiracy to put a foreignlike man in the White House to launch a Marxist revolution with the help of his terrorist friends .
For four years , maybe eight , we 'll be hearing their shrill , tedious accusations , their daffy theories rooted in parsing and paranoia .
Up until the day Obama 's successor is sworn in we 'll be hearing about his middle name — it 's Hussein , have you heard ? — and why he should n't be counted as fully American .
I wish we had the luxury to be amused .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The dollar tumbled Tuesday against other major currencies , particularly the euro and the Japanese yen , after the Federal Reserve slashed U.S. interest rates to a record - low range of zero to 0.25 % .
The dollar index DXY , +0.24 % , a measure of the U.S. dollar against a trade - weighted basket of six currencies , fell to 79.921 , compared with 81.630 before the announcement .
" It is no surprise to see the U.S. dollar selling off aggressively as it is now the lowest - yielding [ Group of 10 ] currency , " said Kathy Lien , director of currency research at GFT , in a note to clients .
" This was the right move for a central bank that wants to be proactive and no longer just reactive . "
The central bank pulled out all the stops in its campaign to save the U.S. economy , promising to try an array of new economic measures to stimulate spending in addition to slashing interest rates .
The Federal Open Markets Committee established at target rate for the federal funds rate of 0 to 0.25 % , effectively reducing its key rate for overnight lending to banks by between 0.75 % and 1 % .
See The Fed .
Most Wall Street firms expected the U.S. central bank to cut its benchmark rate in half , although many economists had seen scope for a reduction all the way to 0.25 % .
The euro was buying $ 1.4097 , compared with $ 1.3792 before the announcement .
The British pound surged to $ 1.5590 , from $ 1.5335 .
The dollar fell to 88.92 Japanese yen , compared to 90.09 yen before the central bank 's decision was released .
The Fed 's move " intensifies the yield assault to the dollar , prompting the biggest two - day rally in the euro vs. the dollar on record [ a 4.82 % gain ] , following last week 's 5.24 % jump , leaving little chance for traders but to extend speculative and directional selling in the U.S. dollar , " wrote Ashraf Laidi , chief market strategist at CMC Markets .
Housing starts plunge
In economic news , housing starts plunged 18.9 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 625,000 , the lowest since the Commerce Department began keeping records in 1959 .
See Economic Report .
Separately , U.S. consumer prices fell in November at the fastest rate since 1932 , the Labor Department reported Tuesday .
The U.S. consumer price index fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.7 % , the Labor Department reported Tuesday , the biggest drop since the government began adjusting the CPI for seasonal factors in 1947 .
On a non-seasonally - adjusted basis , the CPI fell by 1.9 % , the biggest decline since January 1932 , at the nadir of the Great Depression .

Cheap , Cheap , Cheap , LCD Prices keep dropping :
Timing is everything with technology purchases .
At the rate LCD TV prices are dropping waiting 2 weeks could save your 20 % .
The Price plummet continues unabated , check out these amazing drops at Amazon :
Check out the massive slide in prices over the last 12 months :
Samsung , Sony , LG and Panasonic prices dropped 23 % over the Black Friday weekend , prices have since held
over the Black Friday weekend , prices have since held Prices have dropped 22 % in the preceding 12 months
in the preceding 12 months 32 " Value brand LCD TVs are now sub -$ 350
KILLER CHRISTMAS DEALS WITH AMAZON
Wait it out , they will get Cheaper .
Prediction : A $ 1000 TV today , will be $ 800 in 30 days .
Why the additional drop ?
Lower demand due to curtailed American spending
The typical American consumer is n't quite so loose with the wallet this year .
Unfortunately for TV manufacturers their production lines have built the goods , and unlike a fine wine , 42 " TVs do not get better with age .
LCD TV sales are up from 2007 , but lower than expected .
Corning left the glass machine on
Corning manufactures glass for 45 % ( on a per sq. foot basis ) of the LCD TVs produced in the world .
They have a oversupply of inventory and are predicting substantial pricing cuts in Q1 2009 .
The $ 199 LCD TV
Now that " value brands " have smashed the $ 500 barrier .
The big dogs need to lower their prices even more to get into the game .
When a 32 " TV is $ 199 at Costco , the Sony TV next to it better not be more than $ 500 .
It will simply sit on the shelf if it remains 50 % more as it is now .
Unless this was a Christmas gift , expect the price slide to continue .
These prices are trending like housing prices have in 2008 .
The Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) is reviewing its decision to list as " child pornography " the image on one version of the album " Virgin Killer " by the rock band The Scorpions hosted on Wikipedia – and might yet add Amazon US to its list of " blocked " sites for hosting the picture .
That could be disastrous for Amazon if it prevents people in the UK accessing its pages on the week that is expected to be the busiest online before Christmas .
The initial decision to block the image , taken on Friday , prevented UK contributors from editing the site , and blocked some people from seeing the site at all ( although they were still able to view it through Google 's cache ) .
That is because the IWF 's system adds both the URL of an image and of a page containing the image to its " blacklist " of pages to be blocked .
" Illegal sites often hide images in pages , " said Sarah Robertson , director of communications for the IWF .
The decision to ban the page , which was taken after consultation with the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection ( CEOP ) agency , is now being reviewed , Robertson said .
" The assessment was done in partnership with law enforcement . "
The Scorpions image was deemed to be " 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 , where 1 is the least offensive " , said Robertson .
The image was judged to be " erotic posing with no sexual activity " .
It depicts a young naked girl with her genitals obscured by a crack in the camera lens .
Robertson declined to say whether Amazon would be the next to be blocked .
She confirmed that the Amazon page containing the offending cover was referred to the IWF today , but that no decision would be taken while the review of the original decision was in progress .
She could not say how long the review of the original decision will take .
Typically it takes about 24 hours for a URL to go from initial referral to being added to the blacklist .
The decision has put the IWF 's methods and systems under the media spotlight .
Normally the IWF , which is paid for by the EU and through a levy on the internet industry , works quietly away in its Cambridge offices .
A team of four police - trained " analysts " plough through 35,000 URLs sent to them each year that are under suspicion of being obscene .
That works out to an average of 700 per week , or 140 per working day , or 35 per working day per analyst - giving each an average workload for a seven - hour day of 5 URLs per hour .
Typically about one - third of the URLs are deemed illegal .
If an image or text page contains obscene content and is hosted in the UK , the relevant ISP is contacted and the content removed .
But if it is hosted abroad , it is added instead to a " blacklist " to which access is prevented by BT's " CleanFeed " technology .
Any attempt to access that page returns a " Page Not Found " response .
" We were notified of this [ Wikipedia ] URL last Thursday and added it to our blacklist on Friday , " Robertson said .
The image under consideration was previously considered by the FBI in the US .
In an interview with a Portuguese magazine , the leader of the Scorpions said that the decision to use the image had not been the band's :
As the man and woman walked slowly towards the war memorial in Chicago last week , the figure of Barack Obama was instantly recognisable .
But as the pair hugged after laying a wreath in the ceremony , it was the young woman who caught the attention of the media and whose photograph flashed around the world .
It was difficult not to notice her .
As the President - in - waiting embraced her , it was clear that she was a double amputee .
Rarely has the human cost of America 's war in Iraq been so painfully and poignantly illustrated .
The woman was Tammy Duckworth , one of the most remarkable figures to emerge from the conflict .
Horribly wounded by an insurgent attack , the former helicopter pilot is now part of a wave of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans who are returning home and reshaping US politics .
They are running for office , heading government departments and campaigning on issues they care about .
Duckworth is now one of the most visible and high - profile among them .
There are even whispers that she might replace Obama in the Senate , taking the seat left vacant when he moves to the White House , or that he might appoint her to his cabinet as head of the Department of Veterans ' Affairs .
But on that cold Chicago morning last week , as Duckworth and Obama paid tribute to America 's war dead , it was not politics that were on Duckworth 's mind .
It was her former comrades - in - arms , recently redeployed back to the country where she lost her legs .
' I was actually thinking about my crew , ' she told The Observer .
Last week marked a doubly poignant anniversary for Duckworth , a petite and pretty half - Asian woman with a homely Midwestern accent .
Veterans of all wars were remembering their fallen comrades on 11 November , but the day after was Duckworth 's ' Alive Day ' , the fourth anniversary of her close brush with death .
The Alive Day is a tradition that sprang up in Vietnam as wounded American soldiers struggled to cope with the physical and emotional scars left by the injuries of war .
Now Duckworth is part of a new generation treading the same path and marking a fresh wave of Alive Days .
For Duckworth , 40 , commemorating the day that left her so horribly wounded was a bitter - sweet moment .
' It could be a horrible day , but I choose to celebrate it .
Every year we kind of have a big party .
I know it 's the day I lost my legs , but it is also the day that I survived and got my life back , ' she said .
On 12 November 2004 , Duckworth was a helicopter pilot in the Illinois Army National Guard .
She had persuaded her superiors to send her to Iraq when her unit was shipped out , just as she was about to be transferred elsewhere .
On that fateful date she had piloted her ' bird ' over Baghdad from landing zone to landing zone .
Her final stop had been in the green zone , where she had picked up milkshakes , stir - fry food and Christmas decorations .
Once back in the air , she heard the sound of bullets hitting the chopper .
' I remember hearing the tap - tap of small - arms fire .
I was reaching over for the GPS to record the location and then there was a giant fireball , ' she said .
The chopper had been hit by a rocket - propelled grenade fired by an insurgent .
Unaware of the extent of her injuries , Duckworth tried to help her fellow pilot , Dan Milberg , guide the stricken craft down .
But as she struggled she wondered why the pedals were not responding to her commands .
It never occurred to her that she no longer had any feet with which to press them .
' I did not realise my legs were already gone , ' she said , with a lightness of tone that belied the full horror of what she was describing .
' I mean , how many times a day do you ever look down to check if you still have your legs ? '
The helicopter hit the Iraqi dirt and Milberg dragged her to a second aircraft for evacuation .
Her injuries were so bad that Milberg mistakenly assumed she was dead .
Instead she woke up eight days later at the famed Walter Reed military hospital back in the US .
Her husband , Bryan Bowlsbey , had been at her side for days , repeating a mantra - like chant to her as she lay unconscious : ' You were injured .
You are at Walter Reed .
You are safe . '
So began Duckworth 's new life .
Like thousands of injured Iraq veterans before and after her , she faced months of painful physical therapy and the mental anguish of coping with her loss .
But for Duckworth , her energies gradually began to focus around veterans ' rights and their health issues .
Walter Reed is a regular stop on many politicians ' rounds as they make trips both private and public to visit the wards .
Soon Duckworth found herself making contacts with politicians such as Senator Richard Durbin , Senator Obama and Congressman Rahm Emanuel .
It was Durbin in particular who persuaded the feisty and outspoken veteran to consider entering public life .
It was a long process .
By March 2005 she was taking her first steps on her artificial limbs .
Learning to walk again was her priority .
But by that summer Durbin wanted her to run for office as a Democrat in a local congressional seat in 2006 .
' I did not know if I wanted to put up with entering public life .
It is not an easy thing to do , ' she said .
' But then I realised that I spent all this time complaining about things not being done right for the troops .
Why not change the laws yourself ?
I like challenges and I thought , " it 's easy to complain , but it 's not so easy to change things " . '
She made the decision to get involved .
It could yet end with her as a high - profile face in the new Obama administration .
Changing things is now Duckworth 's focus .
She ran for Congress in Illinois , eventually losing a nail - bitingly close race in a previously solid Republican seat .
Then she became director of Illinois 's Department of Veterans ' Affairs , where she has raised the profile of veterans ' needs , especially the problems they face getting jobs when they return from duty .
She has testified before Congress regarding medical care and employment for returning veterans and spoke at this August 's Democratic party convention .
In 2006 she delivered an official Democratic response to one of President Bush 's weekly radio addresses to the nation .
In it she lambasted his policies on Iraq and the path the White House took in going to war .
' Instead of a plan or a strategy , we get shallow slogans like " mission accomplished " and " stay the course " , ' she said in the broadcast .
Now political office in Washington may be beckoning her .
Duckworth said she was flattered that her name was being bandied about , but insisted that she has had no talks with anyone about either a Senate seat or cabinet post .
However , she does say she is willing to serve if asked .
' I have been in the army for 18 years and when my commander - in - chief asks me to do something , I just grab my helmet , ' she said .
' If I was willing to go to Iraq for Bush , I would be willing to serve in any capacity for Obama that he asked me to . '
That sort of military attitude has defined Duckworth 's life .
Perhaps it also gave her the strength to overcome her injuries .
She was born in Thailand , the daughter of an American father and a Thai - Chinese mother .
She joined the army reserves at college and chose to train as a helicopter pilot because it was one of the few military jobs that could place a woman directly in combat .
She later joined the National Guard as she took a day job as a manager with Rotary International .
Amazingly , she displays no bitterness towards the war in Iraq .
' Anger is such a waste of emotion .
It is not worth it .
I am moving on ... I am not going to pick at that scab .
I learned in hospital not to pick at scabs , ' she said .
Duckworth believes firmly that the war was based on false intelligence and that the American public was sold lies .
But it still does not make her regret serving there .
' That does not diminish the honour and service of my buddies and me .
I would go back to Iraq if I could , ' she said .
In her dreams , she still does .
Duckworth has a recurring dream that is becoming less frequent now , but is often triggered by news reports from Iraq on television .
In it she has her legs back and is flying her chopper again .
' I go to sleep and in my dream I wake up in Iraq .
I get up and fly my missions .
I live an entire day .
At the end I am exhausted and I go to sleep .
When I wake up I am in Illinois , ' she said .
The dream carries with it a mixed bag of emotions .
' I am happy because I am flying again and I have my legs and I am doing my job , ' she said .
But for Duckworth , her experiences on the battlefield have changed that job for ever .
She now has a fresh mission , one that has already taken her into the heart of American political power , carried on new legs of steel .
Presidents and presidential contenders whose military records helped propel them to the political front line
John McCain
McCain was a navy pilot from a distinguished American military family .
He was shot down over Vietnam and spent five years as a prisoner of war .
He was beaten and tortured and emerged a hero .
His war record led him into politics and was enough to win him a Senate seat and this year the Republican nomination for president .
John Kerry
The Senator from Massachusetts was picked as the Democratic nominee for president in 2004 .
His record as a Vietnam veteran , on the dangerous Swift boat missions , should have shored up his credentials but instead came under fire and ' Swift Boating ' entered the political dictionary as a description for dirty tactics .
George Bush
The elder Bush was a veteran of World War Two who flew dangerous bombing missions against the Japanese in the Pacific .
On one mission his plane was hit by enemy fire and set ablaze .
Bush guided the stricken craft to complete his bombing run and then bailed out .
He was rescued by a submarine .
Theodore Roosevelt
The dashing two - term president of the early 20th century was an action hero come to life .
An avid hunter and outdoorsman , he rode to the White House on a wave of public support after his heroics in the Spanish - American war of 1898 .
Roosevelt is the only president to have been awarded the Medal of Honour , America 's highest military honour .
Abraham Lincoln
Perhaps America 's most loved , famous and respected president , Lincoln is known for his civilian leadership and victory in the Civil War , though he did serve three short tours in the Black Hawk War of 1832 in Illinois , one of many conflicts with Indians as the country expanded westwards .
He later wrote he had not had '... any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction ' .
George Washington
America 's founding president also led the country 's military victory against the mighty British Empire .
He led the colonists ' Continental Army to victory in a war that lasted from 1775 to 1783 .
He was an inspiring leader and master tactician who also fought in the French and Indian War in the 1750s .
He remains the only president to have been elected with 100 per cent of the electoral college votes .
Sex offenders win landmark ruling that being on register ' indefinitely ' breaches their human rights
Rapists and paedophiles must be given the chance to erase their names from the sex offenders register , judges ruled yesterday .
The law which puts serious sex offenders on the register for life violates their human rights , three High Court judges said .
The decision , reached over the rights of a child rapist and an adult paedophile , was greeted with ' extreme disappointment ' by the Home Office , which runs the register .
The High Court in London where two sex offenders won a landmark ruling that staying on the register indefinitely is in breach of their human rights
It came less than a fortnight after Justice Secretary Jack Straw told the Daily Mail of his ' frustration ' with the courts ' use of the Human Rights Act .
Sex offenders now join a list of apparent wrongdoers who seem to have benefited under the Act and in particular its eight article .
Beneficiaries of the article , which guarantees the right to privacy and family life , include murderers protected from deportation .
Police and experts believe many paedophiles and rapists are unlikely ever to cease being a danger .
The test cases involved a teenager known as ' F ' and Angus Thompson , a paedophile from Newcastle .
The boy , now 16 , who is from Wigan , was 11 when he raped another child .
He was sentenced to 30 months ' youth custody at Liverpool Crown Court in October 2005 for two rapes and a series of other serious offences .
He was released in January 2007 .
Thompson was jailed in 1996 for five years for two indecent assaults on a girl and other offences .
He was released in 2000 .
Under the Sex Offences Act 2003 , sex offenders sentenced to 30 months or more ' shall be subjected for life ' to being on the register .
But Lord Justice Latham , sitting with Mr Justice Underhill and Mr Justice Flaux , said the law was incompatible with article eight of the Act .

Kick , kick , kick ... crunch
Oops , did your Rock Band drum pedal break ?
It 's probably not the most suitable piece of plastic when you think about how many times it 's going to be stomped on during game play .
Was the inclusion of this breakable pedal just crap planning , or was it something more deliberate ?
The lawyers for Kansas resident Monte Morgan think that Rock Band 's makers were out to " cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money ” by selling kit with a " design defect , " says GameCyte .
That 's why they 've hit Harmonix , MTV , EA and Viacom all with a class action lawsuit .
From the complaint :
Due to a design defect , the bass drum foot pedal ( which is an integral component of the Rock Band drum kit ) fractures under ordinary and expected usage , thus rendering the pedal inoperative .
Without a functioning bass drum foot pedal , consumers are unable to use the Rock Band drum kit or play the Rock Band game in the manner marketed and advertised by Defendants , thus depriving them of the value and enjoyment of their purchases .
What sucks for them is that they extended the Rock Band warranty for customers up until October 1st of this year .
Unfortunately , this extension might end up as proof that Harmonix realized that the pedals were defective .
What 's worse is an image that GameCyte dug up , above .
The " improved " drum pedal market points to something being wrong with its predecessor .
On top of that , the Plantiffs allege that the warranty expiration was timed to drive existing owners of defective kits to purchase the new game .
The defendants are seeking unspecified damages , and want the court to order an injunction , which could have Rock Band listed as defective and removed from shelves .
I do n't think anyone will stand up and say that the pedals do n't suck .
It remains to be seen whether this was a deliberate scheme or not .
[ Update : Harmonix / MTV Games have issued an official statement , calling the lawsuit " opportunistic and baseless .
The full story can be found here . ]
A Libyan cargo vessel weighed down with 3,000 tonnes of food , medicine , and other humanitarian goods , was barred from entering the Gaza Strip yesterday by the Israeli navy .
Palestinian officials say they expect the vessel to attempt to reach the Gaza Strip again .
Andy David , a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry , defended to move , saying Israel ’s policy on the naval blockade was “ very clear , ” He said Israeli naval ships approached the aid boat and ordered it via radio to turn back , adding “ Anyone wishing to transfer humanitarian aid into Gaza is welcome to do it in coordination with Israel and through the regular crossings . ”
Yet this has not been the case in recent days , after an Israeli raid on the strip earlier this month sparked an exchange of strikes and a full closure on the strip .
Since then , Israel has only occasionally allowed small amounts of humanitarian aid across the border , and has expressed public outrage at the suggestions of UN officials that refusing to allow food ( and officially barring the importation of shoes ) into a small region inhabited by 1.5 million people was a “ direct contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law . ”
Israeli officials condemned concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “ utterly shortsighted ” and have insisted that their refusal to allow basic humanitarian aid into the strip is entirely the fault of the Hamas government .
The crossings were expected to open briefly last Thursday ( coincidentally Thanksgiving in the United States ) , but the government decided against it after a rocket landed in an empty field in southern Israel , doing no damage and causing no injuries .
Since then no aid has been permitted to enter Gaza by land or , as witnessed today , by sea .
Internet users could boost the value of their homes by buying fibre connections to them , according to a report .
( ( Uwe Lein / Associated Press ) )
What 's the best way to ensure " net neutrality ? "
Tim Wu , the Columbia Law School professor and Toronto native who first coined the term , has a simple suggestion : customer ownership of internet connections .
In a study released last Thursday , the same day the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission issued a verdict allowing Bell Canada Inc. to continue slowing certain internet uses ,
Wu suggested an access model that would allow home owners to purchase high - speed connections rather than rent them from service providers .
Under the " homes with tails " model , customers would purchase a fibre wire connection to their home that would provide speeds far in excess of what is generally available in North America today .
The fibre would be connected to existing open exchange buildings where a large number of telecommunications pipeline providers have equipment that forms the backbone of the internet .
Customers could therefore bypass cable and telephone companies , who today provide the " last mile " of connection between the exchange and the home , to access the internet and thereby video , voice and other services .
The model would also result in significant monthly cost savings because customers would only have to pay service providers for the true price of their services and not for infrastructure investment , the report said .
The majority of monthly internet bills today are to help cable and phone companies recoup the costs of building their networks .
Derek Slater , a policy analyst at Google Inc. who co-authored the report with Wu , says the most important effect of fibre ownership would be that customers could pick their internet connection from more than the two choices they currently have — typically a phone and a cable company .
That increased choice at the exchange level would guarantee net neutrality because if one provider started interfering with connections , customers could switch to one that did not , he says .
" Competition would ensure that consumers were in control of what they choose to use , access and share without any undue interference , " Slater says .
" Competition would be a bulwark against interference by network operators . "
( Although Google has an interest in increased internet usage , the company did not fund the report .
Slater says he helped
Wu co-author it out of his own interest . )
The idea could have specific relevance in Canada , where service providers are increasingly introducing network management measures that critics say are running afoul of net neutrality principles .
In Ontario alone , the two largest internet service providers — Bell and Rogers Communications Inc. — are both slowing peer - to - peer file - sharing applications such as BitTorrent .
Last week 's CRTC ruling ensured that many internet customers in the province will be unable to find unthrottled service at least until a net neutrality probe concludes a year from now .
Test project underway in Ottawa
As such , the fibre ownership idea is currently being tested in Ottawa under a pilot project headed by Bill St. Arnaud , the chief research officer for CANARIE , Canada 's non-profit advanced internet research network .
The Ottawa project is adding an additional incentive for consumers to buy their own fibre by tying its cost to energy usage .
About 300 internet users rallied on Parliament Hill in May to protest companies such as Rogers and Bell .
( ( Peter Nowak / CBC ) ) Under St. Arnaud's " green broadband " plan , the cost of the fibre connection is amortized over a five - year period and added to the owner 's monthly energy bill .
The fibre costs the consumer two cents per kilowatt hour of electricity they use , or the equivalent amount per cubic metre of gas , whichever the case may be .
Based on typical energy expenditures in Ottawa , a consumer would rack up a fibre cost of between $ 200 and $ 300 per year , or about $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 over the five - year lifetime , he says .
The scheme would encourage lower energy consumption , St. Arnaud says , because the fibre would effectively get cheaper as the consumer used less gas or electricity .
" Owning is not going to be sufficient incentive for the customer to make that investment , " he says .
" If we encourage them by this attraction of reducing their energy bill , saving them money and still giving them fibre , it 's a bigger inducement . "
Monthly savings on internet bills would also be significant , St. Arnaud says .
He estimates the true cost of service from Bell and Rogers to be between $ 2 and $ 15 , with the remainder of the monthly $ 40 - plus bill going to recouping infrastructure investment and profit .
Finally , fibre would count as an asset to a home owner .
According to Wu and Slater 's report , studies have found that homes with fibre connections are worth about $ 4,000 U.S. more than those without .
Concept faces obstacles
The idea faces a number of obstacles , however , not the least of which is convincing consumers to change their mindset toward ownership rather than rental of their internet connection .
That 's not an intractable barrier , the report said , since precedents have been set .
Computers , for example , were rented out to businesses before companies such as Apple introduced the idea of an owned personal computer .
" It will be strange to people at first , but the line between consumer property and businesses has changed over time , " Slater says .
" What may seem strange or challenging today may become much easier tomorrow or a few years from now . "
Industry analysts , however , say that 's not such an easy obstacle to overcome because ownership also means unwanted hassles .
" I can buy a water heater for a couple hundred bucks from Home Depot but I do n't want the problem of it , " says telecommunications industry consultant Mark Goldberg .
" If I rent it , it 's not my problem . "
Maintenance of the fibre connections would also be an issue .
Under the current system , cable and phone companies fix any problems that occur on their networks .
With the consumer - ownership model , a " condominium " system where households pay monthly maintenance fees would likely be necessary , which would cut into costs savings earned through bypassing a cable or phone provider .
" It 's not a free ride after you 've paid for the fibre , " Goldberg says .
" You need to have a fibre manager , and they 're not going to do it for charity . "
Incumbents likely to resist
The concept 's other major problem would be getting service providers to sign on .
Cable and phone companies are likely to resist getting cut out of monthly internet access revenue while the backbone service providers at the exchanges may not be willing to go into competition with those firms .
That 's exactly what 's happening in Ottawa , St. Arnaud says .
Despite already having strung fibre , mostly from streetside poles , to about 400 households , the project has been unable to find an exchange - based service provider willing to connect customers and go up against Bell and Rogers .
" The retail internet business in Canada has been destroyed .
All you 've got left in Ontario is Bell and Rogers , " he says .
" Nobody wants to make that kind of investment . "
One possible solution lays in convincing a big internet service provider from one region to expand into another .
Vancouver - based Telus Corp. , for example , could get into the business of selling fibre connections in Ontario , where it has no residential internet customers .
The problem there for Telus , however , would be the threat of repercussions from Bell or Rogers .
" Their concern is that they 'll come back and invade them on their own territory , " St. Arnaud says .
" They like the idea in somebody else 's territory , but not their own . "
Still , both Slater and St. Arnaud believe the concept can fly if only one service provider can be convinced to give it a try .
The point of the report , Slater says , was to get discussion of the concept moving and to encourage more experiments like the one in Ottawa .
" It 's a chicken - or - the - egg problem .
How do you get the service providers in on it if they 're not used to this model , and how do you get people to want to buy the fibre if there are n't service providers there to begin with ? " he says .
" These kinds of attitudes can change over time .
It 's not an insurmountable obstacle . "
If you bought a new video card two or three years ago , you 've probably noticed that newer games are n't running as well right out of the box .
Those GeForce 7900 and Radeon X1900 cards were fantastic when they were new , but game developers have caught up with more power - hungry graphics effects .
Frame rates have started to dip , and you might have had to reduce the game - resolution and image - quality settings to get system performance up to acceptable levels .
Lowering the image quality is n't a desirable long - term solution , so it 's probably time to upgrade that video card .
We 've gathered together a collection of video cards currently available online in the $ 150 to $ 250 price range .
We originally planned to make $ 200 the hard price ceiling , but we found the ATI Radeon HD 4870 and the GeForce GTX 260 Core 192 sitting just above the cap and we had to get them into the comparison because both cards offer a considerable amount of graphics performance .
Note that you 'll find a lot of these cards priced far above our estimated street pricing , but we used the lowest prices we could find at major online retailers for our estimates .
These basic video card packages generally ship without a pack - in game , so if you see a card at a much higher price , check to see if it comes with a game bundle such as Far Cry 2 .
These cards are n't the top - of - the - line performance champions , but they 'll have enough power to get you through a couple more years of PC gaming , and you can put the money you save on the video card toward buying more games and paying for that massively multiplayer online habit .
GeForce GTX 260 Core 192
The original GeForce GTX 260 that Nvidia launched in June 2008 came with 192 processing cores and a $ 399 price tag .
Nvidia had to lower the GTX 260's price to $ 299 after AMD released the highly affordable ATI Radeon HD 4870 .
Later in the year , Nvidia started shipping an improved GeForce GTX 260 with 216 processing cores .
Cards based on this new GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 GPU are selling for $ 299 .
The problem is that the video card makers still have a lot of the original 192 - core GeForce GTX 260 chips to unload .
The GeForce GTX 260 is the most expensive card in our roundup , coming it at $ 229 , but it has a lot of firepower and is considerably more affordable than it was just a few months ago .
Est. Retail Price : $ 229
ATI Radeon HD 4870
The ATI Radeon HD 4870 is the second $ 299 card that 's starting to approach the magical $ 200 price point .
Its closest competitor is the GeForce GTX 260 , which has a slight edge in frame rates and in games with PhysX support , but the Radeon has a few features that make it attractive for PC owners looking for a balance between gaming and utility .
That 's not saying that the card is n't good for gaming .
The Radeon HD 4870 can run all the latest games at high resolution thanks to its 800 stream processing units and GDDR5 memory , but the card is also great for PC game enthusiasts looking for home - theater support .
The card supports full HDMI output with 7.1 surround sound .
Est. Retail Price : $ 219
ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2
The ATI Radeon HD 3870 X2 is a dual - GPU card from the previous graphics generation .
We included the card in our comparison because you will still find it online at close to $ 200 , but you'd be wise to avoid buying one of these cards new because the Radeon HD 4870 has made them obsolete .
The Radeon HD 3870 X2 comes with 640 stream processors , 320 from each onboard GPU , but that 's well below the 4870 's stream processor count , and the 3870 X2 card also uses slower GDDR3 memory .
Est. Retail Price : $ 219
GeForce 9600 GT SLI
The dual - card value proposition Nvidia and AMD have tried to sell us with SLI and CrossFire is that you can buy a card now and add a second one later if you need more power .
The only problem with that argument is that if you wait more than a year to buy that second card , chances are you'd be able to buy a completely new card that 's more powerful than two of the old cards put together .
The cost of the new card would of course be more expensive than the older card , which would likely have dropped in price , but the performance gap between a new card and an older SLI setup makes the decision to complete the matching set a bittersweet choice .
The main benefit is that if you 've already sunk your money into a single GeForce 9600 GT card , spending another $ 100 on a second card will get your system 's graphics performance close to what you 'd get with a single $ 200 card .
Est. Retail Price : $ 200 ( $ 100x2 )
GeForce 9800 GTX +
The GeForce 9800 GTX + leads the trio of cards under $ 200 for players who can't justify reaching for the GeForce GTX 260 or ATI Radeon HD 4870 .
Nvidia introduced the GeForce 9800 GTX + this summer around the time AMD launched its Radeon HD 4800 - series GPUs .
The GeForce 9800 GTX + has the same number of processors as the regular GeForce 9800 GTX , but has higher clocks speeds thanks to a smaller manufacturing process .
Moving down from 65nm to 55nm allowed Nvidia to increase core clock speeds from 675MHz to 738MHz and shader speeds from 1690MHz to 1836MHz .
The GTX + originally sold for $ 229 , but the price has drifted down as the prices of more powerful cards have also moved down .
Est. Retail Price : $ 189
GeForce 9800 GTX
A $ 20 price difference might not seem like a big deal at the high end where cards can cost $ 400 or more , but the price difference becomes more important when card prices get below $ 200 and a $ 20 difference can mean more than 10 percent of the cost of the card .
The GeForce 9800 GTX may be slower than the GTX + , but some people might be willing to give up 9 percent in performance for a more affordable card .
Adventurous card owners can also try overclocking to recoup the lost performance .
Est. Retail Price : $ 169
ATI Radeon HD 4850
It seems unfair to stick the ATI Radeon HD 4850 into the same comparison as the Radeon HD 4870 , but we found several 4850 cards floating in the $ 159 to $ 185 price range .
The Radeon HD 4850 has 800 stream processors , just like the Radeon HD 4870 , but it has a slower core clock , 625MHz compared to 750MHz on the 4870 , and comes with only GDDR3 memory .
All of the multimedia features , including high - definition video playback and HDMI output support , are the same , but the differences in core clock speeds and memory bandwidth make the 4870 a better choice for games .
Est. Retail Price : $ 169
Performance Benchmarks
We did n't see any cards stand out with an exceptional price - to - performance ratio , but that just means that card pricing has fallen in line with relative performance .
We may not have seen any surprise bargain cards outperforming more expensive options , but we did see one card , the Radeon HD 3870 X2 , fail to score in line with its pricing .
However , that was expected because we already knew that the 3870 X2 had inferior specifications compared to the similarly priced Radeon HD 4870 .
The GeForce 9600 GT SLI setup offers an interesting $ 100 upgrade option for existing 9600 GT owners especially if they 're Fallout 3 fans ( you already have an SLI motherboard installed , right ? ) , but it might not be the best choice for buyers that do n't already have a 9600 GT card .
System Setup : Intel Core2 QX9770 , eVGA 780i , 4GB Corsair XMS Memory ( 1GBx4 ) , 750 GB Seagate 7200.11 SATA Hard Disk Drive , Windows Vista 32 - bit SP1 .
Graphics Drivers : Nvidia Forceware 180.48 , Catalyst 8.11 .
Conclusion
Going for the more expensive card such as the GeForce GTX 260 or ATI Radeon HD 4870 will result in better performance .
That conclusion may sound obvious , but that sometimes is n't the case in the $ 200 video card segment .
Usually one or two extraordinary value cards pop up and throttle the competition around the holidays , the GeForce 8800 GT would be a recent example , but that has n't happened this year .
AMD is rolling with the ATI Radeon HD 4870 and 4850 , two cards released almost six months ago , and Nvidia is holding on with the GeForce 9800 GTX and 9800 GTX + while waiting for its card partners to unload the last of their original GeForce GTX 260 chips .
Nvidia made a play for the $ 299 segment by releasing the GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 , but neither company has introduced new cards to target the sub -$ 200 market .
The biggest news is the fact that AMD and Nvidia have allowed the Radeon HD 4870 and GeForce GTX Core 192 prices to fall down so far below their original MSRPs .
Do you know of any particularly good video card deals ?
Do you plan on upgrading your video card for any games this year ?

Do n’t be overconfident of that recent colonoscopy ’s clean bill of health .
That ’s the lesson of a new study suggesting that colonoscopies reduce the risk of dying from colorectal cancer not by up to 90 % , as believed , but by perhaps 60 % to 70 % .
Further , they ’re much better at finding problems in one side of the colon than the other .
“ Colonoscopy seems to prevent two - thirds of deaths on the left side , ” says Dr. Nancy Baxter , a colorectal surgeon and researcher at St. Michael ’s Hospital in Ontario , Canada , and lead author of the study .
“ But there ’s not much effect at all on the right . ”
She led a team of researchers who reviewed public health records in Ontario to identify more than 10,000 people , or “ case patients , ” ages 52 to 90 .
All had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer between January 1996 and December 2001 , and all had died of the cancer by December 2003 .
Advertisement
For each case patient , the researchers selected five controls who matched for age , sex , socioeconomic status and residence location but differed in that they were still alive at the time of the case patient ’s death .
The researchers then compared the percentage in each group that had received a colonoscopy between January 1992 and the date six months before the case patient was diagnosed with colorectal cancer .
Essentially , they were looking at a window of at least several years in which case patients and controls might have had colonoscopies .
And they tried to maximize the chances that a case patient ’s colonoscopy was done for simple screening purposes .
The study , published online last week in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine , confirmed that controls were more likely to have had a colonoscopy than were case patients .
That is , having a colonoscopy was associated with fewer deaths .
But the advantage of a colonoscopy was restricted to patients with cancer on the left side of their colon .
Experts suggest several explanations for the left - versus right - side difference .
For one thing , it ’s harder to examine the right side of the colon .
In a colonoscopy , the doctor inserts a scope at the lower left of the inverted - U - shaped colon , then moves it up , across and down to the lower right .
The process is a bit like maneuvering a very narrow , floppy garden hose through a long tunnel , says Dr. Jacques Van Dam , professor of medicine and director of endoscopy at the Stanford University Medical Center .

The actual exam is performed as the doctor withdraws the scope and looks for polyps .
A variety of tiny tools -- loops , snares , jaws with teeth -- can be passed through the scope and used to take out any growths the doctor finds .
On average , a colon is about a yard long , with several curves and sharp turns along the way .
It takes a good deal of skill and practice not only to reach the end without bumping into the walls ( which hurts the patient ) , but then to withdraw the scope slowly and not miss any polyps .
Physiology also complicates the right - side picture .
“ The stool is more liquid on the right side , ” Baxter says .
“ So it coats the lining and makes polyps harder to see . ”
But the right side of the colon is n’t just harder to examine .
Cancer on the right side is actually different from cancer on the left side .
“ They ’re like two different diseases , ” says Dr. Heinz Lenz , professor of medicine and preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center at USC .

Polyps on the left are generally mushroom - shaped , projecting out on a stalk , while polyps on the right side are generally flatter , with no stalk .
So polyps on the left are easier to see and to remove .
Besides , while most colorectal cancers develop from polyps , some develop directly from the lining of the colon .
This may happen more often on the right side , Baxter says .
In an additional complication , the most characteristic symptom of colorectal cancer -- blood in the stool -- does n’t occur with cancer in the right side , where symptoms may just be abdominal discomfort or pain , Lenz says .
For patients with these complaints , doctors are less likely to recommend a colonoscopy .
Right - side detection can probably be improved by improving colonoscopy technique and pre-colonoscopy preparation .
But because of the differences between left - and right - side cancers , it may be very hard , even impossible , to get right - side detection up to left - side standards .

The Canadian study was limited to some extent by its design and its data .
It was not a randomized , controlled trial , so it could n’t prove that colonoscopy causes a reduction in cancer deaths .
Also , the researchers did n’t have enough information to know for sure whether colonoscopies were for screening or diagnostic purposes .
Because they ’re performed when doctors already suspect disease , diagnostic colonoscopies are more likely to be followed by death than screening ones , which are performed on apparently healthy people .
The quality of colonoscopies keeps improving , Baxter says , so current colonoscopies may well be more accurate than the ones in the study , which were mostly done in the 1990s .
In any case , colonoscopy is a highly effective weapon against colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer in the United States , and the second most deadly , after lung cancer .
“ A 60 % to 70 % mortality reduction . . . should not be considered disappointing , ” Dr. David Ransohoff , a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina , wrote in an editorial with the study .

By comparison , mammograms are only associated with a 25 % reduction in deaths from breast cancer , and PSA testing has not been shown to reduce deaths from prostate cancer .
“ It would be dangerous if the study led doctors to recommend fewer colonoscopies , ” Lenz says .

Colonoscopy Q&A ;
Warning labels will be added to some colonoscopy drugs .
Duke University Medical Center scientists have made a significant finding that could lead to better drugs for several degenerative diseases including Huntington 's disease and Alzheimer 's disease .
Compounds that block the activity of a specific enzyme prevented brain injury and greatly improved survival in fruit flies that had the same disease process found in Huntington 's disease .
" We were able to prevent Huntington 's disease - like illness in mutant fruit flies by giving them orally active transglutaminase inhibitors , " said Charles S. Greenberg , M.D. , a Professor of Medicine and Pathology at Duke University Medical Center and senior author of the paper .
The drug blocks the action of an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase ( TGM2 ) .
TGM2 may damage cells by forming strong bonds between proteins .
Such bonding is beneficial for blood clotting which happens outside of cells , but if this type of bonding occurs inside cells , it can be harmful , Greenberg said .
The study appears in the current issue of Chemistry and Biology .
Huntington 's disease causes uncontrolled movement and mental deterioration that develops later in life , and though there is no cure , people can get tested to learn whether they have the gene that causes the devastating illness , Greenberg said .
Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease and polyglutamine diseases including Huntington 's disease may possibly be improved with the same compounds , said Thung S. Lai , Ph.D. , lead author and a Duke Associate Professor of Medicine .
" Our findings may also help to develop drugs that block the pathology related to transglutaminase 's action .
That action has been linked to the development of tissue fibrosis , organ failure and aging . "
While these compounds were promising in the animal system , they are several years away from entering any human trials , Greenberg said .
" We will be studying these compounds in diseases in which TGM2 produces tissue injury . "
For the study , Lai painstakingly screened 2,000 compounds .
Only two groups of drugs were found to be effective TGM2 inhibitors .
Some of the most potent TGM2 inhibitors were given to the fruit flies along with their food .
The most effective compound was a kinase inhibitor , a drug that had been developed several years ago for another purpose .
The other beneficial compounds fell into a category of drugs that attack a sulfhydryl group in a protein .
The next step is to use the effective compounds as the backbone for developing even more effective drugs , Lai said .
The scientists plan to test whether the TGM2 inhibitors they identified would prevent the fibrous tissue process that causes chronic renal , vascular and lung disease .
The work was funded in part by National Institutes of Health grants .
This study required extensive teamwork between several departments at Duke and a long - time collaborator at Wake Forest University .
Other authors on the paper include Yusha Liu , Tim Tucker , James R. Burke and Warren J. Strittmatter of the Duke Department of Medicine ; Kurt R. Daniel and David C. Sane of the Department of Internal Medicine - Cardiology , Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston - Salem , N.C. ; and Eric Toone of the Duke Department of Chemistry .
You know what is shocking about the growing list of bailouts ?
It is n’t that we come out with a new bailout even before the ink is dry on previous action .
What is striking is the amazing disregard for the future generations of our country .
You do realize as a nation that we are broke right ?
So every action that we take to intervene in the markets is done via two methods .
One , we borrow the money which has been the status quo .
The second method is printing money which given the magnitude and the commitment of funds will shortly arrive at our doorstep .
It does n’t seem like many people care about the moral responsibility of leaving a better country for those that come after us and once again this selfish egocentric give me everything now mentality is dominating Wall Street and Washington .
God forbid that consumers will have to watch their spending for even one freaking holiday season .
You would n’t want your kid to go another year without that third edition of Tickle me Elmo .
What is disturbing is we have yet to hear from anyone for nearly an entire decade two simple words :
“ Stop spending ! ”
Stop buying homes you ca n’t afford .
Stop leasing cars that eat up 40 to 50 percent of your net income .
Stop using your credit card as your personal loan shark .
Stop taking on massive amounts of debt .
Stop spending money you do not have !
Most reasonable people would agree with the above .
But how can Wall Street and Washington ask this of our American citizens when they do the exact opposite .
They spend more than they have .
They run deficits as if they were going out of fashion .
Fiscal responsibility is not allowed in Washington .
Wall Street is the puppet master coming with hat in hand begging for money after they are the machine that created the ecological system for this credit fungus to spread .
And why do they want this money ?
To feed the hamster so he can go back on the consumer wheel and keep on spending until he flies off it due to exhaustion .
Where is the outrage that rose up when the $ 700 billion TARP plan was initially announced ?
This is really a bipartisan issue here .
In fact , much of the uproar around this came from both sides of the aisle .
It is patently absurd that here we are , having Paulson announce another $ 800 billion with $ 200 billion of that going to support consumer debt !
Does anyone pause for two minutes and think , “ if people actually saved a little bit of money , they would n’t need credit to buy 2 Taco Bell Chalupas ? ”
I saw someone using their credit card to buy a freaking $ 1 taco !
And this is the market we are trying to unfreeze ?
No wonder why Wall Street and our enabling government are flat broke and begging like vagabonds for handouts .
New Home Sales and Prices Fall
You might have missed it but the housing numbers were horrific yesterday .
The median price dropped to $ 183,000 nationwide , the biggest yearly decline on record .
New home purchases in October were at their lowest point in half a century .
You might have missed this important piece of information since it was a bailout free money orgy spectacular yesterday with the Citigroup bailout .
Your head might have been spinning as if you jumped off a cliff with a bungee cord into a pool of money and had three bounces to collect as much cash as you can .
That ’s what things have been like these last few months .
It has been a free money orgy .
Even back in June , I recall having a debate about a $ 25 billion assistance to home builders and the uproar that caused .
Now the U.S. Treasury can unilaterally commit us to $ 306 billion in one Sunday evening .
What the hell has happened ?
Remember the outrage over the crony capitalistic FHA bailout for home borrowers ?
As it turns out , that program now looks like a blessing and something we should have in relation to what is currently being dished out in the buffet of stupid finance theatre .
If you carefully scour the data however , there was a piece of good news in the data .
Prices in the west fell mightily .
The median price dropped to $ 231,400 as reported by the NAR which translates to a 27 percent drop from last year .
What a shock , that for the region sales are up 41 percent from last year .
Who would have thought that pricing a home at a reasonable price would get people to start buying again ?
Seems like the market is clearing homes out so long as they are priced right .
The Case - Shiller Index data was released today and once again shows spectacular declines :
* Source : Calculate Risk
The national index now has prices off by 21 % from their peak .
As you can see from the chart above , out of the 6 top declining cities 5 of them are here in the southwest .
3 of the 6 are here in sunny California .
This once again supports my thesis that home prices will not bottom until May of 2011 .
You do realize that we have a boat load of option ARM mortgages set to recast next year ?
Next year will be our first test in terms of large numbers to see how the state can handle this oncoming tsunami of what is arguably the most toxic of all loans .
People now point out that the government will suck these loans onto their books so all is fine .
Well even if the government takes ownership of these loans it does n’t remove the fact that the borrower is still in a load of trouble .
So the government now owns the loan .
All we have done is taking the problem away from an irresponsible lender to the U.S. taxpayer .
It does n’t solve the cash flow situation of the borrower .
That is what we are left dealing with .
And as I made the point above , we are broke .
Bloomberg has a nice little diagram showing that the government has now committed us to $ 7.7 trillion in “ assistance ” to getting us out of this mess .
Take a look at this chart :
Keep in mind the above graph does n’t include the $ 306 billion committed to Citigroup and the recent expansion announced by Paulson .
It is simply an insane amount .
Given that our GDP is $ 13.8 trillion we ’ve just committed over 50 % of that amount to the toxic welfare mortgage credit boondoggle program of America .
Or if you prefer , we ’ve just committed the yearly GDP of Brazil , Canada , Spain , and Italy combined to these programs :
And even with all these commitments the markets are still down over 40 % from their peaks !
You imagine what kind of amazing rally we ’d have if we just flat out injected $ 7.7 trillion into the stock market ?
It would be like a 4th of July for the markets and the ticker would be hemorrhaging green for days .
We ’d have to use a wheelbarrow with dollars to purchase bread but at least we ’d feel better .
Or we would all be issued U.S. Treasury Visa cards directly linked to the TARP fund .
The catch would be this .
You have to spend as much as you can and as quickly as you can because it would be on a first come first served basis .
The fund would be limited to $ 1 trillion so you ’d have to act fast sort of like how Wall Street banks are right now .
They have served as a perfect model of excellence if we institute a program like this .
You may think this idea is out of the box but look at what we are dealing with right now .
Can you believe no significant perp walks have taken place ?
We need to hold those accountable and put them in prison .
We need to demand this .
A bank robber who gets away with $ 50,000 will face many decades behind bars .
Here , you lose a few billion for your bank and you get additional funds .
What a great message we are sending here .
Even Franklin D. Roosevelt went after the “ money changers ” during his inaugural address during the Great Depression :
“ Yet our distress comes from no failure of substance .
We are stricken by no plague of locusts .
Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid , we have still much to be thankful for .
Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it .
Plenty is at our doorstep , but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply .
Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind ’s goods have failed , through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence , have admitted their failure , and abdicated .
Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion , rejected by the hearts and minds of men .
True they have tried , but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition .
Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money .
Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership , they have resorted to exhortations , pleading tearfully for restored confidence .
They know only the rules of a generation of self - seekers .
They have no vision , and when there is no vision the people perish .
The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization .
We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths .
The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit . ”
There better be some justice here .
But seeing how we have the money changers now running the show , how likely is this in 2009 ?
Hopefully we can see beyond party lines and hold those accountable for the biggest financial mess since the Great Depression .
Keep in mind that during the 1930s trial after trial held these masters of the world in contempt and put them in jail .
We should demand the same today since their crimes are equally if not worse than those of that time .

Alliance forms to fix DNS poisoning flaw
Robert Lemos
SecurityFocus
An alliance of software makers and network - hardware vendors announced on Tuesday that they had banded together to fix a fundamental flaw in the design of the Internet 's address system .
 It is a fundamental issue affecting the design .
Because the system is behaving exactly like it is supposed to behave , the same bug will show up in vendor after vendor after vendor .
This one bug affected not just Microsoft ... not just Cisco , but everyone . 
The vulnerability in the domain name system ( DNS ) -- the distributed database that matches a host and domain name with the numerical address of a computer server -- could give an attacker the ability to replace the addresses of popular Web sites with that of a malicious server , said Dan Kaminsky , director of penetration testing for security firm IOActive .
Kaminsky found the flaw when he was doing non-security research on the domain name system ( DNS ) more than six months ago .
" It is a fundamental issue affecting the design , " Kaminsky said .
" Because the system is behaving exactly like it is supposed to behave , the same bug will show up in vendor after vendor after vendor .
This one bug affected not just Microsoft ... not just Cisco , but everyone . "
On Tuesday , a number of software and network - hardware vendors released patches for their products .
On its regularly scheduled patch day , Microsoft released updates for Windows 2000 , Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to mitigate the issue , which the company ranked an Important vulnerability , its second highest grade of severity .
Internet Software Consortium , the group responsible for the development of the popular Berkeley Internet Name Domain ( BIND ) server , also released a patch , confirming that its software contained the vulnerability .
Both Cisco and Juniper also acknowledged flawed systems .
Vendors have also provided the fix to certain large clients .
Yahoo will be upgrading their name servers from BIND 8 to the latest version of BIND 9 , the Internet Software Consortium stated during the conference call .
Internet service provider Comcast has already patched their servers for the issue , according to Internet infrastructure firm Nominum .
Finally , the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) Coordination Center has contacted some other nation 's response groups to inform them of the problem .
For the most part , however , Internet service providers and companies each received the fix on Tuesday , said Sandy Wilbourn , vice president of engineering at Nominum .
The goal :
To have every major service provider and company apply their software patches in 30 days .
For that reason , do n't expect immediate action , Wilbourn said .
" For key customers on our network , we have made a special effort to get them an early release to help solve this problem , and a number of them have finished deployment , " he said .
" But the nature of this patch is that we wanted to get the vendor side covered and then have deployment over the next 30 days .
Anyone that is not patched by today or tomorrow is not doing anything wrong . "
The domain - name system ( DNS ) has been a popular way to attack the Internet in the past -- it 's an ill - kept secret that the DNS system is insecure .
The way that many software applications , such as browsers , handle DNS requests has opened up users to attack .
Microsoft has fixed a few vulnerabilities in the way Windows handles domain names -- issues that could have lead to easier eavesdropping or simpler phishing attacks .
While Kaminsky and other Internet protocol experts that discussed the issue on Tuesday would not give specific details of the flaw , a CERT vulnerability note described the issue as a combination of DNS weaknesses .
While the CERT note referred to the issue with a single Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ( CVE ) identifier , Microsoft , in its security bulletin , referred to the issue as two flaws : a DNS socket entropy vulnerability and a DNS cache poisoning vulnerability .
The CERT vulnerability note describing the issue lists more than 90 software developers and network equipment vendors that may be affected by the issue .
WASHINGTON  When Representative Jan Schakowsky , an Illinois Democrat , began exploring whether she might fill Barack Obama ’s seat in the United States Senate , she called Rahm Emanuel .
They served in the House together and , more important , he had just become chief of staff to the newly elected president .
But Mr. Emanuel was uncharacteristically circumspect .
If Mr. Obama had a favorite , Mr. Emanuel was not saying .
And to Ms. Schakowsky , he seemed wary about Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich , who would be making the appointment .
“ Rahm always has good intelligence , ” she recalled .
“ In this case , he really did n’t .
It was not clear to him what the governor was going to do , or at least he did n’t share it with me . ”
For the Obama team in the days after his election to the presidency , the question of who would succeed him in the Senate was a sensitive one .
With a new administration to build and a financial crisis worsening by the day , Mr. Obama and his advisers had bigger issues on their plate .
Moreover , they wanted to keep their distance from Mr. Blagojevich , who was already known to be under federal investigation into possible corruption .
But many still assumed that Mr. Obama ’s voice would be critical if he chose to weigh in .
Exactly what role he or his team played will be a focus of intense scrutiny in the weeks to come after the arrest of Mr. Blagojevich on accusations that he was plotting to trade or sell the Senate appointment .
In that sense , the furor could be the first test of the Obama team ’s ability to manage a growing scandal in an era when intense media scrutiny and partisan attack machinery can escalate any flap into a serious political problem .
Julian King 's Body Found in White SUV ( Photos )
Julian King 2001 - 2008
The Cook County Medical Examiners office is processing a crime scene on a Chicago street and have found the body of missing , nephew of actress .
Illinois State Police Lt. confirmed that the Amber Alert has been canceled for the vehicle and for Julian .
They are no longer looking for the car or the missing child .
Police had been searching for a white SUV that has been missing since Friday .
It was located on a Chicago street this morning , reportedly with the young boys body inside .
The 1994 Chevrolet Suburban , with a license plate number matching suspect William Balfour's , was discovered on the 1300 block of South Kolin Avenue at 8:00 a.m .
The vehicle has been towed away for evidence processing .
Balfour , 27 , has been held by police since Friday following the discovery of the bodies of Darnell Donerson and Jason Hudson .
He is the estranged husband of Julia Hudson , Julian 's mother and Jennifer Hudson 's sister .
Police had initially found spent gun casings in the boys bedroom .
The seven year old had not been seen since the discovery of Hudson 's murdered mother and brother at their Chicago home .
Julian 's mother had been hopeful that he had simply been hiding after witnessing the brutal slaying of his grandmother and uncle .
Hudson made a plea on her website over the weekend , offering a $ 100,000 reward for the safe return of the boy .
Check out the entire story here .
Police Supt .
Jody
Weis confirmed that the body found on Chicago 's West Side is that of 7 - year - old Julian King .
Two black SUV 's carried approximately a dozen family members to the Cook County medical examiner 's office at 3:00 p.m. this afternoon and the group departed without comment at 3:54 p.m .

One weekafter two anomalous events caused a snag in NASA 's attempt to revive the HubbleSpace Telescope , the orbital observatory is nearly back up and running , withscience operations set to resume this weekend .
" Weare up to the same place we were at about 8 o'clock Wednesday night of lastweek , " with the telescope control systems running , but its instrumentsstill in safe mode , said Art Whipple , manager of the HubbleSystems Management Office at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center inGreenbelt , Md .
The newglitches cropped up while engineers were attempting to switch to a backupdata relay channel in the 18 - year - old observatory 's Science Instrument Controland Data Handling system after the primary channel failedon Sept. 27 .
The primary channel , called Side A , had been working properlysince the telescope launched in April 1990 .
The data relay channels allow thespacecraft to send its images of the cosmos back to Earth .
The switchto the backup channel , called Side B , was a tricky maneuver that required theactivation of five other backup systems that had also been in hibernation sinceHubble 's launch .
Themaneuvering " just made the timing too tight , " Whipple said in aThursday teleconference .
One of theglitches occurred when a component of Hubble 's main camera returned a lowerthan normal voltage , while the other involved a communications drop between thespacecraft 's main computer and the one that controls its science instruments , called the payload computer .
Theglitches caused both the payload computer and the Side B data formatter toreset .
The switch to Side B was , however , successful , and as of 11:15 a.m. EDT ( 1515GMT ) today , the payload computer was back up and running .
Whatexactly caused the reset is remains a mystery , Hubble managers said .
" Wecannot know the exact cause , of course , because we can not get to the hardware .
All we can say is that it appears to have been to have been an electrical event , " Whipple said , ruling out any software or commanding errors .
Whipple saidthat " it is possible that we may see another event of this type in thefuture . "
Fortunately , the electrical event " does not appear to have done any permanent damage , " Whipple said .
If thepayload computer stays operational for the remainder of this week , the Hubble teamwill switch on the telescope ?s
Wide Field Camera 2 and once more resume scienceoperations .
The initialglitch with the Side A relay channel postponed the planned Oct. 14 launch ofthe space shuttle for its next , and last , Hubble repair mission until early2009 .
Every month that the shuttle mission to service Hubble is delayed costsNASA $ 10 million , mission managers have said .
When theastronauts do getup to Hubble , they hope to replace the tray that houses both Sides A and B .
The mission is also slated to install a new camera , replace gyroscopes andbatteries , upgrade Hubble 's guidance equipment and add a docking ring .
Samuel L. Jackson Disses L.A. Alcoholics Anonymous
Pulp Fiction starhas been open about his addiction issues with alcohol and other illegal substances .
Now Jackson talks about his dissatisfaction with Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in L.A .
He may be 18 years sober but he would still like to be in some kind of help group setting to assist him in steering clear of temptation .
It sounds like Los Angeles is n't the place for Sam :
" It 's just too weird .
You hear guys saying stuff like , ' I 've been hitting the red wine too heavy and I need to stop , but I want to keep smoking reefer ( cannabis ) and doing cocaine . '
In New York , rehab is for real .
You sit next to guys who were IV users , guys who stole s# ! , guys who sold their bodies .
In Los Angeles you are sitting next to a guy who wants to go easy on the fine wine .
Man , that 's a symptom of something right there . "
Wow , that is quite a mouthful and our guess is that Jackson may have offended half of L.A. with his insightful comments .

In Berlin hat sich am Wochenende das European Network for Copyright in Support of Education and Science ( ENCES ) formiert , das in Brüssel die Interessen von Bildung und Wissenschaft im Bereich der Urheberrechtsregulierung stärker vertreten will .
Das Netzwerk soll als EU - weites Pendant zum deutschen Aktionsbündnis " Urheberrecht für Bildung und Wissenschaft " agieren , das sich vor allem im Rahmen der ersten und zweiten Novellierung des Urheberrechts immer wieder für wissenschaftsfreundliche Bestimmungen einsetzte .
Die ENCES - Unterstützer haben sich auf die Fahnen geschrieben , dass Wissen und Informationen in digitaler Form für alle Nutzer überall zu jeder Zeit " unter fairen Bedingungen " verfügbar sein müssen .
Die Auftaktveranstaltung für ENCES fand im Rahmen eines Workshops ( PDF - Datei ) bei der Heinrich - Böll - Stiftung in Berlin statt , auf dem rund 30 namhafte europäische Wissenschaftler aus 12 Mitgliedsstaaten auf Initiative des Konstanzer Informationswissenschaftlers Rainer Kuhlen den Einfluss des Urheberrechts auf die Wissenschaftskommunikation berieten .
Man sei zu dem Ergebnis gekommen , dass komplizierte und vor allem die kommerzielle Verwertung von Wissen begünstigende Copyright - Regelungen in der EU derzeit den Austausch von Informationen behindern so dem Fortschritt der Wissenschaften in Europa und der Umsetzung von Wissen in innovative Produkte im Wege stünden , berichtete der Mitorganisator im Anschluss an die Tagung .
Deutlich geworden sei etwa die Notwendigkeit , die Urheberrechtsrichtlinie von 2001 zu korrigieren .
In diesem Zusammenhang begrüßten die ENCES - Gründer , dass die EU - Kommission auf Basis ihres Grünbuchs zum Urheberrecht in der Wissensökonomie offenbar bereit scheine , die bislang als abschließend betrachtete Liste der Ausnahmen von den exklusiven Ansprüchen der Rechteinhaber angesichts der dynamischen Entwicklung des Internet zu öffnen .
Die Tagungsteilnehmer appellierten an die Gesetzgeber in Brüssel und den Mitgliedsländern , dass weder vertragliche Vereinbarungen etwa zwischen Verlagen und Bibliotheken noch technische Schutzmaßnahmen die im Gesetz verankerten , ohnehin schon stark eingeschränkten Schrankenbestimmungen zugunsten von Bildung und Wissenschaft außer Kraft setzen dürften .
Auch könne es nicht angehen , dass die Urheberrechtsregulierung traditionelle , in der analogen
Welt entwickelte und nun obsolet werdende Geschäftsmodelle begünstige .
Wichtiger sei es , Anreize zu bieten , um dem estzustellenden " Marktversagen " auf den wissenschaftlichen Publikationsmärkten auch durch rechtliche Maßnahmen gegenzusteuern .
Die Forscher beklagen zudem , dass Bibliotheken " wegen der überhöhten Preispolitik der großen Wissenschaftsverlage " derzeit Forschern und Lehrenden sowie der allgemeinen Öffentlichkeit nicht mehr die Materialien bereitstellen könnten , die zuvor mit Unterstützung durch öffentliche Mittel entstanden seien .
Im Gegensatz dazu müssten etwa Regelungen zum " Open Access " gesetzlich verankert und eine kostenfreie Internetveröffentlichung einschlägiger Publikationen gesichert werden .
Die Urheberrechtsexperten riefen bestehende Wissenschaftsorganisationen und Forscher aller EU - Länder auf , sich an der Initiative zu beteiligen .
Zuvor hatte Bernt Hugenholtz , Professor am Institute for Information Law an der Universität Amsterdam , an den Präsidenten der EU - Kommission , Jose Manuel Barroso , einen offenen Brief ( PDF - Datei ) geschrieben , in dem er die aktuellen Vorschläge aus Brüssel zur Urheberrechtsreform kritisierte .
Verwundert zeigte sich der Forscher vor allem , dass die Ergebnisse der von ihm betreuten Evaluation der EU - Politik im Bereich des Schutzes immaterieller Güter beim Vorstoß der Kommission zur Verlängerung der Schutzfristen für Musikautoren von 50 auf 95 Jahre unberücksichtigt geblieben seien .
Somit würde die Kommission einmal mehr den Eindruck erwecken , von bestimmten Lobbygruppen aus der Industrie getrieben zu sein .
Der für den Binnenmarkt zuständige EU - Kommissar , Charlie McCreevy , antwortete ( PDF - Datei ) , dass auch eine in Auftrag gegebene Untersuchung keinen vorbereitenden Charakter für ein Gesetzgebungsverfahren habe .
Eingereiht in die Proteste aus der Wissenschaft gegen die geplante Ausweitung des Urheberrechtsschutzes für Tonaufnahmen hat sich eine von Martin Kretschmer , Rechtsprofessor an der britischen Bournemouth University , geführte Koalition .
Sie wendet sich an die EU - Abgeordneten und zerpflückt in einem Schreiben die Behauptungen der Kommission , wonach das Vorhaben vor allem Durchschnittsmusikern und nicht etwa Plattenfirmen oder alternden Stars wie Cliff Richard oder Johnny Hallyday zugute komme .
Unterzeichnet haben die Kritik auch die Cambridge - Forscher Lionel Bently und Rufus Pollock sowie Reto Hilty , Direktor des Max - Planck - Instituts für Geistiges Eigentum .

" We were initially interested in what plants are feeling and what they are reacting to where we can't see , " he said .
Errrmmm , we can do that ?
The full genome of the Neanderthal , an ancient human species probably driven to extinction by the first modern humans that entered Europe some 45,000 years ago , is expected to be recovered shortly .
If the mammoth can be resurrected , the same would be technically possible for Neanderthals .
In fact , Wade points out , there are good reasons to re-create a Neanderthal : “ No one knows if Neanderthals could speak .
A living one would answer that question and many others . ”
Whoa there , says Richard Doerflinger of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops : “ Catholic teaching opposes all human cloning , and all production of human beings in the laboratory , so I do not see how any of this could be ethically acceptable in humans . ”
Wade concedes that “ there would be several ethical issues in modifying modern human DNA to that of another human species . ”
I vote no .
Not that I give a liger ’s ass what the Catholic Church thinks , of course – in many cases condemnation by the Conference of Catholic Bishops would be enough to make me pro-whatever was under discussion .
But there are profound ethical issues here , and I see no evidence that we ’re ready to face them at this point in human ( that ’d be of the homo sapiens variety ) history .
Not that I ’m worried that said Neanderthal would necessarily unravel the fabric of polite society , but can we at least acknowledge the looming presence of Dr. Frankenstein ’s ghost in the discussion ?
Let me turn to a man who ’s a lot brighter than most Americans realize for some comment .
A few years ago England ’s Prince Charles delivered the commemoration address at Harvard University ’s 350th Anniversary celebration .
In that speech he lamented that humanity ’s intellect had advanced so tremendously while its ethical capacities had evolved so little .
“ In the headlong rush of mankind to conquer space , ” he said , we must teach our children “ that to live on this world is no easy matter without standards to live by . ”
In a 1996 speech devoted to the wisdom of genetic engineering , Charles invoked Mary Shelley ’s monster in opposing human intrusion into areas properly left to the divine .
I believe that we have now reached a moral and ethical watershed beyond which we venture into realms that belong to God , and to God alone .
Apart from certain medical applications , what actual right do we have to experiment , Frankenstein - like , with the very stuff of life ?
We live in an age of rights – it seems to me that it is about time our Creator had some rights , too .
No , I do n’t much care for this kind of deference to literal divinity , but there ’s much to be learned from an appeal to divinity as actualized ethical framework .
In that sense , as well as the more overtly spiritual sense intended , Prince Charles is describing a yawning gulf between our minds and our souls , and it is the magnitude of this gulf which feeds , if not defines , what I have termed the “ Frankenstein Complex ” – our deep - seated fear of the product of our own intellects .
Apparently some good folks are n’t nearly afraid enough .
What if we clone a Neanderthal – let ’s call him Charles after both Darwin and His Majesty – and he proves to be very , very human ?
What if he can speak , reason , laugh ?
What if he can sing and appreciates a good story ?
Do we keep him in a lab his whole life ?
A cage ?
Would n’t Charles deserve , in this instance , the same rights as any other human ?
An education , job training , an opportunity to earn a living ?
Would we clone him a mate ?
What if they did n’t get along ?
What if they had children ?
Would those children be allowed to play little league sports ?
Would he be allowed to vote ?
If not , why not ?
We already assure the franchise to people barely brighter than apes , so on what grounds would he be denied full citizenship ?
See the girl in the picture above ?
She ’s the Devil ’s Tower Neanderthal child , reconstructed from fragments found at the Gibraltar site .
Scientists believe these may have been among the last Neanderthals who survived the homo sapien onslaught .
For fun , let ’s pretend this is what Charles ’s daughter – let ’s call her Edna – looks like as she prepares for her first day at PS107 .
Now , you know how tough kids can be .
The fat kid , the ugly kid , the clumsy kid , the dumb kid , the shy kid – maybe you were one of these , or maybe you were the golden child who performed the daily rituals of torment and public humiliation .
In any case , imagine being the Neanderthal kid .
Try and envision the pain in those eyes each morning as she desperately tries to find some excuse to stay home today .
And try these words on for size : “ First - grade spelling – so easy even a caveman can do it . ”
I ’m sure there are better questions even than these few , which I came up with off the top of my head .
And until we have rock - solid answers for them , answers that align with the major moral and ethical codes that guide our lives in a modern world , how dare we even consider something so appalling ?
No , I ’m not coming down against genetic engineering or other forms of scientific research – on the contrary .
But I am saying that we should never conduct a program of science for which we do not have an appropriate ethics .
We should not allow our minds to evolve in a moral vacuum , nor should we risk subjecting an innocent to the full , daming force of our arrogance .

Are our brains being rewired by using the Internet ?
The evidence tends to be pointing that way .
As somebody interested in how the mind works , I read with interest the results of a recent study at UCLA that used the sexiest research tool around today , fMRI scanning .
fMRI allows researchers to see which parts of the brain are active when participants are exposed to different stimuli .
And for the first time I ’m aware of , this was used to track brain activity while people engaged in various online tasks , including searching .
First of all , the “ official ” story of the study .
Then I ’ll launch off into my own personal speculation , as the study raises some mind altering implications , and I use that term “ mind altering ” in it ’s literal sense .
The internet : Keeping aging brains limber
The objective of the study was to see if regular internet usage was more effective than other intellectually stimulating tasks in keep the brain limber in aging test subjects .
Gary Small , a professor the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA , along with Teena D. Moody and Susan Y. Bookheimer , will be publishing the study in an upcoming issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychology .
By the way , Small also has a book out which has just been added to my reading list : iBrain , Surviving the Technological Alteration of the Modern Mind ( after reading the book , I might have to rethink the opinion which follows ) .
In a nutshell , the findings were that “ emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle aged and older adults , ” and that “ internet searching engages complicated brain activity , which may help exercise and improve brain function . ”
This is a long way of saying that being online helps keep those little gray cells busy .
The level of brain activity was compared to that of reading a book .
With internet usage , a significantly bigger piece of neural real estate lit up on the fMRI indicating that more parts of the brain were engaged .
I was particularly interested in the comments on Internet searching , as it seems to line up with my beliefs on the subject .
Recently I tried to walk through the cortical and subcortical interplay that happens when we do a search .
I have also mused that online activity might be remapping our cortical networks .
It appears that this might be the case .
There was one particularly interesting finding in the study .
Not all brains fired up at the same level of activity .
In those without previous Internet experience , the variance between the level of activity reading and that while online searching was n’t significantly different , but in those with prior experience , activity was found in the frontal , temporal and cingulated areas of the brain , areas associated with complex reasoning .
The brain in these participants was getting a much more thorough workout .
The purpose of the study was to measure the effectiveness of online activity in slowing geriatric cognitive loss .
But for me , the more interesting implications come in understanding that the brain of Internet users may be remapping itself .
Or is Google making us stupid ?
Earlier this summer , the Atlantic ’s technology writer , Nicholas Carr , wrote an article entitled “ Is Google Making Us Stupid ? ”
“ Over the past few years I ’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone , or something , has been tinkering with my brain , remapping the neural circuitry , reprogramming the memory .
My mind is n’t going – so far as I can tell – but it ’s changing . ”
Now , the way Carr puts it , it sounds pretty ominous .
Remapping neural circuitry ?
Reprogramming the memory !
One gets the picture of a gremlin armed with wire cutters and a chain saw , having their way with our cortex .
But the fact is , “ remapping ” and “ reprogramming ” happens every day .
If it did n’t , you ’d never remember your phone number or where you lived .
The forging of new neural connections and the pruning of old ones are the basic functions of our brains .
It ’s how our brain works .
But the UCLA findings might indicate something more permanent , something related to the recent discovery that neuroplasticity , once thought to only be present in the very young , is now known to be a property of our brains throughout our lives .
By the way , Small ’s other work does show a significant divide between the online skills of the young ( Digital Natives ) and older generations ( Digital Immigrants ) .
First of all , let ’s understand how we learn .
Learning involves creating new neuronal firing paths .
Basically , as we learn we increase the potential of neurons responsible for storing the new knowledge to fire together .
Donald Hebbs called it “ fire together , wire together ” .
Each time the network of neurons fires , the potential to fire again is increased .
That ’s why things get easier , the more we do them .
In my cognitive walk through of searching explanation , I hypothesized about how the act of searching might pull concepts from various storage modules in the brain ( mental images , memories , brand associations , concepts , experiences , sounds , etc ) and bring them into the prefrontal cortex , enabling the synthesis required to make a click decision .
I ’ve said a number of times before that the act of searching is a complex cognitive ballet .
Looking at the fMRI image , it appears I was right .
But here ’s the thing .
In somebody with little or no previous experience with the Internet , the neuronal paths required to pull the information forward might not have been forged .
No neurons have been “ wired together ” .
This could explain the discrepancy in the UCLA study between Internet experts and neophytes .
There ’s nothing particularly amazing about this .
This is simple learning .
It is interesting to see how online activity engages multiple parts of the brain , but there ’s nothing earth shaking here .
But here is what is interesting , and I think it might go to what Nicholas Carr is alluding too .
Our neural plasticity
Studies have shown that our brain has amazing plasticity .
We can literally remap entire sections of our cortex to take on new functions .
In his book , The Mind and the Brain : Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force , Jeffrey Schwartz recounts how stroke patients have been able remap other parts of the brain to take over motor skills and sense from the striken part of the brain .
Blind people use their visual cortex to enhance the sense of touch needed to read Braille .
This is not just a synaptic strengthening typical in learning .
This is wholesale remapping of the brain , creating enduring pathways for recurring functionality .
So , if the brain has this ability to remap new functions into low traffic areas of our cortex , are we in fact remapping our brains to be more adept in navigating online spaces ?
Carr contends that our attention spans are getting shorter and he worries that soon we ’ll be unable to make our way through a book or even a moderately long magazine article .
Or , if we take the alternate point of view that seems to emerge in the UCLA study , is regular use of Google keeping our mind more limber , regularly exercising the synaptic connections between cortical areas ?
The fact is , the flexibility of our cortex evolved to enable humans to better adapt to dynamic environments .
As our world got more complex , we needed to move beyond the programmed responses of the limbic system to something that gave us a little more latitude to respond appropriately to situations .
Yes , if we use the Internet frequently , our minds will accommodate by building skills in this area .
But this does n’t imply that we ’re getting the virtual version of a frontal lobotomy or , conversely , supercharging our intellect .
It just means that we ’re using our inherent hardware for new purposes so that we can better keep up with our world .
It ’s the same flexibility we all come born with , and it ’s what makes humans rather remarkable .
Google makes access to information easier and I myself have wondered what this will do to our learning habits .
But the fact is that the information revolution is just the latest in numerous changes in how we perceive and cognitize the world around us .
Our cortical remapping allows us to adapt to these changes and utilize them effectively .
It may not be a question of smart or stupid .
It might just be a different way of doing things .

Young ?
Ca n’t afford a house ?
You ’re getting shafted by the government
( Image by : magnus )
What has the UK government got against young people ?
Why is it obsessed with pulling up the drawbridge to anyone who ’d like to buy a home but who ca n’t afford ( or wo n’t pay ) credit bubble prices ?
I will declare my interest : I rent , having decided several years ago that housing was too expensive .
I believed I was making a sensible decision , weighing up the risks of losing my 25 % deposit in a frothy market .
I could afford to buy , but I decided to keep saving and wait for house prices to come back to sane levels .
Well , I had it all wrong .
Apparently , the correct thing to do was :
Lie about my income on a self - assessment mortgage application
Buy a house I could only afford if interest rates stayed low for 30 years
Furnish my new house on credit cards
Wait for the taxpayer to bail me out
Go bankrupt without any stigma if things turned pear - shaped
And people wonder why nobody saves anymore .
Gordon Brown is forever blowing housing bubbles
I have watched ( and posted ) with incredulity as the government has scurried to keep inflated what was clearly a house price bubble .
Its latest wheeze to prop up house prices is a two - year mortgage holiday for homeowners unable to repay their mortgages .
( The interest is rolled up and paid back later – presuming the owners can then pay .
Otherwise you and I as taxpayers will have to cough up for the lot ) .
Not just anyone will qualify , of course :
Only those with less than £ 16,000 in savings will get their mortgages paid .
If you were sensible and put cash aside as a cushion , you will be penalised by the government .
Now do n’t get me wrong : I ’m sure there will be sensible people who risk losing their homes in the coming recession .
That ’s unfortunate , but deliberately targeting aid at the most exposed segment of the population is n’t in the best interests of the country .
Those who ca n’t afford their house any more should simply sell .
If it must ‘ do something ’ , the state should offer extra rental support .
Yes , renting is n’t as nice as owning , but that ’s already the case for those who rent .
And they ’re not getting any extra cash !
The government support ( also known as ‘ the oil onto the fire fund ’ ) aims to maintain valuations reached with cheap money during the credit boom , set by people who spent on plastic , did n’t bother saving , paid too much for houses , and ignored the fact they were wildly over - valued .
It has nothing to do with helping sensible “ hard - working families ” .
Many of those families could n’t afford houses , so they did n’t buy .
Sensible people spend what they can afford , and have savings for tough times .
This support is really about stopping repossessions from bringing house prices down further , and taking the Labour government with it .
Young , renting , unwanted
( Source : BBC house price guide )
Young people ca n’t complain though .
When they struggled to buy as property prices went up exponentially ( far outpacing salary growth ) , the government offered them two years of mortgage payments , too .
Except of course it did n’t .
Already over - priced to anyone who wanted to see it , the housing market was instead talked up further by ministers .
They bragged about stability and low interest rates while presiding over the biggest boom in history – right up until buying a house was as safe as putting your life savings on red at Vegas .
The government apparently considers that status quo perfectly reasonable – it recently urged lenders to return to the lending levels of 2007 .
( You know , the reckless lending that has given us a near economic meltdown . )
Young people might want to ask their local MPs why :
If you aspire to own but ca n’t afford it , you get no help
but ca n’t afford it ,
If you already own but ca n’t afford it , you get taxpayer support
The answer is that like some Herman Munster of a pied piper , Gordon Brown told everyone boom - and - bust was over .
Those foolish people who believed him are now HIS people .
He will stand or fall on what happens to them , not to the ‘ hard - working families ’ he never stops banging on about .
Through hubris , a politician who set out to help the poor and preached prudence is now in hock to the reckless gamblers at the margins .
And the rest of us have to pay for it .
Why do we no longer want affordable housing ?
It was only 18 months ago that newspapers were reporting how first - time buyers were locked out of the market .
“ Something must be done ! ” , politicians boomed .
The response was usually one of :
“ There ’s a shortage of housing in the UK , we need to build more houses ! ” [ Builders ]
“ It ’s market forces at work , young people should give up on owning a home if they ca n’t afford it ! ” [ Older home owners ]
“ So what !
House prices are make everyone better off .
Go and moan about pesticides ! ” [ Landlords ]
All three retorts were utter nonsense :
There was no housing shortage – it ’s a myth .
If there was a housing shortage in the UK , rents would have risen as fast , too .
That did n’t happen .
All those new build flats that have now fallen 40 - 75 % in 18 months are proof that the bubble was essentially manufactured out of speculation and cheap money .
Those who said “ Give up if you ca n’t afford it ” bought back when housing was very cheap .
I know moderately paid engineers and teachers in their 50s and 60s who bought in desirable areas on a multiple of two to three times their earnings in their twenties ( and with tax relief , too ) .
The same house would cost 20 - 40 times the earnings of their young equivalents today !
Rising house prices do not make most of us , even homeowners , better off .
If you want to buy onto the ladder , cheaper is clearly better .
Even if you ’re already ‘ in ’ , you ’d be better off if the next house along the chain was also cheaper .
The only time we benefit is if we sell out of the market completely .
For most people that happens when they die , so only their heirs gain .
And that inheritance is invariably put back into property .
So much for social mobility .
It could all be so different
Now the house price boom has burst , just as bubbles always do , the Government should be celebrating .
Young people might aspire to own again .
Everyone else could be glad the money wasted on mortgages and agents fees might go into more productive start - up technology businesses or better health care .
But no .
Falling prices are a great evil that must be stopped .
Despite no steps being taken to stop the boom .
Besides garnering votes , the real reason for supporting prices is that until a floor is put under valuations , banks will continue to struggle .
Even if you accept this argument , government support should be targeted at prudent savers .
That ’s the kind of behaviour you ’d want the state to encourage , not overstretching .
There are several ways the government could more fairly support the market :
First - time buyers could be exempted from stamp duty
The government could provide new first - time buyers with a special discounted mortgage rate
It could purchase vacant new build properties , increasing social housing in the short term ( instead of paying for families to live in hotels ) and sell out again in 5 - 10 years
Any ‘ mortgage holiday ’ relief for current homeowners should also see the state take an immediate 5 % stake in the property in return for the risks .
Homeowners could buy back the stake at market rates as and when the credit market thaws .
Sadly though , for our politicians ‘ moral hazard ’ might as well mean the danger of being caught with your pants down .
If you ’re currently renting and you aspire to own your own home someday , you ’d better hope they ’re as ineffectual as they are economically illiterate .
( CNN ) -- Perhaps what was most striking about Thursday 's nominations for the 66th annual Golden Globes was n't what received a nomination , but what did n't .
The late Heath Ledger plays the Joker in " The Dark Knight , " the No. 1 box - office hit of the year .
Yes , three heavyweights -- " Doubt , " " Frost / Nixon " and " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " -- led the nominees with five nods each , but each film had at least one snub .
" Doubt " received recognition for all four of its main actors -- Meryl Streep , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Amy Adams and Viola Davis -- but none for either best director or best drama .
" Frost / Nixon " earned a nomination for Nixon ( Frank Langella ) but not Frost ( Michael Sheen ) .
And " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " received a nod for just one cast member -- star Brad Pitt .
Cate Blanchett , who plays
Pitt 's love interest , was shut out .
In other cases , performers were nominated , but their films did n't make the Globes ' short list .
See the list of Globe nominations
" Milk 's " Sean Penn received a best actor nomination , but the film -- which the New York Film Critics Circle named the year 's best -- was shut out of the best director and best drama categories .
Both Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. earned supporting actor nominations for " Tropic Thunder , " but the film itself could n't find its way onto the best comedy or musical list .
" Gran Torino , " the just - out Clint Eastwood flick that 's again earning the director critical plaudits , received its sole nomination for best song , which he co-wrote .
Neither it nor the director 's " Changeling " found a slot on the best drama or director lists .
( Eastwood also received a nomination for his " Changeling " score . )
And " The Dark Knight , " the year 's top box - office success and the runner - up for best picture among the Los Angeles Film Critics , earned just one nomination , a supporting actor nod for Heath Ledger 's performance as the Joker .
iReport.com : Share your reaction to the Golden Globe nominations
Then again , members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association , which presents the Globes , showed some love toward movies that the public generally overlooked .
" In Bruges , " a comedy that received mixed reviews and had a quiet box - office run in late winter , earned nominations for best comedy or musical and actors Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson .
And Woody Allen 's " Vicky Cristina Barcelona " cleaned up -- the film picked up nominations for best comedy or musical and its stars Javier Bardem , Rebecca Hall and Penelope Cruz .
Allen , however , did n't get a nomination for either screenplay or director .
" Last Chance Harvey , " a film that will receive limited release in the U.S. on Christmas Day , scored nominations for stars Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson .
The nominees for best drama are " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , " " Frost / Nixon , " " The Reader , " " Revolutionary Road " and " Slumdog Millionaire . "
The nominees for best comedy or musical are " Burn After Reading , " " Happy - Go - Lucky , " " In Bruges , " " Mamma Mia ! " and " Vicky Cristina Barcelona . "
" Wall - E , " " Bolt " and " Kung Fu Panda " earned nominations for best animated film .
The nominees were pleased to hear their names .
" I am very grateful for this recognition .
My collaboration with Ron Howard and Brian Grazer was one of the best experiences of my career , " said Langella in a statement .
Heath Ledger 's father said the family was touched by the nomination for Ledger .
The actor died in January , before " Dark Knight " was released .
" This nomination is deeply appreciated and is not lost on those of us who continue to love and miss him , " Kim Ledger told People magazine in a statement .
" We are so proud our boy 's work is being recognized in this way . "
The Globes are generally seen as an Oscar harbinger , though the foreign press group 's track record is far from perfect .
Last year , " Atonement " took home the organization 's best drama honor , while " No Country for Old Men " won the Academy Award for best picture .
The Globes did mostly match the Oscars when it came to performers , giving Globes to Daniel Day Lewis ( " There Will Be Blood " ) , Bardem ( " No Country for Old Men " ) and Marion Cotillard ( " La Vie en Rose " ) .
It should be pointed out that , with categories for both dramas and comedy / musicals , the Globes give out twice as many honors for lead performers as the Oscars .
The Globes also hand out awards for TV series .
Nominees for best comedy series are " 30 Rock , " " Californication , " " Entourage , " " The Office " and " Weeds . "
Nominees for best drama series are " Dexter , " " House , " " In Treatment , " " Mad Men " and " True Blood . "
Last year 's awards were canceled after celebrities said they would boycott the show , due to a strike by the Writers Guild of America .
Instead , winners were announced at a press conference .
Despite continued labor unrest -- this time focused on actors -- the Globes are expected to go off as scheduled .
The awards will be presented on January 11 .
The show will air on NBC .

Steve Guttenberg Jogs Through Central Park
Steve Guttenberg will do just about anything for a laugh - or so it seems .
We 've got a video that ' bares ' out that statement .
Guttenberg was recorded for posterity running gleefully through Central Park , exposing his nether regions along the way .
The actor has played the role of Carey Mahoney in Police Academy 1 - 4 .
This latest staged stunt is still a mystery and we 're all curious to find out what Guttenberg plans to do with the footage .
Speaking of footage , the crazy man was on The Howard Stern Show in August and bragged that he was especially well endowed and that it was a great source of confidence .
Now this is all beginning to make some sense .
In a fleeting attempt at respectability , the actor put on his dancing shoes for a few turns around the dance floor on the reality show Dancing with the Stars in April 2008 .
His tenure was short before he got the proverbial boot .
Check out his DWTS pose below :
Remember that E , the earnings , multiplied by M , the multiple , equals P , the price .
That ’s the price - to - earnings multiple .
If a stock ’s PE multiple is equal to or less than its growth rate , then that ’s a cheap stock , Cramer said .
A stock with a PE that ’s twice the growth rate follows the opposite logic :
Ten percent growth on a 20 multiple stock probably means it is time to take profits .
Cramer learned this rule through hard - won experience .
He knows that value investors are attracted to stocks close to their growth rate , which creates a floor .
On the high end , growth investors rarely pay more than twice the growth rate , which creates a ceiling .
Now the stockholder has a range for selling his wares .
It ’s good to hunt for value among stocks with PEs that are about one times the growth , but be careful not buy damaged goods .
Plenty of inexpensive - looking stocks are actually quite pricey if the fundamentals are declining and the earnings are going to miss the estimates , Cramer said .
Again , the opposite is true .
A stock that ’s trading with a multiple that is twice its growth rate looks expensive .
But if its earnings need to be revised higher , its multiple will come down and it has more room to run .
Bottom Line :
When you value stocks , anything with a multiple that ’s lower than the growth rate should be presumed cheap .
Anything with a multiple that ’s more than twice the growth rate is expensive .

Irish authorities say pork products contaminated with toxic chemicals could have been exported to as many as 25 countries .
The scare has prompted authorities to issue a mass recall .
In Britain supermarkets are clearing their shelves and consumers are being urged to dispose of any pork product sourced from Ireland since last September .
Although health authorities say consumers would have to eat enormous quantities of the contaminated meat to become ill , they are taking no chances .
It is believed animal feed used on a number of farms was mixed possibly with oil containing dioxins although it is still not clear exactly how it happened .
Affected animals will have to be destroyed and talks have begun about how farmers will be compensated .
The Irish farmers association says with all the suspect farms identified , safe supplies of pork should be available in a few days .

Gordon Brown has refused to comment on reports the government will cut VAT by 2.5 % as part of an emergency package aimed at kick - starting the economy .
But the PM said " substantial " measures would be in the pre-Budget report on Monday to pump money into the economy .
And he denied increasing borrowing to fund tax cuts was a " gamble " , saying it was " responsible and necessary " .
Tory leader David Cameron has warned the government 's plans will lead to a future " tax bombshell " .
Mr Brown refused to speculate on the contents of Chancellor Alistair Darling 's statement on Monday , but he said there was a consensus around the world that any " fiscal stimulus " had to be " substantial to have an impact " .
Experts say the government will have to increase borrowing to record levels of £ 100bn or more , which the country will have to pay back later in higher taxes - and there is no guarantee tax cuts will get consumers spending again .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But Mr Brown told BBC One 's The Politics Show : " I do n't see this as a gamble , I see this as necessary , responsible action , that any sensible government would want to take .
" Those people who say do nothing now , would leave people , as in the 1980s and 1990s , without hope that their mortgage problems could be sorted out , or their jobs problems could be sorted out .
" It would be lacking in compassion , as well as irresponsible , in my view . "
Planned giveaway Pressed on whether Mr Darling would also be setting out details of future tax rises on Monday , Mr Brown said : " I think you 'll find that everything is above board .
It is stated .
There is no hidden manifesto .
People will be absolutely clear that we are taking action now to prevent permanent damage later . "
He refused to be drawn on reports he is considering a summer general election to capitalise on his improved fortunes in the polls .
He said his " undivided attention " was on fixing the economy .
Widespread press reports suggest Mr Darling will temporarily cut VAT by 2.5 % to 15 % - the lowest level allowed under EU law - in an effort to boost consumer spending .
However , it is not known if the cut would come into effect before Christmas as some newspapers have suggested .
It would be the first time the sales tax has been changed since the early 1990s , when the Conservatives increased it to 17.5 % .
Taken together with other planned giveaways , it would mark the biggest shift in Labour 's economic policy since it came to power in 1997 .
Other measures could include : Extending for another year the £ 120 rebate for low - paid workers who lost out through the abolition of the 10 p tax rate
Increasing the period of grace before lenders repossess homes to three months
Scrapping planned rises in vehicle excise duty for another year ' Consumer confidence '
Earlier , business secretary Lord Mandelson conceded any tax cuts would have to be paid for in the long term , saying : " Of course they will , if what we are going to do tomorrow ( Monday ) is going to be sustainable . "
But he said action was needed now to deliver the sort of stimulus necessary to raise demand , " filling up order books again " .
The Tories have resurrected their 1992 election slogan Conservative leader David Cameron said he was " sceptical " that the government 's plan would get consumers spending because they would be aware of the " tax bombshell " they face in future years to repay the national debt .
He said : " I think people are going to be shocked tomorrow ( Monday ) when they see the extent of government borrowing .
" Maybe £ 80 bn this year , before the recession 's even properly started , and possibly over £ 100 bn next year .
And next year that is over £ 4,000 extra for every family in the country .
" So I do have a real concern about a government going on a borrowing binge that even they are now admitting is going to lead to much higher taxes later . "
' Sustainable ' alternatives
The Conservative leader called for further interest rate cuts and government guarantees for loans to small firms in an effort to help homeowners and businesses .
The party has resurrected its successful advertising campaign from the 1992 general election to warn voters they face a " tax bombshell " to pay for Mr Brown 's economic rescue package .
HAVE YOUR SAY
These companies are not interested in stopping the downturn , only in self preservation Sarah , Newbury Lib Dem treasury spokesman Vince Cable said his party backed tax cuts for low and middle income workers , but said they should be made permanent by increasing taxes on the rich .
He said : " A big tax cut 's desirable , that 's certainly the case .
And a VAT cut would act very quickly , which is positive .
" But we prefer a different approach which is more targeted on people who really need it .
And we believe that people on low incomes , low wages should get an income tax cut - lifting thresholds or reducing the rate .
And that 's a much better way of concentrating resources where it needs it .
" And it would also be sustainable because we 've identified how you would pay for it .
It would n't just be a temporary handout . "

Microsoft 's Windows XP first went on sale in 2001
Microsoft has given yet another reprieve to its seasoned Windows XP operating system .
The cut off date for PC makers to obtain licenses for the software was 31 January 2009 .
But now Microsoft has put in place a scheme that will allow the hardware firms to get hold of XP licences until 30 May 2009 .
Previously Microsoft extended XP 's life until 2010 - provided it was installed on netbooks and low - cost laptops .
Windows XP was originally due to disappear off shop shelves on 30 January 2008 .
It was to be removed so as to make way for Windows Vista which went on sale to consumers early in 2007 .
Despite Microsoft 's claims that Vista has sold well , consumers have reacted badly to its release .
Microsoft granted the reprieve largely because of customer 's preference for XP .
Many PC makers also got around the restrictions by exploiting a clause in Microsoft 's licensing terms that allowed them to offer a " downgrade " licence .
Issued with a new PC running Vista it allowed customers to replace it with XP .
The latest reprieve affects PC makers and resellers who were working to a 31 January 2009 deadline to order licences for XP .
Many feared they would have to stockpile licences before the cut - off and hope they could sell them in the coming months .
Now , Microsoft has changed the terms allowing the resellers to order before 31 January but take delivery at any time up to 30 May .
The change in policy is another indication of the general resistance to Windows Vista .
Early versions of Windows 7 , the replacement for Vista , are due to appear in late 2009 .
Brain scientists have succeeded in fooling people into thinking they are inside the body of another person or a plastic dummy .
The out - of - body experience - which is surprisingly easy to induce - will help researchers to understand how the human brain constructs a sense of physical self .
The research may also lead to practical applications such as more intuitive remote control of robots , treatments for phantom limb pain in amputee patients and possible treatments for anorexia .
The research follows a related study from the same group last year in which the scientists convinced volunteers that they were having an out - of - body experience .
It was the first time it had been done in the lab and showed that the intensely spiritual experiences that patients sometimes have while on the operating table , for instance , can have a scientific explanation .
" We are interested in how normal perception works , how we recognise our own body .
And we do that by studying these perceptual illusions , " said Dr Henrik Ehrsson at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden .
" Critically it depends on the visual perspective and the so - called multisensory integration or the combination of visual signals and tactile signals . "
In the new study Ehrsson and his colleague , Valeria Petkova , attached two cameras to the head of a dummy .
These were hooked up to two small screens placed in front of their subjects ' eyes .
This gave the illusion that the person was looking through the mannequin 's eyes .
For example , when they looked down they saw the dummy 's body and not their own .
To create the illusion of occupying the dummy 's body , the team stroked the abdomen of the subject and the dummy at the same time while the subject watched the stroking via the cameras on the dummy 's head .
As a result , subjects reported a strong feeling that the dummy 's body was their own .
The technique is similar to the " rubber hand illusion " , in which a subject can be convinced that a rubber hand is his or her own , but this is the first time the illusion has been extended to a whole body .
The illusion was so convincing that when the researchers threatened the dummy with a knife they recorded an increase in the subject 's skin conductance response - the indicator of stress that polygraph lie detector tests rely on .
" This shows how easy it is to change the brain 's perception of the physical self , " said Ehrsson , who led the project .
" By manipulating sensory impressions , it 's possible to fool the self not only out of its body but into other bodies too . "
Things got even weirder when the researchers dispensed with the dummy and put the cameras on the head of another person .
After carrying out the same double stroking routine the subjects were convinced that they were occupying another person 's body .
The illusion persisted even when the other person came over and shook the subject 's hand , producing the sensation of the subject feeling as if they were shaking hands with themselves .
The researchers plan to use the out - of - body illusion to try to treat amputee patients that experience phantom limb pain in the arm or leg they have lost .
" We have begun to realise that there could be a link between pain perception and the feeling of ownership of the body , " said Ehrsson .
Another potential angle for research is body image in patients with anorexia .
These people become obsessed with reducing their own weight even when they become dangerously thin .
" Possibly this approach could be used for new diagnostic tools and maybe therapeutic tools to train people better to recognise their actual body size , " he said .
Another application is in remotely operated robots , for example in nuclear power plants or surgery .
" The hope is to elicit a full - blown illusion that you are the robot , " said Ehrsson .
The results are reported today in the journal PLoS One .
Yermack estimates that the aggregate capital investment in GM and Ford since 1980 has led to a net reduction in capital of $ 465 billion …
This is what I find particularly disturbing : with that $ 465 billion , “ GM and Ford could have closed their own facilities and acquired all of the shares of Honda , Toyota , Nissan , and Volkswagen . ”
Deborah Smith Fired For Reporting Hilton Executive Sex Orgy
43 , was the night manager of the SkyWater Restaurant and Lounge , located in the Minneapolis Hilton Hotel .
The operative word is ' was ' because she is no longer employed by the Hilton chain .
Smith reported to her Human Resources department that she had walked in on and witnessed several members of Hilton 's upper management engaging in sex acts in a banquet room .
According to a lawsuit that Smith has filed against the hotel chain , she encountered several inebriated executives engaging in sex acts on top of a table .
When she expressed her displeasure at witnessing the sexual encounter , Hilton Beverage Manager , James Vennewitz , told Smith that she would be fired and he would make sure of it .
The suit goes on to say that Smith was a victim of " undirected sexual harassment " and a " campaign of harassment and retaliation ensured . "
The complaint contends that Hilton Human Resources Director Traci Schultz , upon hearing about the incident , did not take remedial action but in fact set Smith up for retaliatory termination .
Prior to her firing , Smith alleges that Hilton management 's conduct was hostile , oppressive , pervasive , abusive and intimidating .
She claims to have suffered severe emotional , physical and economic damages .

Thanks to its enthusiastic participation in the sub - prime mortgage market and billions in low - interest , low - FICO score auto loans , GMAC was headed for bankruptcy .
There was only one way out : convert to a bank and suckle on the federal teat labeled Trouble Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
Only … GMAC could n’t convince enough of its investors to swap debt for equity to meet the Fed ’s regs for the transformation .
To forestall GMAC ’s C11 , and the domino destruction of General Motors , the Fed did what comes natural to our August federal institutions these days : they changed the rules .
The Wall Street Journal reports that The Fed has granted GMAC bank status– despite its failure to meet the letter of the law .
As the Fed ’s statement clearly indicates , they ’re making it up as they go along .
“ As part of the approval , the Fed is requiring GM and Cerberus Capital Management LP to reduce their ownership stakes in Detroit - based GMAC .
GM must reduce its ownership interest in GMAC to less than 10 % in voting shares and total equity .
Cerberus , which owns Chrysler , must reduce its interest to a maximum of 14.9 % in voting shares and 33 % in total equity . ”
And that ai n’t all …
“ In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets , and all other facts and circumstances , the Board has determined that emergency conditions exist that justify expeditious action on this proposal in accordance with the provisions of the BHC Act and the Board ’s regulations … the Board has also waived public notice of this proposal . ”
So , quick and dirty it is .
Apparently , I ’m not the only one who thinks this thing smells , as noted in the footnote :
“ A commenter requested that the Board hold a public meeting or hearing on the proposal .
Section 3 ( b ) of the BHC
Act does not require the Board to hold a public hearing on an application unless the appropriate supervisory authority for the bank to be acquired makes a timely written recommendation of denial of the application .
The Board has not received such a recommendation from the appropriate supervisory authorities . ”
Accountability .
What happened to it ?
So far , GM is due to score an unknown percentage of the Department of Energy ’s $ 25 loan program , $ 13.4 b in direct TARP loans and multiples of that amount for its former cash cow GMAC .
And the rest .
Suprised ?
One woman screamed that she might have a heart attack .
Another panic - stricken woman clamored for her medicine .
The bathroom could not be serviced for nearly six hours and at one point , drinking water was at a premium .
It happened within the confines of a TACA International Airlines flight from El Salvador that sat on the tarmac at Ontario International Airport for nearly nine hours Monday , as officials tried to sort out protocol .
Passenger Alonso Llosa , 28 , of Culver City recalled that fellow travelers , who had been growing lethargic from the long wait , got louder and louder during the final stretch .
Lights remained on in the plane , causing problems for weary travelers trying to sleep , another passenger said .
Dense fog caused Flight 670 , en route to Los Angeles International Airport , to be diverted to the Ontario airport about midnight Sunday , and it remained there until midmorning Monday .

Just why the flight ’s 132 passengers had to wait so long on the aircraft -- with little relief -- remained a matter of dispute Wednesday .
According to a second statement issued by airline officials , a series of events beyond their control kept the plane at Ontario .
The original plan was to refuel it and wait for the fog to clear at LAX , TACA officials said .
Demand for fuel from other diverted flights pushed the TACA plane ’s departure back .
Because it was an international flight , passengers had to go through customs , but customs officials were short - staffed at Ontario , so TACA was told to wait until the plane arrived in Los Angeles , the airline said .

Airport officials gave a different account .
According to a statement from Los Angeles World Airports , which operates the Ontario airport , TACA did not ask that passengers be allowed to leave the aircraft at Ontario .
In addition , it did not request that passengers be taken by bus to LAX , airport officials said .
As the plane waited until midmorning for fog to clear at LAX , the airline did not request that U.S. Customs and Border Protection process passengers so they could stretch their legs or sit in the terminal , airport officials said .

Customs officials remained at the Ontario airport until 1:30 a.m. Monday , processing another international flight .
Customs does not staff the airport around the clock , airport officials said .
Although the airport did not have customs staff on hand to process exiting passengers , it could have summoned them , according to the airport agency .
“ It is also unknown why , even after [ the airport ] suggested , TACA staff did not request clearance to have their passengers deplane for humanitarian reasons , ” the agency said in a statement .
Advertisement
At 2:45 a.m. Monday , TACA said , it was informed that customs officials at LAX could not wait any longer for the flight to arrive and that passengers could be processed when the office reopened at 6 a.m .
Llosa was returning from a quick vacation with his girlfriend in Lima , Peru , where the plane originated before stopping in San Salvador .
As the morning progressed , the sleepy passengers ’ patience started to wear thin despite updates over the plane ’s intercom .
Once the plane ’s captain informed passengers that Ontario had no customs officials available to allow them off the plane , the passengers grew more confused .

“ We thought we were in this out - of - control situation , ” Llosa said .
Water and snacks were provided to passengers about 4 a .m. by airport staff , and emergency responders received “ a few reports ” of passenger illnesses , airport officials said .
No one was hospitalized .
The airline said the items were not provided until 6 a.m .
Because customs officials were not available , no one could board the plane to service its bathroom until 6 a.m. , TACA said .

At one point , passengers said , up to three police cars surrounded the plane , making some passengers feel uneasy .
One passenger recalled hearing people call elected officials , 911 and local news stations .
Passengers said they heard a woman yell that she might have a heart attack because the police were making her so nervous ; another woman was heard saying she needed medication .
“ I think it ’s not easy after 9/11 to see police around your plane , ” said a 26 - year - old Eagle Rock resident who was aboard the plane .
She refused to give her name .
At 3:15 a.m. , the TACA flight ’s crew had run longer than its allotted hours , and a change of staff was approved nearly three hours later by customs officials , the airline said .

After a normal servicing Monday morning , Flight 670 left Ontario just before 9 a.m. ; it landed at LAX nearly 30 minutes later , about 14 hours after it left El Salvador .
The TACA plane was one of three international passenger flights diverted to Ontario on Monday , said Nancy Castles , a spokeswoman for LAX .
There were no serious problems with the other two flights , airport and airline officials said .

Yesterday , 10 November , was International Human Rights Day , and for the occasion two San Franciscans spearheaded a protest and boycott ( across the U.S. ) on behalf of gay rights and in opposition to California 's Proposition 8 ( which banned same - sex marriage ) .
Two points of linguistic interest : the name of the event is " A Day Without a Gay " ( sometimes reported as " A Day Without Gays " ) , and people are encouraged to " call in gay " to work .
( The webpage for the event is here .
There are stories all over the place , for instance this one suggested to me by Ben Zimmer . )
The name " A Day Without a Gay " is based most immediately on " A Day Without a Mexican " ( the title of a 2004 film , directed by Sergio Arau , about a day of Hispanic protest ) , and has the additional virtue of rhyming .
But there are lots of " A Day Without X " precedents , among them : A Day Without Art ( 12/1/89 ) , A Day Without Facebook ( 9/12/06 ) , A Day Without Google ( or any other major search engine , 6/12/07 ) , and a proposal that , to save the oceans , you pick one day and make it A Day Without Plastic .
" Call in gay " is of course based on the idiom " call in sick ( to work ) " .
Ben Zimmer noted on ADS -L on 9 December :
It appears that one inspiration for the snowclone -y substitution of " call in sick " with " call in gay " is this quote , attributed to lesbian activist Robin Tyler : " If homosexuality is a disease , let 's all call in queer to work : ' Hello .
Ca n't work today , still queer . ' "
This reminds me a bit of the " driving while X " snowclone .
Here are some other " call in X ( to work ) " variations attested on the Web : stupid , grumpy , sad , crazy , dead , drunk , ugly , fat , stinky , gray [ referring to hair dye ] , gasless [ from the days of high gas prices ] , empty [ ditto ] , cold , well , healthy , rich , hysterical , constipated , allergic , seasonally affective , kidnapped , Republican , Democrat .
( From a Google search of : { " call in * to work " - " call in sick|late|gay|queer "} .
( Many are of the negative form , " you ca n't call in X to work " , or the interrogative , " can I call in X to work ? " )
Larry
Horn then added :
There 's also , in a related snowclone , " stage an X - out " ( sick - out ) , I assume based on walk - out , such as staging a gay - out or queer - out .
( Too close to outing ? )
And there 's always the blue flu for police job actions , although I do n't know if that 's sponsored snowclones , given the rhyme factor .
Hair stylists staging a do - flu ?
Tiger - cage cleaners putting on a zoo - flu ?
Underpaid rabbis organizing for …well , you get the idea .
Here we 're in the murky area between idioms with open slots in them and snowclones ; notice that Ben Zimmer called the pattern " call in X " merely " snowclone-y " .
Both originate in some fixed expression , which is then varied by replacement of one ( or more ) of the parts by other items .
It might not be profitable to try to draw a crisp line between small - scale snowclone -y patterns ( snowclonelets ? ) and larger - scale snowclones .
A snowclonelet came past us a little while ago , in my posting on " Whopper virgin " .
The original here is the simple lexical item virgin ' someone who has not experienced sex ' ( for some sense of sex — a topic for some future posting ) , which is varied by addition rather than replacement , to give " X virgin " ' someone who has not experienced X ' .
There are tons of instances .
First , still in the sexual arena , there 's " oral virgin " ( oral sex ) and " anal virgin " ( anal sex ) , with some variation in usage as to which roles ( insertive , receptive , either , both ) are referred to .
And plenty of nonce creations , among them :
Brickworks virgin [ the Brick Works site in Toronto ] , Tolkien virgin [ books by Tolkien ] , Glasto virgin [ the Glastonbury music festivals ] , Pippi virgin [ the Pippi Longstocking books ] , Bassmaster virgin [ the Bassmaster Elite Series tournament , for bass fishing ] , tonsillolith virgin [ tonsil stones ] , Cariban ( a ) virgin [ the Caribana festival in Toronto ] , festie virgin [ the Michigan Womyns Music Festival ] , bulgogi virgin [ the Korean dish bulgogi ] , Astaire virgin [ Fred Astaire movies ] , L&O virgin [ the television show Law and Order ] , Easterhegg virgin [ annual event organized by Germany 's Chaos Computer Club ]
Note that ' someone who has n't experienced X ' is only a stab at the actual meanings .
" X virgin " expressions are in fact noun - noun compounds , and as we 've pointed out several times in Language Log ( for instance , here ) , the semantic relationship between the two nouns in such compounds can be quite complex and indirect .
An Astaire virgin , for instance , is not really someone who has n't experienced an Astaire , but refers to experience with something involving a particular Astaire ( Fred and not Adele ) , namely the experience of watching movies starring Fred Astaire .

Robert Roy Britt of Live Science reports on the research of a team led by University of Wisconsin - Madison professor John Valley that shows increased dryness in the Eastern Mediterranean between 100 and 700 of the Common Era ( CE ) , with dramatic dips in rainfall in 100 CE and 400 CE .
It raises questions about whether climate is somehow implicated in the decline of the Roman Empire ( traditionally considered to have fallen in 476 CE ) and the weakening of the Byzantine Empire in the 600s - 700s CE .
Britt does not mention that the 600s were the era in which the Orthodox Caliphs of Islam took greater Syria and Egypt away from Byzantium ; these lands were later ruled by the Umayyad Empire .
Indeed , within the first century after Islam was founded , its adherents spread out with lightning speed to take over the southern third of the old Roman Empire , as well as the entirety of the Sasanid Empire of Iran .
The Muslim conquests after 632 CE are rivaled in history for their speed and extent only by the 13th - century Mongol expansion .
The Muslim empire , however , retained its civilizational identity and it was adopted by the conquered , whereas the Mongols were absorbed .
Since the Arab Muslims were from desiccated Western Arabia , they may have been better at dealing with a dry climate ; Muslim water - management techniques were superior to those of other civilizations in that era .
They may also have had advantages in logistics and fighting technique .
The Bedouin tribesmen of Arabia that were the core of the Arab Muslim army had been used to raiding across arid territory .
Camels need less water than horses and can cover more territory per day , so in dry conditions a camel cavalry has advantages over a horse cavalry .
Bedouin had been probing Byzantine defenses in Syria all along ; why were they suddenly able to over - run Damascus in 634 CE ?
Many historians have focused on the esprit de corps and unifying ideology they derived from the new religion of Islam , but other explanations should continue to be considered .
Institutions and social arrangements –how people deal with climate change– are more important than the change itself .
Note that pastoral nomads , who take their herds to pasturage wherever it pops up , have advantages over farming peasants in dry eras .
Peasants and urban people defect to tribes , or engage in migrations to regain access to water .
Since the Bedouin were such an important social element in early Islam , a shift in social and economic power toward pastoralists would have benefited the new religion .
Britt writes :
‘ The work involved geochemical analysis of a stalagmite from Soreq Cave in the Stalactite Cave Nature Reserve near Jerusalem .
Rain flushed organic matter from the surface into the cave , and it was trapped in mineral deposits that formed layers on the stalagmite .
Geology graduate student Ian Orland determined annual rainfall levels for the years the stalagmite was growing , from approximately 200 B.C. to 1100 A.D. ‘
A lot of climate history is done from tree ring analysis , but it has been difficult to pursue in the Middle East because the arid conditions there are not conducive to long - lived trees like the California redwoods .
Some analysis has been done for medieval Turkey by using antique wooden , from surviving buildings , churches and ships , but getting a long data series that has wide implications has been difficult .
Richard Bulliet at Columbia University has used rainfall data for Mongolia in trying to understand medieval Iran ’s climate history .
But obviously Middle Eastern data would be preferable where it can be gotten .
Some scientists have suggested that rainfall can be a proxy for temperature , but that relationship is not accepted by everyone ( warm weather might be associated with dry periods , cold weather with increased rainfall ) .
Climate history enjoyed a vogue a hundred years ago in areas like Roman history , but became discredited because its practitioners tried to explain too much by it and discounted other important explanations .
We should avoid these temptations as new climate information allows another run at weather explanations in history .
TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co. slashed its earnings forecast and announced further cuts in its Japanese production and work force , as global demand for cars continues to falter and the soaring yen hits its overseas profit .
Honda , Japan's No. 2 car maker by volume , Wednesday cut its net profit forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2009 to 185 billion yen ( $ 2.08 billion ) from the 485 billion yen profit it expected in late October .
In the year ended March 31 , 2008 , Honda 's net profit totaled 600.04 billion yen .

Ballerinas added glamour to the Czech EU logo presentation last month
The Czech Republic takes over the EU 's rotating six - month presidency on 1 January , but politics is less than sweet in the land that produced the sugar cube , the BBC's Rob Cameron reports from Prague .
One of the delights of living here is gradually discovering the many things that began life in the Czech Republic .
There 's the soft contact lens ( Otto Wichterle , 1961 ) , the sugar cube ( Jacob Christoph Rad , 1841 ) , the dollar ( Count von Schlick , 1518 ... it's a long story ) and the European Union ( King George of Podebrady , 1462 ) .
The European Union ?
Well , sort of .
In the mid-15th Century , George ( Jiri in Czech ) of Podebrady , Hussite leader and King of Bohemia , dreamed up the idea of a confederation of all Europe 's Christian powers , with France in the driving seat .
Sounds familiar ?
The member states would settle their differences by exclusively peaceful means - no more wars and conquest .
There would be a common parliament , common institutions and even a common insignia ( though no mention of yellow stars on a blue background ) .
George 's idea - aimed at neutralising Rome and uniting Christendom against " the abominable Turk " - did n't get very far .
It was dismissed by Pope Pius II and died , along with King George , in 1471 .
President Klaus is a prominent critic of the EU's Lisbon Treaty Now , more than five centuries after his death , George 's vision has become reality .
" Frankly I would be quite glad if the EU eventually evolved into one supranational state , " says Jan Kvasnicka , a 20 - year - old economics student from Charles University in Prague .
" It is the best guarantee of stability in terms of peace .
Also it could put through some of its agenda on the international level more effectively , " he goes on .
" Though I do n't think the French and Germans were inspired by Jiri of Podebrady when they came up with the idea of European integration after World War II . "
Czech learning curve
If few outside the Czech Republic have heard of King Jiri , few outside Charles University seem to care about the Czech EU presidency .
" But look forward to what ? " is the reply from the girl behind the counter at a cafe on the Old Town Square , when I try to ask about her country 's presidency of the European Union .
She seems genuinely not to have a clue what I am talking about .
She calls over a colleague , who is better informed , but also pessimistic .
President Klaus refuses to fly the EU flag above Prague Castle " It 's going to be a little bit embarrassing I think , " she says .
Why ?
I ask .
" Have you seen our president lately ?
Have you heard anything he said lately ?
He 's not exactly the shining example of diplomacy . "
Vaclav Klaus , the conservative Czech president , has strong views on virtually everything - climate change ( not man - made ) , NGOs ( more dangerous than communism ) and the EU ( all right as a free trade bloc , but that 's about it ) .
The " Eurosceptic " President Klaus ( he prefers " Eurorealist " ) has been campaigning against the EU 's Lisbon Treaty , which the fragile centre - right government is attempting to ratify .
The Czech Republic , alone among the 27 member states , has yet to even vote on it .
In November , Mr Klaus had dinner in Dublin with the controversial anti-Lisbon campaigner Declan Ganley , causing a minor diplomatic incident .
Mr Klaus later had a shouting match with a visiting European Parliament delegation , and has steadfastly refused to fly the EU flag over Prague Castle .
And all this before the presidency even begins .
' Teenager driving EU bus '
The combination of Eurosceptic ( though largely ceremonial ) president , fragile government and divided parliament has reportedly caused some nervousness in Brussels , as France hands over the reins .
Profile : Czech Republic
" I think the EU unfortunately has the right to be worried a bit about the Czech presidency , " says Jiri Pehe , who was a political adviser to Mr Klaus 's predecessor Vaclav Havel .
" This 19 - year - old teenager is now taking over a bus with 26 other people on board , " he explains .
" It 's the second teenager , after Slovenia , but this one is rather unruly and problematic .
" Maybe the rest of the European Union would be OK if this particular teenager was driving the bus on an empty road with no intersections ahead , but I think we are facing very difficult traffic , with several complicated intersections . "
Others think such concerns are unfounded and unhelpful .
" I do n't think that those assessments are justified , " says Roman Joch , director of a conservative think - tank , the Civic Institute .
" The Czech agenda is modest .
It 's about internal liberalisation in the EU and about the common energy and security policy towards Russia .
So I can not see any option for failure , because the presidency is more of an administrative function than an executive one . "
Who knows what old King George would have thought of the modern - day European Union .
Disappointed , perhaps , that it was founded by the Treaty of Rome , rather than the Treaty of Prague .
Appalled , probably , that Turkey was even being considered for membership .
But proud , certainly , that the Czechs are in charge .
If only for six months .

And while prosecutors have brought increasing numbers of political corruption cases in recent years , they have done so using laws that make it a crime for an official to deprive the public of “ honest services . ”
The cases are based on statutes that never define exactly what conduct might be illegal and do not require proof of a bribe or a quid pro quo to establish criminal wrongdoing .
Image
The case against Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich , shown outside his home on Monday , may turn out to be difficult to prosecute .
Credit ... Joshua Lott for The New York Times
What those statutes do require is evidence that an official at least tried to seek something of value in return for an official action .
In the case of Mr. Blagojevich , it would be legal for the governor to accept a campaign contribution from someone he appointed to the Senate seat .
What would create legal problems for him is if he was tape - recorded specifically offering a seat in exchange for the contribution .
What would make the case even easier to prosecute is if he was recorded offering the seat in exchange for a personal favor , like cash , a job or a job for a family member .
Indeed the government has claimed the wiretaps show that Mr. Blagojevich told his aides that he wanted to offer the seat in exchange for contributions and for personal favors , including jobs for himself and his wife .
But talk is not enough .
Any case will ultimately turn on the strength of the tapes , and whether the governor made it clear to any of the candidates for the Senate seat that he would give it only in exchange for something of value .
Several lawyers cautioned that the complaint presented last week was a snapshot of the evidence that Mr. Fitzgerald had amassed so far , in an investigation that is continuing .
In moving to arrest Mr. Blagojevich on Dec. 9 , Mr. Fitzgerald acted without having presented his case before a grand jury .
He is now likely to use such a panel to obtain additional witness testimony exploring whether anyone , including anyone in the Obama camp , had specific discussions with the governor ’s office about filling the vacancy .
A groundbreaking study of popularity by a Michigan State University scientist has found that genes elicit not only specific behaviors but also the social consequences of those behaviors .
According to the investigation by behavioral geneticist S. Alexandra Burt , male college students who had a gene associated with rule - breaking behavior were rated most popular by a group of previously unacquainted peers .
It 's not unusual for adolescent rule - breakers to be well - liked – previous research has made that link – but Burt is the first to provide meaningful evidence for the role of a specific gene in this process .
The study appears in the latest issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
"
The idea is that your genes predispose you to certain behaviors and those behaviors elicit different kinds of social reactions from others , " said Burt , assistant professor of psychology .
" And so what 's happening is , your genes are to some extent driving your social experiences .
" S. Alexandra Burt is a behavioral geneticist at Michigan State University .
Credit : Michigan State University
The concept – which researchers call " evocative gene - environment correlation " – had been discussed in scientific literature but only in theory .
This study is the first to really flesh out the process , establishing clear connections between a specific gene , particular behaviors and actual social situations , she said .
Burt collected DNA from more than 200 male college students in two separate samples .
After interacting in a lab setting for about an hour , the students filled out a questionnaire about whom they most liked in their group .
In both samples , the most popular students turned out to be the ones with a particular form of a serotonin gene that was also associated with rule - breaking behavior .
" So the gene predisposed them to rule - breaking behavior and their rule - breaking behavior made them more popular , " Burt said .
Burt is working on similar studies with female college students , as well as mixed - gender social groups .
She also plans to explore associations with other social behaviors and other genes in larger samples .
FRANKFORT , Kentucky ( AP ) 
A group of atheists filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to remove part of a state anti-terrorism law that requires Kentucky 's Office of Homeland Security to acknowledge it can't keep the state safe without God 's help .
American Atheists Inc. sued in state court over a 2002 law that stresses
God 's role in Kentucky 's homeland security alongside the military , police agencies and health departments .
Of particular concern is a 2006 clause requiring the Office of Homeland Security to post a plaque that says the safety and security of the state " cannot be achieved apart from reliance upon almighty God " and to stress that fact through training and educational materials .
The plaque , posted at the Kentucky Emergency Operations Center in Frankfort , includes the Bible verse : " Except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain . "
" It is one of the most egregiously and breathtakingly unconstitutional actions by a state legislature that I 've ever seen , " said Edwin Kagin , national legal director of Parsippany , New Jersey - based American Atheists Inc .
The group claims the law violates both the state and U.S. constitutions .
But Democratic state Rep. Tom Riner , a Baptist minister from Louisville , said he considers it vitally important to acknowledge God 's role in protecting Kentucky and the United States .
" No government by itself can guarantee perfect security , " Riner said .
" There will always be this opposition to the acknowledgment of divine providence , but this is a foundational understanding of what America is . "
Kentucky has been at the center of a series of legal battles involving religious issues in recent years , most involving displays of the Ten Commandments in public buildings .
One case went to the U.S. Supreme Court , which ruled in 2005 that such displays inside courthouses in two counties were unconstitutional .
Kentucky is n't the only state dealing with religious issues , but Ed Buckner , president of American Atheists , said it 's alone in officially enlisting God in homeland security .
" I 'm not aware of any other state or commonwealth that is attempting to dump their clear responsibility for protecting their citizens onto God or any other mythological creature , " Buckner said .

Today I wrote to Dr. Robert Redfield calling on him to resign as the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
It was not a letter I wrote lightly .
But with the events of the past few months , the decision – and the need – to write it could not have been clearer .
More than 200,000 registered Ohio voters may be blocked from casting regular ballots on Election Day because of a federal appeals court decision on Tuesday requiring the disclosure of lists of voters whose names did not match those on government databases , state election officials and voting experts said .
The court decision requires Jennifer Brunner , the Ohio secretary of state , to provide the names to local election officials by Friday .
Once the local officials have the names , they may require these voters to cast provisional ballots rather than regular ones , and they may ask partisan poll workers to challenge these voters on Election Day .
Both possibilities could cause widespread problems when the voters show up at the polls .
Concerns about those problems led the Ohio Attorney General ’s Office to file an appeal of the decision to the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Ms. Brunner on Wednesday night .
The state ’s appeal went directly to Justice John Paul Stevens because he oversees the Sixth Circuit .
It argued that the Republican Party had nearly two years to raise complaints about the process of screening voter registrations and failed to do so .
Any changes now to the process would disrupt preparations for the election , it contended .

iOS 11 is one of the most anticipated software updates .
Apple has been teasing us for a while and finally the update will be officially released this month .
But this does not mean that you ca n’t get a taste of what the new iOS has to offer .
Apple gave the users a chance to beta test the software , just a few weeks before its launch .
At first he got the developer beta and the public preview followed soon after .
The public beta is still buggy
You are probably already aware that a beta version will have plenty of issues , and iOS public beta is no exception .
Your device might lag or crash , your battery could be drained faster and app might freeze .
However , we have to note that public beta is smoother than developer beta , so the official version will probably be seriously improved .
Despite the ugs , you still get to experience the new iOS 11 features like the enhanced Control Center and the new notification system .
You will enjoy the new tweaks even more if you are an iPad owner since update focused on the multitasking system .
Devices that are a compatible with the iOS 11 public beta
If you were wondering whether you can download the beta version on your iPhone or iPad , here is a list with all the devices that are able to get the iOS 11 public beta : iPhone 5s , iPhone 6 Plus , iPhone 6 , iPhone 6s Plus , iPhone 6s , iPhone SE , iPhone 7 , iPhone 7 Plus , iPad mini 4 , 12.9 - inch iPad Pro 2nd generation , 12.9 - inch iPad Pro 1st generation , iPad Air , 10.5 - inch iPad Pro , 9.7 - inch iPad Pro , iPad Air 2 , iPad 5th generation , iPad mini 3 , iPad mini 2 , iPod touch 6th generation .

Trackbacks More Skepticism about the Bailout : A quick roundup of commentary on the bailout : A front - page story in the Washington Post discusses the opposition by many economists to the bailout , including their doubts that it will actually even work : " Away from Wall Street , Economists Question Basis of Paulson 's Plan . "
Allan Meltzer , who I heard invoked about half - a- dozen times last night on tv , expresses his view here : ALLAN MELTZER , Carnegie Mellon University :
It 's a terrible idea .
It 's undemocratic .
It 's bad economic policy , and it 's bad social policy .
And it has a very little chance of solving the problem in a meaningful way .
JEFFREY BROWN : Well , flesh that out a bit .
Is it that we are not in a crisis ?
Or is it that government intervention of this kind is not the right answer ?
ALLAN MELTZER : Well , I 've listened to governments tell me for 40 years that there was a crisis and the world was going to fall apart if we did n't do this or that .
But there have been a few cases where they were n't able to do that .
One was the commercial paper crisis in 1970 .
There have been several others .
The world did not fall apart .
Last week , we had Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy .
Within three days , most of the assets were sold .
We had AIG turn down three offers to buy the company because they thought they would get a better deal from the government .
It turned out they did n't get the better deal from the government .
Now the stockholders suddenly woke up and said — the major stockholders said , " We 'd like to buy the company . "
Well , that 's what I think we need to do .
We need to get the government 's hand out of this , and let 's see whether we can't get a market solution .
The market people caused this problem .
They ought to be the ones that pay the cost of having it cleaned up .
One major justification / rationalization for the bailout is that Wall Street 's crisis will trickle down to " Main Street " and lead to bank and business failures on the local level .
Maybe this eventually will turn out to be the case .
Yet today 's Washington Post reports that community banks that were responsible lenders over the past decade are now thriving .
They are flush with liquidity as depositors pour money into them and borrowers turn to them for credit .
Community banks obviously cannot pick up the slack for financing for massive business transactions , so there may still be a problem there .
But at this point it is not obvious that the rumbles on Wall Street will have the dire trickle - down consequences that President Bush warned of the other night when he told us that student loans , small - business loans , and car loans were in peril .
In fact , it looks like there is at least some offset here :
At the same time , many smaller banks said they were actually benefiting from the problems on Wall Street .
Deposits are flowing in as customers flee riskier investments , and well - qualified borrowers are lining up for loans .
" We collect money from local savers , and we lend it in the local community , " said William Dunkelberg , chairman of Liberty Bell Bank in Cherry Hill , N.J. " We 're doing fine .
There are 9,000 financial institutions out there , and most of them are small and most of them are doing fine . "
Dunkelberg , a professor of economics at Temple University and chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business , added that a recent survey of that group 's members found that only 2 percent said getting a bank loan was the great challenge facing their businesses .
" If you can't get a loan , my advice is to go see your local community bank , " Dunkelberg said .
***
We 're drowning in liquidity because people are pulling money out from other places and depositing it with us , " said Peter Fitzgerald , chairman of Chain Bridge Bancorp in McLean .
" Our bank has benefited tremendously . "
Fitzgerald , a former senator from Illinois whose family has been in the banking business for generations , said the current situation struck him as similar to past downturns .
" The banking system did need to slow down , " Fitzgerald said .
As it does , riskier customers are being turned away .
At the same time , banks that overextended are now forced to turn away even good customers .
The challenge for Chain Bridge , he said , is identifying the worthwhile customers .
The bank has plenty of money to make good loans , he said .
Nor are small bankers the only ones who object to the bailout .
John A. Allison , CEO of BB&T Bank , also objects to bailing out irresponsible bankers ( HT : Division of Labor ) :
There is no panic on Main Street and in sound financial institutions .
The problems are in high - risk financial institutions and on Wall Street .
While all financial intemediaries are being impacted by liquidity issues , this is primarily a bailout of poorly run financial institutions .
It is extremely important that the bailout not damage well run companies .
Corrections are not all bad .
The market correction process elminates irrational competitiors .
There were a nubmer of pooerly managed institutions and poorly made financial decisions during the real estate boom .
It is important that any rules post " rescue " punish the poorly run institutions and not punish the well run companies . "
Finally , he adds an observation that expresses a conern that I have shared from the beginning , which has led them into missteps and unintended consequences already :
The primary beneficiaries of the proposed rescue are Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
The Treasury has a number of smart individuals , including Hank Paulson .
However , Treasury is totally dominated by Wall Street investment bankers .
They do not have knowledge of the commercial banking industry .
Therefore , they can not be relied on to objectively assess all the implications of government policy on all financial intermediaries .
The deicison to protect the money funds is a clear example of amaterial lack of insight into the risk to the total financial system .
In fact , the community bankers mentioned above tend to vacation at the Jersey Shore rather than the Hamptons , and fly commercial rather than charter , so Mr. Paulson may not actually have had the opportunity to speak with them about the bailout .
( Sorry , I could n't resist at least one dig . )
Finally , the Austrian economics community is having a field day with the bailout .
Steve Horwitz observes " Competition sucks if you 're one of the competitors " and that what is good for Wall Street is not necessarily good for the economy as a whole .
Crony capitalists , Horwitz argues , crave stability ( especially when that allows them to keep gains and socialize losses ) rather than dyanamism .
Peter Klein comments on the underlying monetary causes and the inevitability of market correction in " What would Hayek say ? "
And Larry White adds : " Capitalism in which AIG never closes down is like American Idol in which Sanjaya never goes home . "
Finally , the best line of the night last night ( that I saw ) went to Congressman Ron Kind who said that phone calls to his office were " running 50-50 -- 50 % ' No ' and 50 % ' Hell No . ' "
Let 's see what fun today brings .
Federal Law Gives Tribe Ruling in Baby Talon's Fate After six months , Utah family is forced to return baby to American Indian tribe .
Dec. 16 , 2008  --
Six months ago , Utah couple Clint and Heather Larson adopted a baby boy named Talon who was born with drugs in his system and nursed him back to health .
The baby 's biological mother is a member of the Leech Lake band of the Ojibwe American Indian tribe .
A few months later , the tribe went to court , saying the mother had changed her mind and wanted the baby back -- a legitimate claim , they say , under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act .
So Sunday evening , with tears streaming down her face , Heather Larson surrendered Talon to the tribe .
" We do n't understand , " she told " Good Morning America " today .
" The only thing we care about is Talon 's welfare .
...
But imagine your child being taken from you .
And you may never see them again .
And you may never know where they are .
And you may never know if they 're safe , if they 're being fed , if they 're being cared for . "
According to Frank Bibeau , the tribe 's lawyer and member , the fight is about his tribe 's self - preservation , which is why the law was written to give American Indians more leeway in reversing adoptions .
" Congress put the law into effect because of the detriment and destruction to our culture and to our people and to our future existence because we are losing so many children , " Bibeau said .
But the Larsons told " GMA " that they will appeal the decision to try and get back Talon , whom they still call their son .
According to the act , which was passed in 1978 , its intent was to " protect the best interests of Indian children and promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families " -- an intent that the Larsons say is not served in this case .
" His biological parents have been deemed by the state and by the tribe as unfit , " Heather Larson said .
" And he will not go back to them .
To take them out of a stable home , where he has been nursed from a drug addiction , forced upon him at birth . "
Native American Adoption
Talon will likely enter an American Indian foster family , where his two biological siblings already live .
" He 's not only Indian , " Heather Larson said .
" He has Caucasian blood .
He has Mexican blood .
As important as it is for him to learn his heritage , it 's just as important if not more that he 's cared for and loved . "
According to the National Indian Child Welfare Association , Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act " in response to the alarmingly high number of Indian children being removed from their homes by both public and private agencies . "
" This is who we are .
We 've been here forever .
We 're down to 7,000 people on our reservation .
We have to make the best of what we have and go forward .
We need all of our people .
We can't afford to lose anyone , " Bibeau said .
The Larsons , however , do not see Talon as anyone 's but theirs .
" He 's our son .
He always will be even if we do n't get him back , " Clint Larson said .
" He 's ours . "
" He does not have our blood running in his veins , but he does have our hearts , " Heather Larson said .
The Larsons have set up a trust in Talon 's name with Wells Fargo called " For Benefit of Talon Larson . "
More information on the trust can be found by calling ( 801 ) 304-9386 .

They used the new compound to monitor the spread of breast and ovarian cancer cells in living mice , using a tiny camera known as an endoscope .
“ These compounds may allow clinicians to monitor a patient ’s response to cancer therapy by allowing them to visualize whether a drug hits its target and whether hitting the target leads to shrinkage of the tumor , ” Dr. Hisataka Kobayashi of the U.S. National Cancer Institute , who helped lead the study , said in a statement .
Kobayashi and Yasuteru Urano of the University of Tokyo first targeted breast cancer cells with a certain mutation in what is known as the epidermal growth factor receptor or EGFR , which drives several different cancers .
This mutation is targeted by Genentech ’s breast cancer drug Herceptin , known generically as trastuzumab .
The researchers made their imaging compound by linking a fluorescent compound to Herceptin , which is itself a genetically engineered antibody that homes in on cells with mutated EGFR .
It only attaches to living cells , making it possible to specifically find living cancer cells .
Sure enough , they could see breast tumors in living mice , and tumor cells after they spread away from the initial tumor site , they reported in the journal Nature Medicine .
Using another cancer drug , Roche AG ’s Zenapax , known generically as daclizumab , and an endoscope , they imaged ovarian cancer tumors that had spread inside the abdominal cavity of living mice .
“ Our design concept is very versatile and can be used to detect many types of cancer , ” said Kobayashi .
“ Unlike other activatable fluorescent compounds , our compound consists of a targeting agent and a fluorescing agent that act independently .
We can target the fluorescing agent to different types of cancer cells by using any antibody or molecule that is internalized by the targeted cells after it binds to the cell ’s surface proteins . ”
Half an hour after they killed the cells , the red fluorescent light stopped , they said .
“ A clergyman in charge of education for the country ’s leading scientific organisation – it ’s a Monty Python sketch , ” pronounced Britain ’s top atheist , Richard Dawkins , recently .
How the world turns .
In the days of Galileo it was the church which went around persecuting scientists .
Now the boot appears to be on the scientific foot .
That is how it must feel , at any rate , to Professor Michael Reiss who last month was hounded out of his job as the Royal Society ’s director of education by a group of Nobel Prize winners who were outraged not by what he said but by what people might think he had said .
The problem was that Reiss , as well as being an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist , is a non-stipendiary priest in the Church of England .
When he said recently that science teachers should answer questions about creationism if pupils asked them he was deemed to have been advocating the idea that British schools should teach the idea that the world was magicked up ( complete with fossils and ancient geology ) just 6,000 years ago – and then tell pupils to make their own minds up between that and the theory of evolution to which the overwhelming scientific evidence points .
The hapless Reiss made it clear that he insists creationism is scientific nonsense .
But a handful of the Royal Society 's most eminent members began a campaign to have him sacked .
Sir Harry Kroto , Sir Richard Roberts and Sir John Sulston said in a letter to the president of the Royal Society : " We gather Professor Reiss is a clergyman , which in itself is very worrisome . "
We must all now be on the look - out , it now seems for Revs under the beds .

The idea that science and religion are incompatible is a fairly recent import into contemporary culture .
It has been given huge credence by the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States .
The pronounced motivation of Islamic fundamentalists in 2001 hammered home that some people are prepared to inflict outrageous acts of inhumanity in the name of religion .
Yet the roots of the shift in attitude go back much further .
" It came about because of a perfect storm – a wide range of factors came together , " says the atheist philosopher Julian Baggini .
Among them were a shift from liberal to evangelical Christianity in Britain , the rise of creationism in America , advances in scientific techniques in biology and changes in public perception on issues as disparate as homosexuality and assisted dying .
But we are leaping ahead here .
The relationship between science and religion has had a long and chequered history since the settled days of the medieval consensus , which saw faith and the natural sciences as part of a cosmic whole .
Galileo put paid to that with his insistence that the earth revolved around the sun .
The Catholic Church , which saw man and his planet at the centre of the universe – and which already felt its authority threatened by the rise of Protestantism – locked horns with him .
The clash became a metaphor for the irreconcilability of scientific materialism and biblical literalism .
Things changed with Isaac Newton .
His laws of physics led to a world view which relegated God to background status as the designer of a clockwork world which he wound up and then left to its own devices .
Newton 's celestial mechanics brought an advance in our scientific understanding but did n't really work for a faith that wanted to believe that , through the historical Jesus , God had become , in the words of the song " a slob like one of us " .
Next came Darwin .
At first many saw his theory of evolution as a threat to religion but mainstream Christianity soon accepted evolution as the answer to the " how " of creation , leaving the " why " questions of meaning and morality to faith .
Science and religion exercised authority over two discrete compartments of life between which there could be no link .
But through the latter half of the 20th century a synergy developed .
In cosmology the science of the expanding universe and the Big Bang chimed in with a moment of creation .
The inherent uncertainty that quantum physics discovered at the subatomic level overturned Newton 's mechanics and created room for a " God of the gaps " .
Process theology embraced evolution and said men and women are called to play a part in an ever - ongoing creation .
Advances in neuro - science showed that mental and spiritual phenomena depend upon biological processes , undermining the old dualist notions about body and soul and offering a more holistic body - mind - spirit axis .
" Attacks on religion , when I was a student in the Sixties , were largely on political grounds , " says Dr Denis Alexander , the Director of the Faraday Institute for Science and Religion in Cambridge .
" It was seen to be on the side of capitalism and the rich . "
In Anglo - American philosophy , says Baggini , " religion was seen as wrong but as something that did n't really matter much .
The world was going secular and eventually it would just die out . "

But the rise of Christian fundamentalism in America in the past few decades – the word fundamentalist in its religious sense was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in only 1989 – was mirrored in a milder way in Britain too .
Liberal Christianity , so long in the ascendant in the Church of England , began to lose ground to evangelicalism .
" Non-literal Christianity failed , " says Baggini , " because it does n't capture the popular imagination .
The certainties of evangelical Christianity appeal more to those for whom the attractions of religion are on a more visceral level . "
This appeal was symbolised through the 1990s by the Alpha course on the basics of the Christian faith devised in London by a curate at Holy Trinity , Brompton , which has since been used by more than 10 million people in 160 countries .
The idea that the miracles of the New Testament may have been metaphors rather than literal truths suddenly went out of fashion in Christian circles .
Throughout this time scientists such as Richard Dawkins had evidenced a disdain for such simple certainties .
In his 1976 book The Selfish Gene there were a few side - swipes at religion and in 1986 in The Blind Watchmaker he conducted a sustained critique of the 18th - century deist argument that the world is too complicated to have sprung into existence by accident so a rational observer should conclude that it must have been designed , just as someone finding a watch would conclude that somewhere there must be a watchmaker who made it .
And by 1991 , in response to the question of why evolution had allowed religion to thrive , he had coined the notion that religion was a virus .
But it was the terrorist attacks in 2001 that turned Dawkins into an Alpha atheist and transformed him from an academic backwater into a populist ideologue .
Before 9/11 , he said , religion may have appeared a " harmless nonsense " .
But the attacks in New York showed it to be a " lethally dangerous nonsense " .
Previously , he said , " we all bought into a weird respect , which uniquely protects religion from normal criticism .
Let 's now stop being so damned respectful ! "
The gloves were off .
But another prominent atheist , medic and secularist , the Liberal Democrat MP , Dr Evan Harris , is not so sure that 9/11 was the nodal point .
" It 's not the main thing to scientists , " he insists .
" When you talk to them the thing that comes up most often is the influence religion has had on science in America under George Bush . "
Religious pressures there have had direct impacts on a wide range of policy – from a ban on public money being put into stem cell research to a refusal to allow US aid programmes to hand out condoms to fight Aids in Africa .
" Scientists who are publicly funded can't go to conferences and speak without being obliged to stick to the Bush line , " says Harris .
Advances in bio-technology have opened up new areas for disagreement .
Test tube babies , embryo selection , saviour siblings , stem cell research and animal - human cybrids have all created new battlegrounds between those who think that an embryo is a person from the moment of conception to those who think it is merely a cluster of cells before implantation or even birth – and all variety of opinions in between .
" There is a definite danger of our desire for research outstripping our capacity to anticipate the ethical implications of those advances , " says the feminist theologian , Tina Beattie , whose book The New Atheists argues that Dawkins & Co misuse Darwin and evolutionary biology as much as the Christian fundamentalists misuse the Bible .
" Some scientists experience religion as merely an irritating brake on their striving to do new things . "
The public , after a list of scientific disasters from thalidomide and nuclear weapons to BSE and the stealing of dead children 's organs at Alder Hey , are much more suspicious , judging that " scientists have problems policing their borders " .
From a very different perspective Andrew Copson , the director of education for the British Humanist Association , agrees .
" Scientists are fearful so the issue has become very emotive , " he says .
" They fear that , behind what people like Michael Reiss say , there lies a Trojan horse . "
It is perhaps significant here that the two main instigators of the campaign to have Reiss ousted from his Royal Society job , Sir Harry Kroto and Sir Richard Roberts , are now based in the United States where creationism is a major phenomenon .
Polls suggest that around 45 per cent of Americans are creationists with 40 per cent believing that God worked through evolution and just 10 per cent saying it was nothing to do with a God .
The experience of being a secularist in the US is clearly a radicalising one .
" I do n't know if it is too late to stop the slide in Britain but I think it is in the US where [ the religious right ] have now almost complete control over politics , the judiciary , education , business , journalism and television , " Kroto , who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1996 , has said , adding darkly : " The Royal Society does not appreciate the true nature of the forces arrayed against it . "
The position in the UK is nothing like that , though the statistics are unclear .
A 2006 BBC poll claimed that 48 per cent of the British public accepted evolution with 22 per cent preferring creationism but the definitions it used were so sloppy as to be almost meaningless .
A survey of schoolchildren has suggested that more than 10 per cent now believe in creationism .
But the Evangelical Alliance , whose members now number around 3 per cent of the UK population , reckons that only a third of its members – about 1 per cent of the population – are creationists .
About a third think Genesis is merely symbolic , and a third believe that God worked through evolution but is still capable of intervening in specific ways .
Its most recent , unpublished , survey shows that the proportion seeing the Genesis account as symbolic is increasing , the EA 's Head of Theology , Dr Justin Thacker , says .
Evan Harris accepts that the number of British schools teaching creationism is tiny .
But , as an MP , he is worried about the increasing activity of religious lobby groups in public life .
" Groups like the Evangelical Alliance , the Christian Institute and Christian Action Research and Education are now all much more organised and active in seeking to change public policy .
They are making the running in parliament , much more than the leadership of the Catholic Church .
The Church of England 's bishops are much more evangelical too ; their centre of gravity has changed form the days when liberals ruled the roost .
And the C of E has been much more active in Parliament . "
All this is having a real impact , Dr Harris suggests .
" In the days of Thatcher all the mainstream Tories voted in favour of embryo research .
Twenty years on most of the new suave modernising Cameroonian Tories vote against it . "
Academics detect a similar shift .
Professor Steve Jones , of University College London , who has been teaching genetics and evolutionary biology for 30 years , has said that religious students – even those studying medicine – are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to evolution , demanding to be exempted from classes and exam questions on the subject .
Creationism , like Coca - Cola , came here from the United States .
The American lobby group Answers in Genesis , with its $ 13 m annual budget , now has an office in the UK from where staff go round giving illustrated talks about how humans and dinosaurs roamed the earth together .
Another conservative group , Truth in Science , has adopted a strategy of lobbying for schools to " Teach the Controversy " in an attempt to get Intelligent Design , a spin - off of creationism , taught alongside evolution in school science lessons .
In 2006 it sent resource packs to the heads of science of all British secondary schools ; New Scientist claims that 59 schools have used , or plan to use , them .
The fear generated by such tactics is what did for Michael Reiss .
" Even if he does n't support all this , what he said might be seen to give succour to it , " says Andrew Copson of the British Humanist Association .
" I can understand why alarm bells go off with people who are familiar with ' Teach the controversy ' tactics of people who want to baby - step creationism into our science classrooms . "
All of this mystifies the vast majority of the nation 's Christians who have been taught since the time of St Augustine , who died AD430 , that where there appears to be a conflict between demonstrated knowledge and a literal reading of the bible then the scriptures should be interpreted metaphorically .
They see no conflict between faith and reason because , as Pope John Paul II put it : " God created man as rational and free , thereby placing himself under man 's judgement . "
Just last month the present Pope reiterated the same line , warning of the dangers of fundamentalist readings of the Bible .
Each generation , he said , needs to find its collective interpretation of the text .
For this task of interpretation – which can never be never completely finished – science offers a major tool .
It all perplexes academics who specialise in the interplay between science and religion too .
Creationism does n't just involve many scientific errors , it relies on a major theological one too .
" When Robert Burns tell us his love ' is like a red , red rose ' , we know that we are not meant to think that his girlfriend has green leaves and prickles , " says the particle physicist and Anglican priest , Sir John Polkinghorne .
Why , he wonders , would any rational person want to read the Bible in that way ?
The world of science he encounters is a much more subtle one .
" There 's a cosmic religiosity among physicists , " he insists , though " biologists see more ambiguity , perhaps because they look at the wastefulness of nature , and perhaps because sequencing the human genome has made them triumphalist . "
It is more complex even than that : the head of the Human Genome Project , Dr Francis Collins , last year published a book about his journey from atheism into faith arguing that science and religion , far from being irreconcilable , are in fact in deep harmony .
In the past 30 years an area of inter- disciplinary activity has opened up to explore this .
Areas of research include cognitive neuro - sciences and issues like freewill and consciousness and whether human minds are merely matter or something more .
In evolutionary psychology they have also explored together questions like the origins of altruism – asking whether evolutionary biology can give an adequate account of why people are willing to sacrifice themselves on behalf of others .
In paleobiology they are asking questions like how eyes evolve in different lineages – suggesting that evolution is n't a random or chance process but is channelled by certain chemically - determined pathways .
In cosmology there is a universe versus multiverses debate .
" All that going on , but all the public knows about is Dawkins , " says Dr Denis Alexander of the Faraday Institute in Cambridge .
" Academic discussion on the relationship between science and religion is genuinely exploratory , not polarised .
To most people in it Dawkins just sounds rather odd . "
John Hedley Brooke , who recently retired as the first Professor of Science and Religion at the University of Oxford , is more sanguine .
" These eruptions take place from time to time historically , " he shrugs .
" Dawkins is just a throwback to 19th - century rationalism .
He has a strong emotional antagonism that is very indiscriminate and treats all kinds of religion the same .
A lot of fine distinctions that get lost in the polemics .
The problem is that it is all a cumulative process in which the extremes feed off one another . "
" Paradoxically , Dawkins is the biggest recruiter for creationism in this country , " says Denis Alexander .
Recently , he says , Bill Demcksi , a leading US creationist , e-mailed Dawkins to thank him for his assistance .
" The danger is that all this polarisation will make some believers more anti-science which is not a clever move tactically . "
He hopes that whoever succeeds Dawkins as Oxford 's Professor of the Public Understanding of Science is more interested in promoting science than in attacking religion .
On the other side of the argument Evan Harris is unapologetic about contributing to what Julian Baggini waggishly calls this " assertiveness inflation " .
" It 's good that there 's this tension , " the MP says .
" These debates need to be had in public .
Science has nothing to fear from them .
I do n't think we 're winning ; we 've won a few battles ; but there 's a war to be fought . "
He concedes that Michael Reiss may have been sacked unfairly – saying that the " overstrong line " taken by Kroto and Co should not be taken as representative of all on the secular side – but points out that employment injustices are perpetrated every time a church school refuses to appoint a maths teacher because she does n't " have Jesus in her heart " .
The danger is that between the strident secularists and the fanatical fundamentalists some important middle ground is being squeezed out .
" Dawkins sees religion as credulous , superstitious and prejudiced but mature religious traditions teach people to challenge all that , " says Tina Beattie .
" Science will never offer an answer to the parents of Madeleine McCann .
Nor will it ever be irrational to go to a Mozart concert , though science can never explain the genius of his music .
The new atheism completely misunderstands the way that human beings experience the poetry and narrative of life . "
Perhaps the conflict is not between science and religion but between good and bad ways of doing both .
In all of us there will always be a struggle between the craving for certainty , purity and closure and the acceptance of mystery , brokenness and provisionality .
At their best , both scientists and people of faith are in a permanent state of awe - struck humility before the wonder and strangeness and messiness of things .
At their worst , they are arrogant , dogmatic , and incurious .
There 's a bit of both in all of us , of course .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Ann Nixon Cooper , 106 years old , has seen presidents come and go in her lifetime and has outlived most of them .
On a sunny fall morning , she left her weathered but well - kept Tudor home in Atlanta , Georgia , to vote early -- this time for Barack Obama .
The African - American centenarian remembers a time not long ago when she was barred from voting because of her race .
Now she hopes to see the day that Obama is elected as the nation 's first black president .
" I ain't got time to die , " Cooper said with a smile .
" Even if he did n't win , I was happy for him just to be nominated , " said the former socialite .
" The first black president -- is n't that something , at 106 years old ? "
Watch Obama say ' Yes we can ' »
At the Fulton County government center , Cooper was greeted by Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin .
" I thought that I would accompany her today to support her , but also to say to all people that this is a choice we have , " Franklin said .
" As all Americans , we should cherish the right to vote and take every opportunity we have to vote our opinions .
She is an inspiration to me personally , but she is also quite an inspiration to all Atlanta . "
Watch Cooper talk about her life and experiences »
Cooper , in a wheelchair and helped by two caretakers , bypassed the long lines of early voters and headed right to the voting machine .
Her 106 - year - old hands reached out to the 21st - century touch screen to cast her vote for Obama .
Back at her home , surrounded by the elegance of a bygone era , Cooper clutched the photo albums laid out on her dining room table .
The longtime socialite and community leader has called Atlanta home since the 1920s .
See images of Cooper 's day »
She and her late husband , prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper , raised four children in this house .
" Our days and nights were just social affairs , " she said .
The home was a center of Atlanta 's black society and the scene of many parties .
Celebrities , including the late singer Nat King Cole , dropped in to visit .
Do n't Miss Election Center 2008
" It 's been a house with a heap of living going on in it , " said Cooper .
She wears a charm bracelet that former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young gave her when she turned 99 .
" He adds a charm every year , " said friend and caretaker Sally Warner .
" Andy says he will have to apply for a loan soon to keep up with Mrs. Cooper . "
Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103 .
She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip .
On a typical day , Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood - paneled sitting room .
" Her favorite show is ' The Price is Right , ' although she is getting used to Drew Carey as the new host , " said Warner .
Other favorite shows include " Oprah " and " Dancing with the Stars . "
When the weather is nice , Cooper spends afternoons on her screened porch , watching traffic go by and reminiscing about old times .
Occasionally she leaves the house for an outing .
Cooper was born in Shelbyville , Tennessee , in 1902 .
She grew up in Nashville with uncles and an aunt who worked as a domestic for wealthy whites .
She married Albert Cooper in Nashville in 1922 , and the couple moved to Atlanta .
Three of Cooper 's four children have died ; her surviving daughter is 83 .
She has 14 grandchildren living and many great - grandchildren and great - great - grandchildren .
When asked about the secret to her longevity , Cooper said , " I do n't know how it happened , but being cheerful had a lot to do with it .
I 've always been a happy person , a giggling person -- a wide - mouthed person ! "
To young people , Cooper offers this advice : " Keep smiling .
No matter what , you get out and vote .
Vote your choice . "

The Detroit Free Press and Detroit News will become the first major metropolitan newspapers in the U.S. to end daily home delivery , the papers announced Tuesday .
The Detroit News will still be available on newsstands daily , newspaper officials said Tuesday .
" We 're fighting for our survival , " said David Hunke , publisher of the Free Press and CEO of the Detroit Media Partnership , a joint operating agreement between the two papers .
" We think its time to take a geometric leap forward in what we 've known as newspapers . "
Beginning sometime in the first three months of 2009 , the two newspapers will provide home delivery on Thursdays , Fridays and Sundays only , Hunke said during a news conference in Detroit , Michigan .
Papers will be on newsstands every day , and the papers ' online offerings will be expanded , he said .
" The dynamics of delivering information to audiences has changed forever due to technology , " Hunke said in a statement on the plan .
Costs for paper , ink and fuel to deliver papers were forcing the papers into cuts in newsroom talent that would damage their abilities to report the news , Hunke said .
Paying for delivery vehicles to cover 300,000 miles nightly , he said , did not make economic sense at a time when 63 percent of readers have broadband Internet access .
As for those without computers and broadband access at home , " this is n't necessarily gonna be the best news for them , " Hunke said .
" Our economics have become unsustainable , " said Jonathan Wolman , publisher and editor of the Detroit News .
" We 've got to embrace reality , and we 've got to embrace innovation , " said Paul Anger , executive editor of the Free Press , owned by Gannett Corp. , the country 's largest newspaper publisher .
The Free Press , the nation 's 20th - largest daily paper , had a daily circulation of 298,243 and 605,000 on Sunday as of the end of September .
Those numbers were down almost 7 percent and 4 percent , respectively , from the previous six months , according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations .
The Detroit News , the country 's 49th largest newspaper , is owned by MediaNews Group and had a daily circulation of 178,280 in September .
It does not publish a Sunday edition .
The Free Press ' circulation is down 19 percent and the News is down 22 percent since 2002 , the Free Press reported Tuesday .
Hunke said the newspapers would face about a 9 percent reduction in their workforces under the plan .
However no layoffs in their newsrooms , which he described as " fiercely competitive , " were planned .
The Detroit Media Partnership employs more than 2,100 people , CNN affiliate WDIV - TV reported .
Personnel cuts would be negotiated with the papers ' unions , Hunke said .
" We believe it will break the cycle of buyouts and downsizing " that has become common in the newspaper industry , Wolman said .
Newspaper publishers have had a rough year .
Across the industry , daily circulation dropped 4.6 percent in the six months ending in September .
Gannett has been in the process of cutting 10 percent of its workforce across its 85 newspapers nationwide .
McClatchy Co. , the nation 's second - largest newspaper company , has been pursuing cuts at its papers , including the Miami Herald .
Tribune Co. , which owns the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times , among others , announced earlier this month it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
The East Valley Tribune in Mesa , Arizona , a 100,000 - circulation newspaper owned by Freedom Newspapers , announced in October it would move from a daily to a four - day publication beginning in January .
The national Christian Science Monitor is moving its daily content online and dropping its daily print edition next year .
Anger said Tuesday that Detroit readers have been seeking those kinds of changes in how they get their news .
" Generations of readers are telling us they 'd like information delivered in a different way , " he said , promising " a fast reading , provocative news report in print as well as online . "
The Detroit papers will price their three - day home delivery subscriptions at $ 12 a month , including a daily edition delivered by e-mail , Hunke said .
Wolman said mail subscriptions would be available to home - bound readers .

Utah ’s growing tourism industry and the star - studded Sundance Film Festival are being targeted for a boycott by bloggers , gay rights activists and others seeking to punish the Mormon church for its aggressive promotion of California ’s ban on gay marriage .
It could be a heavy price to pay .
Tourism brings in $ 6 billion a year to Utah , with world - class skiing , the spectacular red rock country and the film festival founded by Robert Redford among the state ’s popular tourist draws .
“ At a fundamental level , the Utah Mormons crossed the line on this one , ” said gay rights activist John Aravosis , an influential Washington , D.C - based blogger .
“ They just took marriage away from 20,000 couples and made their children bastards .
You do n’t do that and get away with it . ”
…. The backlash against the church — and by extension Utah — has been immediate .
Protests erupted outside Mormon temples , Facebook groups formed telling people to boycott Utah and Web sites such as mormonsstoleourrights.com began popping up , calling for an end to the church ’s tax - exempt status .
Aravosis is the editor of the popular political blog , americablog.com , which has about 900,000 unique monthly visitors .
He ’s calling for skiers to choose any state but Utah and for Hollywood actors and directors to pull out of the Sundance Film Festival .
Other bloggers and readers have responded to his call .
“ There ’s a movement afoot and large donors are involved who are very interested in organizing a campaign , because I do not believe in frivolous boycotts , ” said Aravosis , who has helped organize boycotts against Dr. Laura ’s television show , Microsoft and Ford over gay rights issues .
“ The main focus is going to be going after the Utah brand .
At this point , honestly , we ’re going to destroy the Utah brand .
It is a hate state . ”
Messages left with a Sundance spokeswoman Thursday and Friday were not immediately returned .
LONG BEACH , California ( Reuters ) - From pricey luxury sedans to popular hybrid cars , automobiles made overseas are stacking up at ports and parking lots around the United States as supplies far outstrip demand amid the nation ’s worst auto market in more than 25 years .

At the Long Beach port near Los Angeles , Toyota Motor Corp vehicles including Prius hybrids , FJ Cruiser sport utility vehicles and Lexus IS 250 luxury sedans are being stored on a vast construction site that will one day be a new container terminal .
The site became a gigantic parking lot when Toyota and Daimler AG ’s Mercedes - Benz asked the port for space to store thousands of vehicles that dealerships have not been able to take on due to sluggish sales .
“ It ’s unusual that they would be here longer than a few days , but that ’s the situation now , ” said Art Wong , a spokesman for the Port of Long Beach .
“ They ca n’t move it through their pipeline fast enough so they are asking for additional space while they keep their vehicles here more than a few days , and in some cases more than a few weeks . ”
The port has not counted how many additional cars were being stored , but Wong said Toyota has leased an additional 23 acres of space while Mercedes - Benz has leased about 20 more acres .
Nissan Motor Co Ltd , which brings its cars in through the neighboring Los Angeles port , had been talking to Long Beach about leasing space , Wong said , though that arrangement fell through .
A Port of Los Angeles spokeswoman , Theresa Adams - Lopez , said Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics ( WWL ) , which operates the terminal that brings in Nissan ’s vehicles , had shifted vehicle storage to another state .
Nissan spokeswoman Katherine Zachary said the company last increased its space at the Port of Los Angeles in February .
“ As a normal course of business , we ’ve got cars moving out of there all the time to various points across the country , ” Zachary said in an e-mail .
WWL , which is based in Norway , would not comment on specific customers , but said auto inventories were building up across the United States .
“ We are seeing cargo buildup at ports of entry on both coasts as well as at other inventory points such as factories and rail yards and dealerships , ” Christopher Connor , the head of WWL ’s business in the Americas , said in a statement .
Other ports are also seeing a buildup of cars , though not all of them are leasing large tracts of land to automakers .
The San Diego port , which brings in Honda Motor Co , Volkswagen AG and Mitsubishi Corp vehicles , has about 14,000 cars on its property .
That ’s about 2,000 more vehicles than usual , according to spokesman John Gilmore , who said the additional cars belong to a range of manufacturers .
COLLAPSING DEMAND
Global automakers have been sideswiped by the collapsing demand for new cars and trucks .
A market slowdown that began in the United States has spread to Europe and Asia .
Detroit ’s embattled automakers have been pushed to the brink of failure by the downturn and are asking the U.S. Congress for a $ 34 billion rescue package .
But the sharp decline in sales in October and November blindsided even the industry ’s better - performing manufacturers like Toyota and Honda .
Toyota said on Friday that it was cutting North American output by idling factories that produce vehicles such as the Camry and Corolla , the Japanese automakers ’ top - selling cars .
Toyota spokesman Mike Goss said inventory had been pushed to “ unacceptably high ” levels that would take 80 to 90 days of sales to clear .
That is still less than the 115 - day supply of inventory on average for General Motors Corp , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC , but it is double Toyota ’s inventory levels of just a year earlier .
The surge in inventories has been a small blessing to some in the industry .
Automobile processors , who wash , repair and accessorize imported cars before they head to dealerships , said revenue from storing cars is helping offset the market ’s overall sluggishness .
MidTexas International Center Inc , whose Midlothian , Texas , facility processes vehicles for Kia Motors Corp , Mazda Motor Corp and Toyota ’s Lexus , expects to break even this year despite the dismal auto market because automakers are paying for cars to sit on its lots for longer .
“ The inflow of vehicles is a lot greater than the outflow , ” MidTexas President Randy Denton said .
“ That helps to offset the loss of income from the vehicles that we ’re not processing . ”

The last of the commemorative Lincoln pennies to be released will show the half - finished U.S. Capitol dome , a symbol of his effort to preserve the union .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
For the first time in 50 years , the penny is getting redesigned , with four versions coming next year to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln 's birth , the U.S. Mint announced Monday .
While the coin will continue to depict Lincoln 's likeness on the front , the reverse side will bear one of four new designs , the Mint said .
The designs show milestones in the life of the 16th president : the Kentucky log cabin of his birth , his youth working as an Indiana rail splitter , his service at the State Capitol in Illinois , and his effort to preserve the union during the Civil War as depicted by a half - finished image of the U.S. Capitol dome .
The first of the coins debuts Feb. 12 , with the others following in three - month intervals .
The release date , besides being Lincoln 's birthday , comes a century after the production of the original Lincoln cent in 1909 .
The Lincoln cent was the first circulating coin to feature a person 's likeness , and also the first to depict a U.S. president .
A Lincoln commemorative silver dollar will also be released in 2009 .
" These coins are a tribute to one of our greatest presidents ... he believed all men were created equal , and his life was a model for accomplishing through honesty , integrity , loyalty and a lifetime of education , " said U.S. Mint director Ed Moy .

The internet - left seems to be horrifically consumed with the Chambliss victory , but it all seems rather baseless , rooted purely in emotion .
Nothing went wrong for the Democrats , they simply did not win .
To prove my point I 'll refer to the following analogy :
In any given state ( with a Senate Election ) the incumbent walks to the top of a building holding their opponents ' egg .
Throughout the campaign the challenger attempts to " protect " their egg by any means .
The height of the building is decided by the political environment .
Using Georgia as an example , the initial deficit facing a Democratic Challenger is comparatively higher than other Senate races across the country .
The demographics in Georgia were not advantageous to Jim Martin at any point .
After the November 4th result , Martin 's egg was essentially intact , but showed signs of breakdown ; Martin initially lost by about 3 percent .
When the runoff was sanctioned , the same egg was used again as Jim Martin was still the candidate .
Martin not only had to protect his egg , but he had to do a better job , from a taller building ; the Republican 's had motivation and , as evidenced by the initial result , more support .
On the second time around , Martin 's already weakened egg shattered on the pavement below .
Did this Republican victory signal a blatant rejection of Democratic values ?
No .
It is impossible to argue that the Democratic brand was rejected in the Georgia runoff , if it was already rejected on November 4th , nothing changed ; remember Obama lost Georgia too .
If you look at the polls in the initial Senate election , or the runoff Martin NEVER led .
It is absolutely foolish for anyone to manufacture a Democratic " problem " based upon the runoff result .
If this was your message you should have been on it 28 days ago .
A Republican led the entire election cycle , and eventually went on to win ; there was no upset , but there was some drama .
This is what should have happened ; there is no Democratic tragedy , there is nothing to learn .

It ’s been over a year since Ben “ Yahtzee ” Croshaw was plucked from YouTube obscurity to host Escapist Magazine ’s Zero Punctuation video series , and the acid - tongued Brit with the surreal , machine gun patter remains the undisputed star of game reviews , with regular appearances on G4 TV , at the Game Developers Conference , and more .
But does his massive fan base buy the games he loves ( which are few ) , and skip the titles he hates ( nearly all of them ) ?
[ digg=http://digg.com/gaming_news/Do_Zero_Punctuation_Reviews_Influence_Videogame_Sales]Depends on who you ask .
Here ’s a case study on the relation between an online video celebrity and the consumer behavior of his fans :
Croshaw recently gave a rare rave to indie art game darling Braid , available on Xbox Live ’s download service .
( Conquering its mind - bending challenges , he memorably noted , is “ a more satisfying feeling than teabagging a hundred noobs in any deathmatch shooter you care to name . ” )
But did his fans follow his advice with their dollars ?
“ I do n’t see any real case for Zero Punctuation increasing sales by a lot , ” Braid designer Jonathan Blow told me , after checking his game ’s Xbox Live purchase stats .
Looking at the period when Croshaw ’s review went online , he added , “ There definitely is n’t a visible sales spike or anything like that . ”
That is n’t the full story , however .
Last May , Croshaw effusively praised Painkiller , a somewhat obscure , hyperviolent first - person shooter from 2004 ; a pull - quote from the review ( “ All you really need to know is there is a gun that shoots shurikens and lightning ” ) showed up as an ad on Steam , the game download service , generating big gamer acclaim .
On Amazon , sales of the old game immediately jumped 7,400 percent .
Yahtzee ’s impact in this case was so notable , Escapist publisher Alexander Macris even cites it in the company ’s marketing brochure , to demonstrate the site ’s reach and influence .
“ As I ’m sure you know , ” he told me , “ media companies are always fighting to prove audience engagement and relevance . ”
As to the comparative lack of consumer engagement after his Braid review , Macris speculates that the game “ was already a breakthrough hit by the time Yahtzee reviewed it , while Painkiller was a lesser - known title that was given a new look based on his review . ”
Maybe .
My personal guess is that Croshaw ’s audience is overwhelmingly comprised of gamers who enjoy the vulgar smack talk in his reviews , which are almost always of hardcore titles from established genres , but no matter what he says , are less interested in experimental games without the usual rock ’em sock ’em conventions .
That would be a sad irony , given Yahtzee ’s passionate advocacy of games as an art form .
But then , that ’s generally the challenge of online video stardom — once your fans decide why they like you , it ’s difficult to stray outside their expectations .

Everyone comes to an understanding of liberty through a slightly different route , which is one reason why there need to be so many varieties of primers available , and why people continue to write them .
The newest one has the potential to become a classic among a certain type of reader , a business owner who seeks to understand his or her place in the world , and to be inspired to help bring about the type of world that is necessary in order for business to make a valued contribution to society .
The book is Inclined to Liberty , and its author is Louis Carabini , the founder of the precious - metals - trading firm Monex .
In fact , as a means of promoting this wonderful book , a special website has been created to draw new readers to it .
It is InclinedtoLiberty.com .
This is an excellent site to recommend to any businessperson you know .
The book is divided into many small chapters , each of which takes only a few minutes to read .
The topics are the burning ones of the day , each touching on an issue that is critical to the survival of freedom .
Carabini deals with the place of entrepreneurship , private property , the legitimacy of profit , the urge to coercively redistribute wealth , the impulse to tax and regulate , inflation and monetary theory , and other such issues .
The answers he provides are the ones that you wished you had at your fingertips in casual conversation with people who toss off statist bromides they have absorbed from the media or the classroom .
He deals with the facts , data , some history , and clear theory to establish not only the case for freedom but also the massively important contribution of enterprise and commerce to the very existence of civilization .
I get the impression that this book is the work of a lifetime of arguments and annoyances that have long confronted the author in many situations : dinner parties , business meetings , civic meetings , and the like .
What he has done here is provide rational responses to relentless anticapitalistic propaganda , which in itself is an important contribution .
But there is more here .
This book serves to provide a kind of framing - up of how the real world works , in terms that speak directly to the individual engaged in business .
Such a person is n’t especially interested , at first , in learning the details of abstract economic theory or in learning a correct approach to economics .
Authors such as Henry Hazlitt , Ron Paul , and Murray Rothbard have already written those books .
Carabini has written a work for those who are n’t particularly political or even that inquisitive about economic theory as such .
It is for businesspeople who seek to understand their place in the world , people who are sometimes hit with core questions that lead to self - doubt .
He leaves them seeing their role as positive for their employees and also for society at large .
They are constantly told that they are selfish and a drain on society ; he helps them see that they are society ’s benefactors who are doing good by doing well .
As with any great primer , there are also contributions to broader understanding here .
The way the author sees it , there are two general approaches to social affairs :
There are those inclined to liberty — freedom of the individual to live his or her life in any peaceful way .
And there are those who are inclined to mastery — permitting others to live their lives only as another sees fit .
There is a massive historical infrastructure behind the idea that all social interactions are based on either force or free will , dating even to the ancient world .
But it is a lesson that is still unlearned — or rather , it is casually denied by people who recommend what they call humane social policies .
Surely the rich should give to the poor .
Surely luxury must relent in the face of necessity .
Surely those who start life with a boost from wealth or social position should assist those who have neither .
One can multiply these claims without limit , all with an eye to fairness , equality , safety , security , humanitarianism , and so on .
There are many things to say about each claim — for example , that the political means to achieve them often yield the opposite effect .
But one point avoided by those who recommend such ideas is that every " humanitarian " policy put into effect makes society more violent .
They deny this , of course , but violence is intrinsic to their chosen means .
They must pass laws enforced by bureaucrats who are empowered to force people to do things they would n’t do voluntarily , and to take property from those to whom it belongs and give it to those who did n’t earn it .
This requires violence and the threat of violence , since every edict of the state is ultimately enforced by this means and no other .
These impulses increase the role of the master - slave relationship in society and diminish the extent to which society is made up of people involved in voluntary pursuits .
Society under the control of the redistributionist mindset will be a police state .
This is the hardest subject to get left - liberals to discuss , because it is a point that they do not want to face , since no leftist genuinely believes in the police state .
They like to change the subject or focus on the problem rather than their proposed means of solving it .
Carabini has come up with a thousand ways to get them to face it , and he reduces the point to the broad claim that there are only two ways to think about social affairs : liberty or mastery .
The life of a person involved in business is all about service and persuasion .
The businessperson is dependent on workers who want to be there rather than somewhere else , upon consumers who are willing to trade money for a product , on suppliers who are willing to sell — at all levels , business depends on human volition .
What Carabini has done is explain that this impulse can be expanded into an overall worldview , made consistent and carried to its fullest to create a massively productive and free society .
The book is not intended to be the first and last book on the topic .
Its purpose is to introduce a tendency of thought and to provide the raison d’être for enterprise .
In that sense , it is an important confidence booster for people involved in commerce , providing answers to their colleagues who criticize freedom , and pointing to other resources .
In this sense , I regard this book as written not so much for students ( though they would find it valuable ) but for mature adults who have been too busy to think much about economics and politics .
The author shows them that now is the time to develop a coherent view of society .

Prosecutors cast doubts on lie detector tests
12/11/2008
By JUAN A. LOZANO / Associated Press
Prosecutors cast doubt Wednesday on two lie detector tests that a federal judge indicted on sexual abuse charges is trying to get admitted into his trial , saying they were riddled with errors and that the man who performed the polygraphs has himself failed such a test .
But attorneys for U.S. District Judge Samuel Kent argued in a court hearing that the polygraph tests taken in August and September were valid and accurate and their results did not indicate their client was lying when he denied the allegations .
The hearing on whether to admit the polygraph tests was set to resume Thursday .
Kent , 59 , was indicted in August on charges he fondled a former case manager and tried to force her into a sexual act .
He is facing two counts of abusive sexual contact and one count of attempted aggravated sexual abuse following a U.S. Justice Department investigation into complaints by case manager Cathy McBroom .
His trial is set to begin Jan. 26 .
John Swartz , the polygrapher who performed the two lie detector tests , testified he asked Kent questions related to the accusations against him , including whether he had a sexual encounter with Broom against her will and whether he touched her sexual organs without her consent .
Kent answered " no " to all these questions , only answering " yes " when asked if all his physical encounters with McBroom were entirely consensual .
Dick DeGuerin , Kent 's high - profile criminal defense lawyer , has previously said that everything that happened between Kent and McBroom was consensual .
Her attorney has denied this .
" Was there deception ever indicated on these tests ? " DeGuerin asked Swartz .
" In my opinion , no , " Swartz responded .
During the hearing , DeGuerin said that McBroom has alleged that Kent had an erection during the alleged harassment .
But Kent 's lawyer made public for the first time that since 1999 the judge has been diagnosed as impotent .
Prosecutor Peter Ainsworth questioned the validity of Swartz 's tests .
He said an initial report from September that prosecutors received from Swartz was full of mistakes , including listing the wrong questions that were asked during the tests .
Ainsworth said he did n't receive a corrected report until late Tuesday evening .
" These are different questions ( on the corrected report ) .
Which did you ask ?
How did you get this wrong ? "
Ainsworth asked .
Swartz had no explanation for the mistakes .
Ainsworth also criticized Swartz for not having the test results reviewed by an independent party , something that experts in the polygraph field call for .
The prosecutor also revealed during the hearing that Swartz in 2006 failed a lie detector test he took while applying for a job with the FBI .
Swartz had denied during the test to using illegal drugs .
He said he had forgotten about taking marijuana in his youth .
If convicted of attempted aggravated sexual abuse , Kent could face up to life in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 .
Each of the two counts of abusive sexual contact carries a sentence of up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 .
Kent was the first federal judge in 17 years indicted while still on the bench .
McBroom accused the judge of physical sexual harassment over a four - year period starting in 2003 when he was the only U.S. District Court judge in Galveston , an island beach town 50 miles southeast of Houston .
McBroom has said the alleged harassment culminated in March 2007 , when the judge pulled up her blouse and bra and tried to force her to perform oral sex when they were interrupted .
Her accusations were first investigated by the Judicial Council of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
That panel suspended Kent in September 2007 for four months with pay but did n't detail the allegations against him .
The Associated Press does not normally name alleged victims of sexual abuse , but McBroom 's attorney and her family have used her name in publicly discussing the case .
A gag order has been issued in the case by U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson , a Florida jurist appointed to preside over the trial .
Pending his trial , Kent continues to hear cases at the federal courthouse in Houston , where he was transferred this year as part of his punishment by the judicial council .
McBroom was also relocated to Houston after reporting her allegations .

Polygraph operator John S. Swartz of Houston , Texas -- a graduate of the U.S. Government 's polygraph school and former Drug Enforcement Agency employee -- reportedly failed the drug- related portion of an FBI pre-employment polygraph administered in 2006 .

A few NBA teams are clearing cap room for the summer of 2010 , but LeBron James ' future might be long decided by then .
James told the Cleveland Plain Dealer he is pleased with the Cleveland Cavaliers ' improvement and is considering signing an extension during this summer .
" You play out this season of course ; I will consider it , " James told the Plain Dealer on Saturday before the Cavs practiced at the Pepsi Center .
" The direction we are headed is everything I expected and more . "
James has not talked publicly about signing this summer until now .
The Cavaliers have made great progress this season and are off to a 22 - 4 start , the second - best record in the NBA .
James had signed a three - year , $ 43 million deal with the Cavs in 2006 .
That contract includes a player option for 2010 - 11 worth $ 17.4 million .
Many believed James would forego the option , but no one had considered his signing an extension .
There has been speculation James will end up in one of the NBA 's larger markets -- maybe with the New York Knicks .
" I definitely want to keep an open mind , I will look at everything , " James told the Plain Dealer .
" [ The extension ] is a good point .
I think me and my group have pretty much made good decisions so far and we 'll look at the options and go from there . "

People who exercise on work days are happier , suffer less stress and are more productive
People 's mood significantly improves after exercising
People who exercise on work days are more productive , happier and suffer less stress than on non -gym days , scientists revealed today .
University of Bristol researchers found that employees who enjoyed a workout before going to work - or exercised during lunchbreaks - were better equipped to handle whatever the day threw at them .
It also found that people 's general mood improved on days of exercise but they became less calm on non-exercise days .
The research , published in the International Journal of Workplace Health Management , is the first of it's kind to prove that exercise during work hours has mental , as well as physical benefits .
Jo Coulson , Research Associate in the University 's Department of Exercise , Nutrition and Health Sciences , said : ' Our statistical results were very important .
' On exercise days , people 's mood significantly improved after exercising .
Mood stayed about the same on days they did n't , with the exception of people 's sense of calm which deteriorated .
' Critically , workers performed significantly better on exercise days and across all three areas we measured , known as mental - interpersonal , output and time demands . '
The study group was made up of 200 university staff and employees working for a pensions company and an IT firm .
Each employee completed a questionnaire about their mood , workload and performance on days when they exercised .
The data was compared to answers from days participants opted not to exercise .
The workers , who were already in the habit of exercising , chose their own mode , frequency and intensity of workout to better reflect a real - life situation .
Most used a gym and did classes while some did weight training and team sports .
The key findings were :
Seventy two per cent reported improvements in time management on exercise days compared to non-exercise days .
Seventy nince per cent said mental and interpersonal performance was better on days they exercised .
Seventy four per cent said they managed their workload better .
The questionnaire scores were 27 per cent higher on exercise days in categories such as dealing calmly with stress and 41 per cent higher for feeling motivated to work .
Those who exercised were also 21 per cent higher for concentration on work , 25 per cent for working without unscheduled breaks and 22 per cent higher for finishing work on time .
Feedback from focus groups found that people who built exercise into their workday were re-energised , calmer and more able to solve problems .
Ms Coulson added : ' It 's generally well - known now that there are many physical and mental health benefits that can be gained from regular exercise .
' If people try to fit an active break into their working day , they might also experience the added bonus of their whole day feeling much more productive .
' And that always feels good in our busy lives .
' The study also begs the question whether employers can afford not to be encouraging active breaks .
' The suggestion is that employers who are ahead of the game in offering proper on - site facilities actually get less from their employees on days that they do n't exercise . '
“ They just did n’t get it , ” he said .
“ They did n’t understand the importance of our concern . ”
Sam Zarifi , the Asia Pacific director for Amnesty International , said while the Chinese government has made some strides in recent years , it has hardened its stance on other issues , such as Tibetan autonomy .
“ China has moved forward , but not at the pace that we had hoped , ” Zarifi said .
“ Certainly for the I.O.C. to pat itself on the back I think is not really a fair evaluation of all that they accomplished . ”
The I.O.C. report also applauded the Games for improving public health in China , saying that authorities “ took new steps to improve food and water safety ” and quoted a World Health Official , Hans Troedsson , as saying the public - health legacy of the Games is a “ long - term gift to China . ”
There was no mention of the tainted - milk scandal that broke just after the conclusion of the Games and which has led to the death of four infants and sickened more than 50,000 others .
Worden pointed to reports that a Chinese journalist ’s blog post about the contaminated milk was removed from a Web site just as the Games were beginning .
Chinese reporters were also prohibited from reporting on food - safety issues during the Olympics , she said .
“ I think it has to be said that the news was there of the toxic baby formula , ” Worden said .
“ Censorship in China is a matter of life and death . ”
Despite the timing of the tainted - milk scandal , the public health improvements brought about by the Games should not be overlooked , said Zhen Xiaozhen , who served as the medical service manager of the Beijing Olympics .
She pointed to a ban on smoking in public places and the training of 3,000 medical volunteers .
“ These health care volunteers are the legacy for the future , ” she said .
The meetings in London are part of a debriefing process in which Beijing organizers pass along technical advice to those planning the London Games in 2012 .
This “ knowledge management ” process dates to 2000 , and was instituted by the I.O.C. president , Jacques Rogge , to improve efficiency and planning of future Olympic Games , said Emmanuelle Moreau , a spokeswoman for the Olympic committee .
“ The Beijing debrief focuses on the operational aspects of the Games and does not intend to address issues that fall outside the remit of the I.O.C. , ” she said in an e-mail message .
Moreau said the questions raised by the human - rights groups will be examined next year at the annual Olympic Congress in Copenhagen .

Religious identification in the U.S. :
How American adults view their religion .
A parallel report for Canada is located elsewhere
Summary :
During the late 20th century up to 1990 , the popularity of Christianity had been stable in the U.S. About 87 % of adults identified themselves as Christians .
The country then experienced a major change .
The gradual drift away from religion towards secularism that began after World War II began to have an impact on adult Christian affiliation .
Significant numbers of American adults began to leave Christian denominations and from other organized religions .
By 2007 , the percentage of Christians had dropped to 78.4 % .
By 2014 , it reached 70.6 % .
That is a drop of 7.8 percentage points in seven years -- about one percentage point a year .
This decline appears to be continuing .

明朝体の 「の」の字をひたすら表示するという作品を、ニコニコ動画に投稿しました。
明朝体は、まだまだこんなものじゃない。 この動画って、ある意味「オレってば、こんなにいっぱいフォント持ってるぜ」という*1、持ち物自慢みたいなもんですよね……。
ただし、入れたかったけど入れられなかったフォントも多数。
游明朝体と游築見出し明朝体、丸明オールド、日本の活字書体名作精選、イワタ明朝あたりが入ってないのが痛いし、S明朝やV7明も入れたいところですが、所有してないものは仕方がありません。フォント収集は半ば趣味とはいえ、仕事に使うあてのないものまで購入するわけにはいかないんです。結構高額なのもありますしね……。まあ、印刷物からスキャンする手もあったんですが、 めんどくさかったので それをやると秀英体とか本蘭明朝まで入れたくなってくるので、今回はやめておきました。
そんなわけで、この動画に入っていない「の」の字を提供してくれる酔狂な御仁の登場を待つことにいたしましょう。仮想ボディ枠付きのアウトライン.aiデータで。ほんとに待ってますから！
映像でのフォント利用について少し。 知ってる人は知ってると思いますが、いくつかのフォントメーカーでは、フォントを映像に使って配信する場合（主にテレビ番組やDVDのテロップなどを想定しています）、別途ライセンス契約・使用料が必要なのです。印刷物とは違い、フォントを買って来てそのまま使うというわけにはいかなかったりするのです。余談ですが、テロップにしょぼいフォントが幅をきかせていたりするのは、そういう理由があるんですね。
で、この動画の場合ですが、やや微妙ながら許容の範囲内であろうと判断しました。もし万が一、フォントメーカーからクレームが入るようなことがあれば（まずないだろうと思いますけども）、取り下げるか使用料を払って対応するつもりです。
But she took an entirely different tone on Wednesday , when she chastised reporters for asking her questions about her war with some staff members in the McCain campaign at such a heady time .
“ Barack Obama has been elected president , ” Ms. Palin said .
“ Let us , let us  let him  be able to kind of savor this moment , one , and not let the pettiness of maybe internal workings of the campaign erode any of the recognition of this historic moment that we ’re in .
And God bless Barack Obama and his beautiful family . ”
There is a great tradition of paint - peeling political hyperbole during presidential campaign years .
And there is an equally great tradition of backing off from it all afterward , though with varying degrees of deftness .
But given the intensity of some of the charges that have been made in the past few months , and the historic nature of Mr. Obama ’s election , the exercise this year has been particularly whiplash - inducing , with its extreme before - and - after contrasts .
The shift in tone follows the magnanimous concession speech from Mr. McCain , of Arizona , who referred to Mr. Obama ’s victory Tuesday night as “ a historic election ” and hailed the “ special pride ” it held for African - Americans .
That led the vice president - elect , Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. , to get into the act .
During the campaign , Mr. Biden said he no longer recognized Mr. McCain , an old friend .
Now , he says , “ We ’re still friends . ” President Bush , in turn , also hailed Mr. Obama ’s victory , saying his arrival at the White House would be “ a stirring sight . ”
Whether it all heralds a new era of cooperation in Washington remains to be seen , and it may be downright doubtful .
But for now , at least , it would seem to be part of an apparent rush to join what has emerged as a real moment in American history .
BOSTON , Massachusetts , USA -- Thursday , December 11 , 2008 -- The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) today announced that it has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Cisco .
The FSF 's complaint alleges that in the course of distributing various products under the Linksys brand Cisco has violated the licenses of many programs on which the FSF holds copyright , including GCC , binutils , and the GNU C Library .
In doing so , Cisco has denied its users their right to share and modify the software .
Most of these programs are licensed under the GNU General Public License ( GPL ) , and the rest are under the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) .
Both these licenses encourage everyone , including companies like Cisco , to modify the software as they see fit and then share it with others , under certain conditions .
One of those conditions says that anyone who redistributes the software must also provide their recipients with the source code to that program .
The FSF has documented many instances where Cisco has distributed licensed software but failed to provide its customers with the corresponding source code .
" Our licenses are designed to ensure that everyone who uses the software can change it , " said Richard Stallman , president and founder of the FSF .
" In order to exercise that right , people need the source code , and that 's why our licenses require distributors to provide it .
We are enforcing our licenses to protect the rights that everyone should have with all software : to use it , share it , and modify it as they see fit . "
" We began working with Cisco in 2003 to help them establish a process for complying with our software licenses , and the initial changes were very promising , " explained Brett Smith , licensing compliance engineer at the FSF .
" Unfortunately , they never put in the effort that was necessary to finish the process , and now five years later we have still not seen a plan for compliance .
As a result , we believe that legal action is the best way to restore the rights we grant to all users of our software . "
" Free software developers entrust their copyrights to the FSF so we can make sure that their work is always redistributed in ways that respect user freedom , " said Peter Brown , executive director of the FSF .
" In the fifteen years we 've spent enforcing our licenses , we 've never gone to court before .
We have always managed to get the companies we have worked with to take their obligations seriously .
But at the end of the day , we 're also willing to take the legal action necessary to ensure users have the rights that our licenses guarantee . "
The complaint was filed this morning in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by the Software Freedom Law Center , which is providing representation to the FSF in this case .
The case is number 08 - CV - 10764 and will be heard by Judge Paul G. Gardephe .
A copy of the complaint is available on the FSF web site .
About the FSF
The Free Software Foundation , founded in 1985 , is dedicated to promoting computer users ' right to use , study , copy , modify , and redistribute computer programs .

About the GNU General Public License ( GNU GPL )
The GNU General Public License ( GPL ) is a license for software .
When a program is released under its terms , every user will have the freedom to share and change it , no matter how they get it .
The GPL is the most popular free software license in the world , used by almost three quarters of all free software packages .
The FSF recently updated the license to address new concerns in the free software community ; version 3 of the GPL ( GPLv3 ) was released on June 29 , 2007 .
About the GNU Operating System and Linux
Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a free software Unix - like operating system called GNU .
GNU is the only operating system developed specifically for the sake of users ' freedom .
See http://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html.
In 1992 , the essential components of GNU were complete , except for one , the kernel .
When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under the GNU GPL , making it free software , the combination of GNU and Linux formed a complete free operating system , which made it possible for the first time to run a PC without non-free software .
This combination is the GNU / Linux system .

I was n't that surprised when the 57 activists who braved sub - zero temperatures and the threat of arrest to stop CO2 emissions at Stansted got a bit of kicking from some of Fleet Street 's finest .
It 's a sad reality that when ordinary people seek to change society , the standard establishment reaction is to label them dismissively as somehow different to everyone else .
Commentators who would otherwise be trotting out celebritised platitudes or treating us to their ill - informed thinkpieces about the impact of the credit crunch on nativity plays now specialise in ghettoising anyone who stands up for what they believe .
Instead of analysing the problems and proposing real solutions to society 's most pressing problem – the rapid and runaway growth of greenhouse gases – these tired hacks shoot down anyone fed up with the stale old politics of Westminster and the media establishment .
Young people only appear in the media to receive the blame for breaking Britain , and as the subject of longwinded tracts that label us apathetic and materialistic .
Most of us care , but feel so disempowered by these stifling truisms .
This is a perfect example : 40 of the 57 arrested had never been in trouble with the police before , but felt so moved by the threat that they risked life and liberty to be heard .
What does the media fixate on ?
Whether we say " haitch " or " aitch " .
While the majority of papers dreamt up alliterative but illiterate headings ( " the designer demo " , " middle - class and militant " ) , one bright spark at the Sun decided to savage me for the heinous crime of being educated at Godolphin and Latymer school .
Of course , the journalist , Lynsey Haywood – who sounds pretty well - heeled to me – forgot to mention that I went there on a full scholarship , and that my dad drives trucks for a living .
Since when has the Sun been opposed to people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and braincells , especially when the same issue of the paper contained a four - page spread on climate change ?
Let 's be clear : Plane Stupid activists are mostly middle - class .
Some of us have upper - class backgrounds ; others have " real " salt - of - the - earth parentage .
Some of us are women , some are men ; some have jobs , some do n't ; some are gay , some are old – a bit like the rest of society , really .
We have all flown on planes , and some of us even own cars .
Does that somehow undermine the scientific consensus that failing to tackle rising CO2 emissions will have severe and devastating consequences ?
We have less than seven years to change our future .
The Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate and once that 's gone , the world will start to warm beyond our control .
We are on track for a +6C future , which will lead to the extinction of thousands of species and millions of people from all races , classes and walks of life .
Things are going to get very , very nasty – and for the whole human race , not just a bunch of poor people in a far - off land which we would n't be able to find on a map .
Climate change is a class issue ; there 's no denying that emissions from wealthy lifestyles are driving global warming , and it's only right that the richest countries bear the brunt of the responsibility for cleaning up their mess .
But that does n't mean that halting and reversing the wanton growth of shorthaul flights is an act of class war .
The average household income of a passenger at Stansted airport is £ 47,000 a year : one hell of lot more than I earn .
Having an education should n't prevent you trying to stop our society from running into certain disaster .
The climate does n't care how much you earn or who your parents are , just how much carbon you emit .
There is no planet B .
We need action now .
If government wo n't act fast enough , then we will be forced to do what 's necessary .
But if your daily wage comes from attacking good people trying to do things for what they truly believe is the greater good , it 's time to take a good hard look at yourself .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 8 , 2008
San Francisco , CA FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE : Intersection of Mission St .
and Cesear Chavez , NE corner
San Francisco Dear Shareholders and Clients ,
The Billboard Liberation Front has partnered with Wachovia to release a daring advertising campaign that celebrates Wachovia ’s new money management strategy .
This campaign emphasizes the silver lining in the economic storm front now threatening to swamp our economy as well as our individual fiscal inner tubes .
“ The calamitous decline in the value of all investments and the impending total collapse of the dollar will render the true value of the average savings account or investment portfolio roughly equal to a bucket of warm piss , " noted Thomas J. Wurtz , CFO of Wachovia .
Dr. John Silvia , Managing Director and Chief Economist noted : “ After that golden shower we got from Golden West , we decided to fight fire with fire and start bailing for our clients and stockholders , mixed metaphors notwithstanding . ”
This dramatic revaluation of your money has created the opportunity for our team at Wachovia to offer a unique service to our stockholders and clients .
“ With what promises to be the coldest winter in years now commencing , we ’ve instructed our staff in all 21 States that we have offices in to start bundling greenbacks into tight rolls , perfect for small stoves and furnaces , ” said Robert K. Steel CEO and President .
“ We believe this is the soundest application of our clients ’ money . ”
“ ’ We ’re in the money ….
we ’re in the money …’ they sang in the 1920’s .
Maybe we should be singing ‘ Burn , Baby , Burn ’ in light of the modern era of fiscal management , ” - BLF CEO Jack Napier .
Rico T. Spoons added , “ The true value of this new campaign will be reflected in the “ heat ” it generates for Wachovia ’s clients . ”
That ’s right , you no longer have to worry about your money .
As a matter of fact , do n’t bother worrying at all .
The BLF ( www.billboardliberation.com) has been improving outdoor advertising since 1977 .
Prior campaigns have included work for Exxon , R.J. Reynolds , and Apple Computers .
Wachovia Corporation ( NYSE : WB ) , based in Charlotte , North Carolina , is a diversified financial services holding company provided via its operating subsidiaries a broad range of banking , asset management , wealth management , and corporate and investment banking products and services .
The Department of the Treasury is a Cabinet department and the treasury of the United States government .
It was established by an Act of Congress in 1789 to manage government revenue .
The Department is administered by the Secretary of the Treasury .

Working with money is largely about developing good habits and sticking to them .
Many people do n’t even realize that , but a large portion of the way you interact with your finances comes down to the habits you ’ve developed and how well you can control them .
Unfortunately , for many people , their ability to get on top of these things is actually not that good , even if they believe otherwise .
If you ’re not paying attention to how you ’re acting with your money , it ’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that everything is fine , when it ’s in fact far from that .
Here are some examples of bad financial habits that have quite the strong potential to mess things up for you down the road .
Not Saving Enough
This is probably the biggest one out there by far .
Failing to save enough money can have serious consequences at the worst possible time , and it ’s not something you can correct on short notice either .
Ideally , you should have enough saved up for about six months ’ worth of expenses .
That way , even if you find yourself without a job , you should be able to have something to keep you going until you ’re back on your feet .
This is a very simple backup plan that many people fail to bother with , only to find themselves facing significant issues when they need money urgently
Treating Loans as Free Money
Speaking of urgent money , bad credit loans are also something you need to be careful with .
They ’re a great tool , sure – but they also come with some strings attached that the average person does n’t consider very carefully .
A loan is not “ free money ” – you still have to pay it back , and you have to actually put a lot of thought into planning for that if you do n’t want to face disaster .
Make sure that you can keep up with the instalments , and if there ’s any sign that you might have to delay a payment , get on top of that situation immediately .
Talk to the creditor , let them know what ’s going on , and make sure to recover as quickly as possible .
Buying Things Just Because
They ’re on Sale
Not every sale is your friend .
In fact , unless you were actually looking for a specific item , buying it on sale usually means that you ’re just wasting money .
It ’s true – and some people do n’t even think about it in this way .
That ’s part of the reason why you see so many people “ addicted ” to shopping , always looking for the next best deal and trying to catch a nice discount on things they do n’t really need .
It gets worse when you consider that some people spend hours of their time driving around just to save cents on a purchase .
Gambling
Taking risks is inevitable when dealing with finances .
But you have to make sure that yours are calculated .
Gambling with your money – both in the literal and the figurative sense – is a very bad idea if you do n’t know what risks you ’re taking on , and what consequences you can expect from them .
There are many ways to spend your money on things that promise great returns but do n’t actually work that way , and the financial market can actually seem like a bit of a trap for the unprepared .
And while that ’s true , it ’s also not that difficult to avoid those problems if you pay attention to what ’s going on .
Not Keeping Track
Which brings us to another important point .
You have to keep your finances in check , and track them as best as possible with any tools you have at your disposal .
There are various advanced budget trackers that you can use to get a much better overview of your current situation than the one you have in your head .
They do n’t take a lot of time or effort to set up , and they can run pretty much on auto - pilot after that – you just have to input your information and let the tool work its magic .
And the best part is , many of them are completely free !
Inflating Your Lifestyle Too Fast
Finding yourself with some extra income can be a nice feeling , but it can also be dangerous .
Many people lack the capacity to be careful when improving their lifestyle , and end up spending more money than they ’re actually earning , and not even realizing how things got that bad .
This is particularly common among those that do n’t keep track of their finances as we described above .
The point is , whenever you find yourself earning more , you should take the time to evaluate how you could improve your lifestyle before actually committing to any such changes .
Because if you wait a little , you ’ll often find out that things are not exactly as stable as they initially seemed .
And it ’s good to find that out before you ’ve made any harsh changes to your lifestyle that incur even greater costs to you , rather than dealing with the consequences of that at a later stage .
Philip Zelikow was in Chicago on Wednesday , October 29 , 2008 .
He spoke at the Chicago Council on Global Domination , um , I mean Global Affairs .
This is another name for the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations .
Lone Lantern – Chicago 9/11
Truth activists were there to accost him as he arrived .
After the confrontation , two activists infiltrated his speaking event and sat through his creepy speech on global governance .
However , their cameras were prohibited and held at the front desk .

In the final hours of this marathon election , all the polls are predicting an Obama victory .
Whether this outcome is confirmed or not , the Republican party is in need of some serious soul - searching .
Once again , as in 2000 and 2004 , the Republicans are seeking to win the election on the basis of a highly cynical strategy fueled by negativity .
In the words of Joe Biden , they are taking the lowest road to the highest office in the land .
Instead of damaging Obama ’s reputation , the McCain / Palin ticket has managed to damage its own .
With Palin running around the country talking of a “ real America ” that apparently exists only in the rural areas away from the “ elitist ” cities , one can only wonder why the party would intentionally want to narrow its base in this manner .
Are the Republicans now confining themselves to becoming solely the party of sparsely populated farms , villages , and little suburbs ?
Seems foolish , to say the least .
Palin has done more than alienate urban dwellers , of course .
She has also helped run a platform against intellectual curiosity .
She is trying to tell voters who do n’t care and do n’t engage that this is the best way to be .
It ’s OK not to read magazines or newspapers .
It ’s OK not to be interested in foreign affairs .
This approach can work only in a limited manner .
Every person grapples with his or her own positive and negative sides .
A politician can score cheap points by appealing to the latter , but lasting political victory goes to those like Robert Kennedy , who said : “ Some men see things as they are and ask ‘ Why ? ’
I dream things that never were and ask , ‘ Why not ? ' ”
There is a reason why we remember Kennedy ’s words today , and I somehow doubt that Palin ’s own soundbytes will inspire the generations to come .
Meanwhile , personal attacks have always been the bread and butter of US elections .
George Bush Senior ’s Willie Horton tactics against Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election are notorious .
And who can forget Lloyd Bentsen ’s cruel put - down of Dan Quayle with the infamous “ you ’re no Jack Kennedy ” line ?
The audacity of Bush and Cheney ’s Swift boat attacks in 2004 , with two draft dodgers shamelessly calling into question Kerry ’s military service , also remain fresh in the memory .
Nonetheless , many observers agree that McCain and Palin have taken the art of personal attacks to a new low .
The Bill Ayers debacle reached its peak with the infamous robo-calls that practically called Obama a terrorist for sitting on a respectable education board with a man who committed acts of terrorism when Obama was 8 years old .
You do have to hand it to the McCain team for their oddly subtle touch .
They did n’t want to go out and call Obama a terrorist just because Obama ’s father was Muslim .
Even with Muslims and Arabs being targets of various forms of discrimination , this would have been a bit much .
So they chose a roundabout approach .
At this point , an unexpected hero emerged in the GOP ’s own Colin Powell .
He was the only politician to come out and attack the very dangerous tone of the discussion surrounding Obama ’s non-existent Muslim faith .
Powell ’s interview on Meet the Press stands as a true “ Profile in Courage , ” the courage to say the truth that nobody dares to utter .
It ’s worth to quote a part of Colin Powell ’s extraordinary statement in this regard :
“ I ’m also troubled by – not what Senator McCain says – but what members of the Party say , and it is permitted to be said : such things as , “ Well , you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim . ”
Well , the correct answer is he is not a Muslim .
He ’s a Christian ; has always been a Christian .
But the really right answer is , “ What if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? ”
The answer ’s “ No , that ’s not America . ”
Is there something wrong with some seven - year - old Muslim American kid believing that he or she could be President ?
Yet , I have heard senior members of my own Party drop the suggestion he ’s Muslim and he might be associated with terrorists .
This is not the way we should be doing it in America …
Powell may have been inspired to say those things by McCain ’s ignominious defense of Obama against the horrid charge of being a * gasp * ARAB .
When that woman stood up and called Obama an Arab , McCain leapt gallantly to his defense , saying “ No Ma’am , he ’s not an Arab , he ’s a decent family man , ” as if being Arab automatically precludes being a decent person with family values .
There was the attempt last week to claim that Obama ’s friendship with a respected Palestinian academic was a matter of national security , and the scary image of Obama as a Muslim Antichrist – propagated amongst evangelical communities by surrogates of the Republican party .
The list goes on and on .
Is all of the above worth a chance at victory ?
What kind of an election win would McCain ’s be , if he somehow managed to pull a surprise win right now ?
At what cost can one come to power , without making the whole exercise pointless and counterproductive ?
An election success based on racism and other forms of bigotry is no success at all .
Even if McCain wins , the damage to the Republican party will live on , eating away at its very soul .
When one considers Republican Colin Powell ’s words and the apparent Republican disdain of the urban populations , one can easily imagine a party split in half , if not worse .
The sad irony of it all is that it did not need to be that way .
McCain chose to jettison his character and reputation for the Karl Rove cookbook of electoral success .
Had he focused on a positive message of bi-partisanship , and on displaying the character of the fair and honest man that his friends proclaim him to be , then he may well have been leading in the polls right now .
Had McCain opted to choose a running mate on the basis of principle and experience , as opposed to a cynical choice based on the need to appeal to the lowest possible denominator , things may have been different .
Instead , he faces the prospect of a historic defeat for a party that is moving to the outer fringes of political decency .
Nonetheless , he may still win and , even if he does , my point remains .
A victory founded on fear and very thinly veiled racism is still likely to accelerate the decline of the Republican party as whole .

" Mr. Obama also responded to criticism of waste and inefficiency in such programs by promising new spending rules , like a requirement that states act quickly to invest in roads and bridges or sacrifice federal money . "

" If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with bank - notes , bury them at suitable depths in disused coal - mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish , and leave it to private enterprise on well - tried principles of laissez - faire to dig the notes up again ( the right to do so being obtained , of course , by tendering for leases of the note - bearing territory ) , there need be no more unemployment and , with the help of repercussions , the real income of the community , and its capital wealth , would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is . "
The sign at Keflavik international airport made for an odd greeting .
" Welcome to Halfpriceland , " it said .
" Are you here for the nature or the exchange rate ? "
It was quickly deemed offensive and removed .
But it spoke volumes about Iceland , and its sudden dereliction .
Not so long ago , Iceland was known mainly as an expensive , exotic geological wonder in the North Atlantic .
Now it stands for something altogether different : the first sovereign victim of the financial crisis , and a sobering case study in what happens to a country when an economy falls off a cliff .
The collapse of the banking system and the currency , the krona , has been so severe that it has left a surreal economic landscape : a country gone from rich to poor so quickly that it can no longer afford some imports ; moribund construction sites dotted with half - finished buildings ; an affable people now reduced to pelting parliament with eggs ; newspapers so strapped that they are struggling to afford the paper on which to print the news , just at a time when Iceland has become newsworthy .
Anyone with debt is feeling the pain the most .
One of the features of the Icelandic crisis is that most loans - to buy a house , or even a car - were taken out in foreign currencies , to avoid high interest rates and inflation - linked loans in the domestic currency .
Klemens Thrastarson , a 33 - year - old journalist , and his girlfriend bought a house with loans in an exotic mix of Swiss francs and Japanese yen as well as krona , as recommended by their bank .
When the krona collapsed , their debts more than doubled .
The couple and their baby had to move and rent the house out .
" If it reaches the point where the monthly instalments from the housing loan will be equal to my pay cheque , I would have no qualms about handing in the keys to my house , declare bankruptcy and perhaps leave the country , " Thrastarson says .
He is not alone .
Most young Icelanders are either thinking the same thing or know someone who is .
" Three of my best friends have lost their jobs recently .
Two of them have gone to Norway and one of them is moving to the Faroe Islands , " says Gauti Masson , 19 , a former worker at a care home .
He says he lost his job " because more educated people were applying " .
Now , he says , " I might go to Norway too , but I do n't really want to leave my family . "
The most visible evidence of the crisis is the half - built structures that no one has money to finish .
Cranes used to fill the skyline , but now most have been shipped abroad .
The most spectacular abandoned project is the shell of a new music hall by the harbour .
Three lonely figures clad in orange stand on top of the building , where hundreds previously worked around the clock .
It is not clear who will finish the building , and when .
The construction company is bankrupt , and the property is owned by the cash - strapped Landsbanki .
Next to the incomplete music house is a huge hole in the ground , where a hotel , a mall and the new headquarters of Landsbanki were supposed to rise .
Whether these will ever be completed is anyone 's guess .
Unnar Josepsson , a construction worker in his late 20s , says : " All construction has been stopped in the Reykjavik area and probably in the country as a whole . "
His friend , a carpenter called Jon , says : " I had a foreign currency loan to buy a car , and instead of having to pay 30,000 kronur a month , it 's gone up to 45,000 .
Now , there is no way to get rid of the car .
I go home at noon every day because there is nothing to do . "
On Reykjavik 's main shopping street , there are still plenty of products available , but most of the imports came before the collapse of the krona .
Goods imported in the past two months are expensive , if available at all , and that goes for everything from food to condoms .
Sales of the latter have been rising sharply in some countries as a curious byproduct of the financial crisis .
In Iceland , however , they have fallen 25 % , most probably because a packet of Durex costs twice as much as it used to .
Perhaps this is just as well for Iceland 's future , as it may take many generations to pay off the country 's debts .
However , the collapse of the krona may be good for Icelandic music .
The weak krona makes it too expensive to import anything but the most surefire sellable albums , says Kiddi Krisjansson in the Bad Taste Music Store .
Guns 'n ' Roses fans were exasperated when , having waited 15 years for the new album , they had to wait even longer for it to appear in Iceland 's stores .
Sales have held up , Krisjansson says , but mostly because tourists with hard currency are eagerly snapping up merchandise which has become so much cheaper for them .
Icelanders are settling for listening to Björk and other local acts .
" Icelanders are buying more local music .
The musicians here are happy .
It will be an Icelandic Christmas , " he adds .
On three shiny floors of a former fish factory is CCP , a company best known in computer gaming for Eve Online , which has 300,000 participants all over the world - as many inhabitants as Iceland itself .
However , restrictions on access to foreign currency for individuals and businesses and on foreign investment into Iceland are making life difficult .
" To make new games , we need foreign investors , " says Eyjolfur Gudmundsson , formerly an assistant professor at the University of Akureyri , who supervises Eve 's virtual economy .
" The present currency restrictions are putting us in a straitjacket .
We are in talks with the government , but if we can't let capital in , we might be compelled to leave Iceland , even though this would be against our wishes . "
At least CCP still generates income .
For the auto industry , sales have plummeted 93 % compared with the same time last year , according to RUV state broadcasting .
Icelanders simply can't afford foreign models .
But foreigners can .
Haukur Baldvinsson , a car salesman , says that his staff have taken to snooping around the streets for foreign imports , contacting the seller and then flipping the vehicles on to foreigners .
" We are no longer selling expensive Jeeps , but rather smaller Hilux cars that are bought secondhand by Norwegians , " he said .
" Now , when we see someone driving a Hilux , we get a buzz in the stomach and take down the number .
Then we call the owner to ask if he wants to sell . "
Icelanders are reeling from the shock of having everything they knew virtually disappear overnight .
As well as anger at the government and the central bank , a residual distaste lingers for Britain and the punitive measures introduced to ensure that British savers got their money back from teetering Icelandic banks .
For those who have already lost their jobs as well as for those who are still clinging on , the beginning of a new year will bring an increasingly uncertain future .
At this , the darkest time of the year , daylight is just a brief glimmer between night and night .
This time , it may take a while before it truly starts getting brighter .
Cold financial wind
Iceland was the canary in the coalmine of the global financial crisis , the first economy to collapse under the extreme pressure of the credit crunch .
A housing and consumer bubble blew up during the good times , as the banking sector took on huge overseas debts which at one point amounted to as much as 10 times GDP , around $ 14bn .
As the credit crunch froze markets , banks could no longer refinance these debts ; the currency began falling , making the debts even more expensive .
Iceland 's three major banks collapsed and had to be nationalised .
Now inflation is 17 % , unemployment looks headed for double digits and Iceland has gone from one of the sunniest OECD economies to one of its most indebted .
As I 've been reporting , there is a legal battle brewing in Florida around Amendment 2 , the so - called " Marriage Protection " Amendment .
And now they will have their day in court .
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Mary Barzee Flores has granted the request of Florida Red & Blue , the group behind the SayNo2 Campaign to defeat Amendment 2 , for a hearing to require the sponsors of Amendment 2 ( Florida4 Marriage ) to disclose the donors to the non-profit Florida Family Action and for an immediate halt to advertising paid for with these secret , illegal funds .
The hearing will take place Monday , November 3 at 4:00 p.m .
The hearing will look into the illegally shielded campaign donations of Florida4 Marriage that were funneled through a non-profit organization called " Florida Family Action " , which was created by John Stemberger ( who also runs the campaign for Amendment 2 ) .
Based on public finance reports filed yesterday , 55 percent of all spending in support of Amendment 2 - more than $ 1.1 million in total - comes from donors being illegally shielded from the public by the " yes " on Amendment 2 campaign through purposefully funneled money .
Much more after the jump ...
We are dreaming , we Europeans , of Obamaland : a temperate land of sunshine and showers , of soft music and plenitude , of conciliation and concord .
We think we caught glimpses of it in July , just fleetingly , behind the garden wall at Number 10 ; on the steps of the Elysée Palace , and beneath the Victory monument in Berlin , where the would - be US President finally spoke to us , before being whisked away again .
And we concealed our very slight disappointment – that he seemed so camera - shy ; that even in Berlin he could not quite treat us to the same soaring rhetoric that he lavished on his fellow - citizens ; that he still seemed locked in the " war on terror " .
But we gave him the benefit of the doubt .
After all , even in Europe he was still campaigning .
He had his home audience to look to , and Europe furnishes many a photogenic backdrop .
We would bide our time , mouthing " Yes we can " in silent solidarity , and hope against hope for a Democratic victory .
Unless the polls are very wrong , Obamaland is materialising almost as you read .
And , as we anticipate the long transition before Inauguration Day , our wish - list is almost complete .
From a President who had barely travelled outside the US before taking office , we look forward to one whose peripatetic youth surely makes him a citizen of the world .
From a President who believed US military superiority was there to be used , we welcome one whose stated preference is for talking first – even to adversaries -– and calling in the force of arms only as the last resort .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And we especially welcome someone who , even as he regrets his lack of a foreign language , seems – do we flatter ourselves ?
– to want to master fluent European .
When the worst the Republicans can find to throw at him is to denounce his economic remedies as " socialist " , is it not time to roll out the red carpet ?
Europe 's leaders might already be jockeying for the privilege of being first to greet the new President , but the code of Obamaland would remove the need for such undignified scrambling .
The new President would be the one to hop on the plane for a lightning tour of European capitals .
And this time Chancellor Merkel would have no objection to a speech at the Brandenburg Gate , especially one scripted as an apology for the Bush era mistakes and a pledge of more equal transatlantic relations ...
Barack Obama has only himself to blame if he has spun dreams .
Yet all that is certain as Americans vote today is that Obamaland , if indeed it emerges from the ocean mists overnight , will not be as we imagine it .
The landscape may be more familiar than the oil derricks of Texas and the barbed wire of Guantanamo , and so may be the lexicon of its leader .
Perhaps , too , he might even forsake tradition and make emergency fence - mending with Europe his priority .
It would be a bold overture and one that would set another tone .
But Europe is deceiving itself if it believes that everything that has gone awry in recent transatlantic relations derives from the alien character and rank incompetence of George Bush .
Recent concentrated exposure to US opinion on the future of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation – at a conference in the quintessentially English setting of Ditchley Park – suggests a startling degree of wishful thinking in Europe about the speed and direction of any change .
Yes , and a reluctance to abandon long - cherished illusions .
The most obvious of these is our European belief in a philosophical gulf , almost as wide as the Atlantic , between the leaders of Obamaland and Macainia as they train their telescopes on abroad .
To be sure , from London , Paris or Berlin , the landscape and the language of these two Americas can look very different : one closer to our European image of ourselves , the other less so .
But the similarities are striking , and significant , too , especially on foreign policy .
A President Obama is pledged to end the US presence in Iraq , but so – to a not much shorter timetable now – would be a President McCain .
Internal change in Iran and North Korea may soon negate the sharp divergences that opened up between the two during the campaign .
And while a President Obama has set as his absolute foreign policy priority the commitment to stabilise Afghanistan – a President McCain would also be confronted with the same imperative to avoid what many already fear could be defeat .
However consensual an approach to foreign relations the campaigning Obama has favoured , however softly he wants to speak to the European allies , he will carry the big stick commended by Theodore Roosevelt .
That brings with it capabilities and opportunities that will divide the US and Europe , more than they will unite – as they have increasingly since the end of the Cold War .
Barring developments unforeseen today , Afghanistan will be the first test of transatlantic relations , and it will be a severe one .
Mr Obama would not be the accomplished politician he has shown himself over the past year , if he did not exploit his honeymoon with a joyful Europe to demand a vastly increased force contribution for Afghanistan .
Those countries deemed not to have pulled their weight will be called upon to do so ; saying no will not be an option .
Even in Obamaland it will be argued that two futures crucial to our mutual well - being are on the line : a stable Afghanistan free of terrorist camps , and the continued existence of the transatlantic alliance .
Except that it is not at all clear how far European leaders , and more particularly their electorates , will accept that analysis .
Does a lawless Afghanistan represent a potential terrorist threat of such an order that a costly war has to be fought and won there ?
Europe has its own backyard to patrol , notably in the Balkans .
Might Afghanistan be the point at which Europe calls an end to fighting wars declared in Washington ?
Do we risk defeat in Afghanistan only because the terrain is tough , or because Nato , without the cold war enemy , is unsustainable ?
This question , lurking since the collapse of communism , will be posed with some urgency , whether Europe finds itself dealing with Obamaland or McCainia .
The paradox is that a more congenial and communicative partner could foster straighter talking – and with it mutual recognition that it may be time for our two destinies to move apart .

A B.C. environmental group is flabbergasted that the publisher of the Oxford Junior Dictionary has sent words like " beaver " and " dandelion " the way of the dodo bird .
In the latest version of its dictionary for schoolchildren , Oxford University Press has cut nature terms such as heron , magpie , otter , acorn , clover , ivy , sycamore , willow and blackberry .
In their place , the university publishing house has substituted more modern terms , like the electronic Blackberry , blog , MP3 player , voicemail and broadband .
Canadian wildlife artist and conservationist Robert Bateman , whose Get to Know Program has been inspiring children to go outdoors and " get to know " their wild neighbours for more than a decade , said the decision is telling kids that nature just is n't that important .
" This is another nail in the coffin of human beings being acquainted with nature , " Bateman said in an interview with The Canadian Press .
"
If you can't name things , how can you love them ?
And if you do n't love them , then you 're not going to care a hoot about protecting them or voting for issues that would protect them .
"
Environmentalists likely wo n't be the only ones stewing over the revisions .
Also gone from the text , which is available in Canada and throughout the English - speaking world , are Christian phrases like nun , monk , saint , disciple , psalm and christen .
No one from Oxford University Press was immediately available for a comment but a statement from the press said the junior dictionary , which is aimed at seven - year - olds , has fewer words than …
MySQL Conf - Memcached Internals
Brian Aker and Alan Kasindorf gave a great talk on Memcached - every developer ’s favorite caching layer - at MySQL User Conference earlier last week .
The slides are available online , and they ’re well worth a bookmark .
Brian and Alan promised to continue updating the deck as they hone out their presentation at OSCON and other events .
In fact , their next iteration will include the Nginx integration trick , and new and improved section on consistent hashing .
In other words , check back frequently .
Memcached Best Practices
At its core , Memcached is a high - performance , distributed caching system .
It is application neutral , and is currently used on many large scale web sites such as Facebook ( 2TB of cache , circa Q1 2008 ) , LiveJournal , Mixi , Hi5 , etc .
However , it is also an extremely simple piece of software : all of the logic is client - side , there is no security model , failover , backup mechanisms , or persistence ( albeit the last one is in the roadmap ) .
But that has n’t stopped the developers from deploying it in all kinds of environments , and here are a few best practices suggested by Brian :
Do n’t think row - level ( database ) caching , think complex objects
Do n’t run memcached on your database server , give your database all the memory it can get
Do n’t obsess about TCP latency - localhost TCP / IP is optimized down to an in -memory copy
Think multi - get - run things in parallel whenever you can
Not all memcached client libraries are made equal , do some research on yours - hint , use Brians .
Slab Allocator - Heart of Memcached
The heart of Memcached is in its memory slab allocator .
A little daunting at first sight , it is actually a very elegant solution once you understand the motivation and the tradeoffs of its architecture :
Size of maximum allocated memory to Memcached is only limited by the architecture ( 32/64-bit )
The key size is limited to 250 bytes , the data ( value ) size is limited to 1mb
On bootup , Memcached grabs the memory and holds on to it - wasted memory at cost of performance
Allocated memory is split into variable sized buckets by the slab allocator
Default slab allocator will create 32 - 39 buckets for objects up to 1 mb in size
You can customize the page size at compile time , and slab sizes on startup
Each stored objects gets stored in a closest - size bucket - yes , memory is wasted
Fragmentation can be a problem - either customize slab sizes , or evict / flush your cache every so often
If there is unused memory in a different slab class , that memory will be re-allocated , if required
To guarantee no-paging , disable swap on your OS - practically , just keep it tiny , as to avoid disasters
Memory Management
The memory is managed via a Least Recently Used ( LRU ) algorithm :
Each slab class has its own LRU - evict target depends on the size of the object
Expiration timestamps are checked once every second - minimum lifespan is 1 second
Objects marked for deletion are handled asynchronously - checked and evicted once every 5 seconds
Inconsistency between the two timers listed above can result in sub-optimal eviction policy
LRU can be completely disabled - do it at your own risk
Best Practices : Invalidations and Expiry
Memcached does not provide any mechanisms for deleting a set of associated keys ( object , name , etc. ) .
For good or for worse , you could implement this functionality yourself with the help of prepend and append commands , however , be careful with the 1 mb limit !
A much cleaner way to handle this situation is to forgo the invalidation process all together :
Instead of invalidating your data , expire it whenever you can - memcached will do all the work
Generate smart keys - ex. on update , increment a version number , which will become part of the key
For bonus points , store the version number in memcached - call it generation
The latter will be added to Memcached soon - as soon as Brian gets around to it
Roadmap and Future Ahead
Memcached is a force to be reckoned with already , and the roadmap is only going to solidify this position .
Amongst the big objectives :
Binary protocol is in the works
Support for generations - as described in paragraph above
Multi-engine support : char based , durable ( persistence ! ) , queue
Facebook has overhauled the core to be highly - threaded , and is expected to contribute the changes
Kudos to Brian and Alan for a great presentation !
Do n’t forget to bookmark the slides and check back every so often , as they will be updated with time to describe best practices , common mistakes , and the roadmap ahead .
France is currently paralyzed by yet another strike .
Unlike the ones you ’re used to when visiting my country , usually from railway or airport staff , this one was launched by lawyers and judges alike , united against their government minister , Rachida Dati ( read more here ) .
Traditional journalists have been covering the event as it unfolded .
Google News brings you more than 300 bland and unsurprising articles .
The only place where you can read what ’s going on in France ’s judicial system is a blog .
Maître Eolas , a lawyer who opened his blog 4 years ago , just published 64 testimonies from justice professionals .
He even renamed his blog ‘ Daily news from angry justice professionals ’ .
Narvic , probably the best media commentator in France , immediately saw that Maître Eolas had become a media .
I see here the best proof that justice professionals in this country are the first ones to think that ’s something is rotten in the media kingdom .
To them , only Eolas ’ blog is credible enough to collect their grievances .
Yes , blogs are dead .
The amalgamation of all blogs in an imagined blogosphere has ended .
OJB has nothing to do with *~ ChElLe ~ * ’s MySpace blog , for instance .
It was about time late - adopters ( you know who they are ) realized this basic fact .
Blogging is about leading a conversation .
Such discussions sometimes reach a level so high that it has implications in the public sphere .
Maître Eolas ’ blog served as a Cahier de Doléances for French lawyers .
Just like Guido Fawkes ’ role in Peter Hain ’s resignation , Maître Eolas ’ blog is now the Fourth Estate ; a real counterweight to government policies .
Do you know other examples of bloggers having an influence on public life ?
Such a phenomenon might very well be limited to Western countries , where the market for journalists is such that it ’s more profitable to write for one ’s own pleasure outside the traditional media .
In post socialist countries for example , the shortage of journalists is so acute that any blogger is hired by a media group after a few months ’ blogging .
In such conditions , barely any blog can exert any real influence .
By Nicolas Kayser - Bril
Facebook is not immune , it seems , to the many security expolits that have hit MySpace users over recent years .
A so - called " Facebook trojan " is making its way around the site .
The trojan masquerades as a Facebook message with a title like " Nice dancing !
Should n’t you be ashamed ? " or " Some0ne thinks your special and has a * Hot_Crush * on you .
Find out who it could be " .
This mail includes a link - to a free hosting site like GeoCities - that when clicked prompts the user to install an .exe file .
The trojan then executes a worm called W32 .
Koobface that locates your Facebook cookies and proceeds to spam your Facebook friends with the same message .
Here 's the step by step :
1. Get a Facebook message with a spammy subject line , think nothing of it 2 .
Click on a suspicious - looking link within that mail 3 .
Be running Windows ( nothing wrong with that , of course ) 4 .
Ignore all warning messages
If you 're a fairly savvy web user then , there 's no need to fear : not installing an .exe file from an unknown source is Internet Security 101 .
And yet , there 's word of a nuance that could catch fairly smart web users unaware : the trojan may also attempt to change the user 's profile by inserting links to the malicious page .
In short : a reminder to never , ever install and execute an .exe file from an unknown source .
But we all make mistakes , and if you have been afflicted by W32 .
Koobface , Symantec has the fix .
As the departing Bush administration frantically attempts to shore up its place in history , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann stands ready to kick the props out from under it again .
A renewed claim that " no one could have anticipated " the attacks of 9/11 attracted his scorn in particular on Thursday 's Countdown .
http://rawstory.com/news/2008/Olbermann_White_House_owes_apology_to_1219.html
Olbermann refers to Bush 9/11 ' lies ' as ' Insult the Dead - gate '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday December 19 , 2008
" This is a White House talking point still , even though your average three - year - old could disprove it using an etch - a - sketch . "
Olbermann sneered on Thursday , over the heading , " Insult the Dead - gate . "
Olbermann 's specific target was White House press spokesman Tony Fratto , who responded to a Fox News interviewer 's suggestion on Wednesday that before 9/11 , " nobody was thinking that there 'd be terrorists flying 767s into buildings " by agreeing , " No one could have anticipated that kind of attack -- or very few people . "
" Yeah , well , it ai n't true , " Olbermann remarked , with open contempt dripping from his words , " and out of respect for the people who died that day you damn well better stop saying it . "
Olbermann then ran through a list of pre-9/11 warnings of potential al Qaeda hijackings , noting , " A president 's daily brief as far back as December 1998 said bin Laden was ' preparing to hijack US aircraft in hopes of trading hostages for jailed radicals . ' ...
The August 6 , 2001 brief , of course , told President Bush -- if he read it -- that there were ' patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings . ' "
Olbermann did not mention either the use of airplanes as weapons by the Japanese kamikaze suicide pilots during World War II or the abortive al Qaeda plot of the 1990's known as Project Bojinka , which would have involved both blowing up airliners and crashing a plane into CIA headquarters in Virginia and which may have been the inspiration for 9/11 .
" That Mr. Fratto 's employers might not have been expected to know the exact hour of these attacks , " concluded Olbermann , " does not give him or anybody else the right to perpetuate the lie that 9/11 was impossible to conceive .
Clearly , many inside this nation 's government anticipated it .
It was Mr. Bush and his gang who chose to ignore them . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - An original drawing of A.A. Milne ’s popular children ’s characters Winnie - the - Pooh , Tigger and Piglet fetched 31,200 pounds ( $ 50,000 ) at auction on Tuesday .
An oval pencil drawing of Winnie - the - Pooh , Tigger , and Piglet , by E. H. Shepard , is seen in this undated handout photograph , received in London on November 4 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Bonhams / Handout
The amount , which includes a 20 percent buyer ’s premium , comfortably beat pre-sale expectations of up to 20,000 pounds , not including the premium .
The oval pencil sketch by E.H. Shepard , one of children ’s literature ’s most famous illustrators , shows Pooh dipping his paw into a pot of honey while sitting at a table as Piglet and Tigger look on .
Auctioneer Bonhams said the successful telephone bidder was from Germany and bought the picture for his wife , a long - time Pooh fan .
On the same day , Sotheby ’s announced it was offering what it called the finest single collection of Shepard ’s original drawings for the Pooh books to be sold at auction .
The sale in London on December 17 , which also includes a selection of rare Milne books , is expected to fetch 650 - 930,000 pounds .
The illustrations , from the collections of Stanley J. Seeger and Christopher Cone , are among the most recognizable , including “ He went on tracking , and Piglet ... ran after him ” depicting Pooh and Piglet turning to each other as they walk away .
It is expected to fetch 40 - 60,000 pounds .
Also on offer is “ Bump , bump , bump - going up the stairs ” featuring Christopher Robin dragging his bear by the leg up the stairs beside him .
It is valued at 50 - 70,000 pounds .
Earlier in 2008 , Sotheby ’s set a record for the work of an illustrator at auction when Beatrix Potter ’s watercolor illustration for the final scene of “ The Rabbits ’ Christmas Party ” sequence went under the hammer for 289,250 pounds .
The drawing on sale at Bonhams was a larger version of an illustration entitled “ Tiggers do n’t like honey ” which appeared in Milne ’s “ The House at Pooh Corner , ” one of four books he wrote about the bear in the 1920s .
Other works by Shepard on sale at Bonhams included a first sketch for Kenneth Grahame ’s “ Wind in the Willows , ” depicting Rat and Mole lounging with a picnic on the riverbank .
It appeared in the published book with the caption : “ Now pitch in , old fellow ! and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey ” and fetched 7,440 pounds , including premium .
This library differs from the documented Python API for tzinfo implementations ; if you want to create local wallclock times you need to use the localize ( ) method documented in this document .
In addition , if you perform date arithmetic on local times that cross DST boundaries , the result may be in an incorrect timezone ( ie. subtract 1 minute from 2002 - 10 - 27 1:00 EST and you get 2002 - 10 - 27 0:59 EST instead of the correct 2002 - 10 - 27 1:59 EDT ) .
A normalize ( ) method is provided to correct this .
Unfortunately these issues cannot be resolved without modifying the Python datetime implementation ( see PEP - 431 ) .
pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python .
This library allows accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4 or higher .
It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of daylight saving time , which you can read more about in the Python Library Reference ( datetime.
tzinfo ) .
If you are installing from a tarball , run the following command as an administrative user :
If you are installing using pip , you do n’t need to download anything as the latest version will be downloaded for you from PyPI :
This package can either be installed using pip or from a tarball using the standard Python distutils .
The maintainers of pytz and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications .
Save time , reduce risk , and improve code health , while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use .
Learn more . .
If is_dst is not specified , ambiguous timestamps will raise an pytz.exceptions .AmbiguousTimeError exception .
The is_dst parameter is ignored for most timestamps .
It is only used during DST transition ambiguous periods to resolve that ambiguity .
The tzinfo instances returned by the timezone ( ) function have been extended to cope with ambiguous times by adding an is_dst parameter to the utcoffset ( ) , dst( ) && tzname ( ) methods .
Problems with Localtime
The major problem we have to deal with is that certain datetimes may occur twice in a year .
For example , in the US / Eastern timezone on the last Sunday morning in October , the following sequence happens :
01:00 EDT occurs
1 hour later , instead of 2:00 am the clock is turned back 1 hour and 01:00 happens again ( this time 01:00 EST )
In fact , every instant between 01:00 and 02:00 occurs twice .
This means that if you try and create a time in the ‘ US / Eastern ’ timezone the standard datetime syntax , there is no way to specify if you meant before of after the end - of - daylight - saving - time transition .
Using the pytz custom syntax , the best you can do is make an educated guess :
>>> loc_dt = eastern.localize(datetime ( 2002 , 10 , 27 , 1 , 30 , 00 ) ) >>> loc_dt.strftime( fmt ) ' 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST - 0500 '
As you can see , the system has chosen one for you and there is a 50 % chance of it being out by one hour .
For some applications , this does not matter .
However , if you are trying to schedule meetings with people in different timezones or analyze log files it is not acceptable .
The best and simplest solution is to stick with using UTC .
The pytz package encourages using UTC for internal timezone representation by including a special UTC implementation based on the standard Python reference implementation in the Python documentation .
The UTC timezone unpickles to be the same instance , and pickles to a smaller size than other pytz tzinfo instances .
The UTC implementation can be obtained as pytz.utc , pytz.UTC , or pytz.timezone ( ‘ UTC ’ ) .
>>> import pickle , pytz >>> dt = datetime ( 2005 , 3 , 1 , 14 , 13 , 21 , tzinfo=utc ) >>> naive = dt.replace(tzinfo=None ) >>> p = pickle.dumps( dt , 1 ) >>> naive_p = pickle .dumps( naive , 1 ) >>> len( p ) - len( naive_p ) 17 >>> new = pickle.loads ( p ) >>> new == dt True >>> new is dt False >>> new.tzinfo is dt.tzinfo True >>> pytz.utc is pytz.UTC is pytz.timezone ( ' UTC ')
True
Note that some other timezones are commonly thought of as the same ( GMT , Greenwich , Universal , etc. ) .
The definition of UTC is distinct from these other timezones , and they are not equivalent .
For this reason , they will not compare the same in Python .
>>> utc == pytz.timezone ( ' GMT ')
False
See the section
What is UTC , below .
If you insist on working with local times , this library provides a facility for constructing them unambiguously :
>>> loc_dt = datetime ( 2002 , 10 , 27 , 1 , 30 , 00 ) >>> est_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt , is_dst=True ) >>> edt_dt = eastern.localize(loc_dt , is_dst=False ) >>> print( est_dt.strftime( fmt ) + ' / ' + edt_dt.strftime( fmt ) )
2002-10-27 01:30:00 EDT -0400 / 2002-10-27 01:30:00 EST - 0500
If you pass None as the is_dst flag to localize ( ) , pytz will refuse to guess and raise exceptions if you try to build ambiguous or non-existent times .
For example , 1:30 am on 27th Oct 2002 happened twice in the US / Eastern timezone when the clocks where put back at the end of Daylight Saving Time :
>>> dt = datetime ( 2002 , 10 , 27 , 1 , 30 , 00 ) >>> try : ... eastern.localize( dt , is_dst=None ) ... except pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError : ... print('pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError : %s ' % dt ) pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError : 2002-10-27 01:30:00
Similarly , 2:30 am on 7th April 2002 never happened at all in the US / Eastern timezone , as the clocks where put forward at 2:00 am skipping the entire hour :
>>> dt = datetime ( 2002 , 4 , 7 , 2 , 30 , 00 ) >>> try : ... eastern.localize( dt , is_dst=None ) ... except pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError : ... print('pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError : %s ' % dt ) pytz.exceptions.NonExistentTimeError : 2002-04-07 02:30:00
Both of these exceptions share a common base class to make error handling easier :
>>> isinstance ( pytz.AmbiguousTimeError( ) , pytz.InvalidTimeError ) True >>> isinstance ( pytz.NonExistentTimeError ( ) , pytz.InvalidTimeError )
True
A special case is where countries change their timezone definitions with no daylight savings time switch .
For example , in 1915 Warsaw switched from Warsaw time to Central European time with no daylight savings transition .
So at the stroke of midnight on August 5th 1915 the clocks were wound back 24 minutes creating an ambiguous time period that cannot be specified without referring to the timezone abbreviation or the actual UTC offset .
In this case midnight happened twice , neither time during a daylight saving time period .
pytz handles this transition by treating the ambiguous period before the switch as daylight savings time , and the ambiguous period after as standard time .
>>> warsaw = pytz.timezone (' Europe / Warsaw ' ) >>> amb_dt1 = warsaw.localize(datetime ( 1915 , 8 , 4 , 23 , 59 , 59 ) , is_dst=True ) >>> amb_dt1.strftime( fmt )
' 1915-08-04 23:59:59 WM
T+0124 ' >>> amb_dt2 = warsaw.localize(datetime ( 1915 , 8 , 4 , 23 , 59 , 59 ) , is_dst=False ) >>> amb_dt2.strftime( fmt ) ' 1915-08-04 23:59:59 CET+0100 ' >>> switch_dt = warsaw.localize(datetime ( 1915 , 8 , 5 , 00 , 00 , 00 ) , is_dst=False ) >>> switch_dt.strftime( fmt )
' 1915-08-05 00:00:00 CET+0100 ' >>> str( switch_dt - amb_dt1 ) ' 0:24:01 ' >>> str( switch_dt - amb_dt2 ) ' 0:00:01 '
The best way of creating a time during an ambiguous time period is by converting from another timezone such as UTC :
>>> utc_dt = datetime ( 1915 , 8 , 4 , 22 , 36 , tzinfo=pytz.utc ) >>> utc_dt.astimezone(warsaw).strftime( fmt ) ' 1915-08-04 23:36:00 CET+0100 '
The standard Python way of handling all these ambiguities is not to handle them , such as demonstrated in this example using the US / Eastern timezone definition from the Python documentation ( Note that this implementation only works for dates between 1987 and 2006 - it is included for tests only ! ) :
>>> from pytz.reference import Eastern # pytz.reference only for tests >>> dt = datetime ( 2002 , 10 , 27 , 0 , 30 , tzinfo =Eastern ) >>> str( dt ) ' 2002-10-27 00:30:00-04:00 ' >>> str( dt + timedelta( hours=1 ) )
' 2002-10-27 01:30:00-05:00 ' >>> str( dt + timedelta( hours=2 ) ) ' 2002-10-27 02:30:00-05:00 ' >>> str( dt + timedelta( hours=3 ) )
' 2002-10-27 03:30:00-05:00 '
Notice the first two results ?
At first glance you might think they are correct , but taking the UTC offset into account you find that they are actually two hours appart instead of the 1 hour we asked for .
>>> from pytz.reference import UTC # pytz.reference only for tests >>> str( dt.astimezone( UTC ) ) ' 2002-10-27 04:30:00+00:00 ' >>> str(( dt + timedelta( hours=1 ) ).astimezone( UTC ) ) ' 2002-10-27 06:30:00+00:00 '
If there is a silver lining to the Treasury market ’s gyrations , it is that the United States can borrow money more cheaply from investors , whether they be the governments of China or Japan , or big fund managers .
That could help Washington finance various programs intended to revive the ailing economy .
Borrowing by the Treasury has already ballooned since Congress approved the $ 700 billion financial rescue plan , and policy makers expect the federal budget deficit to swell further next year as the Big Three automakers and other industries look for support .
“ That sucking sound is all the world ’s capital going into the U.S. Treasury market , ” Mr. Yardeni said , “ which means the Treasury and the Fed can tap into that liquidity pool to finance TARP and offer mortgages at 4.5 percent . ”
While that may offset some of the expense of the bailouts , economists say the fact that the United States must borrow so much to prop up large parts of the economy is a big cause for concern .
There are several explanations for the flight to safety in the bond market .
The world of short - term money market funds , for instance , is still reeling from troubles at the Reserve Primary Fund , a money market fund frozen in September after it lost money on investments in Lehman Brothers .
Since then , individual and large investors have put more than $ 200 billion into money funds that only invest in safe Treasury bills , according to iMoneyNet , a financial data publisher .
At the same time , investors have withdrawn nearly $ 400 billion from prime funds .
That has forced portfolio managers to buy Treasury bills , driving down yields .
“ That group of investors has to invest in something , ” said Max Bublitz , chief strategist at SCM Advisors .
“ They do n’t have the luxury of saying , ‘ I will stick it in the mattress . ’ ”
Yields for longer term Treasury securities have also slumped , with the 10 - year now yielding 2.64 percent , down from 2.7 percent Monday and 3.75 percent a month earlier .
That decline appears to reflect several other forces .
Many investors are seeking safety because they believe that the economy is in its worst recession since the Depression .
Rather than inflation , which was a worry for some a few months ago , many are now worried about deflation , or falling prices .
I thought it would be interesting to make a list to go along with Top 10 gruesome methods of execution and Top 10 modern methods of execution .
This list includes individuals that came face to face with death and their execution devices and because of fate or just plain luck were able to survive and live another day .
10 Elizabeth Proctor circa 1652
In 1692 Elizabeth Proctor and her husband John were accused of witchcraft in the Salem Witch Trials .
After their arrest the court met in Salem to discuss the fate of John and Elizabeth and several others .
In spite of the petitions and testimonies from friends , both John and Elizabeth were found guilty , and were sentenced to death .
Elizabeth , who was pregnant at the time , was granted a stay of execution until after the birth of the baby .
John tried to postpone his execution , but failed .
On August 19 , 1692 , her husband was executed .
In January 1693 while still in prison , Elizabeth gave birth to a son whom she named John after his father .
For some reason , Elizabeth was not executed as the court had ordered and then in 1693 the Governor , believing that people were being wrongly convicted without hard evidence , ordered 153 people set free .
Elizabeth was among this general release of prisoners .
Interesting Fact : Over 150 people were arrested and imprisoned during the Salam Witch Trials .
The two courts convicted twenty - nine people of the capital felony of witchcraft .
Nineteen of the accused ( fourteen women and five men ) were hanged .
One man who refused to enter a plea was crushed to death under heavy stones in an attempt to force him to do so .
At least five more of the accused died in prison .
9 John Henry George Lee 1864 – circa 1945
In 1884 at her home at Torquay England , Miss Emma Keyse was bludgeoned to death with an axe , her throat slashed with a knife and her house set on fire .
John Lee , who was one of the servants at the house was arrested and convicted of her murder and sentenced to death by hanging .
The date for the hanging was set for February 23rd 1885 at the Exeter Prison .
When Lee was standing at the gallows waiting to die the trap door release malfunctioned .
Not just once , not twice , but three times !
Amid the confusion of these botched attempts Lee was returned to his cell and at some later time the Home Secretary reduced his sentence to life imprisonment with the recommendation that he never be released .
Interesting Fact :
After some 23 years in prison Lee ( now aged 41 ) due to constant pressure to review his case , was released in December 1907 .
Ironically it was suggested that this was not because the merits of the case justified a review but because of the infamous bungle which was made in attempting to hang him .
8 William Duell 1724
In 1740 , 16 year old William Duell was convicted of raping and murdering a girl in the village of Tyburn , London .
Duell was sentenced to death by hanged along with 4 others .
During this time period bodies of criminals were regularly provided to medical training colleges so after the execution Duell ’s body was brought to Surgeons ’
Hall to be anatomized .
After he was stripped and laid on the board one of the servants noticed he was breathing .
After Duell ’s breath became quicker and quicker the surgeon took some blood from him and in two hours he was able to sit up in his chair .
That evening the authorities decided to reprieve him and his sentence was commuted to transportation .
Interesting Fact : Tyburn was commonly invoked in euphemisms for capital punishment – for instance , “ to take a ride to Tyburn ” was to go to one ’s hanging .
7 Zoleykhah Kadkhoda born 1977
In 1997 20 - year - old Zoleykhah Kadkhoda was arrested and charged with engaging in sexual relations outside marriage .
She was immediately sentenced to death by stoning .
Kadkhoda was then buried up to her waist in preparation for her execution but soon after the stoning began it prompted great reaction among most of the village inhabitants which caused the stoning to stop .
It was first thought that the woman had died and was taken to the morgue but then began to breath again and was taken to the hospital .
Her condition improved and an appeal for amnesty was submitted to the court on her behalf .
Interesting Fact : The Iranian authorities informed Amnesty International that the death sentence against Zoleykhah Kadkhoda has been lifted and that she was released on 26 November 1997 .
6 Wenseslao Moguel circa 1880
On March 18 , 1915 Wenseslao Moguel was captured while fighting in the Mexican revolution .
Without trial he was sentenced to be executed by firing squad .
Moguel was shot 9 times including a final bullet through his head at close range by an officer to insure death .
Moguel somehow survived and managed to escape .
Wenseslao went on to live a full life after his “ execution ” .
The above photo shows Moguel in 1937 on the Ripley ’s Believe It Or Not radio show pointing to his scar from the bullet that was shot at close range .
Interesting Fact : A popular song was written about Wenseslao Moguel .
You can listen to it here .
5 John Smith circa 1690
John Smith , from England was convicted of robbery and was sentenced to death by hanging at Tyburn .
On Christmas Eve 1705 , having been turned off the back of the cart , he dangled for 15 minutes until the crowd began to shout “ reprieve ” and was then cut down and taken to a nearby house where he soon recovered .
When Smith was asked what it had felt like to be hanged this is what he told his rescuers : “ When I was turned off I was , for some time , sensible of very great pain occasioned by the weight of my body and felt my spirits in strange commotion , violently pressing upwards .
Having forced their way to my head I saw a great blaze or glaring light that seemed to go out of my eyes in a flash and then I lost all sense of pain .
After I was cut down , I began to come to myself and the blood and spirits forcing themselves into their former channels put me by a prickling or shooting into such intolerable pain that I could have wished those hanged who had cut me down ” .
Interesting Fact :
The 1747 drawing above by William Hogarth shows the condemned travelling in carts with their coffins to Tyburn infamous “ Triple Tree ” tripod - shaped gallows .
The grandstands which were named “ Mother Procter ’s Pews ” were erected for the hundreds of spectators that would come out to see a public hanging .
4 Anne Green circa 1630
Anne Green was a 22 year old woman from England who was most likely seduced by the grandson of her employer .
When Green became pregnant she hid her pregnancy and gave birth to a premature baby boy who died soon after he was born .
After trying unsuccessfully to hide the child ’s body Green was accused of the murder and was sentenced to death by hanging .
During the execution Anne Green had to climb the ladder up to the gallows where the rope was laid around her neck and then was pushed off the ladder .
After about half an hour her body was cut down and placed in a coffin and taken to a local doctor who gave anatomy lectures at the university .
When the doctors and others assembled for the dissection and opened the coffin they noticed that the ” corpse ” took a breathe and they heard sounds coming from her throat . ”
After giving her hot drinks she opened her eyes .
The treatment continued with bloodletting and twelve hours after the execution Anne Green was able to say a few words .
After her unique rescue the court usher attending the execution and the prison director of Oxford agreed that Anne Green should be reprieved .
Green later married , had three children and lived for fifteen years after her famous execution .
Interesting Fact : During this time period it was common for people to grab onto the legs of the condemned with all their weight causing a forceful downward jerk so that the hanged person would die as quickly as possible .
It was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that hanging in England was done with a fall to break the neck .
3 Joseph Samuel circa 1780
Joseph Samuel was born in England and later transported to Australia after committing a robbery in 1801 .
Samuel then became involved in a gang in Sydney and robbed the home of a wealthy woman .
A policeman who had been sent to protect her home was murdered .
The gang was soon caught and at the trial Joseph Samuel confessed to stealing the goods but denied being part of the murder .
The leader of the gang was released due to lack of evidence and Joseph Samuel was sentenced to death by hanging .
In 1803 , Samuel and another criminal were driven in a cart to Parramatta where hundreds of people came to watch the hanging .
After praying , the cart on which they were standing drove off , but instead of being hanged , the rope around Samuel ’s neck snapped !
The executioner tried again .
This time , the rope slipped and his legs touched the ground .
With the crowd in an uproar , the executioner tried for the third time and the rope snapped again .
This time , an officer galloped off to tell the Governor what had happened and his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment .
The Governor and others believed that it was a sign from God that Samuel should not be hanged .
Interesting Fact : Samuel was one of Australia ’s earliest Jewish settlers and became known as the man they could not hang .
2 Maggie Dickson circa 1700
Maggie Dickson lived in Edinburgh Scotland in the early eighteenth century .
Her story is remarkably similar to Anne Green ’s . ( #4 ) After her husband deserted her in 1723 she was forced to move further south to Kelso near the Scottish Borders .
She worked for an innkeeper in return for basic lodgings and started an affair with the Innkeeper ’s son which led to her becoming pregnant .
Not wanting the innkeeper to discover this because it would surely lead to her dismissal she concealed her pregnancy as long as possible .
The baby was born prematurely and died within a few days of being born .
She then planned to put the baby into the River Tweed but could n’t bring herself to and finally left it on the riverbank .
The same day the baby was discovered and traced to Maggie and in 1724 she was charged under the contravention of the Concealment of Pregnancy .
Maggie was taken back to Grasssmarket for her public execution by hanging .
After the hanging she was pronounced dead and her body was bound for Musselburgh where she was to be buried , however the journey was interrupted by a knocking and banging from within the wooden coffin .
The lid was lifted to find Maggie alive and well .
The law saw it as God ’s will and she was freed to live for another forty years .
Interesting Fact : Maggie became something of a local celebrity and the locals gave her the nickname ‘ Half Hangit ’ Maggie . ’
The pub pictured above is a well - established and popular macabre themed watering hole in Edinburgh and is named after Maggie Dickson .
1 Willie Francis 1929 – 1947
In 1945 Willie Francis at age 16 was charged with murder of a drugstore owner in St. Martinville Louisiana .
The murder went unsolved for nine months until Francis was detained due to an unrelated crime .
Police claimed he was carrying the wallet of the drugstore owner in his pocket .
A short time later , Francis confessed to the murder in writing after he was interrogated .
He later directed the police to where he ’d disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon .
Despite two separate written confessions , Francis pleaded not guilty .
The state - appointed defense attorneys offered no objections , called no witnesses and put up no defense .
Two days after the trial began ; Francis was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death by the electric chair .
On May 3 , 1946 during the execution as the lethal surge of electricity was being applied witnesses reported hearing the teenager scream “ Take it off !
Take it off !
Let me breathe ! “ .
Another report states that he said “ I ’m n - not dying ! ”
The electric chair failed to kill Willie Francis .
It turned out that the portable electric chair had been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard .
Interesting Fact :
After the botched execution , Francis appealed to the Supreme Court citing various violations of his Fifth , Eighth , and Fourteenth Amendment rights .
The appeal was rejected and Willie Francis was executed on May 9 , 1947 over a year after his first execution .
The U.N. is scheduled to bring up a legislative vote on decriminalizing homosexuality worldwide .
This bill would make it global law that it is illegal to imprison or execute someone solely based on their sexual orientation .
There have been protests and anger directed at the Vatican over their refusal to vote in the affirmative .
As of right now the United States of America has not pledged to support the legislation .
It is imperative we quickly act to encourage the U.S. a global world leader to take a stance in favor of decriminalizing homosexuality .
Please contact the following high level individuals and tell them to have U.S. representation in the United Nations vote to make sure imprisonment and the death penalty for homosexuals is illegal .

There is gaming , and then there is extreme gaming .
A woman in Japan has been arrested for killing off her ex- online husband ’s avatar in Maple Story .
Apparently , the 43 year - old hacked into the game using his ID and password , then did the dirty virtual deed .
Although she has n’t yet been formally charged , she could face up to a 5 year bout in prison and a fine of up to $ 5,000.00 .
We think a fitting punishment might be a forced stay on Second Life for about six months .
I would go naked for the right role , says 18 - year - old Harry Potter star Emma Watson
She only turned 18 eight months ago , but Harry Potter star Emma Watson is already considering stripping off on screen .
In what many might see as further evidence of the pressure on women in the industry , the young actress admits she is prepared to go nude - if the role demands it .
The news will shock fans who have watched her grown up as Hermione Granger in the series of JK Rowling adaptations and still think of her as a child .
Looking good : Emma Watson looked stunning at the world premiere of her new movie ' The Tale of Despereaux ' in Hollywood
Emma reveals her enviable figure in an ink blue backless minidress
But when asked by a Sunday magazine if she would ever film naked , she admitted : ' Yes. For Bernardo Bertolucci .
It ... depends .
' I ’m not getting my kit off any time soon , but it is part of my job .
' I ’m at a strange age .
I ’m not a woman yet , but I ’m not a girl any more .
' They [ film companies ] say : " Oh , in a couple of years you ’ll be perfect for this . "
' I ’ll be like , yeah , but I want to be studying English then , so it ’s going to be quite tough to choose between the two . '
Turning heads : Emma shows off her stunning style , in the dark blue dress and strappy heels
A word in your shell - like : Emma gets up close and personal with the giant mouse she befriends in the animated film
Meanwhile , the university - bound actress showed her youth as she donned mouse ears - and a fasionable dress of course - for her latest Hollywood premiere last night .
She may have graced the cover of Vogue , but she looked at home promoting the animated movie , The Tale of Despereaux , which is set to be a big Christmas hit .
The British star had a big smile for the camera as she posed on the red carpet in the satin dress and a pair of peep - toe black heels .
Mousing around : Emma dons a pair of fun mouse ears at the after - party
She posed with co-stars Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick in Los Angeles .
In the CGI film she provides the voice for the character Princess Pea , who forms a friendship with a brave little mouse with huge ears .
The Harry Potter star signed a deal with Kate Moss 's modelling agency Storm last summer and was a fixture at both London and Paris Fashion Week this year .
Hollywood girl : Emma Watson poses with her co-stars Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick at the premiere of their new movie ' The Tale of Despereaux '
The young actress has admitted to having a big interest in the fashion world and has become a regular face on the fashion circuit of late .
' I 've always been really interested in art and fashion ' , she has said .
But despite her hugely successful acting career and the interest from the fashion industry , Emma has pledged to continue her academic career following her current gap year .
After gaining straight
As at A - level , she plans to study English literature in the UK or a liberal arts degree in the U.S .
Audio in linux , how to put it into words ?
How about : oss , alsa , pulseaudio , esound , arts , portaudio , jack , gstreamer , phonon .
Did I miss any ?
Embarrassment of riches ?
Or just embarrassment ?
I will not rehash history any more than to say that between buggy / incomplete drivers for sound cards and the wonderful world of alsa I 've never been able to understand how the hell audio works beyond getting output and , sporadically , input .
I am the quintessential dumb user of linux audio , even though I have tried to figure it out .
But let past be past .
Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid .
Pulseaudio ready and everything , since 8.04 .
Why Ubuntu decided to plug in pulseaudio without setting up any gui controls for it is beyond me .
All I know is that occasionally sound output will stop working ( I get 2 seconds of output and then it stops ) and then " pkill pulse " cures it .
Let 's run through the list .
alsamixer
I 've learned to use alsamixer to fix low level audio problems .
It is reliable in that it gives me all the channels on my sound card , so I always use it to mute / unmute my microphone and to untangle the master / pcm / headphones / front speakers settings caused by mixers that only allow me to control the volume of one channel and apps that output on god knows what channel .
That 's alsamixer on a Ubuntu 8.10 desktop with all updates installed as per today .
Here 's the same thing on my laptop .
Same distro , same version , all updates installed .
And I have made no conscious choice for this to come about , all I did was install the pulsaudio gui tools .
All of a sudden , alsamixer is useless as it only has access to a single " master " channel .
It would appear now that pulseaudio is sitting between the sound card and alsa , but does that sound right ?
pulseaudio gui
pulseaudio is here , might as well use it , right ?
Ubuntu ships a bunch of pa* packages that are gui tools for pulseaudio ( not installed by default ) .
This one is called pavucontrol .
It lets you set volume per audio stream .
I love this , I 've wanted to have it since forever .
But then it comes to output and what do I see ?
A single output device .
Where is my master , my pcm , all my channels ?
What 's more bizzarre is that pulseaudio says it 's connecting to alsa while alsamixer says it 's connecting to pulsaudio .
Surely that way madness lies ?
What 's worse , pavucontrol is a gui app without any kind of systray integration , so much as I would like to use it as an easy - to - reach mixer , I can't .
kmix
I run kmix in my tray , it lets me set the volume by scrolling the mousewheel over the icon , which is exactly what I want .
It 's not a terribly impressive mixer , as it only lets me select one channel to control , whereas what I really would like is to be able to lock several output channels into one , otherwise I 'm never really in control .
So the best I can do is set the volume to max on master , and tell kmix to show me pcm .
That seems to work well enough .
It appears I have two identical channels , but the leftmost is misnamed , that 's actually Master .
Now , let 's see .
alsamixer does n't show any of these channels , because it delegates to pulseaudio .
So kmix connects to ... god knows what , but at least I can access these channels .
gnome-volume - control
Gnome 's volume manager is an interesting one .
It has a combo box for devices .
I 'm showing here all the devices related to output and how channels are connected .
The good news is that the channels in the default mixer correspond to those in kmix ( sweet sanity ! ) .
But then there is that bottom mixer with a channel of the same name as the single output channel in pavucontrol .
And yes , they are the same ( and the same as the single output in alsamixer ) .
But this channel appears to be some kind of composite output channel that has no bearing on any of the output channels in the top mixer ( or in kmix ) .
( Ie. while it might appear to be a composite pipe that aggregates the flow of all these standard channels , it 's actually a pipe that sits after all of them .
If pcm volume is 0 , this channel wo n't receive any input , and will be mute no matter its volume setting . )
So neither can I effect the settings of master / pcm /etc with this channel nor vice versa .
That means if I want to use this single channel as my master volume control , I have to make sure that absolutely no application can mess with the volume for any of the standard master / pcm /etc channels .
Good luck with that .
A sane spec
I know this sounds crazy , but what 's it gonna take to get a single server + mixer applet that
captures every possible audio stream , no matter the audio server / api it 's on ,
possible audio stream , no matter the audio server / api it's on , prevents applications from messing with master volume controls ( eg. mplayer ) ,
has a single virtual channel controlling all the underlying output channels , so that I can have a single master volume slider ,
has per stream / app volume controls pulseaudio style ,
integrates well into the systray ,
integrates with laptop hotkeys
?
UPDATE : Ubuntu users can now vote on a proposal to unify sound systems on ubuntu brainstorm .
Hopefully this idea and the related ones can gain some traction with Canonical to attack the problem .
Michael Kinsley has written a brilliant column on Sarah Palin which guts any argument about whether she is a fiscal conservative .
Moreover , Kinsley has provided a roadmap by which Obama and Biden can attack her credentials as a reformer while avoiding bogus charges of sexism .
I would strongly suggest you stop reading this post and read Kinsley 's column in its entirety here .
Some excerpts :
Sarah Palin thinks she is a better American than you because she comes from a small town , and a superior human being because she is n't a journalist and has never lived in Washington and likes to watch her kids play hockey .
Although Palin praised John McCain in her acceptance speech as a man who puts the good of his country ahead of partisan politics , McCain pretty much proved the opposite with his selection of a running mate whose main asset is her ability to reignite the culture wars .
So maybe Governor Palin does represent everything that is good and fine about America , as she herself maintains .
But spare us , please , any talk about how she is a tough fiscal conservative .
Next up … Alaskans are doing pretty well :
Alaska residents each get a yearly check for about $ 2,000 from oil revenues , plus an additional $ 1,200 pushed through by Palin last year to take advantage of rising oil prices .
Any sympathy the governor of Alaska expresses for folks in the lower 48 who are suffering from high gas prices or can't afford to heat their homes is strictly crocodile tears .
So Palin thinks it 's
Ok for the oil companies to gouge Americans in the lower 48 states , as long as she can return a windfall profits tax to Alaskans only .
Now I know what she means by Alaska First .
Furthermore :
As if it could n't support itself , Alaska also ranks No. 1 , year after year , in money it sucks in from Washington .
In 2005 ( the most recent figures ) , according to the Tax Foundation , Alaska ranked 18th in federal taxes paid per resident ( $ 5,434 ) but first in federal spending received per resident ( $ 13,950 ) .
Its ratio of federal spending received to federal taxes paid ranks third among the 50 states , and in the absolute amount it receives from Washington over and above the amount it sends to Washington , Alaska ranks No. 1 .
Here is a copy of the Tax Foundation Report .
North Carolina is ranked 27th in the amount of federal funding we receive vs. federal taxes paid .
Most of the key battleground states are in the lower half : Colorado ( 41 ) , Michigan ( 37 ) , Florida ( 34 ) , Ohio ( 31 ) , Pennsylvania ( 28 ) .
Do you think the residents of those states ( even the ones who live in small towns ! ) know that they pay higher prices for Alaskan oil so Governor Palin can keep the residents of her welfare state on the dole ?
Kinsley concludes :
Why is a windfall - profits tax good for Alaska but not for the U.S. ?
Well , it 's obvious , is n't it ?
People in Alaska are better than people in the rest of the U.S.
They 're more American .
Although there are small towns and farms and high school hockey teams in the lower 48 , there are fewer down here , per capita , than in Alaska .
And there are many more journalists and pollsters and city dwellers and other undesirables who might benefit if every American had the same right to leech off the government as do the good citizens of Sarah Palin 's Alaska .
Sarah Palin is alot of things : Welfare Queen and Pork Queen come to mind .
What she is n't is fiscally conservative , a reformer , mavericky , or truthful .
But she is from a small town and John McCain was a POW .
Programmers coming to functional languages for the first time cannot imagine life without variables .
I address this head - on in the Clojure book .
In Section 2.7 ( free download here ) , I port an imperative method from the Apache Commons Lang to Clojure .
First the Java version :
// From Apache Commons Lang , http://commons.apache.org/lang/ public static int indexOfAny ( String str , char [ ] searchChars ) { if ( isEmpty ( str ) || ArrayUtils.isEmpty( searchChars ) ) { return - 1 ; } for ( int i = 0 ; i < str.length ( ) ; i++) { char ch = str.charAt ( i ) ; for ( int j = 0 ; j < searchChars.length ; j++ ) { if ( searchChars [j ] == ch ) { return i ; } } } return - 1 ; }
And now the Clojure code .
I have shown the supporting function indexed as well :
( defn indexed [ s ] ( map vector ( iterate inc 0 ) s ) ) ( defn index - of - any [ s chars ] ( some ( fn [ [ idx char ] ] ( if ( get chars char ) idx ) ) ( indexed s ) ) )
There are many things I like about the Clojure version , but I want to focus on something I did n't mention already in the book .
A reader thought the Clojure version did too much work :
... the [ Java ] version can be seen as * more efficient * when a match is found because scanning stops right there , whereas " indexed " constructs the whole list of pairs , regardless of whether or not a match WILL be found ....
The reader 's assumption is reasonable , but incorrect .
Clojure 's sequence library functions are generally lazy .
So the call to indexed is really just a promise to generate indexes if they are actually needed .
To see this , create a logging - seq that writes to stdout every time it actually yields an element :
( defn logging - seq [ s ] ( if s ( do ( println " Iterating over " ( first s ) ) ( lazy - cons ( first s ) ( logging - seq ( rest s ) ) ) ) ) )
Now , you can add logging - seq to indexed so that each element of indexed is of the form [ index , element , logged - element ] .
( defn indexed [ s ] ( map vector ( iterate inc 0 ) s ( logging - seq s ) ) )
Test the modified indexed function at the Clojure REPL :
user= > ( indexed " foo " )
Iterating over f ( Iterating over o [ 0 \f \f ]
Iterating over o [ 1 \o \o ] [ 2 \o \o ] )
As you can see , the indexed sequence is only produced as needed .
( At the REPL it is needed to print the return value . )
Finally , you can test indexed - of - any and see that Clojure only produces enough of the sequence to get an answer .
For a match on the first character , it only goes to the first character :
( index - of - any " foo " # {\f} ) Iterating over f 0
If there is no match , index - of - any has to traverse the entire string :
( index - of - any " foo " # {\z} ) Iterating over f Iterating over o Iterating over o nil
So give up on those variables , and live lazy !

Alex Simpson showed me this bizarre function .
Given a total predicate p over streams , the function ( exists p ) returns true if there is some stream for which the predicate returns true .
This works because if the predicate is total , then there must be some bound on the initial segment of the stream that it examines .
The auxiliary function ( epsilon p ) returns a stream for which p holds , if one exists , and an arbitrary stream otherwise .
The auxiliary function ( prefix b p ) is like ( epsilon p ) , but only considers streams beginning with b.
Here are some test predicates and a testing function .
And here are some test runs .
Well , Dawkins bless us , every one , and here it comes again – Christmas : season of cultural insecurity , financial strain and family meals involving tensions , posturing , lies and menace worthy of the Cuban Missile Crisis , sis , or even something of true historical import – like the outcome of Strictly Come Dancing .
I 'm always puzzled when people react to the savage perils of Christmas with variations on a theme of wounded surprise .
As far as I 'm concerned , Christmas is bound to be appalling .
It is , after all , the celebration of a woman giving birth without anaesthetic in a draughty cave surrounded by donkey poo .
Her husband was n't the father , so you just know he 'll have been really helpful with the boiling water and towels .
( Although he was a chippy , so he 'd probably have string – but not clean string . )
The country had been occupied by a foreign power – and now that Obama 's nearly in charge we 're probably allowed to admit this is n't something every civilian population really enjoys .
It 's Bethlehem , it 's small , it 's provincial , there are n't any curtains and a heaving great star has taken up residence outside , so no one 's getting any sleep – even though no crying he makes .
Then the weird strangers turn up – three posh blokes and some shepherds , who bring lambs .
Exactly what you 'd need : more unhousetrained livestock .
Plus , the flock - watchers are probably completely freaked out and babbling – " Yeah , there was this light and singing and this herd of angels ... a what of angels ...?
A host ?
Really ?
That does n't sound right .
But OK , a host of angels .
Were n't we the host of angels , though , because they were visiting us ...?

" Anyhoo , they 're talking about love and peace and biscuits – something like biscuits – and all this hippy stuff and we 're bloody terrified and they 're saying be not afraid , except in these big , boomy voices , so we 're thinking maybe if we can't get relaxed , they 'll just kill us and so that 's making us incredibly more tense and round about then some of the sheep fainted and , I mean , it was just really messed up and crazy – we 're still in a right state .
Angels dropping in and monkeying with your life , you do n't expect that , ' do you ?
Although obviously , it could be worse ... could be that we 'd ended up ... how is the baby , anyway ?
Not crying – that 's a blessing , eh ! "
The three kings , of course , bring along the world 's first rubbish Christmas presents – each one heavy on the symbolism .
Frankincense would make the cave smell slightly better , but mainly has religious associations and can also be chewed like gum – possibly implying that Jesus would become something in religion , or a bit of a slacker , or make scented candles – definitely not something sensible like a carpenter .
Myrrh is used in funeral rites – presumably they 'd also considered offering Mary a tiny child 's coffin , perhaps with some tinsel on it .
I 'd guess considerations of space ruled that one out : you can only get so much loaded on a camel .
Then there 's gold , a great big sparkly casket of gold that will ensure you 'll be burgled , if not mugged while you huddle , knackered and unarmed in your vile and quite possibly front - doorless shelter .
Now does any of that suggest that Christmas would n't turn out to be an elf - haunted , witch - melting festival of bickering , misery and waste ?
I think not .
Of course , I principally associate Christmas with being – in one way or another – close to death .
This began when I repeatedly witnessed the arrival of The Turkey , specially sent by train from Great Uncle Edgar 's Turkey Lagoon .
( Or whatever collective noun would be more appropriate . )
Edgar being a generous man , the avian cadaver unloaded from the luggage compartment was , for many years , much larger than myself .
The body would then rest – very much like a dead , decapitated child – in the bath as a kind of combined appetiser and threat .
I already knew about the Massacre of the Innocents and was unclear whether this led to outrage and woe , or huge dinners with lots of little sausages and evil sprouts .
Hideous midnight hacking – à la Jeffrey Dahmer – would ensue and then on Christmas morning the oven would be packed with flesh and only 18 or 20 hours later a selection of genetically similar strangers would be forced to stare at each other round a groaning board , while remembering , in vivid detail , why they had promised themselves last year this would never happen again .
( The massive binge - eating component of Christmas is , of course , not Christian , but was imposed by the Romans as a cunning plan to eliminate the Druids through cholesterol poisoning . )
A sometimes chillingly intelligent child , I quickly noticed that feigning serious illness was a good way of avoiding one 's festive relatives .
By the age of eight I managed to fling myself from a speeding horse as it proceeded rapidly up the wrong side of a dual carriageway .
The resulting head injury allowed me to spend much of Christmas in a children 's ward with a viciously illuminated Christmas tree and a number of other restlessly not - at - all - ill - enough children I would have been happy to see covered in bacon slices and served with roast potatoes .
They and the apparently endless broadcasts of Perry Como singing in a golf sweater may have damaged me emotionally in a bad and wrong way .
Since then I have – like you , dear reader – realised that merry carolling , romping in snow banks , patting impish tykes , hugging and shoving satsumas into used socks are all activities which expose the immune system to unreasonable stress .
Last year – as usual – I spent Christmas crawling between the sofa and my bed , unable to hear , breathe or see .
In the few moments every day when I could speak , I begged for death .
Sadly , no one else in the house , or my mother 's village , or indeed the region was well enough to even hit me with a cracker .
So I 'm still here .
Looking forward to Christmas .
Do n't say I did n't warn you .

Press Releases British nukes protected by bicycle lock keys
Category : News ; BBC

Britain is the only nuclear weapons state which does not have a fail - safe mechanism to prevent its submarines launching a nuclear attack without the right code being sent , according to tonight 's Newsnight on BBC Two .
The programme also reveals that until less than ten years ago , the locks on RAF nuclear bombs were opened with a bicycle lock key .
Ten years ago the United States decided it was too risky to allow their Trident submarine commanders to launch without a code , known as the Trident Coded Control Device , which is sent by the President via the Chiefs of Staff .
The idea was to prevent rogue or accidental launches triggering World War Three and the Russians and French have similar systems .
However , the Ministry of Defence has told Newsnight that such safeguards are " not relevant " to the British situation .
They say that " Britain is unique " and British Trident commanders can still launch a nuclear attack without any command from Whitehall if the worst comes to the worst .
Newsnight also reveals that , until they were retired in 1998 , the RAF 's nuclear bombs were armed by turning a bicycle lock key .
There was no other security on the bomb itself .
American and Russian weapons were protected by tamper - proof combination locks which could only be released if the correct code was transmitted .
The British military resisted Whitehall proposals to fit bombs with Permissive Action Links or PALs – which would prevent them being armed unless the right code was sent .
PALs were introduced in the Sixties in America to prevent rogue generals or pilots launching a nuclear war and since then all US weapons have been fitted with a PAL .
The correct code had to be transmitted by the US Chiefs of Staff and dialled into the bomb before it could be armed , otherwise it would not detonate .
Crews in missile silos also had a dual - key arrangement so one man could not launch Armageddon .
Similar safeguards are in place on Russian nuclear weapons .
Newsnight reveals that RAF nuclear bombs were armed by opening a panel held by two captive screws – like a battery cover on a radio – using a thumbnail or a coin .
Inside are the arming switch and a series of dials which are turned with an allen key to select high yield or low yield , air burst or ground burst and other parameters .
The bomb is actually armed by inserting a cylindrical bicycle lock key into the arming switch and turning it through 90 degrees .
There is no code which needs to be entered or dual key system to prevent a rogue individual from arming the bomb , although RAF crews were supposed to always work in pairs if they were near the bomb or had the keys for the bomb .
National Archive papers show that , in 1966 , Chief Scientific Adviser Solly Zuckerman formally advised Defence Secretary Denis Healey that Britain needed to install PALs on its nuclear weapons to keep them safe .
However , the Royal Navy argued that its officers could be trusted and : " It would be invidious to suggest ... that senior Service officers may , in difficult circumstances , act in defiance of their clear orders . "
Neither the Navy nor the RAF installed PAL protection on their nuclear weapons and the RAF kept their un-safeguarded bombs at airbases until they were withdrawn in 1998 .

When science fiction legend Arnold Schwarzenegger leaves office as California governor in 2011 , he does n't plan to return to acting .
Instead , he wants to help lead the way on climate change .
That 's a darn shame , because we need Arnie 's Heston - on - steroids style of acting more than we need his thoughts on global warming .
And to prove it , here are 10 movie moments where Arnie brought his acting A - game in the face of almost insurmountable challenges .
Advertisement
You see , Schwarzenegger is n't just an action hero , he 's our guide to the worlds of the fantastic and bizarre .
His acting skills are as prodigious as his pecs , but they 've gone unappreciated — until now .
I recently sat down and watched pretty much every Schwarzenegger science fiction epic , and I came away with a new appreciation for his acting skillz .
Here are the moments where he rises above his situation , no matter how dire , and manages to shine .
Advertisement
1 . No eyebrows , in The Terminator .
Major challenge : Arnold is a killer cyborg from the future , and he uses his eyebrows convey a subtle menace — until his eyebrows get singed off halfway through the movie .
He looks like Bob Geldof at the end of Pink Floyd 's The Wall .
Massive solution : Arnie is up to the task , scowling and grimacing and turning his forehead into a gnarled mask of terror .
Until he finally gets some big sunglasses , which solve the problem for him .

2. Covered with mud , in Predator .
Major challenge :
At the end of this alien hunter movie , Arnie gets slathered with mud , which hides him from the creature .
Not only is he deprived of his eyebrows , but you can't even make out his sharp jawline and jutting chin .
Massive solution : Arnie 's eyes go into maximum overdrive , bugging out , rolling around and finally bursting out of his sockets .
" Cmawwn ! Kill me ! "
He yells .
Advertisement
3 . The yellow unitard , in Running Man .
Major challenge : Accused of a crime he did n't commit , Arnie is dropped into a maze of death for the amusement of the dystopian masses .
Worst of all , he 's wearing a bright yellow spandex unitard .
Massive solution :
You can't repress Arnie 's masculinity just by putting him in a bizarre aerobics outfit .
You 'll only make him more manly .
And indeed , the moment the unitard goes on , Arnie gets mean .
He grins with delight as he strangles his attackers or castrates them with a chainsaw , and his face finds four new outer quadrants of expression , expanding to convey the full scope of his rage as he threatens to rip out the producer 's spine .
4. Danny DeVito chemistry , in Twins .
Major challenge : Arnie is paired with comedian Danny DeVito , as they pretend to be twins , the result of a weird genetic experiment .
How can Arnie bring his usual gravitas opposite this sleazy clown ?
Massive solution :
He basically goes for the " overgrown child " thing , grinning and acting super eager in contrast to DeVito 's world - weary scumbag .
Arnie is super smart but ignorant of the " real " world , and does n't know what tossing your cookies means .
Advertisement
5 . The crotch kick , in Total Recall .
Major challenge : Sharon Stone wearing aerobics gear ( considerably cuter than Arnie 's in Running Man ) kicks Arnie in the crotch over and over .
How can Arnie convey the wounded masculinity ?
How ?
Massive solution : Luckily , Arnie has had a hundred extra teeth added to his mouth for this film , and he uses all of them , in a grimace so massive it disrupts the gravity of Mars .
Little known fact : Arnie and his many teeth were the model for Rob Liefeld 's art .
Advertisement
6. Slave robot , in Terminator 2 .
Major challenge : Arnie 's back playing a killer cyborg , but this time he has to obey everything a punk kid tells him to do .
Massive solution :
He brings a quiet dignity , underplaying the role for once and letting Edward Furlong and Linda Hamilton spaz out around him .
Advertisement
7. Getting hormonal , in Junior .
Major challenge :
Not only is he acting opposite DeVito once again , but he has to play a pregnant man , who gets all emotional on massive doses of female hormones and starts to cry while watching a Lifetime TV movie .
And then he finally has to go undercover and pose as a woman .
Can Arnie bring his sensitive side ?
Massive solution : Score !
Arnie reaches deep inside himself , a little fold of softness under the five thousand layers of muscle .
His eyes crinkle up , his mouth twists into an S - shape , or maybe that mysterious symbol that 's on Hiro 's sword in Heroes , and he looks like he 's experiencing the joys and sorrows of every mother , everywhere .
Mothers , Arnold Schwarzenegger is you .

8. Covered with goop , in Batman And Robin .
Major challenge :
His greatest struggle yet .
This time , he 's got no eyebrows , like in Terminator .
He 's covered with gunk , like in Predator .
And he 's wearing weird dance wear , like in Running Man .
What can he do ?
Massive solution :
He can't act with his eyes , or his jaw , or his teeth , or his chin this time around .
The only thing Arnie has left is his voice , and he just works it , shouting at the top of his lungs .
With dialogue like " You 're not sending ME to the cooler ! " and " Tonight , Hell freezes over ! " it 's probably the best option .
9 . Too many facelifts , in The Sixth Day .
Major challenge :
It 's like a futuristic science fiction nightmare .
Medical technology has advanced to the point where you can give Arnold Schwarzenegger a whole new face .
It just may not be a good idea .
Gone are Arnie 's trademark grimaces , scowls and eye - pops , because the skin on his face has been stretched so tight he can barely see any more .
Massive solution : Arnie just relaxes and goes with it .
It 's a more laid - back Arnie , even after a clone takes his place and sleeps with his wife .
He has one facial expression , a rigid grin , and it sometimes expands to turn into a cracked - out leer .
It sort of works , as the maniac who 's on the run from the evil clone heads .
Advertisement
10 . Obsolescence , in Terminator 3 .
Major challenge : Arnie is kind of old to be playing a super - advanced ageless cyborg from the future , a fact he references by referring to himself as an " obsolete design . "
Plus , he 's stuck acting opposite an annoying Nick Stahl , who is n't nearly as fun as Edward Furlong was .
Massive solution : Arnie just sort of zones out , acting way more robotic than in the first two Terminators .

And here 's our video compilation of Arnie 's greatest science fiction moments :
Touchscreen voting machines at the center of recent vote - flipping reports can be easily and maliciously recalibrated in the field to favor one candidate in a race , according to a report prepared by computer scientists for the state of Ohio .
At issue are touchscreen machines manufactured by ES&S , 97,000 of which are in use in 20 states , including counties in the crucial swing states of Ohio and Colorado .
The process for calibrating the touchscreens allows poll workers or someone else to manipulate specific regions of the screen , so that a touch in one region is registered in another .
Someone attempting to rig an election could thus arrange for votes for one candidate to be mapped to the opponent .
" If one candidate has a check box in one place and a different candidate has it in a different place , you can set it up so that if you press on one candidate it gets recorded for another candidate , " said Matt Blaze , a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania who led one of three teams that co-wrote the report ( . pdf ) last year .
" But if you press on the other candidate , it gets recorded correctly for that candidate .
You can make it work perfectly normally in most of the screen , but have it behave the way you want in small parts of it . "
The report illustrates a shocking vulnerability in a charged race that 's already seen voter - fraud allegations on both sides , and an ugly spate of voter suppression tactics targeting Democratic voters in several states .
The behavior described is also eerily similar to problems already observed in early voting on ES&S machines and during a 2006 race in Sarasota , Florida .
Such miscalibration , however , would affect any other candidate or race that uses the same part of the screen on a different page of the ballot ; and an alert voter would likely notice the check mark appearing next to the wrong candidate 's name .
Blaze said the calibration function on the ES&S machine is n't password - protected , making it easy for a poll worker – or even a voter
– to access the calibration menu in the middle of an election using a
PEB device ( Personalized Electronic Ballot ) , which election officials insert in a port on the face of the machine .
A PEB might be stolen or purchased online , or an intruder can simulate a PEB by using a Palm Pilot or other handheld device with an infrared port .
With no more than a minute 's access to a voting machine , someone could recalibrate the screen , and to observers the action would be indistinguishable from the normal behavior of a voter in front of a machine or of a poll worker starting up a machine in the morning , said
Blaze , who discusses the issue on his blog .
Voters have recently complained in a number of states about vote - flipping occurring on touchscreen voting machines made by
ES&S .
Voters in West Virginia and Texas complained that when they tried to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , their ES&S machine registered a vote for
Republican presidential candidate John McCain instead .
Voters in Tennessee complained of the opposite occurring – that when they tried to vote for McCain , their ES&S machine registered a vote for Obama instead .
The problem in West Virginia was presumed to be calibration issues with the machine that can occur when the machine is moved or jostled or used for long periods of time without being recalibrated .
Secretary of State
Betty Ireland directed election officials in 34 counties where the
ES&S machines are used to recalibrate their machines every morning during early election and on Election Day .
Voters who complained about the vote - flipping have said that after several tries they were able to get the screen to successfully register their vote for the candidate they selected .
Blaze said that in a scenario involving a malicious calibration , the attacker would essentially shrink or move the region on the screen that is connected to a specific candidate so that voters hit that region only after several attempts touching areas around the candidate .
But voters might also find the " sweet spot " for the candidate in the same way if the machine simply fell out of calibration naturally .
Blaze said it 's impossible to know , from the information that 's been published about the vote - flipping incidents , whether the calibration issue is a naturally - occurring one or one that has been aided .
" There is nowhere near enough information from what I 've seen to conclude that malicious calibration is actually what 's going on , but we can't rule it out either , " Blaze said .
A West Virginia election official recently demonstrated on video how to calibrate an ES&S machine .
A computer science professor at Auburn University has a different take on what might be occurring with the vote - flipping reports .
Juan Gilbert , who directs the Human Centered Computing Lab at Auburn University in Alabama , said he believes the problem is a usability issue coupled with bad ballot design .
He said that on ballots that use a windowbox design with the candidate 's name inside a windowbox on the screen , voters tend to touch on the candidate 's name , rather than the center of the windowbox .
If the windowboxes for two candidates are placed too closely together on top of each other , a voter who casts a ballot for the candidate in the lower box is likely to press on the area between the two boxes , causing the machine to register a vote for the candidate in the upper box .
See the video below for a demonstration of his theory .
Blaze said that Gilbert 's theory is entirely plausible .
" This may not be a tech problem at all , " Blaze said .
" It may in fact be that some of what is being reported may be usability and user interface issues .
In order to figure out what 's going on in a particular case , though , you have to look at the exact ballot design and exact machine configuration in each case . "
Blaze added that due to the recent reports from voters who have experienced problems with machines , other voters are very much on alert and may have a tendency to attribute any problem they experience with the machines to vote flipping .
But that should n't keep them from reporting it .
" If it is a calibration problem – whether malicious or not – it's important that a voter who thinks that that is going on report it and not just go home and complain about it later .
If there is a miscalibration , it can be fixed right then and there ... in the field . "
ES&S did not immediately return a phone call on the issue Monday .

SPECIAL
Rating : **** By Richard Scheib
USA .
2006 .
Directors / Screenplay – Hal Haberman & Jeremy Passmore , Producers – Frank Mele & Edward Parks , Photography – Nelson Cragg , Music – Manish Raval & Tom Wolfe , Visual Effects Supervisor – Michael Leone , Production Design – Nathan Amondson .
Production Company – Rival Pictures .
Cast :
Michael Rapaport ( Les Franken ) , Paul Blackthorne ( Jonas Exiler ) , Jack Kehler ( Dr Dobson ) , Robert Baker ( Everett ) , Josh Peck ( Joey ) , Alexandra Holden ( Maggie ) , Ian Bohen ( Ted Exiler ) , Christopher Darga ( Steve )
Plot : Les Franken is a lonely Los Angeles parking ticket officer who enjoys reading comic - books .
He signs up as a trial subject of the new drug Special for the Exiler Group .
Immediately after taking the pills , Les discovers that he has superpowers – he is able to float off the floor , can read minds and walk through walls .
However , other people are unable to see these things .
After using his telepathy to detect and stop an armed robber in a convenience store , Les quits his job and decides to become a full - time superhero .
He makes himself a costume and sets out to stop other armed robbers .
However , his tackling people has him listed as a crazy by the police .
This also brings him to the attention of the Exiler brothers who have funded the drug trials .
They determine to stop
Les to prevent him from discrediting their drug , while he becomes convinced that they are super - villains who are trying to stop him .
In the last couple of years , the superhero parody has focused on the story of the superhero who has no powers , is merely a deluded individual who either believes that they are a superhero or is trying to enact some form of personal justice by donning costume .
See the likes of Defendor ( 2009 ) , Griff the Invisible ( 2010 ) , Kick - Ass ( 2010 ) and Super ( 2010 ) , as well as Superheroes ( 2011 ) , a documentary about people who dress as superheroes and fight crime in the real world .
Before all of these however , there was Special .
It never gained much of a profile when it came out but was there first and does the idea with considerable brilliance .
Before that , the idea had earlier been tentatively conducted by other films like Hero at Large ( 1980 ) , Blankman ( 1994 ) and Orgazmo ( 1997 ) .
Special hits in with a decided weirdness .
The opening scenes as Michael Rapaport signs up for the drug trial have a thorough normalcy , while his voiceover narration pinpoints the role of a sad nobody living an invisible life with great accuracy .
A few minutes in we then get the baffling image of Rapaport sitting in his apartment where he suddenly floats up off the floor .
This is contrasted to the next scene where he is in the trial doctor ( Jack Kehler ) ’s office and tries to demonstrate his ability to fly and the film cuts between him diving off the desk and floating a few inches off the ground before pulling back to show the doctor ’s point - of - view where he is squiggling on his stomach on the floor .
Things get even more bizarre a few minutes later where Jack Kehler is trying to treat him and Rapaport keeps hearing telepathic conversations that say completely different things and tell him it is all part of a plan to give him superpowers .
The central character ’s insistence on the actuality of his superpowers becomes hysterical – there is the hilarious scene where Michael Rapaport walks into a police station and offers his services , trying to convince a desk sergeant of a signal device to call him if needed “ It does n’t have to be as complicated as the Batsignal ” and then attempts to demonstrate his powers by walking through a wall , only to run smack into it .
The dexterity of the games the film plays in the constant switches between the subjective portrayal of Michael Rapaport ’s superpowers and the objective view of others who can see nothing is bewildering .
There is the mind - boggling scene where Rapaport is in a limo talking with drug company exec Paul Blackthorne who is explaining the fact that the drug has side effects at the same time as Rapaport starts having a conversation with a double of himself in the seat opposite who explains he has time travelled back from the future , or where Rapaport flees from Ian Bohen and starts squirming on the ground believing he is trapped in an invisible forcefield .
The filmmakers love taking the opportunity to screw with our perception and throw what we are seeing on its head – like the scene where Rapaport takes the two comic - book store brothers to Jack Kehler , who has been established as a regular pharmaceutical doctor , to corroborate his story only for Kehler to deny ever having seen Rapaport before .
The film arrives at a particularly good ending [ PLOT SPOILERS ] wherein Michael Rapaport finally comes down off the drugs and walks away , realising in a potently sad voiceover that he has no superpowers and is entirely ordinary .
He is then abruptly hit by a car – given the tone of his voiceover and the staging of the shot , we cannot initially be sure that it is not a suicide and he has thrown himself in front of it .
It turns out to be Paul Blackthorne and brother in the limo who have deliberately run him down .
Rapaport then gets to his feet and Blackthorne reverses to run him down again , at the same time as the bruised and bleeding Rapaport struggles to get back up , showing his defiance of his fate with every attempt , eventually forcing Blackthorne to back down .
It is a beautiful ending in its swinging between the poles of despair and tenacious defiance .
Michael Rapaport , an actor who seems to have been stuck in roles as dim- witted characters in the likes of Mighty Aphrodite ( 1995 ) and Cop Land ( 1997 ) , does an exceptional job in the central role , getting an acute sense of the character ’s loneliness , social awkwardness and certainty in the actuality of his superpowers .
There is a performance of endearing sweetness from the up and rising Alexandra Holden , while everybody else in the cast delivers fine work .
Special was a directing and writing debut for newcomers Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore who sadly have not had the opportunity to do anything else since .
You would certainly welcome their return to the director ’s chair someday soon .
Passmore did eventually go on to write the remake of Red Dawn ( 2012 ) .

A COMMENT :
A friend came over recently for an evening of wine and a most decadent cake that she bought at Luckybird Bakery in Brooklyn , my favorite pastery shop .
It was going to be a movie night .
I chose the movies .
First up an oldie with Michael Rapaport , Special .
We both like this type of quirky , offbeat , indie " dramedies " .
Rapaport delivers an almost unexpected dedicated and amazing performance .
Although Special 's low budget is more than obvious , I think with this cinematic gem that the sum is greater than the parts .
The two of us had seen it when we were in high school .
A decade + later we were out of college and following our dreams working in the fashion industry in the Big Apple .
We alternate our once a month movie night since she lives on Brooklyn and I in the West Village .
So the evening begins .
The movie had us laughing , gasping , holding our breath and wiping away tears .
Perhaps our boisterous behavior spook my two cats , but all of a sudden there were two fur ball hurtling across the coffee table knocking over the bottle of red wine and my plate with a second slice of cake .
I stood up quickly trying to prevent the bottle from landing on the rug and instesd stepped on the fallen pice of cake .
It was like a 1940 's slap stick comedy routine .
It 'sa good thing I had already found some terrific Manhattan rug cleaning pros whom I knew I would be calling the next day .
We cleaned up as much of the mess as possible , moved our seating , and the coffee table , opened another bottle of wine and went back to our movie binge .
The next morning I called Agara , the rug cleaners .
They were there that very afternoon to pick up the rug and whisk it away to be cleaned .
Agara rug cleaners specialize in cleaning and restoring antique hand tied rugs .
This is not the first time I have used them .
I think they can remove just about any stain .
They use environmentally friendly rug cleaner practices and all rugs are washed with organic solutions which is important to me since I do n't want my cats to get sick from some toxic cleaning solution .
This was the first movie night in which my cats really got out of control .
It 's hard to believe that out laughter triggered them , but perhaps the next time I host a movie night that cats will not be invited .
Obviously I highly recommend Special .
DON'T watch this expecting a superhero movie !

Review : Special ( 2006 )
There are severe problems with Hal Haberman & Jeremy Passmore ’s Special — scheduled to play on November 21st in Los Angeles and New York as the second film in Magnet Releasing ’s very intriguing Six Shooter Film Series .
( I have also seen Timecrimes , a very fun time travel movie from Spain that I can recommend to you .
Timecrimes manages to do everything right that Special does so wrong , and I will write about it later . )
Here is a film that strives to be a partial satirical sendup of the pharmaceutical industry , but that gives us a protagonist who has little going for him other than a crush on a stuttering supermarket clerk and a loose friendship with two brothers who work at a comic book store .
Here is a film ridiculing an average Joe ( or , in this case , an average Les ) who clings to kind acts and antidepressants to find some personal meaning , but that likewise asks us to empathize with him after he has been beaten to a pulp .
Here is a film attempting to celebrate the geeky fantasy of having superpowers , but that lacks the bravery to suggest that some of our seemingly insignificant acts are less solipsistic and more meaningful than the ability to walk through walls .
Here is a case in which Les is n’t more , and he really needs to be in order for the premise to work .
He ’s a gushing parking enforcement officer played with too much earnestness by Michael Rapaport .
We first see Les as a thrashed up man wandering in the night , with a handheld camera drifting in and out of focus .
“ I used to dream about flying , ” says Les in the first of many voiceovers .
We learn that this narration represents what he styles his medication journal .
Les has signed up for a clinical trial program .
( The doctor is named Dobson , which may be a nod to the evangelical Christian . )
Rather suspiciously , Les is not asked to take any physical tests .
The pills are handed over , and he ’s asked to ingest a new phramaceutical called Specioprin Hydrochloride .
Nothing happens at first .
But shortly after eating a sad microwaved meal in his apartment , a mostly barren place populated by a few comic book posters hanging behind the couch , he finds himself levitating in his living room .
He rushes back to the doctor to demonstrate his abilities , and it soon becomes apparent that all this is in his mind .
He soon quits his job , determined to pursue a new life as a crimefighter ( and to avoid the dreaded mantra , “ I ’m important and I keep this city running , ” that his boss frequently has him utter ) .
Aside from the power to fly and the ability to run through walls , Les also believes that he can read minds and make objects disappear .
This all sounds like a fantastic premise .
And you ’d think that a movie featuring a Takeshi Kitano - like scene in which Les punctures a man ’s ear with chopsticks would have the spirit to pull this premise off .
But the filmmakers have foolishly placed their collective faith in a high concept idea , when they really needed to pay attention to human behavior .
I got the sense that Haberman and Passmore were n’t particularly interested in the way that ordinary people feel and think .
And I desperately desired for someone to send them a crate of Stewart O’Nan and Richard Yates novels .
This contempt was evident when Les ’s frequent tackling of potential suspects is broadcast on the evening news .
The video is played over and over , as if it were a crude YouTube video or a Jackass outtake , with the Channel 3 anchor declaring , “ Let ’s take one more look at it . ”
It ’s there in the hard rock music that plays as Les runs around the city in his makeshift costume .
We ’re expected to laugh at Les ’s cluelessness .
But this film takes itself seriously .
And when a film wants us to care like this , it should not treat its main character like something to be pummeled in a Punch and Judy show .
The contempt is also there in the PG - rated thoughts that Les “ hears ” in his mind .
( One man says , “ Sweet juicy peach . ”
His girlfriend calls for peach cobbler . )
Now this is an interesting choice from the filmmakers .
You would think that a man who has been repeatedly tricked out of issuing parking tickets , who has indeed been called an “ asshole ” by a woman offering a maudlin sob story , would have a less chaste view of other people ’s “ thoughts . ”
But the filmmakers do n’t want to transport us into this very interesting place .
We ’re expected to accept Les as nothing more than a pathetic and bumbling thirtysomething hick who got hoodwinked into the drug program because he was “ happy ” and he did n’t quite know his place .
And with such a one - dimensional portrait , we can neither hate him nor like him , much less be interested in him .
And this is simply not good enough for a narrative that wants to matter .
It is also a terrible cheat to present an undeveloped character , have him periodically abuse himself by running into walls or getting mugged by thugs , and then try to ramrod the audience into sympathizing with him .
Les does n’t get a chance to breathe , even though Rapaport does manage to sell a fight sequence in which his assailants are “ invisible , ” but beat him up anyway .
I was reminded of the moment in Fight Club in which Edward Norton punches himself .
But that moment worked , because we were damn curious about how far Norton ’s character would go .
What does Rapaport have react to ?
“ You have no idea what kind of man I am , motherfucker , ” followed by a flip courtesy of digitally erased wires .
There is also one glaring plot hole .
If the “ suits ” from the drug company are after Les , and they want him to stop taking the experimental drug , why do n’t they just wait for Les ’s bottle of pills to run out ?
It is suggested multiple times in this movie that Les ’s condition will continue so long as he pops the pills .
But so far as we know , he only has one bottle .
Certainly if the drug company wanted to leave Les out in the cold , they could simply wait it out .
But instead they resort to violence .
And they drive a fancy limo around town , with the men wearing bloody suits and drawing attention to themselves .
A narrative involving the tragedy of interior self - delusion is certainly a good idea for our uncertain times .
But the more I think about this movie , the more I realize just how little time the filmmakers devoted to working out their story .
Special ( 2006 ) – Review
05/19/2010
SANDY HOFFMAN
‘ what good will it be for a man to gain the whole world –yet forfeits his soul ? ’
Special ( 2007 ) is a film by director and writers Hal Haberman and Jeremy Passmore .
The film stars Michael Rapaport , Paul Blackthorne , Josh Peck , Robert Baker , Jack Kehler , and Alexandra Holden , in a film about a guy who thinks he has special hero powers , thanks to a experimental anti-depressive drug .
I can remember hearing a song by the group ” Third Eye Blind ” called Semi- charmed life .
Later , after blasting the song on my iPod at work–learned that the song referenced taking ‘ mood enhancements ’ i.e drugs .
“ Wanting something else –to get through life . ”
No wonder the song made such and impression on me – ( do doo do doo do do do ) sorry .
What if –there was actually something –something to make you feel better than you are now–as if you are invincible – the ability to face the world without a worry ( psst .
I know that there are things akin to this description , I ’m writing a review here , so work with me ð Ÿ˜‰ )
Feel like –like living is actually worth it .
Case in point , meet Les ( Michael Rapaport ) who asked himself the exact same thing .
Les is basically a loner , except for his two friends , who owned a comic book store .
Les has a terrible job as a meter maid and a boss who did not respect him .
Overall–no one really respected Les and he did not blame them .
He did not respect himself .
Well , that was until a new pharmaceutical company came to town offering him a ray of sunshine .
Clinical pharmaceutical trials .
Promising Les that the antidepressant sepcioprin hydrochloride would make life a bit more tolerable for him .
Sign me up !
The antidepressant would be just the thing he needed –
an answer to his troubles …
an it would seem that the pill worked wonders for Les .
— but there are those side effects —
‘ Special ’ a movie for most of us .
I mean , are n’t we all looking for that ‘ miracle ’ pill that would make our lives seem a bit easier ?

Chason said I could benefit from doing some more surreal work .
So , HA !
Email :
Thanks to everyone who wrote in about the maps .
This page has had nearly a million hits since the election and I 've received so much email that I may not be able to reply to everyone , but I much appreciate all your comments and suggestions .
Many of the things people have been asking about are answered in this list of frequently asked questions .
Book of cartograms : I have a new book of world cartograms entitled The Atlas of the Real World , coauthored with Daniel Dorling and Anna Barford .
It 's nothing to do with elections , but it contains more than 300 cartograms showing everything from who emits the most greenhouse gases to who imports the most fish .
You can see a preview of some of the maps here .
The book is supposed to be fun but also informative – the maps are a great way to learn many things about the world that you probably never knew .
If you 're interested in this stuff check it out .
I have new cartograms of the 2016 election results .
You can find them here .
Maps of the 2008 US presidential election results
Election results by state
Most of us are , by now , familiar with the maps the TV channels and web sites use to show the results of the presidential election :
Click on any of the maps for a larger picture
The states are colored red or blue to indicate whether a majority of their voters voted for the Republican candidate , John McCain , or the Democratic candidate , Barack Obama , respectively .
Looking at this map it gives the impression that the Republicans won the election handily , since there is rather more red on the map than there is blue .
In fact , however , the reverse is true – the Democrats won by a substantial margin .
The explanation for this apparent paradox , as pointed out by many people , is that the map fails to take account of the population distribution .
It fails to allow for the fact that the population of the red states is on average significantly lower than that of the blue ones .
The blue may be small in area , but they represent a large number of voters , which is what matters in an election .
We can correct for this by making use of a cartogram , a map in which the sizes of states are rescaled according to their population .
That is , states are drawn with size proportional not to their acreage but to the number of their inhabitants , states with more people appearing larger than states with fewer , regardless of their actual area on the ground .
On such a map , for example , the state of Rhode Island , with its 1.1 million inhabitants , would appear about twice the size of Wyoming , which has half a million , even though Wyoming has 60 times the acreage of Rhode Island .
Here are the 2008 presidential election results on a population cartogram of this type :
As you can see , the states have been stretched and squashed , some of them substantially , to give them the appropriate sizes , though it 's done in such a way as to preserve the general appearance of the map , so far as that 's possible .
On this map there is now clearly more blue than red .
The presidential election , however , is not actually decided on the basis of the number of people who vote for each candidate but on the basis of the electoral college .
Under the US electoral system , each state in the union contributes a certain number of electors to the electoral college , who vote according to the majority in their state .
The candidate receiving a majority of the votes in the electoral college wins the election .
The electors are apportioned roughly according to states ' populations , as measured by the census , but with a small but deliberate bias in favor of smaller states .
We can represent the effects of the electoral college by scaling the sizes of states to be proportional to their number of electoral votes , which gives a map that looks like this :
This cartogram looks similar to the one above it , but it 's not identical .
Wyoming , for instance , has approximately doubled in size , precisely because of the bias in favor of small states .
The areas of red and blue on the cartogram are now proportional to the actual numbers of electoral votes won by each candidate .
Thus this map shows at a glance both which states went to which candidate and which candidate won more electoral college votes – something that you cannot tell easily from the normal election - night red and blue map .
Election results by county
But we can go further .
We can do the same thing also with the county - level election results and the images are even more striking .
Here is a map of US counties , again colored red and blue to indicate Republican and Democratic majorities respectively :
Now the effects we saw at the state level are even more pronounced : the red areas appear overwhelmingly in the majority , an appearance again at odds with the actual results of the election .
Again , we can make a more helpful respresentation by using a cartogram .
Here is what the cartogram looks like for the county - level election returns :
However , this map is still somewhat misleading because we have colored every county either red or blue , as if every voter voted the same way .
This is of course not realistic : all counties contain both Republican and Democratic supporters and in using just the two colors on our map we lose any information about the balance between them .
There is no way to tell whether a particular county went strongly for one candidate or the other or whether it was relatively evenly split .
One way to improve the map and reveal more nuance in the vote is to use not just two colors , red and blue , but to use red , blue , and shades of purple in between to indicate percentages of votes .
Here is what the normal map looks like if you do this :
And here 's what the cartogram looks like :
As this map makes clear , large portions of the country are quite evenly divided , appearing in various shades of purple , although a number of strongly Democratic ( blue ) areas are visible too , mostly in the larger cities .
There are also some strongly Republican areas , but most of them have relatively small populations and hence appear quite small on this map .
A slight variation on the same idea is to use a nonlinear color scale like this :
These maps use a color scale that ranges from red for 70 % Republican or more , to blue for 70 % Democrat or more .
This is sort of practical , since there are n't many counties outside that range anyway , but to some extent it also obscures the true balance of red and blue .
Notes : Frequently asked questions ( FAQs ) : A list of frequently asked questions concerning these maps , along with answers , can be found here .
County results :
The county - level data I used came from here .
For those who want to do their own analysis , here are spreadsheets of the complete county results in OpenDocument and Microsoft format .
They are up - to - date as of November 16 , 2008 , but a small number of precincts still had not reported by that date , so a few results are missing .
Correction : Vote tallies for Richmond and Kings counties in New York were mistakenly interchanged on the original maps .
This has now been corrected on all maps .
Many thanks to C. Moore for pointing out the error .

I am still reeling after the GOP led the charge to sink our American auto industry by demonizing the unions and their workers for making an honest wage along with the benefits that go with it .
What further angered me was viewing this tape of a man actually being foreclosed which came to my attention this morning .
I call it Bush ’s dirty little secret .
As many await the opening of the stock markets which will most likely go into negative territory as predicted by some after the GOP sank our American auto industry , the foreign markets proved it did as their markets spiraled downwards .
While supporters of Bush ( if there are still some left ) will say , blame the Democrats equally , this is where I cannot blame the Democrats .
This is a crisis taking place on Bush ’s watch and he could have written an executive order to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson to release portions of that TARP money to stem the tide of these foreclosures and to bailout our American auto industry .
He ( Bush ) has been busily writing other executive orders which will take significant time for President - elect Barack Obama to reverse .
When candidate Bush was running for the presidency back in 2000 , I truly wish that the media had concentrated on the sea - of - red that he left the state of Texas in as well as his failed corporate leadership of two oil companies .
That was his plan for the rest of us .
He did not enter into this office to serve the will of the people , but destroy this country .
As you watch the feed above , this process is taking place all over our country and this is what is in store for those auto workers who will most likely find themselves out of work .
So much for his pro-family and compassionate - conservatism stance since many families have found themselves out on the street and will continue to do so .
There is absolutely no compassion coming from Bush .
While the Blagojevich drama will continue to be the lead story of the main stream media :
What should be front and center are stories like this that are actually affecting our fellow Americans .
This is what Americans should be paying attention to instead of a disgraced governor going down in flames .
Hopefully , he will get what he deserves , but it cannot even compare to American families being thrown out into the street as they can no longer afford to live in their homes .
Exactly where is the wall - to - wall coverage of their stories ?
Just like the thousands of coffins that came home from Iraq , they are not seen .
As you read this article written by Helen Thomas , this is another case of out of sight , out of mind when she reported , “ Do n't let the American public see coffins arriving home with U.S. casualties from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
She goes onto report , “ In a move by the Bush administration to suppress distressing images of war , the Defense Department issued a directive last March on the eve of the U.S. invasion of Iraq that declared : " There will be no arrival ceremonies for , or media coverage of , deceased military personnel returning to or departing from Ramstein ( Germany ) airbase or Dover ( Del. ) base , ( and ) to include interim stops . "
Just another example of the Bush legacy that I thought you should know .
Hide those killed in action , hide those losing their jobs , hide those being foreclosed upon and what you get is the true Bush legacy .
January 20th , 2009 , cannot come fast enough .
I do remember when Bush first came into office , the media continued to cover former President Bill Clinton as he left Washington , D.C. and those who welcomed him here in New York State : Hopefully , the media will end their coverage of Bush as he is flown out of Washington and heads back to Dallas , Texas .
Good riddance to Bush is what I say !
While some may say of Bush ’s presidency that he kept us safe since 9/11 , try telling that to the thousands upon thousands being foreclosed upon as they have lost their jobs during this administration .
What they have felt and will continue to feel is abject terror and not at the hands of foreign terrorists , but at the hands of President George W. Bush :
The destroyer of the American dream .
God help us all .
BEN BERNANKE , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , has a lot on his plate these days , including a financial crisis , a probable recession , and the worst inflation in 17 years .
What is more , he is tackling it with a fractious team of policymakers .
The contingent of inflation hawks on the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) is one of the largest and most vocal in memory .
The committee , made up of governors and regional bank presidents , has voted on interest rates eight times since the end of last September .
All featured at least one dissenting vote and , except for one , they were for higher interest rates .
At least six of the 12 bank presidents ( of whom five vote in any given year ) have expressed discomfort with the current , low level of rates .
Ahead of the Fed 's August 5th policy meeting , three banks requested a quarter - point increase in the Fed 's discount rate .
They did not get it .
But it was a sign of what they want .
The FOMC has so far refused to yield to such internal pressure .
Mr Bernanke would sooner suffer dissent than placate the hawks with what he thought was a premature rate increase .
The signs are that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at 2 % when it meets on September 16th .
There could even be a rare show of harmony , given that the inflationary threat from oil prices and the dollar may be receding .
The hawks ' bigger influence is on how the Fed talks .
Mr Bernanke has made Fed deliberations more democratic and strives to incorporate the breadth of his colleagues ' views in official announcements .
In a process that began shortly before he took office , a draft of the post - meeting statement is e-mailed a week before each meeting to FOMC members , who are asked to comment if they do not think it spans the “ plausible range ” of committee views .
Anywhere from zero to four typically do , sometimes resulting in a new draft .
During meetings , Mr Bernanke sums up the views of his colleagues before stating his own .
At times , this can send misleading signals about interest rates .
Statements released last month , and in August and October last year , emphasised concerns about inflation at a time of deepening economic distress .
Mr Bernanke has sought to reduce the confusion by asserting his own views in public more often .
Bridging these divergent views is tricky because many of the hawks do not just differ in their outlooks , but in how monetary policy works .
The conventional view , shared by Mr Bernanke , Donald Kohn , his influential vice - chairman , and their professional staff , is that monetary policy affects inflation via its impact on the real economy .
Higher interest rates reduce demand relative to the economy 's potential to supply goods and services .
Reduce it enough , and unused slack will accumulate , forcing firms and workers to compete for scarce customers and jobs by lowering prices and wages .
The opposite happens when demand rises relative to supply .
This relationship is captured in the Phillips curve , which shows inflation falling when unemployment is above its natural rate .
In this view , it does not matter whether it is monetary policy or a credit crunch that raises unemployment : both put downward pressure on inflation .
What is more , Mr Bernanke and his colleagues reckon today 's low fed funds rate is merely offsetting tighter financial conditions from the credit crunch .
The hawks , by contrast , think that unemployment and other measures of “ economic slack ” have limited bearing on the transmission of monetary policy .
Fed actions affect inflation primarily by altering inflation expectations .
They worry that a low funds rate in itself threatens to lift inflation , and rising unemployment and the credit crunch will do little to contain it .
The divide inside today 's FOMC recalls the “ freshwater - saltwater ” split in macroeconomics in the 1970s and 1980s , when inland scholars such as those at the University of Minnesota challenged the Phillips - curve advocates at coastal universities like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over their sympathy for activist policymaking .
Appropriately , the latest challenge originated with research at the Minneapolis Fed earlier this decade that found no relationship between unemployment and inflation .
The most outspoken hawk today is Jeffrey Lacker , a University of Wisconsin graduate who now heads the Richmond Fed .
He dissented four times in 2006 and in June criticised the Fed 's expansion of lending to banks as risking both moral hazard and the Fed 's independence .
Although some hawks rile their colleagues with the rigidity of their views , they are not a threat to Mr Bernanke 's leadership .
For one thing , his fellow governors in Washington , DC , are united behind him .
For another , the hawks are grateful for being encouraged to air their disagreements .
The hawkish chatter may at times muddle the Fed 's message , but it probably means the FOMC is working as it should .
An infrared camera aboard NASA 's Cassini spacecraft has discovered a unique aurora lighting up Saturn 's polar cap .
The mysterious new aurora is unlike any other known in our solar system .
"
We 've never seen an aurora like this elsewhere , " said Tom Stallard , an RCUK Academic Fellow working with Cassini data at the University of Leicester .
Stallard is lead author of a paper released today in the British journal Nature .
" It 's not just a ring of aurorae like those we 've seen at Jupiter or Earth .
This one covers an enormous area across the pole .
Our current ideas on what forms Saturn 's aurorae predict that this region should be empty , so finding such a bright one here is a fantastic surprise .
" Aurorae are caused when charged particles stream along the magnetic field of a planet and into its atmosphere .
On Earth these charged particles come from the solar wind ­ a stream of particles that emanaates from the Sun .
This image of the northern polar region of Saturn shows both the aurora and underlying atmosphere , seen at two different wavelengths of infrared light as captured by NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft .
Energetic particles , crashing into the upper atmosphere cause the aurora , shown in blue , to glow brightly at 4 microns ( six times the wavelength visible to the human eye ) .
The image shows both a bright ring , as seen from Earth , as well as an example of bright auroral emission within the polar cap that had been undetected until the advent of Cassini .
This aurora , which defies past predictions of what was expected , has been observed to grow even brighter than is shown here .
Silhouetted by the glow ( cast here to the color red ) of the hot interior of Saturn ( clearly seen at a wavelength of 5 microns , or seven times the wavelength visible to the human eye ) are the clouds and haze that underlie this auroral region .
For a similar view of the region beneath the aurora see http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09185 .
This image is a composite captured with Cassini ’s visual and infrared mapping spectrometer .
The aurora image was taken in the near - infrared on Nov. 10 , 2006 , from a distance of 1,061,000 kilometers ( 659,000 miles ) , with a phase angle of 157 degrees and a sub- spacecraft planetocentric latitude of 52 degrees north .
The image of the clouds was obtained by Cassini on June 15 , 2008 , from a distance of 602,000 kilometers ( 374,000 miles ) and a sub- spacecraft planetocentric latitude of 73 degrees north .

Credit : NASA / JPL / University of ArizonaJupiter 's main auroral ring , caused by interactions internal to Jupiter 's magnetic environment , is constant in size .
Saturn 's main aurora , which is caused by the solar wind , changes size dramatically as the wind varies .
The newly observed aurora at Saturn , however , does n't fit into either category .
" Saturn 's unique auroral features are telling us there is something special and unforeseen about this planet 's magnetosphere and the way it interacts with the solar wind and the planet 's atmosphere , "  said Nick Achilleos , Cassini scientist on the Cassini magnetometer team at the University College London .
" Trying to explain its origin will no doubt lead us to physics which uniquely operates in the environment of Saturn .
"
The new infrared aurora appears in a region hidden from NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope , which has provided views of Saturn 's ultraviolet aurora .
Cassini observed it when the spacecraft flew near Saturn 's polar region .
In infrared light , the aurora sometimes fills the region from around 82 degrees north all the way over the pole .
This new aurora is also constantly changing , even disappearing within a 45 minute - period .

As I work on my major Masters project ( due December ) , and while doing the odd freelance job , I take inspiration from the likes of Carsonified and Contrast who have been known for their ‘ drop everything else for a week ’ approach to work on other projects , and I work on my own side projects .
Their approach to taking a week to focus on 1 new project ( from start to finish ) is great but working 1 or 2 hours a day on a side project is also beneficial .
Why bother with side projects ?
Luck favors the people who try stuff - Guy Kawasaki
1 . Take a break
Take a break from your normal routine and refresh your head .
Exploring different ideas can get you out of a creative block and bring inspiration .
2. Expand your skill - set
Try out new frameworks , see what you can do with different APIs , test your design skills .
The creative community never stops moving so you need to make sure you stay up - to - date .
3. Brand awareness - raise your profile
Whether you ’re a freelance designer or a large corporation , side projects can help raise your profile simply by having your name associated with it .
4. Contribute to the community
It ’s always good to contribute something to the community .
It ’ll be appreciated .
5 . Have fun
You can have a lot of fun working on your own stuff because you ’re in control of the brief and there ’s no one to tell you what to do .
6. Passive income
It ’s hard to beat an application that makes money while you sleep or get on with the rest of your life .
You might not make a fortune , but a few extra bucks a week to fund your Saturday night on the rip is a welcome addition :)
7 . Try stuff
If you want to be successful in life I believe you have to try stuff .
If it works , happy days !
If it does n’t , learn from it and move on .
“ Luck favors the people who try stuff ” , says entrepreneur Guy Kawasaki .
Where to start
a . Take notes
Take notes when you think of projects and put them on your to - do list .
I carry around a small notebook in my laptop bag and constantly add ideas to my ‘ Someday ’ list in Things .
b. Talk to other creatives
Talking to others will spark new ideas .
c. Read
Read a book from an inspiring designer or look at a book of visuals to get ideas .
d. Mashups
APIs make it very easy to launch small apps .
Look at all the Twitter mashups now available .
Think of different uses for Google Maps , Flickr , YouTube .
e . What would you find useful ?
Chances are that if there was a website or tool that you would find useful , then there are 100s or 1000s of people who would also find it useful .
What side projects are you working on ?
A successful side project I co-founded was The Big Word Project and I ’ve just launched an Irish web design gallery ( Web Designire ) which only took a couple of hours a day for 5 days to develop ( read more about it here ) .
Please feel free to share the side projects you ’re currently working on or have produced in the past .
It would be great to have your input .

Muriel Drinkwater was 12 when she was raped and killed .
Scientists working on the case of a schoolgirl raped and shot dead 62 years ago have made a possible breakthrough in the hunt for the killer .
Muriel Drinkwater , 12 , was attacked as she walked home from a school in Penllergaer , Swansea in June 1946 .
Forensic experts have now obtained a DNA profile related to the killer 's family from a semen stain on her coat .
It means police could trace her killer even if he is dead by matching his profile to a close male relative .
Dr Colin Dark , from the Forensic Science Service , said it was the oldest case in the world that he was aware of that a DNA profile and familial profile had been obtained from .
Attempts to match a DNA profile of the suspected killer have so far failed , because his details are not on the national DNA database .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Det Ch Insp Paul Bethell from South Wales Police , who is conducting the new investigation , said Muriel 's killer was probably aged 18 to 25 when he murdered her , so would now be aged at least 80 , if alive .
He said he was focusing on 40 to 50 men who featured in the original investigation .
If any of the men emerged as strong suspects , DNA would be taken from them or , if the men were dead , from their male relatives , to establish if there is a link to the crime .
None of the suspects or their relatives had been swabbed so far .
Scientists used a technique called Y - STR to gain a familial DNA profile from the stain , which enables them to examine specific DNA markers on the Y - chromosome , which is passed from father to son relatively unchanged throughout the generations Familial searching was crucial to police solving the 1988 murder of 20 - year - old Lynette White in Cardiff .
A search of the national DNA database for a rare gene variant found in a specimen recovered from the crime scene identified a 14 - year - old boy with a similar genetic profile .
This led police to his paternal uncle , Jeffrey Gafoor , the murderer .
Gafoor received a life sentence in 2003 for the killing .

Hi , my name is Kimmo Lahtinen and I was the programming lead for Housemarque on Super Stardust Portable .
Super Stardust Portable is the PSP version of our previously released PS3 title Super Stardust HD with some nice additions we think you ’ll enjoy .
And you ’ll be able to enjoy them very soon .
Super Stardust Portable will be available for download on the PlayStation Store on Thursday , December 4th for just $ 9.99 !
If there is one word to describe the game , that would be ‘ intense ’ .
Your goal in the game is to simply destroy the waves after waves of enemies we throw at you and try to not get killed .
If you ’re not constantly on the edge of your seat when trying to blow up everything in sight with dozens of asteroids coming at you all the while screen is filled with explosions and fireworks , you should probably apply for a job as an astronaut or something . :)
When we first got the idea from Sony about doing a PSP version of the game , we were thrilled .
We think that Super Stardust is a perfect fit for a portable device , do a 10 minute session of Endless while riding on the bus into school .
Pick up and play , it ’s like it was designed to be portable from the start .
Then it hit us , how are we going to get this thing running on the PSP .
Even though the PSP is the most powerful for a hand - held console , it ’s still a totally different animal from the processing power of the PS3 .
We ’ve got more than ten thousand objects and hundreds of thousands particles flying around in the PS3 version and we probably use more than 10GHz of processing power from the machine .
What we learned from developing the PS3 version is that sphere level is actually quite a large playing space and requires thousands and thousands of objects rotating around before the game level does n’t feel empty .
It took a lot of trial and error to get that working on the PS3 version .
The PSP version is played on a wrapping 2D field that is optimized for the PSP screen .
There was a lot of tuning to make it not feel either crowded or too large so we could have the gameplay and levels stay as fast as before .
After we found the optimum size , we felt that we had lost nothing of the old intensity in the conversion .
In addition we actually do a few tricks to make it look like you ’re still playing around a planet too .
After a lot of work and because of the choices we made , we managed to get more than a thousand objects on the field with 60 frames per second .
That ’s a lot of things to shoot .
We ’ve also got the Super Stardust trademark particle effects working on the PSP , so the explosions look as pretty as ever .
Another change we faced was the controls .
The PS3 version uses two analog sticks for control and shooting .
How are we going to get that working on the PSP where there ’s only one analog stick available ?
What we decided to go with is to map the shooting to the face buttons and let the game interpolate the shooting direction when needed .
This took a lot of effort to get right , but the end result feels perfect .
We were glad to find out that even for those that are completely new to PSP system , it did n’t take long to figure out the controls .
We also made a new shooting mode to make full use of the buttons .
If you tap a shooting direction , the shots will spray around .
This also makes for another interesting gameplay choice .
More weapon power on one focused point or less in a wide spray ?
The controls are also configurable , so if someone out there does n’t like the choices we made , they can remap the controls for their own liking .
Some other new things we have for PSP version :
A completely new mode : Impact .
In impact mode you cannot shoot , just bomb and boost .
The boost is a bit different in this mode in that when you boost through something , you receive more boost energy and your multiplier goes up at the same time ( max 100x ) , so the key to high scores is to chain your boosts into as long as you can and to collect points with huge multipliers .

A new final boss :
One complaint on the PS3 version was that the final boss was way too easy .
I should warn you that your first meeting with Professor Schaumunds ’ new machine of destruction could leave a bit of something in you pants . ;)

Even more intense gameplay .
We still have a casual mode that is suitable for everyone , but one thing we found out about the PS3 version is that for the best players it takes hours and hours to complete the arcade game .
For this version we have upped the difficulty curve too after a few of the first difficulty levels .
This is a portable game , you should n’t have to play a day to get challenged in the game even if you are that good .
Our main goals were to keep the same high intensity gameplay from the PS3 version and do it at a consistent 60 frames per second .
We feel that both goals were successfully completed , but I ’ll leave the final judgement to you .
See you on the high score lists !
( Yes we have online high scores too ! )
Will Google 's new Friend Connect help Webmasters add a " dash of social " to their sites ?
That 's what the search giant is promising with today 's announcement .
The idea is to make it easy to let Web site owners add social networking features like chat , games and ratings by simply copying and pasting a few lines of code .
For users , that means instead of having to create an account on a Friend Connect - powered Web site , they can use their Google ID instead of yet another login and password to remember .
Facebook has something similar with Facebook 's Connect service , which uses a consumer 's existing Facebook ID info to validate them on a site outside Facebook .
In the latter case , your activities on Facebook Connect sites , such as posting a review , would be automatically reported back to your Facebook friends if you set up your profile to follow your activities .
Google , a prime backer of the OpenSocial initiative , offers a broader of access points for its new offering .
You can gain entry to Friend Connect features using Google ID info , as well as Yahoo , AOL , or OpenID .
You can also create an entirely new profile .
Friend Connect lets users post profile information and find out about each other at these Connect - enabled sites much as they would on a social networking site like Facebook or MySpace .
Chat and other features are available from a list of gadgets at the Friend Connect site .
A Google promo video said " there will soon be an endless number of other social gadgets you 'll soon be able to add . "
Also ,
Web sites that use Friend Connect automatically become " OpenSocial containers " capable of running an emerging cross-section of applications from the OpenSocial developer community , said Google product manager Mussie Shore in a blog post .
Friend Connect is an OpenSocial application .
There 's no restriction on where Friend Connect might be added , be it a fan site , blog or merchant site .
The race is on ?
Kathy Sharpe , CEO of digital marketing agency Sharpe Partners , said if this is a social networking race , she gives the early nod to Facebook .
" It 's completely on brand for Facebook because that 's what they 're known for , social networking , " Sharpe told InternetNews.com .
" Google 's known for algorithms and search . "
On the other hand , Sharpe said Google has a better reputation for security than Facebook , but she also thinks Google will have to change some of its past practices to be successful .
" This is Facebook 's game to lose , they have the brand .
It 's not a zero sum game , but Google has n't shown it believes in marketing .
Microsoft finally learned what Apple learned years ago , you have to market to be successful , " said Sharpe .
Meanwhile , Sharpe notes
Web site operators get to benefit from being associated with the Facebook brand .
" That 's what you want to reach the 35 and unders , " she said .
" And then Facebook will have all this data .
I do n't exactly what they 'll do with it , but I suspect they 'll find ways to use it , not in a selfish way , but to benefit their members , help them connect more with one another and add value . "
She expects the next big area of growth will be mobile where you 'll be able to take this kind of universal ID and participate at different sites designed for mobile .
 Pitched battles outside parliament 
Boy died from ricochet , says lawyer  Country 'at a standstill ' as strike deepens
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
A general strike shut down schools , hospitals , flight and public services across Greece today , touching off further riots that left dozens injured and piling the pressure on a government severely shaken by five days of unprecedented civil unrest .
Stone - throwing youths fought pitched battles with riot police outside Athens ' parliament as thousands of striking workers joined a separate demonstration , chanting their way through the capital .
Amid screams of " let parliament burn , " protesters hurled petrol bombs , marble slabs and pieces of cement at police who responded by firing rounds of acrid tear gas into the air .
The clashes , triggered by the police shooting of 15 - year - old Alexandros Grigoropoulos , are the worst disturbances to hit Greece since the end of military rule in 1974 .
Angry mobs have relentlessly laid siege to cities nationwide , plundering public buildings , stores and cars before sending them up in flames in an orgy of destruction .
With the country shut down and Greece 's links to the world cut as a result of the strike , the conservative administration – already clinging onto power by a single seat in Athens ' 300 member House – found itself facing a full - scale political crisis .
Addressing the nation in a bid to contain the spiralling tensions , the prime minister , Costas Karamanlis , today pledged financial support for those who had suffered damage and promised to protect individuals from further violence .
But opposition to the free - market conservatives ' fiscal policies and plans to privatise hospitals and schools , is unlikely to fade soon .
Support for the government , even from the most die - hard conservatives , has dropped dramatically with nearly 70 % telling pollsters they have mishandled the crisis .
" The only way out of this impasse is for the government to resign and call early elections , " said Spyros Polyzos , a 60 - year - old accountant participating in the demonstration .
" Young people are right to take to the streets .
They have absolutely no future .
It 's not just the global economic crisis .
Even if they speak three foreign languages and get the best degrees they can't find work , and if they do it pays badly .
The only thing that saves them is the strong family ties here . "
" These protests are our answer to a government that always closes the doors in our face , " said Yiannis Yiapitsakis , a student at Athens ' fabled Polytechnic .
" If the root causes of our problems are not solved there will be more explosions .
It 's a smouldering fire , all it needs is another match . "
Symbolic of the fear and loathing gripping Greece is the makeshift shrine erected on the spot in Athens where Grigoropoulos was shot dead .
In handwritten notes , cards , paintings and poems , Greeks of all ages not only honoured the young " martyr " but gave vivid testimony to a country that increasingly appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
" You have paid for what people like me who belong to the generation of 50 - year - olds , know to be true , " wrote one father in a note placed on top of a pile of roses , candles , plants and paper icons .
" That we are shaking with worry over the future of our children .
Something has to happen now . "
Today , according to a lawyer for the two police officers accused in the fatal shooting , a ballistic examination revealed that the schoolboy had died as an accident after the bullet ricocheted .
" Whether it was an accident or not that policemen should never have pulled a gun on a child , " said 20 - year - old Menelaos Katrakis paying homage at the scene .
" The killing somehow sums up everything that is wrong with Greece today : repression , police brutality and fear . "
A judge has yet to approve the indictment against Mr Cheney A Texas grand jury has charged US Vice - President Dick Cheney for " organised criminal activity " related to alleged abuse of private prison inmates .
The indictment says Mr Cheney - who has invested $ 85 m ( £ 56 m ) in a company that holds shares in for - profit prisons - conspired to block an investigation .
The indictment has not been seen by a judge , who could dismiss it .
Mr Cheney 's spokeswoman declined to comment , saying his office had not yet received a copy of the charges .
One Texas lawyer said the charges were politically motivated .
' Conflict of interest '
The indictment was overseen by county District Attorney Juan Guerra , an outgoing prosecutor at the end of his term of office .
He cites the case of Gregorio De La Rosa , who died on 26 April , 2001 inside a private prison in Willacy County , Texas .
The grand jury in Willacy County , near the US - Mexico border , accuses Mr Cheney of committing " at least misdemeanour assaults " of inmates by allowing other inmates to assault them .
It said there was a " direct conflict of interest " because Mr Cheney had influence over federal contracts awarded to prison companies .
US grand juries weigh evidence to decide whether a case is worthy of being sent for a full trial , before issuing formal charges known as indictments .
The three - page indictment also alleges that former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales " used his position ... to stop the investigations as to the wrong doings . "
The grand jury wrote that it made its decision " with great sadness , " but said they had no other choice but to indict Mr Cheney and Mr Gonzales " because we love our country . "
Several other related indictments were brought against a host of public officials in what one lawyer called a circus act by the outgoing prosecutor , Mr Guerra , who he said was seeking revenge in his final weeks in office .

The Southern California housing market still shows significant signs of distress .
It is rather obvious that the Federal Reserve is going to do everything it can to weaken the dollar and try to strong - arm interest rates until they scream uncle .
During this same historic week that we are now in zero interest rate policy Ben Bernanke helicopter ( ZIRP ) world , another milestone occurred in Southern California .
The median price for an area with more than 20 million people has now breached the $ 300,000 mark .
This is significant because the peak of $ 505,000 was reached only last summer .
The market has deteriorated so quickly and with such devastation , it gives me pause to think what is going to happen when the $ 300 billion in pay option ARMS ( POA ) recast in 2009 through 2012 .
For many long time readers you know that my “ crash scenario ” meant prices falling 40 percent from their peak .
The median price for the region is now off by 43.6 percent .
Keep in mind that last month 55 percent of buyers exercised their bargain shopping right to purchase repossessed homes .
You have to take that into context when looking at the median price .
However , let us go through our monthly analysis of one of the most expensive and diverse housing regions in the country :
* Click for sharper image
This chart gives a very clear picture of what has occurred in Southern California .
You ’ll notice that most counties reached their peak in the summer of 2007 only to fall precipitously over the next year .
Southern California is a micro view of what has occurred in many metro areas across the country .
You have your prime locations in Laguna Beach , Santa Monica , and La Jolla that will remain resistant simply because of their locations .
Yet you have areas like the Inland Empire that have seen unrelenting price drops similar to those in Florida or Arizona .
Aside from the Southern California median price dropping below $ 300,000 we have our first county dropping below $ 200,000 since 2003 .
The median price for a home in San Bernardino is now $ 185,250 .
San Bernardino hit a peak of $ 380,000 in November of 2006 .
Guess what ?
We ’ve just had our first county drop by 50 percent from the peak .
Now there are many things pushing prices lower .
Market confidence is shattered and it does n’t help the public to hear that a Ponzi scheme run by Bernard Madoff has been going on for probably a decade and has put at risk nearly $ 50 billion .
That is n’t the boost in the arm we need right now .
First , to simply think that the housing market collapsed out of nowhere is a mistake .
Let us look at the sales pattern in conjunction with median price for Southern California over this decade :
The first warning sign we had came with the major pattern dislocation in the summer of 2006 .
The normally robust bounce in sales did not occur .
Yet prices kept going up for another year .
This is where the bubble stepped it up to another level .
This graph from a technical perspective gives you a better understanding why looking at price alone is not a good predictor of future trends .
What you ’ll also notice is the steady sales increase from January of 2008 .
Normally , winter is the weak selling season and you ’ll notice the seasonal dips in the chart followed by the healthier summer selling seasons .
Keep in mind that our recent ascent upwards was fueled by these strong price drops .
The recent sales increases should be taken in context .
If you look at the decade , we are still well under even the weakest winter trough from 2000 to summer of 2007 .
You ’ll also notice that last months sales are now reflecting the typical fall and winter weakness .
Some argue that the median price is a poor indicator .
Yet this is what the average family on the street is most likely in tune to .
It is also the average family that will be buying homes so yes , it is important .
It is fascinating that during the boom , those in the real estate industry kept championing robust median price numbers and now that the numbers do n’t suit their purpose , they choose to knock them down .
Okay , let us look at the Case - Shiller Index for the Los Angeles and Orange County area :
The Case - Shiller Index measures repeat sales on the same home .
So this is arguably a more accurate reflection .
The index does n’t give us a price per se but gives us an overall measure of price increase from a baseline point .
For example , the baseline year is 2000 and has a number of 100 .
At the peak , the LA / OC measure jumped to 273.94 .
That is nearly a tripling of price in less than a decade .
This measure is now converging with the median price .
How so ?
Let us look at the median price of a home in L.A .
December 1999 median price : $ 192,000
August 2007 median peak price : $ 550,000
550,000 / 192,000 = 2.86 times
Nuts .
The median price of Los Angeles is now $ 340,000 .
Let us run the numbers again :
December 1999 median price : $ 192,000
November 2008 median price : $ 340,000
340,000 / 192,000 = 1.77 times
What is the current Case - Shiller number ?
184.54 .
Keep in mind that the Case - Shiller Index looks at L.A. and Orange County .
The 184.54 number takes us back to where we were in February of 2004 .
The median price in Los Angeles county in August of 2003 was $ 338,000 .
The index and the median price are converging with a trend and are only separated by 6 months in Los Angeles .
Bottom line ?
You can choose to look at the Case - Shiller Index or the median price and the story remains the same .
Yet California is facing challenges beyond just the housing market .
Some people forget that you actually need good employment to buy a home .
They have become so laser focused on interest rates or monetary policy that they forgot one thing .
A large number of Californians were employed in the real estate industry !
I talked in great detail about the rise and the fall of the Southern California housing empire in a previous article .
We benefited the most from the housing bubble and are paying the price during the bust .
Have you noticed that the bailouts have gone into the black hole of crony capitalistic banking wonderland ?
Was n’t the main purpose of the bailout to keep the market from collapsing as it currently is ?
The truth of the matter is the bailout was never for you .
The bailout was to keep the world of the bankers and those on Wall Street from collapsing .
Even floor brokers now realize that they are n’t part of the private club as we have seen the many pictures of entry level workers walking out with their boxes from Lehman Brothers .
It is the Titanic and only a few lifeboats are available .
Who will get a piece of the bailout lifesaver ?
California is also in a budgetary mess .
While our politicians get paid to literally do nothing , our employment base is getting shattered to pieces :
It is stunning how little focus has gone into sustainable job growth .
Here we are , nearing the end of 2008 and having committed over $ 2.2 trillion and what can we say we have accomplished with all this ?
My main question is how can we as a public simply not care where this $ 2.2 trillion went ?
Think if we only dedicated half the time from the bread and circus theater of the auto industry to asking the Fed to open up their books .
$ 15 billion for the auto industry .
$ 2.2 trillion for the banking industry .
Hmmmm .
You know how many jobs that $ 2.2 trillion could have created ?
I ’m not for government meddling as long time readers know but I would rather have that $ 2.2 trillion go to rebuilding roads , schools , focusing on healthcare , and maybe getting our budget in order .
If it is a choice between banks , hedge funds , and our buddy Madoff I ’d rather see the money go to the average American taxpayer who is already being taken to task while watching the Fed and U.S. Treasury destroy their currency .
I still stand by my prediction that the bottom for California housing will not be reached until 2011 .
I know in our nano - second driven world , it is hard to imagine 2 or 3 more years of this .
But we only have 2 roads we will follow .
One road takes us down our current path .
Price destruction and massive market corrections to fix the misallocation of a bubble decade .
Otherwise known as deflation .
Or if the Fed and U.S. Treasury have their way hyper-inflation .
Their actions hope for a 1970s style inflation were they can prime things up and then get it under control .
Anyone that looks at data from that time realizes that bringing down high inflation is no easy task .
The Southern California housing market operates with all these multiple forces pulling at it .
Before you start looking at a bottom ask yourself the following questions :
(a) Is the employment situation good for the state ?
( b) Are wages increasing ?
( c) Is there a lack of inventory on the market ?
(d) Are prices going back up ?
I would answer no to all the above and if someone asked me whether Southern California has hit a bottom , my answer would be no .

WORCESTER , Mass. , Nov. 5 ( UPI ) --
A retired Massachusetts firefighter will receive $ 50,000 annually for 20 years after getting a winning ticket in the state lottery for a second time in a month .
Leo Dominie of Ware said he felt good when a $ 20 lottery ticket he purchased paid $ 1,000 , but his big surprise in October was a second winning ticket for $ 1 million , the Worcester Telegram & Gazette reported Wednesday .

Dominie , 72 , says he purchased the lottery ticket at a convenience store on a Friday night and started scratching it off as soon as he got back in the car where his wife was waiting .
" She said my face changed , and she could tell , " he said .
His wife started weeping when she saw how much the ticket was worth , Dominie said .
" My hands were literally shaking , " he said .
" My wife wanted to dig a hole under our mobile home to hide it . "
SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Australian wildlife rescuers on Sunday said they successfully returned a small number of pilot whales to the ocean after a mass stranding in Tasmania .
Chris Arthur , who coordinated the rescue effort , said 11 of the 64 animals found stranded on the island ’s north coast on Saturday were released after a day - long effort which involved relocating them by road to another beach .
Environmentalists said it was unusual to save any whales after such a mass stranding
“ We have successfully released 11 animals out to sea , ” Arthur told Reuters by telephone .
“ The last one went out less than 20 minutes ago . ”
While the possibility that the animals would strand themselves again could not be ruled out , he said , the hope was that they would instead join up with other pilot whales in the ocean .
Some the whales have been tagged and aerial reconnaissance is planned to check on their progress .
“ We have had a reasonable outcome .
They will form a small pod .
We have given them the best chance they have got , ” said Arthur , a regional officer with the Tasmanian state parks and wildlife service .
This maternal pod of 64 long - finned pilot whales , around one - third of them juveniles , were found stranded on Saturday along a stretch of Anthony ’s Beach at Stanley on the island ’s northwest coast , a site where repeated strandings have occurred in the past .
Pilot whales are among the smaller whales , typically up to about five meters in length and dark with a grey underbelly .
Their relatively small size may have helped rescuers save them , environmentalists said .
Although most of the pod could not be saved , a team of around 65 people battled throughout much of Sunday to move 12 survivors , including both adults and juveniles , 17 kilometers by road in trailers to nearby Godfrey ’s Beach to try to return them to the sea .
One whale died during the operation .
Mass strandings of whales occur periodically in Australia and New Zealand for reasons that are not entirely understood .
Theories include disturbance of echo- location , possibly by interference from sound produced by human activities at sea , a spokeswoman for the environmental group Greenpeace told Reuters .
In a statement , the state government said satellite trackers had been placed on some of the released whales and a reconnaissance plane would fly over the area on Monday to check on the whales ’ progress .
Samples are to be taken from the dead whales and a mass burial organized .
Although wildlife officials and volunteers have often tried to save stranded whales , relatively few attempts have been successful .
ほかのパソコンに偽の設定情報を送信、攻撃者のDNSサーバーを参照させる
PR
米国のセキュリティ企業や組織は2008年12月4日、新たなウイルス（悪質なプログラム）を確認したとして注意を呼びかけた。特徴はDHCPサーバー機能を持つこと。同じLANに存在する別のパソコンに、偽の設定情報を送信。攻撃者のDNSサーバーを参照させるようにして、フィッシング詐欺サイトなどへ誘導する。ウイルスに感染していないパソコンや脆弱（ぜいじゃく）性のないパソコンにも被害を与える点が脅威。
感染したパソコンの「 hostsファイルを改ざんする」「DNSサーバーの設定を変更して、攻撃者のDNSサーバーを参照させる」といった方法で、ユーザーを悪質なサイトへ誘導するウイルスは、今までに多数出現している。こういった手口は「ファーミング（ファーミング詐欺）」などとも呼ばれる。
この手口 の “ 巧みな ” ところは、正規 のURLを、悪質サイトのIPアドレスに関連付けること。これにより、Webブラウザーに正規のURLを入力しているにもかかわらず、フィッシング詐欺サイトなどに誘導されてしまう。
DNS サーバーの設定を変更するようなウイルスは「 DNSChanger」などと呼ばれ、ここ最近、相次いで出現。Windowsで動作するものだけではなく、Mac OSで動作するものも複数確認されている。
今回出現したウイルス も “ 原理的 ” には同じ。異なるのは、ウイルスに感染したパソコンではなく、同じネットワークに存在する非感染パソコンに被害を与える点。
今回のウイルスは、感染すると、そのパソコン上でDHCPサーバーを動作させるとともに、ネットワークを流れるデータを監視する。そして、別のパソコンが正規のDHCPサーバーに対して送信した問い合わせパケットを見つけると、その問い合わせに対して偽の応答を送信する。
偽の応答には、攻撃者のDNSサーバーを参照させるような設定情報が含まれる。このため、この応答を受け取ったパソコンは、攻撃者の意のままに、悪質サイトに誘導される恐れがある。
米サンズ・インスティチュートのスタッフは、ウイルスはまだ
“ 洗練 ” されていないものの、手口は “ 興味深い ” とコメント。前述のように、ウイルスに感染していないパソコンが被害に遭うため、原因を特定することが難しいという。
米マカフィーでは、今回のウイルスについては、公共の無線LAN環境などで被害に遭うシナリオが考えられるとコメント。1台の感染パソコンが、多数のパソコンに影響を与えるウイルスではあるが、現時点では広くは出回っていないようだとしている。

Auriea Harvey and Michaël Samyn are new media artists who have embraced realtime 3D game technology as their artistic medium of choice .
Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas .
It is much too important to be wasted on computer games alone .
This manifesto is a call - to - arms for creative people ( including , but not limited to , video game designers and fine artists ) to embrace this new medium and start realizing its enormous potential .
As well as a set of guidelines that express our own ideas and ideals about using the technology .
Realtime art manifesto
1. Realtime 3D is a medium for artistic expression .
Games are not the only things you can make with realtime 3D technology .
And modification of commercial games is not the only option accessible to artists .
Realtime 3D is the most remarkable new creative technology since oil on canvas .
It is much too important to remain in the hands of toy makers and propaganda machines .
We need to rip the technology out of their greedy claws and put them to shame by producing
the most stunning art to grace this planet so far .
( And claim the name “ game ” for what we do even if it is inappropriate . )
Real - time 3d interactives can be an art form unto themselves .
2 . Be an author .
Do not hide behind the freedom of the user in an interactive environment to ignore your responsibility as a creator .
This only ends in confirming cliches .
Do not design in board room meetings or give marketeers creative power .
Your work needs to come from a singular vision and be driven by a personal passion .
Do not delegate direction jobs .
Be a dictator .
But collaborate with artisans more skilled than you .
Ignore the critics and the fanboys .
Make work for your audience instead .
Embrace the ambiguity that the realtime medium excels in .
Leave interpretation open where appropriate
but keep the user focused and immersed the worlds that you create .
Commercial games are conservative , both in design as in mentality .
They eschew authorship , pretending to offer the player a neutral vessel to take him or her through the virtual world .
But the refusal to author results in a mimicking of generally accepted notions , of television and other mass media .
Banality .
Reject pure commercialism .
Individual elements of many commercial games made with craft and care produce artistic effects
but the overall product is not art .
Some commercial games have artistic moments ,
but we need to go further .
Step one : drop the requirement of making a game .
The game structure of rules and competition stands in the way of expressiveness .
Interactivity wants to be free .
Gaming stands in the way of playing .
There are so many other ways of interacting in virtual environments .
We have only just begun to discover the possibilities .
Games are games .
They are ancient forms of play that have their place in our societies .
But they are by far not the only things one can do with realtime technologies .
Stop making games .
Be an author .
3. Create a total experience .
Do not render !
All elements serve the realisation of the piece as a whole .
Models , textures , sound , interaction , environment , atmosphere ,
drama , story , programming
are all equally important .
Do not rely on static renderings .
Everything happens in real time .
The visuals as well as the logic .
Create multi-sensorial experiences .
Simulate sensorial sensations for which output hardware does not exist ( yet ) .
Make the experience feel real
( it does not need to look real ) .
Do not imitate other media but develop an aesthetic style that is unique .
Make the activity that the user spends most time doing the most interesting one in the game .
It ’s not about the individual elements but about the total effect of the environment .
The sum of its parts .
In the end the work is judged by the quality of authorship
and not by its individual elements .
Models , textures , sound , interaction design , environment design , atmosphere , drama , story , programming .
Together without hierarchy .
No element can be singled out .
All are equally important .
Create a simulated multi-sensorial experience .
Not only a picture .
Or only a game .
Or only a soundtrack .
4. Embed the user in the environment .
The user is not disembodied in virtual space
but takes the body into the experience .
The avatar is not a neutral vessel but allows the user to navigate
not only through the virtual space
but also through the narrative content .
Interaction is the link between the user and the piece .
Provide for references
( both conceptual and sensorial )
to connect the user to the environment .
Reject abstraction .
Make the user feel at home .
( and then play with his
or her
expectations
- just do n’t start with alienation ,
the real world is alienationg enough as it is )
Reject the body - mind duality .
The user is the center of the experience .
Think “ architecture ” , not “ film ” .
Interaction is pivotal
to “ put the user in the environment ” .
The user is not disembodied but is provided with a device
( similar to a diving suit or astronaut ’s outfit )
which allows him
or her
to visit a place that would otherwise not be accessible .
You bring your body with you to this place ,
or at least your memories of it .
Strictly speaking , our output media only allow for the reproduction of visuals and sound .
But real - time interaction and processing can help us to achieve simulation of touch , smell and taste as well , through visuals and sound .
In fact , force feedback already provides for a way to communicate with touch .
And the activity of fingers on the mouse or hands holding a joystick allows for physical communication .
Do n’t underestimate this connection .
From the USB port to the joystick .
Through the hand to the nervous system .
One network .
Soon as smell and taste can be reproduced , those media can quickly be incorporated into our technology .
The virtual place is not necessarily alien .
On the contrary :
It can deal with any subject .
References to the real world
( of nature as well as culture )
( both conceptual and sensorial )
create links between the environment and the user .
Since interaction is pivotal , these links are crucial .
Make it feel real , not necessarily look real .
Develop a unique language for the realtime 3D medium and do not fall in MacLuhan ’s trap
( do n’t allow any old medium to become the content of the new )
Imitate life and not photography , or drawings , or comic strips or even old - school games .
Realism does not equal photo - realism !
In a multisensory medium , realism is a multisensory experience :
It has to feel real .
5 . Reject dehumanisation : tell stories .
Stories ground people in culture ,
( and remove the alienation that causes aggression )
stimulate their imagination ,
( and therefore improve the capability to change )
teach them about themselves
and connect them with each other .
Stories are a vital element of society .
Embrace non-linearity .
Let go of the idea of plot .
Realtime is non-linear .
Tell the story through interaction .
Do not use in - game movies or other non-realtime devices to tell the story .
Do not create a “ drama manager ” : let go of plot !
Plot is not compatible with realtime .
Think “ poetry ” , not “ prose ” .
The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle recognized six elements in Drama .
PLOT
what happens in a play , the order of events ,
is only one of them .
Next to plot we have
THEME
or the main idea in the work
CHARACTER
or the personality or role played by an actor
DICTION
the choice and delivery of words
MUSIC / RHYTHM
the sound , rhythm and melody of what is being said
SPECTACLE
the visual elements of the work .
All of these can be useful in non-linear realtime experiences .
Except plot .
But the realtime medium offers additional elements that easily augment or replace plot .
INTERACTIVITY
the direct influence of the viewer on the work
IMMERSION
the presence of the viewer in the work
AN AUDIENCE OF ONE
every staging of the work is done for an audience of a single person in the privacy of his
or her
home .
These new elements add the viewer as an active participant to the experience .
This is not a reduction of the idea of story but an enrichment .
Realtime media allow us to tell stories that could not be told before .
Many of the mythical fantasies about art can now be made real .
Now we can step into paintings and become part of them .
Now sculptures can come alive and talk to us .
Now we walk onto the stage and take part in the action .
We can live the lives of romance characters .
Be the poet
or the muse .
Do not reject storytelling in realtime because it is not straightforward .
Realtime media allow us to make ambiguity and imagination active parts of the experience .
Embrace the ambiguity :
it is enriching .
The realtime medium allows for telling stories that cannot be told in any other language .
But realtime is not suitable for linear stories :
Embrace non-linearity !
Reject plot !
Realtime is a poetic technology .
Populate the virtual world with narrative elements that allow the player to make up his or her own story .
Imagination moves the story into the user ’s mind .
It allows the story to penetrate the surface and take its place amongst the user ’s thoughts & memories .
The bulk of your story should be told in realtime , through interaction .
Do not use in - game movies or other devices .
Do not fall back on a machine to create plot on the fly :
let go of plot ,
plot is not compatible with realtime .
Do not squeeze the realtime medium into a linear frame .
Stories in games are not impossible or irrelevant , even if “ all that matters is gameplay ” .
Humans need stories and will find stories in everything .
Use this to your advantage .
Yes , “ all that matters is gameplay ” ,
if you extend gameplay to mean all interaction in the game .
Because it is through this interaction that the realtime medium will tell its stories .
The situation is the story .
Choose your characters and environment carefully
so that the situation immediately triggers narrative associations in the mind of the user .
6. Interactivity wants to be free .
Do n’t make games .
The rule - based structure and competitive elements in traditional game design stand in the way of expressiveness .
And often , ironically , rules get in the way of playfulness
( playfulness is required for an artistic experience ! ) .
Express yourself through interactivity .
Interactivity is the one unique element of the realtime medium .
The one thing that no other medium can do better .
It should be at the center of your creation .
Interactivity design rule number one :
the thing you do most in the game , should be the thing that is most interesting to do .
i.e. ,
If it takes a long time to walk between puzzles , the walk should be more interesting than the puzzles .
7 . Do n’t make modern art .
Modern art tends to be ironical , cynical , self referential , afraid of beauty , afraid of meaning
- other than the trendy discourse of the day - ,
afraid of technology , anti-artistry .
Furthermore contemporary art is a marginal niche .
The audience is elsewhere .
Go to them rather then expecting them to come to the museum .
Contemporary art is a style , a genre , a format .
Think !
Do not fear beauty .
Do not fear pleasure .
Make art - games , not game - art .
Game art is just modern art
- ironical , cynical , afraid of beauty , afraid of meaning .
It abuses a technology that has already spawned an art form capable of communicating far beyond the reach of modern art .
Made by artists far superior in artistry and skills .
Game art is slave art .
Realtime media are craving your input , your visions .
Real people are starving for meaningful experiences .
And what ’s more :
society needs you .
Contemporary civilisations are declining at an unsurpassed rate .
Fundamentalism .
Fascism .
Populism .
War .
Pollution .
The world is collapsing while the Artists twiddle their thumbs in the museums .
Step into the world .
Into the private worlds of individuals .
Share your vision .
Connect .
Connect .
Communicate .
8. Reject conceptualism .
Make art for people ,
not for documentation .
Make art to experience
and not to read about .
Use the language of your medium to communicate all there is to know .
The user should never be required to read a description or a manual .
Do n’t parody things that are better than you .
Parodies of commercial games are ridiculous if their technology , craft and artistry do not match up with the original .
Do n’t settle yourself in the position of the underdog : surpass them !
Go over their heads !
Dominate them !
Show them how it ’s done !
Put the artistry back in Art .
Reject conceptualism .
Make art for people , not for documentation .
Make art to experience and not art to read about .
Use the language of your work to communicate its content .
The audience should never be required to read the description .
The work should communicate all that is required to understand it .
9. Embrace technology .
Do n’t be afraid of technology ,
and least of all , do n’t make art about this fear .
It ’s futile .
Technology is not nature .
Technology is not god .
It ’s a thing .
Made for people by people .
Grab it .
Use it .
Software is infinitely reproducible and easy to distribute .
Reject the notion of scarcity .
Embrace the abundance that the digital allows for .
The uniqueness of realtime is in the experience .
Cut out the middle man : deliver your productions directly to the users .
Do not depend on galleries , museums , festivals or publishers .
Technology - based art should not be about technology :
it should be about life , death and the human condition .
Embrace technology , make it yours !
Use machines to make art for humans , not vice versa .
Make software !
Software is infinitely reproducable
( there is no original ; uniqueness is not required
- the uniqueness is in the experience )
Distribution of software is easy through the internet or portable data containers
( no elitism ; no museums , galleries , or festivals ; from creator to audience without mediation - and from the audience back to the creator , through the same distribution media )
10 . Develop a punk economy .
Do n’t shy away from competition with commercial developers .
Your work offers something that theirs does not :
originality of design ,
depth of content ,
alternative aesthetics .
Do n’t worry about the polish too much .
Get the big picture right .
“ Reduce the volume , Increase the quality and density ”
( Fumito Ueda )
Make short and intense games :
think haiku , not epic .
Think poetry , not prose .
Embrace punk aesthetics .
But do n’t become too dependent on government or industry funding :
it is unreliable .
Sell your work directly to your audience .
And use alternative distribution methods that do not require enormous sales figures to break even .
Consider self - publishing and digital distribution .
Avoid retail and traditional games publishers .
Together they take so great a cut
that it requires you to sell hundreds of thousands of copies to make your production investment back .
Do not allow institutional or economic control of your intellectual property , ideas , technology and inventions .
Do n’t depend on government support or the arts world exclusively .
Sell your games !
Communicate with your audience directly :
cut out the middle man .
Let the audience support your work .
Communicate .

A day after President Bush was nearly struck in the head by flying footwear at a Baghdad news conference , U.S. Secret Service officials faced questions Monday about how an Iraqi television reporter was able to hurl not one but two shoes at the president without the agents responsible for protecting him being able to move into the line of fire .
Secret Service officials said they were reviewing the episode , including the procedures used by agents guarding Bush during his unannounced visit to Baghdad .
But officials said they believed the agents reacted appropriately in a situation where all those present in the room had already undergone intensive security screening .
Nonetheless , some security experts and former agents who reviewed tapes of the assault predicted that it would lead to minor changes to improve procedures for safeguarding the president .
“ They will probably make a decision to have more close - in agents , right around the president , ” said Ronald T. Williams , a former Secret Service agent .
“ They will make some adjustments , so if a shoe is thrown again , they can intercept it , or at least give the president cover . ”
Advertisement
Secret Service officials said their agents began moving as soon as the first shoe was thrown .
Ed Donovan , a spokesman for the agency , said the videos show agents quickly moving in from the sides of the room .
“ We think the response was appropriate , ” he said .
“ You can see agents reacting after the first shoe was thrown . ”
Everyone at the news conference , Donovan said , had already passed through several layers of security and had been searched multiple times .
But he added that the agency would nevertheless examine its performance .
“ We are our own harshest critics , ” he said .
“ This will be reviewed to see if there is anything we can do differently .
We always strive to make ourselves better as an agency . ”

Patrick J. Lennon , another former agent , said that after he saw the video , his impression was that the agents seemed to react more slowly than he would have expected .
“ I thought they would have responded after the first shoe , ” Lennon said .
The agents guarding Bush were not able to immediately get in front of him because they were positioned at the side of the room , not beside him , as they would be if he was working a rope line , Lennon said .
Luckily , he added , Bush moved quickly .
“ Thank God , Bush apparently played a little dodge ball when he was younger , ” said Lennon , who heads a security consulting firm in Rockville , Md. “ His reflexes are quick .
I was proud of him . ”

Joseph J. Funk , also a former agent , said that when he first watched a tape of the incident , he thought the agents should have reacted more quickly , at least fast enough to stop the second shoe .
But , as he studied the video further , he changed his mind .
“ In a perfect world , they would have been on the guy before he threw the first shoe , ” Funk said .
“ But after looking at the tapes , [ the throws ] were pretty quick , and they were one right after the other .
I doubt any security force or any law enforcement could have reacted in time to stop the second shoe . ”
After the second shoe was thrown , the agents tackled the assailant , shoving him to the ground .
Advertisement
Funk and other former agents praised the president ’s detail for not overreacting or shooting the shoe thrower .
Unless a hurled object has the potential to kill a president , agents will move to physically restrain the assailant rather than use deadly force , said Funk , whose Severna Park , Md. , firm , U.S. Safety & Security , helped provide protection to President - elect Barack Obama early in the campaign .
“ Given the fact you are in a crowded room , the collateral damage would have been extensive , ” Funk said .
The Baghdad incident also illustrates other Secret Service training protocols .
Tape of it shows how agents moved toward the president and other parts of the room as several tackled the Iraqi reporter , aided by other journalists and Iraqi security personnel .
Williams , who now runs Talon Executive Services in Fountain Valley , said agents are trained that a first attacker could stage a diversion by hurling something -- like a shoe -- creating a clear , lethal shot for a second attacker .

“ It is like playing zone defense , ” Williams said .
“ Not all agents are going to rush that guy .
Because they are trained to watch for diversion . ”
Iraqi reporters attending the news conference were searched at least three times before entering , and their credentials had been screened .
Both White House and Iraqi officials believe having bodyguards hovering around the president would have sent the wrong message .
“ It would give the appearance that things are the same as Saddam ’s reign , ” Funk said .
Former agents acknowledged that it was nonetheless embarrassing for the agency that the reporter was able to throw two shoes at Bush .
But they noted that ultimately there was no real threat .
Advertisement
“ Would the service view this as embarrassing ?
Yes .
Will they take steps in the future ?
Probably .
But these kind of things do happen , ” Williams said .
“ If he came in and was able to secret a weapon -- then we have a real , real problem , ” he said .

Maybe he should have sung “ 99 Bottles of Beer . ”
A never publicly heard outtake recording of a very intoxicated John Lennon singing a debauched version of Lloyd Price ’s “ Just Because ” in 1973 is hitting the auction block today in Los Angeles .
Estimated to bring in $ 30,000 to $ 40,000 , the six - minute - long recording dates to the period when Lennon separated from Yoko Ono for a time to live with May Pang – a period he later referred to as his “ Lost Weekend , ” according to auction house Bonham’s .
The session was recorded in LA , where Lennon had gone to work on a record with producer Phil Spector .
The tape begins with a slurring Lennon , warbling : “ I wanna take all them new singers , Carol and the other one with the nipples , I wanna take ’em and hold ’em tight , all them people that James Taylor had . . .
I wanna suck your nipples , baby ! ”
He later murmurs , “ Just a little cocaine will set me right . ”
The backing band speeds up and slows down to try to keep up with Lennon , but a male voice is then heard calling the session to a close .
The Spector session later fizzled because of Lennon ’s drunken behavior .
“ Although Lennon is intoxicated , because it ’s John Lennon singing , it still sounds decent , ” reads the description in Bonham ’s auction catalogue .
Lennon ’s “ Lost Weekend ” lasted for a year and a half .
He and Ono reconciled and got back together in early 1975 .
Nine months later , they had a son , Sean .
Lennon later re-recorded “ Just Because ” and released it on his 1975 album , “ Rock ‘ n ’ Roll . ”
Several other Lennon items are up for auction , including a “ War is over ! ” banner and an animation cel from “ Yellow Submarine . ”

And they did n’t stop there .
Nearly half also thought that atheists could go to heaven  dragged there kicking and screaming , no doubt  and most thought that people with no religious faith also could go .
What on earth does this mean ?
One very plausible explanation is that Americans just want good things to come to good people , regardless of their faith .
As Alan Segal , a professor of religion at Barnard College told me : “ We are a multicultural society , and people expect this American life to continue the same way in heaven . ”
He explained that in our society , we meet so many good people of different faiths that it ’s hard for us to imagine God letting them go to hell .
In fact , in the most recent survey , Pew asked people what they thought determined whether a person would achieve eternal life .
Nearly as many Christians said you could achieve eternal life by just being a good person as said that you had to believe in Jesus .
Also , many Christians apparently view their didactic text as flexible .
According to Pew ’s August survey , only 39 percent of Christians believe that the Bible is the literal word of God , and 18 percent think that it ’s just a book written by men and not the word of God at all .
In fact , on the question in the Pew survey about what it would take to achieve eternal life , only 1 percent of Christians said living life in accordance with the Bible .
Now , there remains the possibility that some of those polled may not have understood the implications of their answers .
As John Green , a senior fellow at the Pew Forum , said , “ The capacity of ignorance to influence survey outcomes should never be underestimated . ”
But I do n’t think that they are ignorant about this most basic tenet of their faith .
I think that they are choosing to ignore it ... for goodness sake .
It only took a 100 years or so , but the world is finally getting a piece of Mark Twain 's mind on the subject of free expression and whether it 's safer for your words to be expressed after you 're dead .
" We have charity for what the dead say .
We may disapprove of what they say , but we do not insult them , we do not revile them , as knowing they can not now defend themselves .
If they should speak , what revelations there would be ! "
Twain observed in " The Privilege of the Grave , " an essay written in 1905 , and long unpublished , that will appear in the issue of The New Yorker that comes out Monday .
" Now there is hardly one of us but would dearly like to reveal these secrets of ours ; we know we cannot do it in life , then why not do it from the grave , and have the satisfaction of it ? "
The essay is part of the Mark Twain archive at the University of California - Berkeley .
Please remember that this is an archive of an older website for researchers , and it is not being updated .
Therefore , much of the material here is not current .
Much like any library archive , it is " out - of - date . "
Brick and mortar libraries do not toss out older resource materials , they archive them .
That is what we have done here .
Christian Reconstructionism March / June 1994 Theocratic Dominionism Gains Influence by Frederick Clarkson Part 1 Overview and Roots The Christian Right has shown impressive resilience and has rebounded dramatically after a series of embarrassing televangelist scandals of the late 1980s , the collapse of Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority , and the failed presidential bid of Pat Robertson .
In the 1990s , Christian Right organizing went to the grassroots and exerted wide influence in American politics across the country .
The Christian Right has shown impressive resilience and has rebounded dramatically after a series of embarrassing televangelist scandals of the late 1980s , the collapse of Jerry Falwell 's Moral Majority , and the failed presidential bid of Pat Robertson .
In the 1990s , Christian Right organizing went to the grassroots and exerted wide influence in American politics across the country .
There is no doubt that Pat Robertson 's Christian Coalition gets much of the credit for this successful strategic shift to the local level .
But another largely overlooked reason for the persistent success of the Christian Right is a theological shift since the 1960s .
The catalyst for the shift is Christian Reconstructionism -- arguably the driving ideology of the Christian Right in the 1990s .
The significance of the Reconstructionist movement is not its numbers , but the power of its ideas and their surprisingly rapid acceptance .
Many on the Christian Right are unaware that they hold Reconstructionist ideas .
Because as a theology it is controversial , even among evangelicals , many who are consciously influenced by it avoid the label .
This furtiveness is not , however , as significant as the potency of the ideology itself .
Generally , Reconstructionism seeks to replace democracy with a theocratic elite that would govern by imposing their interpretation of " Biblical Law . "
Reconstructionism would eliminate not only democracy but many of its manifestations , such as labor unions , civil rights laws , and public schools .
Women would be generally relegated to hearth and home .
Insufficiently Christian men would be denied citizenship , perhaps executed .
So severe is this theocracy that it would extend capital punishment beyond such crimes as kidnapping , rape , and murder to include , among other things , blasphemy , heresy , adultery , and homosexuality .
Reconstructionism has expanded from the works of a small group of scholars to inform a wide swath of conservative Christian thought and action .
While many Reconstructionist political positions are commonly held conservative views , what is significant is that Reconstructionists have created a comprehensive program , with Biblical justifications for far right political policies .
Many post -World War II conservative , anticommunist activists were also , if secondarily , conservative Christians .
However , the Reconstructionist movement calls on conservatives to be Christians first , and to build a church - based political movement from there .
For much of Reconstructionism 's short history it has been an ideology in search of a constituency .
But its influence has grown far beyond the founders ' expectations .
As Reconstructionist author Gary North observes , " We once were shepherds without sheep .
No longer . "
What is Reconstructionism ?
Reconstructionism is a theology that arose out of conservative Presbyterianism ( Reformed and Orthodox ) , which proposes that contemporary application of the laws of Old Testament Israel , or " Biblical Law , " is the basis for reconstructing society toward the Kingdom of God on earth .
Reconstructionism is a theology that arose out of conservative Presbyterianism ( Reformed and Orthodox ) , which proposes that contemporary application of the laws of Old Testament Israel , or " Biblical Law , " is the basis for reconstructing society toward the Kingdom of God on earth .
Reconstructionism argues that the Bible is to be the governing text for all areas of life -- such as government , education , law , and the arts , not merely " social " or " moral " issues like pornography , homosexuality , and abortion .
Reconstructionists have formulated a " Biblical world view " and " Biblical principles " by which to examine contemporary matters .
Reconstructionist theologian David Chilton succinctly describes this view : " The Christian goal for the world is the universal development of Biblical theocratic republics , in which every area of life is redeemed and placed under the Lordship of Jesus Christ and the rule of God 's law . "
More broadly , Reconstructionists believe that there are three main areas of governance : family government , church government , and civil government .
Under God 's covenant , the nuclear family is the basic unit .
The husband is the head of the family , and wife and children are " in submission " to him .
In turn , the husband " submits " to Jesus and to God 's laws as detailed in the Old Testament .
The church has its own ecclesiastical structure and governance .
Civil government exists to implement God 's laws .
All three institutions are under Biblical Law , the implementation of which is called " theonomy . "
The Origin of Reconstructionism
The original and defining text of Reconstructionism is Institutes of Biblical Law , published in 1973 by Rousas John Rushdoony -- an 800 - page explanation of the Ten Commandments , the Biblical " case law " that derives from them , and their application today .
" The only true order , " writes Rushdoony , " is founded on Biblical Law .
The original and defining text of Reconstructionism is Institutes of Biblical Law , published in 1973 by Rousas John Rushdoony -- an 800 - page explanation of the Ten Commandments , the Biblical " case law " that derives from them , and their application today .
" The only true order , " writes Rushdoony , " is founded on Biblical Law .
All law is religious in nature , and every non-Biblical law - order represents an anti-Christian religion . "
In brief , he continues , " Every law - order is a state of war against the enemies of that order , and all law is a form of warfare . "
Gary North , Rushdoony 's son- in - law , wrote an appendix to Institutes on the subject of " Christian economics . "
It is a polemic which serves as a model for the application of " Biblical Principles . "
Rushdoony and a younger theologian , Rev. Greg Bahnsen , were both students of Cornelius Van Til , a Princeton University theologian .
Although Van Til himself never became a Reconstructionist , Reconstructionists claim him as the father of their movement .
According to Gary North , Van Til argued that " There is no philosophical strategy that has ever worked , except this one ; to challenge the lost in terms of the revelation of God in His Bible .
. . by what standard can man know anything truly ?
By the Bible , and only by the Bible . "
This idea that the correct and only way to view reality is through the lens of a Biblical world view is known as presuppositionalism .
According to Gary North , Van Til stopped short of proposing what a Biblical society might look like or how to get there .
That is where Reconstructionism begins .
While Van Til states that man is not autonomous and that all rationality is inseparable from faith in God and the Bible , the Reconstructionists go further and set a course of world conquest or " dominion , " claiming a Biblically prophesied " inevitable victory . "
Reconstructionists also believe that " the Christians " are the " new chosen people of God , " commanded to do what " Adam in Eden and Israel in Canaan failed to do .
. . create the society that God requires . "
Further , Jews , once the " chosen people , " failed to live up to God 's covenant and therefore are no longer God 's chosen .
Christians , of the correct sort , now are .
Rushdoony 's Institutes of Biblical Law consciously echoes a major work of the Protestant Reformation , John Calvin 's Institutes of the Christian Religion .
In fact , Reconstructionists see themselves as the theological and political heirs of Calvin .
The theocracy Calvin created in Geneva , Switzerland in the 1500s is one of the political models Reconstructionists look to , along with Old Testament Israel and the Calvinist Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony .
Capital Punishment Epitomizing the Reconstructionist idea of Biblical " warfare " is the centrality of capital punishment under Biblical Law .
Doctrinal leaders ( notably Rushdoony , North , and Bahnsen ) call for the death penalty for a wide range of crimes in addition to such contemporary capital crimes as rape , kidnapping , and murder .
Death is also the punishment for apostasy ( abandonment of the faith ) , heresy , blasphemy , witchcraft , astrology , adultery , " sodomy or homosexuality , " incest , striking a parent , incorrigible juvenile delinquency , and , in the case of women , " unchastity before marriage . "

According to Gary North , women who have abortions should be publicly executed , " along with those who advised them to abort their children . "
Rushdoony concludes : " God 's government prevails , and His alternatives are clear - cut : either men and nations obey His laws , or God invokes the death penalty against them . "
Reconstructionists insist that " the death penalty is the maximum , not necessarily the mandatory penalty . "
However , such judgments may depend less on Biblical Principles than on which faction gains power in the theocratic republic .
The potential for bloodthirsty episodes on the order of the Salem witchcraft trials or the Spanish Inquisition is inadvertently revealed by Reconstructionist theologian Rev. Ray Sutton , who claims that the Reconstructed Biblical theocracies would be " happy " places , to which people would flock because " capital punishment is one of the best evangelistic tools of a society . "
The Biblically approved methods of execution include burning ( at the stake for example ) , stoning , hanging , and " the sword . "
Gary North , the self - described economist of Reconstructionism , prefers stoning because , among other things , stones are cheap , plentiful , and convenient .
Punishments for non-capital crimes generally involve whipping , restitution in the form of indentured servitude , or slavery .
Prisons would likely be only temporary holding tanks , prior to imposition of the actual sentence .
People who sympathize with Reconstructionism often flee the label because of the severe and unpopular nature of such views .
Even those who feel it appropriate that they would be the governors of God 's theocracy often waffle on the particulars , like capital punishment for sinners and nonbelievers .
Unflinching advocates , however , insist upon consistency .
Rev. Greg Bahnsen , in his book By This Standard , writes : " We. . .endorse the justice of God 's penal code , if the Bible is to be the foundation of our Christian political ethic . "
Reconstructionism has adopted " covenantalism , " the theological doctrine that Biblical " covenants " exist between God and man , God and nations , God and families , and that they make up the binding , incorporating doctrine that makes sense of everything .
Specifically , there is a series of covenant " structures " that make up a Biblical blueprint for society 's institutions .
Reconstructionists believe that God " judges " a whole society according to how it keeps these covenantal laws , and provides signs of that judgment .
This belief can be seen , for example , in the claim that AIDS is a " sign of God 's judgment . "
Reconstructionist Rev. Ray Sutton writes that " there is no such thing as a natural disaster .
Nature is not neutral .
Nothing takes place in nature by chance .
. . Although we may not know the exact sin being judged , " Sutton declares , " what occurs results from God . "
Christian Historical Revisionism
Part of the Reconstructionist world view is a revisionist view of history called " Christian history , " which holds that history is predestined from " creation " until the inevitable arrival of the Kingdom of God.
Christian history is written by means of retroactively discerning " God 's providence . "
Part of the Reconstructionist world view is a revisionist view of history called " Christian history , " which holds that history is predestined from " creation " until the inevitable arrival of the Kingdom of God.
Christian history is written by means of retroactively discerning " God 's providence . "
Most Reconstructionists , for example , argue that the United States is a " Christian Nation " and that they are the champions and heirs of the " original intentions of the Founding Fathers . "
This dual justification for their views , one religious , the other somehow constitutional , is the result of a form of historical revisionism that Rushdoony frankly calls " Christian revisionism . "
Christian revisionism is important in understanding the Christian Right 's approach to politics and public policy .
If one 's political righteousness and sense of historical continuity are articles of faith , what appear as facts to everyone else fall before the compelling evidence of faith .
Whatever does not fit neatly into a " Biblical world view " becomes problematic , perhaps a delusion sent by Satan .
The invocations of the Bible and the Founding Fathers are powerful ingredients for good religious - nationalist demagoguery .
However , among the stark flaws of Reconstructionist history is the way Christian revisionism distorts historical fact .
For example , by interpreting the framing of the Constitution as if it were a document inspired by and adhering to a Reconstructionist version of Biblical Christianity , Reconstructionists make a claim that denies the existence of Article VI of the Constitution .
Most historians agree that Article VI , which states that public officials shall be " bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution ; but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States , " was a move toward disestablishment of churches as official power brokers and the establishment of the principles of religious pluralism and separation of church and state .
R. J. Rushdoony , in his influential 1963 book , The Nature of the American System , claims that " The Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order , " then asks rhetorically : " Why then is there , in the main , an absence of any reference to Christianity in the Constitution ? "
He argues that the purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve " states ' rights . "
Once again , however , such a view requires ignoring Article VI .
Before 1787 , most of the colonies and early states had required pledges of allegiance to Christianity and that one be a Christian of the correct sect to hold office .
Part of the struggle toward democracy at the time was the disestablishment of the state churches -- the power structures of the local colonial theocracies .
Thus the " religious test " was a significant philosophical matter .
There was little debate over Article VI , which passed unanimously at the Constitutional Convention .
Most of the states soon followed the federal lead in conforming to it .
Reconstructionist author Gary DeMar , in his 1993 book America 's Christian History : The Untold Story , also trips over Article VI .
He quotes from colonial and state constitutions to prove they were " Christian " states .
And , of course , they generally were , until the framers of the Constitution set disestablishment irrevocably in motion .
Yet DeMar tries to explain this away , claiming that Article VI merely banned " government mandated religious tests " -- as if there were any other kind at issue .
He later asserts that Article VI was a " mistake " on the part of the framers , implying that they did not intend disestablishment .
By contrast , mainstream historian Garry Wills sees no mistake .
In his book Under God : Religion and American Politics , he concludes that the framers stitched together ideas from " constitutional monarchies , ancient republics , and modern leagues .
. . . but we [ the US ] invented nothing , except disestablishment .
. . .
No other government in the history of the world had launched itself without the help of officially recognized gods and their state connected ministers . "
Disestablishment was the clear and unambiguous choice of the framers of the Constitution , most of whom were also serious Christians .
Even Gary North ( who holds a Ph.D. in History ) sees the connection between Article VI and disestablishment and attacks Rushdoony 's version of the " Christian " Constitution .
North writes that " In his desire to make the case for Christian America , he [ Rushdoony ] closed his eyes to the judicial break from Christian America : the ratification of the Constitution . "
North says Rushdoony " pretends " that Article VI " does not say what it says , and it does not mean what it has always meant : a legal barrier to Christian theocracy , " leading " directly to the rise of religious pluralism . "
North 's views are the exception on the Christian Right .
The falsely nostalgic view of a Christian Constitution , somehow subverted by modernism and the Supreme Court , generally holds sway .
Christian historical revisionism is the premise of much Christian Right political and historical literature and is being widely taught and accepted in Christian schools and home schools .
It informs the political understanding of the broader Christian Right .
The popularization of this perspective is a dangerously polarizing factor in contemporary politics .
A Movement of Ideas
As a movement primarily of ideas , Reconstructionism has no single denominational or institutional home .
Nor is it totally defined by a single charismatic leader , nor even a single text .
Rather , it is defined by a small group of scholars who are identified with Reformed or Orthodox Presbyterianism .
The movement networks primarily through magazines , conferences , publishing houses , think tanks , and bookstores .
As a matter of strategy , it is a self - consciously decentralized and publicity - shy movement .

Reconstructionist leaders seem to have two consistent characteristics : a background in conservative Presbyterianism , and connections to the John Birch Society ( JBS ) .
In 1973 , R. J. Rushdoony compared the structure of the JBS to the " early church . "
He wrote in Institutes : " The key to the John Birch Society 's effectiveness has been a plan of operation which has a strong resemblance to the early church ; have meetings , local `lay ' leaders , area supervisors or `bishops . ' "
The JBS connection does not stop there .
Most leading Reconstructionists have either been JBS members or have close ties to the organization .
Reconstructionist literature can be found in JBS - affiliated American Opinion bookstores .
Indeed , the conspiracist views of Reconstructionist writers ( focusing on the United Nations and the Council on Foreign Relations , among others ) are consistent with those of the John Birch Society .
A classic statement of the JBS world view , Call It Conspiracy by Larry Abraham , features a prologue and an epilogue by Reconstructionist Gary North .
In fact , former JBS chairman Larry McDonald may himself have been a Reconstructionist .
Joseph Morecraft has written that " Larry [ McDonald ] understood that when the authors of the US Constitution spoke of law , they meant the law of God as revealed in the Bible .
I have heard him say many times that we must refute humanistic , relativistic law with Biblical Law . "
As opposed to JBS beliefs , however , Reconstructionists emphasize the primacy of Christianity over politics .
Gary North , for example , insists that it is the institution of the Church itself to which loyalty and energy are owed , before any other arena of life .
Christians are called to Christianity first and foremost , and Christianization should extend to all areas of life .
This emphasis on Christianity has political implications because , in the 1990s , it is likely that the JBS world view is persuasive to more people when packaged as a Biblical world view .

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has described comments made by the Czech Republic 's President after a meeting with Libertas Leader Declan Ganley as inappropriate .
On the second day of his visit to Ireland , Mr Klaus claimed the Lisbon Treaty would not enhance freedom and democracy and said he supported Mr Ganley , an anti-Lisbon campaigner .
Speaking on RTÉ Morning Ireland , Micheál Martin said every welcome had been extended to Václav Klaus , who is on a state visit to Ireland .
He said there was a private dimension to every state visit , but the very clear political comments made by Mr Klaus at a news conference were an inappropriate intervention .
The Minister said the Government knew in advance that Mr Klaus had controversial views about a number of issues .
Fine Gael has urged Mr Martin to register a complaint with his Czech counterpart over the remarks .
While Mr Klaus denied he was breaching the protocol of a state visit by speaking out on the issue , Fine Gael Foreign Affairs spokesperson Billy Timmins criticised what he described as inappropriate behaviour .
In a statement last night , Mr Timmins said the Czech President has created a very definite perception that he strongly sympathises with groupings and individuals who are opposed to Government policy .
Mr Timmins said he believed the actions of Mr Klaus in meeting in a very public fashion people who have opposed , not only the Lisbon Treaty , but every Government initiative on Europe , may well be a breach of long - established protocol .
These days , the archetypes of good and evil in our society are Mother Teresa and Hitler , respectively .
If you start with these two as the paradigms , it becomes pretty easy to figure out what “ Good ” and Evil ” are really all about .
I admit that I have never met Adolf Hitler .
Fortunately for this blog post , however , I have met Mother Teresa .
It was in Toronto , Canada back in ’ 84 .
She was giving a speech at Shea Stadium and I ( being the ‘ good Catholic boy destined for priesthood ’ ) was brought to Toronto to be introduced to a living saint .
The woman was a bitch to me .
I shook her hand and she sneered .
I said a few words — basic niceties of some sort — and she just glowered at me .
After about three seconds , she turned to the security people with her and said “ Get rid of him . ”
They did .
I suspect I would have done better meeting Hitler .
Years later , I learned that Mother Teresa had a disdain for males .
This information came to me as I read about the series of accusations leveled against Mother Teresa shortly before her death .
It seems that many in India thought she was misappropriating the funds she had raised , using them to build more convents instead of feeding the poor .
She explained that this was her answer to the cruelty of the streets of Calcutta :
The more girls there were in convents , the better things were on the streets .
The problem , of course , was that this policy prevented males , married couples , and any girl who did not want to be a nun from getting food or help .
Many were pissed about it , and sought to have her relieved of her duties .
The Church and the media basically rode out the accusations until she died , and whitewashed it all with a canonization .
Now , this does n’t make her “ evil ” or anything , but it does show some normal , human fuckedupedness in this icon of ultra “ Good ” .
[ I can just hear people out there thinking “ He ’s not going to try to defend Hitler now , is he ? ” ]
Hitler was responsible for killing lots of Jews , and starting a World War .
This makes it a tad hard to portray the man as “ good ” .
However , I ’ve always been of the opinion that Hitler was really just a man of his times .
Hear me out here …
Long before WWII , there were pogroms throughout Europe .
( POGRAMS were mass killings , usually of Jews .
See the WIKI . )
The genocide of WWII was basically just another pogrom .
This is why Hitler ’s plan was called ‘ The Final Solution ’ … other extermination plans had been tried before and failed .
The Nazis reasoned that only a large , coordinated pogrom could achieve the genocide they wanted .
It was the ‘ final solution ’ in a series of attempts , not the stand - alone event that many see it as today .
Here ’s bit of little - known Hitler history for you :
In 1939 , before his extermination of Jews began , 937 Jews got onto a boat ( the S.S. St. Louis ) and tried emigrate to anywhere that would accept them .
These Jews , having a good idea of what returning to Europ meant , traveled to every port of call they could find , asking for refugee status .
None of the allied countries ( who were supposedly appalled by Hitler ’s Final Solution ) would accept a single Jew into their country .
Every one of the 937 Jews on that boat were forced to return to Europe to face the concentration camps .
Follow this forward : During the war , German troops were stretched thin , the supplies were dwindling , and Germany still had hundreds of thousands of Jews in concentration camps that no other country would take off their hands .
The Nazis could n’t feed their own men , and they certainly could n’t feed the hated Jews in the camps .
This is why the corpses of the dead were found so malnourished …
Hitler was unwilling to “ waste ” resources on the concentration camps when his own soldiers were starving in the field .
When it came down to it , a prisoner in the camps had to show that they could contribute to the war effort , or they were killed .
The Nazi ’s only other option was to keep them alive , but starving .
Is this evil incarnate ?
As I said , I ’ve always seen Hitler as a man of his times .
These Jews could easily have been granted refugee status in any of dozens of countries , but were rejected .
Still , when it was all over and the cameras moved into the death camps , the rest of the world was able to relieve their guilt by elevating the evil of Hitler .
He was the madman .
He hated and killed them all .
He was the very essence of EVIL .
We , of course , were the good guys .
We “ saved the Jews ” .
( Except for the millions who could have emigrated to the USA in 1939 but were flatly rejected . )
The point of all this is simple : Good and Evil are just monikers .
Every icon has a story behind it .
More often than not , the elevated status of saints and demons are created to make us feel the way we want to feel .
Mother Teresa is good and holy because she takes our $ 10.00 donation and makes us feel better about poor starving children in India .
Hitler is ultimate evil because he exonerates our own guilt .
In Hitler ’s case , his designation even allowed us to feel superior and heroic .
There is no ultimate evil in the world , any more than there is ultimate good .
They ’re just words we use to get over our own guilt , or to make ourselves look good .
People are people , some more fucked up than others , but all of us fall within that five percent deviation from the norm .
Beware anyone who tells you different .

WASHINGTON 
The possibility of a victory by Senator Barack Obama combined with significant Congressional gains by his party could give Democrats extraordinary muscle to pursue an ambitious agenda on health care , taxes , union rights , energy and national security .
Democrats , who are within reach of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster in the Senate , would also face high expectations , especially from the party ’s more liberal quarters , that could be difficult to meet even with enhanced numbers in the Senate as well as the House .
And they would be at risk of overreaching , a tendency that has deeply damaged both parties in similar situations in the past .
But given the opportunity and the magnitude of the problems facing the country , Democrats said they would welcome the chance  and the potential accountability  even though winning the White House is no assurance that their initiatives would sail through Congress .
And all of the issues on their agenda may be overshadowed by the need for urgent action on the deepening financial crisis .
“ I think we are in enough trouble in enough areas , ” said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , “ that I would rather own it and then have to perform than continue with this back and forth , back and forth with Republicans , particularly while they are engaged in this absolute determined policy of obstruct , obstruct , obstruct . ”

Brutal Legend is Double Fine 's long - awaited follow - up to Psychonauts from the mind of Tim Schafer .
It is a heavy metal action game starring Jack Black who plays rock - and - roll roadie Eddie Riggs who is hurled back in time to the mythical Age of Metal when the world was formed and ruled by the power of Rock .
Barely three weeks since America elected its first black president , noose hangings , racist graffiti and death threats have struck dozens of towns across the country .
More than 200 such incidents -- including cross burnings , assassination betting pools and effigies of President - elect Barack Obama -- have been reported , according to law enforcement authorities and the Southern Poverty Law Center , which monitors hate groups .
Racist websites have been boasting that their servers have been crashing because of an exponential increase in traffic .
And America ’s most potent symbol of racial hatred , the Ku Klux Klan , is reasserting itself in a spate of recent violence , after decades of disorganization and obscurity .

Nearly two weeks ago , the leader of a cell based in Bogalusa , La. -- a backwoods town once known as the Klan capital -- was charged with second - degree murder in the shooting of a woman who allegedly sought to become a member but then changed her mind .
Late last month , two men with ties to a notoriously violent Klan chapter in Kentucky were charged in a bizarre plot to kill 88 black students and then decapitate an additional 14 students -- and then assassinate Obama by shooting him from a speeding car while wearing white tuxedos and top hats .
“ We ’ve seen everything from cross burnings on lawns of interracial couples to effigies of Obama hanging from nooses to unpleasant exchanges in schoolyards , ” said Mark Potok , director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center , based in Montgomery , Ala .
“ I think we ’re in a worrying situation right now , a perfect storm of conditions coming together that could easily favor the continued growth of these groups . ”
Experts attribute the racist activity to factors including the rapidly worsening economic crisis ; trends indicating that within a generation whites will not comprise a U.S. majority ; and the impending arrival of a black family in the White House .

The FBI is investigating whether the recent Klan - related incidents involve conspiracies .
And the Secret Service is monitoring the racist activity “ to try to stay ahead of any emerging threats , ” according to spokesman Darrin Blackford .
One white supremacist leader , describing himself as moderate , professes alarm .
“ There is a tremendous backlash ” to Obama ’s election , said Richard Barrett , the leader of the Nationalist Movement in Learned , Miss .
“ My focus is to try to keep it peaceful .
But many people look at the flag of the Republic of New Africa that will be hoisted over the White House as an act of war . ”
The FBI has no hate - crime statistics yet for 2008 .

But based on local media reports , some experts are calling the rise in hate incidents surprising and unprecedented .
“ The rhetoric right now is just about out of control , ” said Brian Levin , director of Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino .
“ When you get this depth of hatred , it usually is the smoke before the fire . ”
In the small Louisiana town of Angie , 58 - year - old Judy Robinson put an Obama sign outside her home a few weeks before the Nov. 4 presidential election .
The morning after Halloween , she awoke to find the words “ KKK ” and “ white power ” spray - painted around her yard .
“ I thought all that KKK stuff was in the past , ” said Robinson , who is black .
“ But now I look at people and think , ‘ Could he be Klan ? ’
Suddenly I ’m feeling like my town is hostile territory . ”

Experts say modern Klan chapters remain isolated and small , with perhaps 6,000 members nationwide -- a shadow of the group ’s membership of 4 million in the early 1900s .
Bogalusa , a lumber and paper mill town of about 13,000 , is just down the road from Angie .
In the 1960s , historians say , the Ku Klux Klan so dominated Bogalusa ’s commerce , politics and law enforcement that the group once held a public meeting to debate which black church to burn down next .
Several Bogalusa Klan members were long suspected of shooting two black sheriff ’s deputies in a 1965 ambush , killing one .
No one was ever brought to trial .
Advertisement
“ To this day , most white people in Bogalusa know who the killers were , and they were never brought to justice , ” said Lance Hill , a Tulane University law professor and Klan expert .
That past now seems less distant .
On Nov. 10 , local law enforcement authorities arrested Raymond “ Chuck ” Foster , 44 , the leader of a Bogalusa Klan chapter called the Sons of Dixie , and seven other Klan members in connection with the shooting death of a Tulsa , Okla . , woman who went to the group ’s remote campsite in St. Tammany Parish for an initiation ceremony .
Authorities say Foster shot the woman when she tried to change her mind about joining the group .
He has been charged with second - degree murder ; the other Klan members , including Foster ’s 20 - year - old son , have been charged with obstruction of justice .

City officials say they had no idea that Bogalusa has Klan cells .
“ I ’ve been here 13 years , and this was a complete surprise to me that there was Klan here , ” said Police Chief Jerry Agnew .
Yet members of the town ’s black community say they have been reporting Klan sightings to the police for more than a year .
About 40 % of residents are black .
In October 2007 , residents of one black neighborhood reported white - hooded Klan members riding horses through the streets .
Advertisement
And in March , Klan members openly handed out fliers advertising the second annual Sons of Dixie Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Craw Fish Boil -- held at the house on Louisiana Avenue that Foster was renting from a Bogalusa deputy sheriff .
“ The city leaders want to make it look like this is just some small fringe group , ” said former City Councilman Marvin Austin , 61 , who once belonged to the Deacons for Defense , a black group that formed in the 1960s to defend black residents from the Klan .
“ But the Klan still has a lot of sympathizers here . ”

NBC News projects Obama clinch
NBC News , which keeps the most widely followed of the media 's Electoral College estimates , on Friday night said it is moving the closely watched battlegrounds of Virginia and Colorado to “ lean Obama , ” putting its estimate for the Democratic nominee over the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency .
President Bush won each of those states by 5 points or more in both 2000 and 2004 .

Before the move , NBC ’s count had Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) at 264 electoral votes , to 163 for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , with 111 as tossups .
“ We ’re going to be , this weekend , moving Virginia and Colorado — two tossup states — into the ‘ lean Obama ’ category , ” political director Chuck Todd told “ NBC Nightly News ” anchor Brian Williams from Chicago .
“ That moves his total to 286 . ”
The move is congruent with projections by others , but marks a milestone because NBC ’s count is so closely followed by the press and campaigns .
Then Todd pointed out a curiosity of electoral math : “ If Nevada , which is a state that ’s also trending in Obama ’s direction , went in his column at 291 , that means he could lose Pennsylvania , Ohio and Florida to McCain and still be at 270 .
It ’s a big shift .
It just shows you the expanded playing field for Obama has paid off .
He is not banking on those big states . ”
Politico ’s 2008 Swing State Map , based on RealClearPolitics polling averages , gives Obama an even wider electoral vote margin over McCain , 375 - 163 .
Former Bush strategist Karl Rove , on Rove.com , has his tally at 306 for Obama to 171 for McCain , with 61 tossups .
Rove ’s latest analysis has McCain making progress in Florida : “ With under two weeks to go before Election Day , Barack Obama retains the lead in the Electoral College with 306 votes to McCain ’s 171 and 61 votes as a tossup .
Since last week , Ohio ( 20 EV ) has shifted from tossup to Obama , while Florida ( 27 EV ) has gone from Obama to tossup , a net loss of 7 electoral votes for the Illinois senator .
McCain still needs to win the tossup states and peel Ohio and at least one substantial state away from Obama to have a chance at victory .
In Virginia ( 13 EV ) and Pennsylvania ( 21 EV ) , which his campaign says he is targeting , he trails by 7 and 13 points , respectively . ”

The Organization of Dialect Diversity in North America

It is now widely recognized that a crucial test for speaker independent recognition systems is their success in dealing with dialect diversity .
Sociolinguistic research on linguistic change in progress has found rapid development of sound changes in most urbanized areas of North America , leading to increased dialect diversity .
It appears that the dialects of New York , Philadelphia , Detroit , Chicago , Saint Louis , Dallas and Los Angeles are now more different from each other than they were 50 or 100 years ago .
Most efforts to establish dialect regions in the U.S. are based on dialectological studies of vocabulary , begun in the 1930's by Kurath ( 1939 ) , and completed for the U.S. by the Dictionary of American Regional English ( Carver 1987 ) .
For most regions , it is not clear how these dialect divisions correspond to differences in pronunciation that would be important for speech recognition .
It seems evident to us that any dialect divisions that would be relevant to speech recognition must be based on the distribution of differences in phonological organization , as determined by acoustic analysis .
For the past three years , the Linguistics Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania has been engaged in an effort to supply this information through Telsur , a telephone survey of North America , supported by NSF , NEH and Bell Northern Research .
The survey is based on a sampling method that is sensitive to both population and geography .
The end product of the survey is the Phonological Atlas of North America , which maps the phonological organization of all English dialects and the extent of ongoing sound changes .
The current results of the survey show 500 speakers representing the urbanized areas above 200,000 and a number of smaller localities .
There are two major types of sound changes which affect success rates in speech recognition : mergers and chain shifts .
The Telsur interview includes a number of direct inquiries aimed at the presence or absence of phonological mergers , in both perception and production .
The maps to follow are based on the phonetic transcription of the 500 interviews , including both spontaneous speech and more formal elicitations by minimal pairs and other methods .
The study of urbanized areas is not quite complete , but enough has been done to give a clear picture of national trends .
The first consideration in estimating the extent of dialect diversity is the phonological inventory : how many different segments there are to be modeled , and what distinctions should be shown in the dictionary representations .
North American dialects are differentiated by unconditioned mergers , which affect the phonemes wherever they appear , and by conditioned mergers , which occur in a particular environment .
There is only one unconditioned merger in the vowel system : the collapse of the distinction between short /o/ and long open / oh/ , which distinguishes cot and caught , hock and hawk , Don and dawn .
In about half of the geographic United States and all of Canada , these pairs are pronounced the same .
Map 1 shows the extent of this merger in speech production before /t/ , as in cot vs. caught .
The symbols labelled " same " show speakers who are merged ; symbols marked " close " shows pairs that are produced phonetically in close approximation as judged by the analyst , and the symbols labelled " distinct " show speakers who produce a clear distinction .
It is immediately apparent that the geographic extent of the merger is quite broad ; it covers half the geographic area of the United States ( and Canada ) , though most of the heavily populated areas in the North , North Midland and mid-Atlantic States keep these word classes separate .
The four areas where the merger predominates are delineated by the isoglosses on Map 1a .
( 1 ) is Northeastern New England , here shown as including Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont and the northeastern portion of Massachusetts , stopping - not far south of the Boston area .
Area ( 2 ) is Western Pennsylvania .
In the Linguistic Atlas maps reflecting the situation in the 1940's ( Kurath and McDavid 1961 ) , this region was confined to the area around Pittsburgh .
Here it extends northward to include Erie , Pennsylvania on Lake Erie , westward to include a number of cities in Ohio , and southward to West Virginia and northern Kentucky .
Though not shown here , the merger is quite solid in Canada , and area ( 3 ) appears to be a southward extension of the Canadian merger .
Finally , most of the American West is included in area ( 4 ) , though some variation remains in certain large cities : Los Angeles , the Bay area , and Denver .
This merger is continuing to expand and is stronger with younger speakers .
Some of the variation in the west reflects the differential ages of the speakers , and some the influence of Southern dialect from settlement patterns of the late 19th century ( as in Montana ) .
However , there is no indication that this merger is progressing so rapidly that speech recognition programs can ignore the distinction : on the contrary , the inland North , most of the South , and the mid-Atlantic states show considerable resistance to the spread of this merger .
In fact , the transition zone in the midwest , through the Dakotas , Nebraska and Kansas is just about where it was in the only other national map available , a survey of long distance telephone operators in 1968 ( Labov 1991 , Figure 1.12 ) .
One of the most widespread conditioned mergers concerns the distinction between / i/ and /e/ before /m / and /n/ , as in pin vs. pen , him vs. hem .
This is usually reflected in a high front vowel for both , so that both pin and pen sound like pin to speakers of other dialects .
As a result , the two words are normally distinguished as ink pen and safety pin in these areas .
The " same " symbols indicate the loss of the distinction ; " close " designates speakers who produce the two vowels very close to each other ; and the " distinct " tokens are speakers who make a plain distinction .
This merger has long been known to be characteristic of Southern States dialects ( Kurath and McDavid 1961 ) .
Brown 1990 and Bailey and Ross 1992 showed that it was still in the process of expansion in the South .
Map 2 indicates that it is quite widespread throughout the South Midland ( southern Ohio , central Indiana , Illinois , Missouri and Kansas ) , Texas , and a scattering of points in the West .
The areas where the pin ~ pen distinction is solidly maintained include the inland and much of the South Midland , all of Pennsylvania and the Middle Atlantic States .
On the other hand , the merger is spreading northward and westward from its base in the South , with a broad zone of variation in the South Midland .
The greatest difficulties for speech recognition are posed not by mergers but by chain shifts of vowels .
Over the past two decades , two major patterns of chain shifting have been identified , which rotate the vowels of English in opposite directions ( Labov , Yaeger & Steiner 1972 , Labov 1990 , Labov 1994 ) .
To examine these , I will draw upon the 220 speakers for whom complete acoustic analyses are now available .
The first chain shift is the Northern Cities Shift , shown in Figure 1 below .
The Northern Cities Shift is found throughout the industrial inland North and most strongly advanced in the largest cities : Syracuse , Rochester , Buffalo , Cleveland , Toledo , Detroit , Flint , Gary , Chicago , Rockford .
The shift begins when /æ/ , the vowel of cad , moves to the position of the vowel of idea /i '/ ( 1 ) .
The vowel /o/ in cod then shifts forward so that it sounds like cad to speakers of other dialects ( 2 ) .
/oh/ in cawed moves down to the position formerly occupied by cod ( 3 ) , /e/ in Ked moves down and back to sound like the vowel of cud ( 4 ) , / cud moves back to the position formerly occupied by cawed ( 5 ) , and /i/ in kid moves back in parallel to the movement of /e / ( 6 ) .
A more concrete view of the Northern Cities Shift can be obtained from Chart 1 / Rochester .
The chart shows the F1 , F2 measurements of the six vowels involved for Sharon K. , a 35 - year old woman from Rochester , NY .
The mean value for each vowel is displayed in a white circle .
In Sharon K.'s speech stages 1 - 5 of the shift have gone to completion .
( 1 ) Short /æ/ has moved from lower front to high front position , while ( 2 ) short /o/ has moved forward to the position vacated by /æ/ , and ( 3 ) long open / oh/ has moved down to the position vacated by /o/.
At the same time , short /e/ has moved down and back until it is positioned in low central position , directly above /o/ , while wedge , the vowel of cut has moved back to the position vacated by / oh / .
To assess the effects of the Northern Cities Shift , it may be helpful to compare the relative positions of the vowels involved for two advanced representatives of the shift with two speakers who are quite remote from its influence .
Figure 2 displays the normalized means of five short vowels and / oh / .
The two Southern speakers , from Springfield , Missouri and Greenville , South Carolina , show the short front vowels vertically aligned , and wedge somewhat front of short /o/ , which is in low back position , not far from / oh / .
Below them are two Detroit speakers , mother and daughter , who show a developed and advanced stage of the Northern Cities Shift .
Here /æ/ has risen to upper mid front position , considerably fronter than short / i/ , and /e/ has fallen to mid central position .
For Leslie R. , /e/ is still to the front of /o/ , but for the daughter , Janice , the fronting of /o/ and the further backing of /e/ has led to what is almost a vertical alignment .
At the same time , wedge has moved back and / oh/ down , so that it is now directly above / oh/ .
Figure 2 . Normalized means of the vowels involved in the Northern Cities Shift for two Southern and two Northern speakers .
On the other hand , the Southern Shift , found throughout the Southern States , South Midland , and many other areas , moves vowels in an opposite direction .
The shift begins when / ay / becomes monophthongized and shifts slightly to the front ( 1 ) .
The nucleus of the diphthong /ey / then falls along a non-peripheral track until it becomes the lowest vowel in the system ( 2 ) .
The nucleus of the diphthong / iy / follows a parallel path towards mid-center position ( 3 ) .
The short front vowels / i , e/ shift forward and up until they reach the front peripheral positions formerly occupied by / iy / and /ey / , and /æ/ moves in parallel ( 4 ) .
The nuclei of / uw / and / ow / then shift forward to front and center positions ( 5,6 ) .
/ ohr / ( now most often merged with / owr / ) moves up to high back position ( 7 ) , and / ahr / shifts up and back to the position that / ohr / vacated ( 8 ) .
The operation of the Southern Shift is illustrated in detail in Chart 2 / Birmingham , which shows the relevant vowels in the normalized system of Thelma M. from Birmingham , Alabama .
In this doubly linear plot , the vertical dimension is the first formant , which corresponds roughly to phonetic height , and the horizontal dimension is the second formant , which corresponds roughly to fronting and backing of the vowel .
The individual vowel tokens are plotted with colored symbols , and the means as black and white circles .
The key to each vowel token is given at the right : the vowels that are actually plotted are shown with lettering in reverse .
In Chart 2 / Birmingham , the schematic view of the Southern Shift in Figure 3 is shown as it actually realized .
The three short front vowels , /i/ , /e/ , /æ/ have retained their vertical organization , and have moved up and to the front , in a peripheral position .
On the other hand , the long vowel / iy / in be and the long vowel /ey / in made have shifted down and to the center along a centralized , non-peripheral track .
The /ey / vowel now has a low nucleus , extending down to overlap to a considerable extent with / ay / , which is monopthongized to [ a : ] .
The back vowels / uw / and / ow / have moved strongly to the front , while / ahr / and / ohr / show an upward chain shift in the back .
The Northern Cities Shift and the Southern Shift are both complex relations of 6 to 10 vowels .
One of the goals of the Telsur project is to derive a small set of numerical parameters which can place each speaker 's system within the overall configuration of the regional dialects of North America in a way that reflects both geographic and linguistic regularities .
Two such parameters will be presented here : �/e reversal and e/o alignment .
They are designed primarily as measures of participation in the Northern Cities Shift , but they also isolate Southern systems , since the movements of the Southern Shift are diametrically opposed to movements of the Northern Cities Shift .
The first parameter is a discrete transformation of the quantitative relations of short /æ/ in man , bad , cat , etc. and short /e/ in pen , bet , bed , etc . Step 1 of Figure 1 begins with /æ/ in low front position , further back and lower than /e/ .
As /æ/ moves forward , their relative positions change .
First /æ/ shifts to a position where it is fronter than /e / but still lower , and eventually reaches a position where it is both higher and fronter .
This reversal is accelerated as /e/ moves down and back in step 4 of Figure 1 .
Map 3 shows the geographic distribution of these relative positions of short /�/ and short /e/ .
As indicated by the legend , the red circles show the situation characteristic of conservative and Southern dialects , where /e/ is lower and backer than /æ/.
The yellow circles show speakers where /æ/ has moved to the front , but is not yet higher than /e / ; the blue circles are all those systems where the relative positions are now reversed .
It is immediately clear that the blue circles are confined to the area of the Northern dialect region , ranging from Chicago in the western portion to Grand Rapids , Detroit , Cleveland , Buffalo , Rochester and Syracuse .
The grey line through Pennsylvania and the Midwest is a useful point of reference here .
This is the line separating the Northern dialect area from the North Midland , drawn by Carver ( 1987 ) on the basis of the distribution of words in the Dictionary of American Regional English .
The lexical isogloss drawn from the DARE data , separating North from North Midland , sharply delimits this aspect of the Northern Cities Shift .
On the other hand , the most conservative relation between /æ/ and /e/ dominates the Southern and Western dialects , with the intermediate stage characteristic of the North Midland .
A second parameter of the Northern Cities Shift concerns the front / back alignment of short /e/ and short /o/.
The starting point for these sound changes , indicated by the position of the ellipses in Figure 1 , shows short /e/ well in front and higher than short /o/.
In step 2 of Figure 1 , /o/ moves forward , and in step 4 , /e/ moves to the back .
Each step in the Northern Cities Shift reduces the difference between the F2 of /e/ and the F2 of /o / , so that for the most advanced stage of the shift , seen in Figure 2 , /e/ is directly aligned with /o/ on the F2 axis .
Map 4 shows six categories in the F2 differentiation of short /e/ and /o/.
Red circles show speakers whose mean F2 difference between /e/ and /o/ is over 800 Hz .
These are clearly confined to the Southern dialect area .
Orange circles , with 600 - 800 Hz differences are characteristic of the South Midland and the West extending from Ohio to Kansas .
Closer positions of /e/ and /o/ are shown by green and light blue symbols ; the dark blue symbols show the speakers for whom /e / and /o/ are vertically aligned , characteristic of the advanced stages of the Northern Cities Shift .
Again , this pattern is found only in the Northern dialect region , and appears in all of the large cities of that area .
A third index of the North / South axis is independent of the Northern Cities Shift : it concerns the relative fronting of / aw / and / ay / .
In the North , most speakers have a nucleus of / aw / back of center , while / ay / is center or front of center .
In the North Midland and the South , and most of the West , these relations are reversed , as shown in Map 5 .
On Map 5 , the darkest circles labelled " < 50 " in the legend indicate speakers for whom the difference between the mean F2 of / aw / and the mean F2 of / ay / is less than 50 Hz ;
The medium circles labelled " 50 - 300 " show all those speakers with a difference between 50 and 300 Hz ; the circles labelled " > 300 " show strong fronting of / aw / , with a difference of over 300 Hz .
It is evident that the blue circles are confined to an area north of the North / Midland isogloss , but here this northern trait extends westward through the North Central states .
The green circles are characteristic of the South , but are also well represented in the South Midland portions of Ohio , Indiana and Illinois , and dominate the more western extension of the South Midland in Missouri and Kansas .
Given the number of parameters involved in comparing two - dimensional plots of sixteen vowels , it seems reasonable to submit the matrix to a principal components analysis and see whether the geographic areas identified on the map will emerge from the overall pattern of the data Chart 3 shows the first two components that emerge from a matrix of nineteen acoustic measures for the 220 speakers analyzed .
The first component , U1 , has an eigenvalue that accounts for exactly one third of the variance ; U2 , for one eighth .
( U3 is slightly less than an eighth , and the other eigenvalues are much smaller . )
The various points , each corresponding to a speaker , are colored according to the dialect : dark blue is the Northern Cities and blue - green is North Central .
These clearly cluster at the high end of U1 .
Red circles show Southern speakers , and purple South Midland , which clearly cluster at the low end of U1 .
It is quite clear that U1 is the North / South axis which several of the earlier figures have shown to be an organizing principle of dialect differentiation .
It also represents the advancement of the two sets of sound changes .
Note that the high point , labeled Detroit 14 , is the 14 - year - old daughter of the speaker labeled Detroit 42 .
The lowest outlier is 39 - year - old Thelma M. from Birmingham , whom we saw earlier as the most advanced representative of the Southern Shift in the set of acoustic analyses done so far .
Along the U2 axis , we see the separation of the eastern from the western sections of the South Midland : Four Kansas speakers , who aligned strongly with the South on the / aw/-/ ay / parameter , are clustered at right with high values of U2 , while the Southern mountain speakers are grouped at left , with low U2 values .
Our data collection in the South and Canada is still incomplete , and there is much more to be said about the dialectal situation in the West .
Yet as a first result , these acoustic analyses yield new quantitative methods for aligning dialects along the North / South axis which we believe will be quite useful in speech recognition .
It must be noted that the sharpest North / South division is far from the Mason - Dixon line : it is the great divide between the North and North Midland dialects .
On one side of this line are the large cities of the inland North from Madison in the west to Syracuse in the east , which follow the Northern Cities Shift with extraordinary homogeneity .
South of this line are the large cities of the North Midland , which follow other and more diverse principles : Pittsburgh , Columbus , Dayton , Cincinnati , Indianapolis , Evansville , Saint Louis .
South of the Ohio River , we find once again uniform patterns of vowel shifting : the Southern Shift governs the vowel development of Appalachia as well as the coastal South .
The Phonological Atlas provides the first national view of American phonology , more systematic and considerably simpler than the information that has been gleaned from dialectology over the past sixty years .
In place of the gradual decay of rural dialects , we see the rapid development of new sound changes in all the urbanized areas .
Instead of a long list of dialect features , the Telsur telephone survey provide a small set of parameters that can be located at any given dialect in relation to others .
At the same time , the Telsur project has verified the revolutionary conclusions that Kurath and McDavid derived from the Linguistic Atlas : that there are three coequal regions of American dialects , the North , the Midland and the South .
The boundary between the North and the North Midland , which is hidden from popular awareness and seemed obscure to many scholars , emerges as the most important feature on the landscape of American English .

Josh Knowles recently suggested that maybe I could merge grb ’s functionality to the github gem .
Both gems being command - line tools that help you use
Git in a friendlier manner , the question makes a lot of sense .
It makes so much sense in fact , that I decided to blog about it .
A post about it will scale much better to answer other users who may potentially ask the same question .
So here ’s a slightly edited excerpt from the answer I gave him .
And yes , I also ramble in email .
I ’ve seen what Scott added to the github gem .
Pretty cool stuff indeed .
I think the idea of merging with the github gem has merit .
I definitely can see a future where we start having too many distinct command - line tools that help deal with Git ’s sometimes obscure or numerous commands .
However I ’m not sure I ’d like to merge grb into the gh gem , despite the additional awareness it would get .
Here ’s why .
In my mind , the github gem should be mostly features about GitHub itself , like managing pull requests ( the way GitHub does them ) .
It ’s starting to accumulate features that probably are n’t GitHub - specific , which I do n’t mind , of course .
But grb ’s features really are GitHub - agnostic .
I ’ve started working on it before I even started using GitHub , in fact :-)
Reinforcing the previous point , I would n’t want someone who does n’t use GitHub to not realize the features of grb are available to him because they ’re included in a gem called ‘ github ’ ;-)
Also , one of the goals of git_remote_branch is to explicitly teach the underlying git commands .
I do this by always spewing out the underlying commands in red , and by having the explain command .
I ’m pretty sure an unsuspecting user would wonder what hit him if a few of the github commands started spewing out red text in his console ;-)
Having explain for a few commands ( ported from grb ) and not for the rest of the github gem ’s commands would be weird , too .
There ’s also a few other architectural decisions of grb that may not fit with github ’s , like having aliases .
Once again , grb being a teaching tool , I want to offer a bunch of aliases for forgetful people like me .
So far I do n’t see anything like aliases in github and I ’m not sure how the authors of github - gem would react to a pull request polluting it with a bunch of aliases ;-)
Last but not least , the github gem already has a track command , which conflicts with grb’s .
github ’s is used to track a new remote repo in your local repo while grb ’s is to track another branch from your current remote repo .

We 've been looking forward to Dead Space for quite a long time now , and I had the entirely terrible task of spending most of last night and today playing the game .
While I wo n't talk much about specifics until we run our feature review , I will say one thing : the game is scary .
Last night I took the game over to a friend 's house and we killed the lights , put the volume at a comfortable level and then turned it up a few notches , and got to playing .
It sneaks up on you , the atmosphere and the level of immersion are both very well done , mostly through some clever design with the user interface .
You 're having a good time , and then BAM !
Something happens and you jump out of your seat .
This happened multiple times .
It 's a thing of beauty .
In one instance I was carrying the flame thrower , and when I jumped my finger slipped and hit the trigger , causing a very weak spurt of flame to shoot out somewhat impotently .
We both got a giggle out of that .
Do yourself a favor when you get the game : make the room as dark as possible .
Turn the sound system up .
Allow yourself to be swept away in it .
So far Dead Space has been a great experience , just for the horror .
It 's so refreshing to have a scary game that does n't have the words " Silent " or " Resident " in the title .
USC coach Pete Carroll says the NCAA can have a timeout from Saturday 's crosstown rivalry game with UCLA .
He just wants his players to wear their home colors .
Carroll said on Monday that the Trojans would wear their cardinal red home jerseys on Saturday at the Rose Bowl .
That violates an NCAA rule that requires visiting teams to wear white , and the infraction will cost a timeout .
The Pac - 10's interpretation of the team wearing the wrong colored jersey is that they are penalized a timeout at the start of the game .
UCLA is taking USC 's side in the dispute .
The Bruins plan to call their own timeout immediately after USC is assessed that penalty at the start of the game to even it out .
Both Carroll and UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel had talked about restoring tradition back at the Pac - 10 media day in July .
The last time the Trojans and the Bruins both wore home jerseys -- the Trojans in red , the Bruins in blue and gold -- was in 1982 , when the schools shared the Los Angeles Coliseum .
" I just thought it was a really cool tradition , " Carroll said .
Am I An Atheist Or An Agnostic ?
A Plea For Tolerance In The Face Of New Dogmas
by Bertrand Russell ( 1947 )
Return to Historical Index
Home to Positive Atheism
I speak as one who was intended by my father to be brought up as a Rationalist .
He was quite as much of a Rationalist as I am , but he died when I was three years old , and the Court of Chancery decided that I was to have the benefits of a Christian education .
I think perhaps the Court of Chancery might have regretted that since .
It does not seem to have done as much good as they hoped .
Perhaps you may say that it would be rather a pity if Christian education were to cease , because you would then get no more Rationalists .
They arise chiefly out of reaction to a system of education which considers it quite right that a father should decree that his son should be brought up as a Muggletonian , we will say , or brought up on any other kind of nonsense , but he must on no account be brought up to think rationally .
When I was young that was considered to be illegal .
Sin And The Bishops
Since I became a Rationalist I have found that there is still considerable scope in the world for the practical importance of a rationalist outlook , not only in matters of geology , but in all sorts of practical matters , such as divorce and birth control , and a question which has come up quite recently , artificial insemination , where bishops tell us that something is gravely sinful , but it is only gravely sinful because there is some text in the Bible about it .
It is not gravely sinful because it does anybody harm , and that is not the argument .
As long as you can say , and as long as you can persuade Parliament to go on saying , that a thing must not be done solely because there is some text in the Bible about it , so long obviously there is great need of Rationalism in practice .
As you may know , I got into great trouble in the United States solely because , on some practical issues , I considered that the ethical advice given in the Bible was not conclusive , and that on some points one should act differently from what the Bible says .
On this ground it was decreed by a Law Court that I was not a fit person to teach in any university in the United States , so that I have some practical ground for preferring Rationalism to other outlooks .
Do n't Be Too Certain !
The question of how to define Rationalism is not altogether an easy one .
I do not think that you could define it by rejection of this or that Christian dogma .
It would be perfectly possible to be a complete and absolute Rationalist in the true sense of the term and yet accept this or that dogma .
The question is how to arrive at your opinions and not what your opinions are .
The thing in which we believe is the supremacy of reason .
If reason should lead you to orthodox conclusions , well and good ; you are still a Rationalist .
To my mind the essential thing is that one should base one 's arguments upon the kind of grounds that are accepted in science , and one should not regard anything that one accepts as quite certain , but only as probable in a greater or a less degree .
Not to be absolutely certain is , I think , one of the essential things in rationality .
Proof of God
Here there comes a practical question which has often troubled me .
Whenever I go into a foreign country or a prison or any similar place they always ask me what is my religion .
I never know whether I should say " Agnostic " or whether I should say " Atheist " .
It is a very difficult question and I daresay that some of you have been troubled by it .
As a philosopher , if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic , because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove that there is not a God .
On the other hand , if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist , because when I say that I cannot prove that there is not a God , I ought to add equally that I cannot prove that there are not the Homeric gods .
None of us would seriously consider the possibility that all the gods of homer really exist , and yet if you were to set to work to give a logical demonstration that Zeus , Hera , Poseidon , and the rest of them did not exist you would find it an awful job .
You could not get such proof .
Therefore , in regard to the Olympic gods , speaking to a purely philosophical audience , I would say that I am an Agnostic .
But speaking popularly , I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists .
In regard to the Christian God , I should , I think , take exactly the same line .
Skepticism
There is exactly the same degree of possibility and likelihood of the existence of the Christian God as there is of the existence of the Homeric God .
I cannot prove that either the Christian God or the Homeric gods do not exist , but I do not think that their existence is an alternative that is sufficiently probable to be worth serious consideration .
Therefore , I suppose that that on these documents that they submit to me on these occasions I ought to say " Atheist " , although it has been a very difficult problem , and sometimes I have said one and sometimes the other without any clear principle by which to go .
When one admits that nothing is certain one must , I think , also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others .
It is much more nearly certain that we are assembled here tonight than it is that this or that political party is in the right .
Certainly there are degrees of certainty , and one should be very careful to emphasize that fact , because otherwise one is landed in an utter skepticism , and complete skepticism would , of course , be totally barren and completely useless .
Persecution
On must remember that some things are very much more probable than others and may be so probable that it is not worth while to remember in practice that they are not wholly certain , except when it comes to questions of persecution .
If it comes to burning somebody at the stake for not believing it , then it is worth while to remember that after all he may be right , and it is not worth while to persecute him .
In general , if a man says , for instance , that the earth is flat , I am quite willing that he should propagate his opinion as hard as he likes .
He may , of course , be right but I do not think he is .
In practice you will , I think , do better to assume that the earth is round , although , of course , you may be mistaken .
Therefore , I do not think we should go in for complete skepticism , but for a doctrine of degrees of probability .
OVER the coming days and weeks , there will be many “ I never thought I ’d see the day ” pieces , but none of them will be more overflowing with “ I never thought I ’d see the day ” - ness than this one .
I ’m black , you see , and I have n’t gained a pound since college .
I skip breakfast most days , have maybe half a sandwich for lunch , and sometimes I forget to eat dinner .
Just slips my mind .
Yesterday morning , I woke up to a new world .
America had elected a Skinny Black Guy president .
I never thought I ’d see the day .
What were the chances that someone who looked like me would come to lead the most powerful nation on earth ?
Slim .
Skinny Black Guys of my parents ’ generation pinned their hopes on Sammy Davis Jr. His was a big - tent candidacy , rallying Skinny Black Guys , the Rat Pack and the Jewish vote in one crooning , light - footed package .
He won South Carolina , but he never gathered momentum .
In the end , the Candy Man could n’t .
No one stepped up for a long time .
Michael Jackson was black and skinny , but also pretty weird , and after a while he was n’t even black any more , although he did retain his beanpole silhouette .
We thought we had a winner in Chris Rock , but then he started in with his infamous “ There are Russians , and then there are ... Georgians ” routine and we decided he was too raw for the national stage .
So we waited .
Some lost faith .
Others gorged themselves on protein shakes , believing that America might accept a black mesomorph .
And some of us kept hoping .
We were hungry for change , if not brunch .
A day after West Virginia secretary of state Betty Ireland held a press conference to address vote - switching problems with touchscreen voting machines made by Election Systems & Software , she presented an award of merit to an ES&S vice president , who had abruptly and mysteriously left the company in May after 11 years of service , according to the Charleston Gazette .
Gary Greenhalgh , as ES&S 's vice president of sales , helped the company win a $ 17 - million contract to supply machines to West Virginia in 2005 and was the company 's point person for dealing with election officials until he left ES&S .
Last week , Ireland gave him a Medallion Award from the National Association of Secretaries of State at a special ceremony .
The award came the same week that voters in several West Virginia counties reported that ES&S 's iVotronic touchscreen machines were flipping their votes from Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to Republican rival John McCain .
Ireland addressed the problem by directing the 34 West Virginia counties that use the touchscreen machines to re-calibrate them each morning during early voting and on election day .
At the ceremony honoring Greenhalgh , Ireland said the Medallion Award was given to people who have " established a very distinctive record in areas including responsible citizenship , voter registration , use of technology and service to local elected officials and county government . "
Ireland seemed less satisfied with Greenhalgh 's record two years ago , when she filed a formal complaint against ES&S with the federal Election Assistance Commission , the body that oversees federal testing and certification of voting machines .
She called for an audit of the company 's contractual performance .
The complaint charged ES&S with failing to program and deliver voting machines to county officials in time for testing before that year 's May primary , forcing some counties to fall back to paper ballots .
ES&S failed to provide accessible voting machines to counties by the time early voting in the primary began , despite promises that the machines would be supplied months earlier .
That delay put the state in violation of a federal law that required every voting precinct in the country to have at least one accessible voting machine for disabled voters by January 1 , 2006 elections .
" I am more than upset that our county clerks and their staffs and the county commissions had to withstand stress and anxiety over the broken promises and delays ES&S put them through , " Ireland said in a press release ( . pdf ) at the time .
" The county election officials are to be commended for their valor and hard work above and beyond the call of duty . "
She also said in the statement that " ES&S was chosen to provide West Virginia 's voting machines partly based on its local connection , its past service in the state , and its knowledge of West Virginia election deadlines and procedures .
Unfortunately , we now feel ES&S let West Virginia down . "
The " local connection " refers in part to Greenhalgh , who lives in West Virginia with his wife .
Greenhalgh has been the source of specific frustration in Kanawha County , West Virginia , where he and the company are accused of repeatedly missing deadlines and making mistakes on voting materials .
Threat Level obtained a series of letters and faxes ( .pdf ) the county 's commissioners sent to Greenhalgh in 2006 complaining about repeated delays , broken promises and poor equipment .
In one fax to Greenhalgh , Kanawha County Commission President Kent Carper complained that a printer ES&S provided for the county 's central tabulation system must have come from a " Cracker Jacks " box .
The county uses optical - scan machines made by ES&S as well as its AutoMark system for disabled voters .
The AutoMark provides a touchscreen , Braille keyboard and audio feed for voters and produces a paper ballot that is scanned through an optical reader .
Greenhalgh is a former Federal Election Commission official and was largely responsible for creating the voting system standards that were developed in the 1980s that were used for testing and certifying Diebold and ES&S voting systems , as well as others , for two decades .
In the late 1970's , long before he went to work for ES&S , Greenhalgh helped organize election officials to lobby Congress to amend the Federal Election Campaign
Act to establish the standards .
He personally pushed the amendment into conference in the Senate and then hired the person who wrote the standards , Bob Naegele .
He did this , ironically , to address problems that election officials were having with voting machine vendors who would sell their machines to states then fail to provide adequate customer service afterward or go out of business .
Neither Greenhalgh nor ES&S responded to a call for comment from Threat Level , but in 2004 I interviewed Greenhalgh about the voting system standards and he explained the motivation for establishing them .
" A number of us got together and said that we need to come up with baseline national standards that everyone needs to meet so that we do n't have election officials victimized by these small companies that did n't have any real interest in staying in the business and making things work correctly , " he said .
With regard to Greenhalgh 's recent departure from ES&S , the Charleston Gazette reports that neither Greenhalgh nor ES&S would discuss the reason for his leaving the company .
His wife , Jane Greenhalgh , is now project director for ES&S in West Virginia , but when the Gazette asked him whether his wife worked for ES&S , Greenhalgh replied , " I have no idea " and refused to answer any questions .
Reminiscent of the complaints against her husband , Jane Greenhalgh received her own complaint from Kanawha County this month after officials discovered that an ES&S sub - contractor had misprogrammed voting machine PCMCIA cards ahead of a state Supreme Court race .
The programming error would have caused the machines to mis-record votes when a voter opted to vote a straight Republican ticket , but chose one Democratic candidate in the Supreme Court race .
The state had to have the PCMCIA cards re-programmed quickly to keep Democratic votes from being discarded .
In a fax ( .doc ) sent from Commission president Kent Carper to Jane Greenhalgh about a week before her husband received his award , Carper wrote that he continued to be " amazed at the lack of attention on the part of ES&S , not only to Kanawha County , but the entire State of West Virginia . "
Carper writes that the change in leadership that occurred when Jane Greenhalgh replaced her husband as ES&S 's representative in West Virginia " has not improved the lack of commitment made by ES&S to this State . "
Carper told Threat Level , " When you spend the kind of tax dollars that we spent on these machines , you should n't have programming errors the day before early voting starts .
You should n't have cards fail . "
For his part , Gary Greenhalgh did n't completely leave the ES&S fold after he left the company in May .
According to the Charleston Gazette , he now works as a regional account manager for Casto & Harris , Inc. , the subcontractor that misprogrammed the PCMCIA cards in the Supreme Court race .
It 's not known who was responsible for calibrating the touchscreen machines that were flipping votes last week .
Casto & Harris did not respond to a call for comment .
Ireland 's office did not respond to a call for comment , but the secretary of state is expected to hold a press conference Monday afternoon to address issues about the election and ES&S .
UPDATE : Greenhalgh has now responded to the message I left him this morning .
He says the * Charleston Gazette * got it wrong and he does not work for Casto & Harris .
He had been talking with the company recently about going to work for it , but decided he wanted out of the election business entirely .
He 's now looking to get back into the federal government and has interviewed for a congressional staff position as well as a position with the U.S. Census Bureau .
Greenhalgh also said that he and ES&S parted on amicable terms and he left the company only because he felt he 'd accomplished all he wanted to after eleven years .
As for the award that Ireland gave him on behalf of the National Association of Secretaries of State , he said it was a belated award for the work he did in 1979 to convince Congress to create voting system standards .

American lawyers defending six Algerians before a habeas corpus hearing in Washington this week learned some very odd things about US intelligence after 9/11 .
From among the millions of " raw " reports from American spies and their " assets " around the world came a CIA Middle East warning about a possible kamikaze - style air attack on a US navy base at a south Pacific island location .
The only problem was that no such navy base existed on the island and no US Seventh Fleet warship had ever been there .
In all seriousness , a US military investigation earlier reported that Osama bin Laden had been spotted shopping at a post office on a US military base in east Asia .
That this nonsense was disseminated around the world by those tasked to defend the United States in the " war on terror " shows the fantasy environment in which the Bush regime has existed these past eight years .
If you can believe that bin Laden drops by a shopping mall on an American military base , then you can believe that everyone you arrest is a " terrorist " , that Arabs are " terrorists " , that they can be executed , that living " terrorists " must be tortured , that everything a tortured man says can be believed , that it is legitimate to invade sovereign states , to grab the telephone records of everyone in America .
As Bob Herbert put it in The New York Times a couple of years ago , the Bush administration wanted these records " which contain crucial documentation of calls for a Chinese takeout in Terre Haute , Indiana , and birthday greetings to Grandma in Talladega , Alabama , to help in the search for Osama bin Laden " .
There was no stopping Bush when it came to trampling on the US Constitution .
All that was new was that he was now applying the same disrespect for liberty in America that he had shown in the rest of the world .
But how is Barack Obama going to repair the titanic damage which his vicious , lying predecessor has perpetrated around the globe and within the US itself ?
John F Kennedy once said that " the United States , as the world knows , will never start a war " .
After Bush 's fear - mongering and Rumsfeld 's " shock and awe " and Abu Ghraib and Bagram and Guantanamo and secret renditions , how does Obama pedal his country all the way back to Camelot ?
Our own dear Gordon Brown 's enthusiasm to Hoover up the emails of the British people is another example of how Lord Blair 's sick relationship with Bush still infects our own body politic .
Only days before the wretched president finally departs from us , new US legislation will ensure that citizens of his lickspittle British ally will no longer be able to visit America without special security clearance .
Does Bush have any more surprises for us before 20 January ?
Indeed , could anything surprise us any more ?

Obama has got to close Guantanamo .
He 's got to find a way of apologising to the world for the crimes of his predecessor , not an easy task for a man who must show pride in his country ; but saying sorry is what – internationally – he will have to do if the " change " he has been promoting at home is to have any meaning outside America 's borders .
He will have to re-think – and deconstruct – the whole " war on terror " .
He will have to get out of Iraq .
He will have to call a halt to America 's massive airbases in Iraq , its $ 600 m embassy .
He will have to end the blood - caked air strikes we are perpetrating in southern Afghanistan – why , oh , why do we keep slaughtering wedding parties ?
– and he will have to tell Israel a few home truths : that America can no longer remain uncritical in the face of Israeli army brutality and the colonisation for Jews and Jews only on Arab land .
Obama will have to stand up at last to the Israeli lobby ( it is , in fact , an Israeli Likud party lobby ) and withdraw Bush 's 2004 acceptance of Israel 's claim to a significant portion of the West Bank .
US officials will have to talk to Iranian officials – and Hamas officials , for that matter .
Obama will have to end US strikes into Pakistan – and Syria .
Indeed , there 's a growing concern among America 's allies in the Middle East that the US military has to be brought back under control – indeed , that the real reason for General David Petraeus ' original appointment in Iraq was less to organise the " surge " than it was to bring discipline back to the 150,000 soldiers and marines whose mission – and morals – had become so warped by Bush 's policies .
There is some evidence , for example , that the four - helicopter strike into Syria last month , which killed eight people , was – if not a rogue operation – certainly not sanctioned byWashington or indeed by US commanders in Baghdad .
But Obama 's not going to be able to make the break .
He wants to draw down in Iraq in order to concentrate more firepower in Afghanistan .
He 's not going to take on the lobby in Washington and he's not going to stop further Jewish colonisation of the occupied territories or talk to Israel 's enemies .
With AIPAC supporter Rahm Emanuel as his new chief of staff – " our man in the White House " , as the Israeli daily Maariv called him this week – Obama will toe the line .
And of course , there 's the terrible thought that bin Laden – when he's not shopping at US military post offices – may be planning another atrocity to welcome the Obama presidency .
There is just one little problem , though , and that 's the " missing " prisoners .
Not the victimswho have been ( still are being ? ) tortured in Guantanamo , but the thousands who have simply disappeared into US custody abroad or – with American help – into the prisons of US allies .
Some reports speak of 20,000 missing men , most of them Arabs , all of them Muslims .
Where are they ?
Can they be freed now ?
Or are they dead ?
If Obama finds that he is inheriting mass graves from George W Bush , there will be a lot of apologising to do .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Terrorists are likely to use a weapon of mass destruction somewhere in the world in the next five years , a blue - ribbon panel assembled by Congress has concluded .
Police watch over travelers at New York 's Grand Central Terminal before Thanksgiving .
They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating , the chairman of the commission told CNN .
" The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension .
It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed , " former Sen. Bob Graham said .
He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example .
" Today it is still in the laboratory , but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose , we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago , " he said .
Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack »
The U.S. government " needs to move more aggressively to limit " the spread of biological weapons , the commission said in its report .
Graham warned that such measures would be costly , but were necessary .
" The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority ... they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world , " he said .
" It is not going to be cheap .
It is not going to be accomplished without some sacrifices .
It wo n't be accomplished without putting this issue ahead of some other competing national and international goals .
But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so , " he added .
Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out .
Biological weapons " are more available , " he said .
" Anthrax is a natural product of dead animals .
Other serious pathogens are available in equally accessible forms . "
" There are so many scientists who have the skills to convert a pathogen from benign , helpful purposes into an illicit , very harmful weapon , " he added .
But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism , both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals .
" Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons , " said the report , which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday .
CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening .
It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen. Sam Nunn , who said that the " risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing , not receding . "
The report recommends a range of measures , including increased security and awareness at biological research labs and strengthening international treaties against the spread of biological and nuclear weapons .
" Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use , or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists , " the report warned .
The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea , and about Pakistan , which it described as " the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism . "
While observing that Pakistan is a U.S. ally , the report said , " the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas " in Pakistan .
The tribal areas lie in northwest Pakistan where the government exerts little control ; the United States says it is a haven for militants from both Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan .
Congress created the commission to investigate and report on WMD and terrorism in line with a recommendation from the 9/11 Commission , which compiled a report on the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the United States .
Commissioners heard testimony from more than 250 experts from around the world over the course of their six - month investigation .

ASHLAND , Ohio ( CNN ) -- Deb Sheriff remembers when it was different .
Employees at Archway Cookies bakery find out that their workplace is being shut down .
Her father moved to Ashland in the 1950s from Battle Creek , Michigan , to help build and open the Archway Cookies bakery .
And 31 years ago , Deb started working on the production line .
" We were family , " she told us .
" They looked out for us .
You know -- we got good raises .
We got raises two times a year . "
The last raise , though , was six years ago .
Then workers one recent Friday night noticed supervisors changing some locks .
The next day , a letter was delivered by overnight mail : official notice the bakery was shutting down , and that their benefits , including their health insurance , were being canceled .
" It is just devastating , " Sheriff says as she stares at the ground outside her modest home .
Nobody was getting rich at the bakery ; the jobs paid from $ 14 to $ 18 an hour .
But they had health insurance with a modest worker contribution .
Sheriff 's daughter is a single mom who also worked at the bakery , and as she mingles with other family members nearby , Deb Sheriff confronts her family 's new reality .

" My daughter had a heart attack three years ago and takes heart medicine .
She has high blood pressure and is a diabetic and we have no benefits as of today .
So it is going to be hard for her , hard for all of us . "
Tiny Ashland was already struggling ;
Ohio has lost 200,000 jobs over the past eight years and people here say most of the higher - paying factory jobs have disappeared .
The toll is evident in the small town 's center : Vacant storefronts are easy to find .
For 19 years , Terry Mowery worked in maintenance at Archway Cookies and was protected from the decline around him .
" The town of Ashland is a dying town , " was Mowery 's sad take .
" All the manufacturing is leaving . "
Politics is for the most part predictable in a conservative place like this .
At the local Republican headquarters , the signs in the window are simple : " PRO LIFE " reads one .
" PRO GUNS , " is another .
Republicans count on big margins in these conservative areas to offset Democratic advantages in urban areas like Cleveland .
Ashland also is one of those blue - collar places where Hillary Clinton trounced Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries , and some voters say flatly that they have a hard time thinking about voting for an African - American for president .
Watch how race could affect the election in Ohio »
But predictable might not be such a safe bet at such a volatile time .
Sheriff is a lifelong Republican who says John McCain will get her vote because of his military service , and because she does not believe Obama has the experience to be president .
But there are many others who say they are tired of what they perceive as Republican policies that contributed to the decline of small towns like theirs .
Mike Davis is among dozens of Archway workers we met outside the shuttered bakery , all wondering what would come next , and whether they had any way of protecting their health benefits .
" Leaning towards Barack Obama at this point , " Davis said when asked about the race for president .
" The country needs to definitely go in a different direction .
Washington is corrupt and everyone knows it , and you have the extremely rich and you have us . "
In the crowd , there is talk that the banks cut off the company 's credit , and rumors that the bakery machines were trucked out overnight to a facility in Canada .
Most of all , there is a numbing sense among people like Diana Anderson that nobody outside this little town will care much .
Anderson is a fierce abortion opponent -- the issue that led her to support George W. Bush .
But this year ?
" Definitely Obama .
... I am definitely going to vote for Obama . "
Losing your job can change your political priorities .
" It really does trump all else , " Anderson says .
" McCain has shown me nothing that would benefit us and our economy . "
Tata Boss Ratan Tata launches the world 's cheapest production car
Tata Motors , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover , is to inject " tens of millions " of pounds into the British carmaker , according to the Financial Times .
A spokesman for Tata Motors did not deny the report .
A cash injection by the Indian owner would give the UK government more time to decide whether to use public money to bail - out the company .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson had cast doubt on a bail - out , saying the state was a " lender of last resort " .
Debasis Ray , head of corporate communications for Tata , did not deny the report but would not say how much money would be injected .
" It is our company and we are running a business , " he said .
" Discussions with the government , however , are confidential and cannot be revealed .
We have to run the company and are doing so to the best of our abilities . "
State aid
The carmaker has asked the government for financial support and its case has been backed by unions which say the industry needs help .
Labour peer Lord Bhattacharyya had suggested ministers were discussing a £ 667 m loan package for Jaguar .
But Lord Mandelson said that Tata group must " look to their own resources . "
Jaguar Land Rover has been hit hard by a dramatic slump in sales that has affected carmakers across the world .
In the US , the government has agreed to a $ 17.4bn ( £ 11.6 bn ; 12.4bn euros ) bail - out package for its auto industry .
In the UK , the Confederation of British Industry has said urgent government loans are needed to preserve 800,000 UK jobs in the carmaking industry .
The Unite union says tens of thousands of skilled jobs are " hanging by a thread " .
Minority Report comes to Britain :
The CCTV that spots crimes BEFORE they happen
CCTV cameras which can ' predict ' if a crime is about to take place are being introduced on Britain 's streets .
The cameras can alert operators to suspicious behaviour , such as loitering and unusually slow walking .
Anyone spotted could then have to explain their behaviour to a police officer .
The move has been compared to the Tom Cruise science - fiction film Minority Report , in which people are arrested before they commit planned offences .
CCTV frame 1 : Two men appear to be meeting on a deserted street .
Is a crime about to happen ?
CCTV frame 2 : The two men are now seen exchanging words and perhaps something else .
The operator is alerted
It will also fuel fears that Britain is becoming a surveillance society .
There are already 4.2 million cameras trained on the public .
The technology could be used alongside many of these to allow evermore advanced scrutiny of our movements .
Last night , civil rights campaign group Liberty was sceptical .
A spokesman said : ' Bringing expensive Hollywood sci- fi to our car parks will never be as effective as having police on the street leading the fight against crime . '
The cameras , trained on public places , such as car parks , are being tested by Portsmouth City Council .
Crystal ball :
This new CCTV in Portsmouth can automatically detect potential crimes before they happen
Computers are programmed to analyse the movements of people or vehicles in the camera frame .
If someone is seen lurking in a particular area , the computer will send out an alarm to a CCTV operator .
The operator will then check the image and – if concerned – ring the police .
The aim is to stop crimes before they are committed .
If a vehicle is moving too fast or slow – indicating joyriding or kerb - crawling , for example – a similar alert could be given .
Councillor Jason Fazackarley of Portsmouth Council said : ' It 's the 21st century equivalent of a nightwatchman , but unlike a night - watchman it never blinks , it never takes a break and it never gets bored . '
How it works :
The CCTV system being used in Portsmouth to detect potential criminal behaviour
Under watch : A man is caught on CCTV loitering in a stairwell
But the danger is that the innocent could be forced to account for their movements despite doing nothing wrong .
Nick Hewitson , managing director of Smart CCTV , which has created the technology , denied it was a further infringement on privacy .
He said the final decision on whether to send police to question a suspect would still rest with the CCTV operator .
Fiction ?
Crimes are predicted by special operators in the Hollywood blockbuster Minority Report , starring Tom Cruise
Mr Hewitson added : ' Although we are a long way off Minority Report , it is a step closer .
' But what it can not do is say whether a guy is waiting for his girlfriend or about to commit a crime .
That is for the operator to make a subjective human decision on . '
Smile you 're on camera : Portsmouth City Council is introducing a new sophisticated CCTV system
The system has been run successfully in several U.S. cities , including New York .
Government departments here are said to be interested in putting it to wider use .
Tory Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' We will look at this carefully … but there is no argument for CCTV that invades your privacy without being effective in the fight against crime . '
Roy Fielding :
When did you stop beating your wife , Ian ?
The apparent catalyst for this exchange was a document put out by Mike Smith .
Clearly there are areas of disagreement .
Not just between Roy and Ian , but between many of the participants in the working group .
Many are focusing on such details as to what should be normative , and how such specifications should be arranged .
My opinion is that this discussion is premature and ca n’t be settled without first establishing a common understanding of the context and goals of the effort .
Meanwhile , it is important to note the Mike ’s document does not attempt to be inconsistent with the ongoing HTML5 work , it merely attempts to capture a subset of this information , and present it from a different perspective .
The bigger problem is that HTML5 will be finished in 2022 .
Or in 2010 .
The first thing that needs to be recognized is that the WHATWG ’s goals ( are these documented ? ) wo n’t be met in 2010 .
The second thing is that neither will the W3 C’s .
There are many ways to address this .
One that I would not be in favor of is adjusting the W3 C ’s date significantly .
IMHO , what ’s needed is a chair that will take consensus whenever he ( or she ) can find it , and graciously accept defeat when that ’s not possible .
Again , not all of the goals are achievable by 2010 .
Whether they ever could have been or not is irrelevant , at this point it clearly is not the case .
And it is worth repeating that the intent is that Mike ’s document and Ian ’s document are n’t in conflict .
One way to resolve any apparent conflicts is to relabel the document which is intended to be later .
Picking some dates out of the air , how about HTML5=2010 ; HTML6=2013 ; HTML7=2016 ; HTML8=2019 ; and HTML9=2022 ?
Meanwhile ...
Question :
Do we need to resolve whether ping is in HTML9 ?
Answer : Not today .
Question :
Do we need to resolve whether the DOM bindings are in HTML9 or are in a separate document ?
Answer : Not today .
I could go on , but the basic point is that if HTML5 were redefined to be the set of things over which we can come to rough consensus over the next 18 months or so , it would in all likelihood be ( a ) delivered on time , ( b ) be significantly smaller than the current working draft , and ( c ) as consistent as we collectively know how to make it with the full “ 2022 ” vision .
Repeat that process ever three or so years , and I ’m confident that we will eventually converge on full consensus .
Possibly even by 2022 .

" We spent as much money as we could , and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us . "
~ Charles Dickens : Great Expectations as reprinted in " Hard Lessons : The Iraq Reconstruction Experience "
Oh man !
I missed out on the spectacle of the year .
So grand was it I would have paid money … yes money … to see it .
At a surprise press conference in Iraq a Liberated Iraqi Patriot threw not one but two shoes at George W. Bush ’s head !
Talk about ungrateful .
Sadly , both missed .
I might have asked for a refund .
But what can you expect from a country where soccer is the number one sport ?
I mean … the poor guy just does n’t have the expertise at throwing projectiles like Eric Gagne or Fran Tarkenton .
Still , I give him an A for effort .
But I also wonder if George gave him back his shoes .
They might be his only pair .
The other sad thing is that Dubya seemed to enjoy the whole incident .
Well , maybe that ’s not so sad .
I can personally relate to the joys of having Weapons of Minor Destruction hurled in anger at my face .
Maybe Bush is a good old - fashioned punk rocker too .
The Shrub seemed to be thrilled by the display as evidence of a " free society . "
You know a free society where you can give visiting dignitaries the one - fingered victory salute and scream obscenities at political party conventions .
At such fun events one only needs fear being pummeled by hired goon squads or hauled off in the paddy wagon for … and I shudder at the thought … being a " journalist " like Amy Goodman of Democracy Now !
Forgive me while I take a moment to wash my mouth out with alcohol ( Stone Brewing Arrogant Bastard Ale ) for being a bad boy and uttering the J - word .
Yup , Bush should be pleased .
Mission accomplished .
Iraq is freer than the United States .
All thanks to him .
So … I guess we can go home now .
Uh… well … maybe the troops and contractors do n’t want to .
After all , they have more freedom in Nisoor Square than Times Square .
Aside from reveling in the lighthearted incident George made the comment : " I do n’t know what the guy ’s cause is . "
That ’s our anointed Shrubbery , delusional to the last .
No clue George ?
I ’m so relieved the past eight years have taught Dubya nothing .
The Big W supposed the shoe thrower was trying to draw attention to himself .
Yeah … well , maybe .
But do you imagine he might also be angry at the total destruction of Iraqi society and the deaths of something like 1.2 million Iraqis ?
Hm … at that rate , it ’s a good safe bet the shoe thrower knows at least a couple dead friends or family members , thanks to George ’s Liberation and gift of freedom .
Or possibly , the anger is subtler than that .
Maybe Abdul bin Hushpupi only lost his job and neighborhood .
Gee George … you think there might be one or two Iraqis with good cause to be angry with … you ?
Naw , that ’s too preposterous to even contemplate .
Well , sorry to be preposterous but the fact is , Iraq is a mess and the US is to blame .
And you George are at the top of the refuse heap of reconstruction and liberation .
As easy as it is to dodge a flying Birkenstock it ’s just as easy to dodge reality .
Forget about the dead , displaced , the ethnic cleansing , destroyed infrastructure and all that tedious old news .
How about something fresh and exciting to ignore ?
Here ’s a good one .
The new 512 - page report on the history of Iraqi " reconstruction , " prepared by the feds themselves and floating around in secure channels … and the New York Times .
As reported by the NY Times : " u2018 Hard Lessons : The Iraq Reconstruction Experience , ’ the new history was compiled by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , led by Stuart W. Bowen Jr. , a Republican lawyer who regularly travels to Iraq and has a staff of engineers and auditors based here . "
And what goodies lurk between the pages of Hard Lessons ?
Nothing " good " I assure you .
It simply chronicles officially what anybody paying attention already knows .
The US has been flushing billions of greenbacks down the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in a war profiteering orgy of incompetence and corruption .
Also reported in the NY Times : " Money for many of the local construction projects still under way is divided up by a spoils system controlled by neighborhood politicians and tribal chiefs .
u2018 Our district council chairman has become the Tony Soprano of Rasheed , in terms of controlling resources , ’ said an American Embassy official working in a dangerous Baghdad neighborhood .
u2018 You will use my contractor or the work will not get done . ’ "
Gee , what a surprising revelation .
The fact is , in wasting $ 117 billion the Wizards in Washington never had a clue what they were doing … and still do n’t .
Hey , build one open sewer of a Baghdad Police Academy why not build another ?
Strange how reconstruction projects are usually total disasters is n’t it ?
You would think of all nations familiar with this principle it would be the United States .
Oh … but our disastrous Reconstruction was so long ago , who cares … or is left alive to remember ?

Taneka Talley was stabbed to death in March 2006 while she was working as a clerk at a Dollar Tree store in Fairfield .
Her killer 's only motive , prosecutors say , is that she was African American .
That 's also the reason the store 's workers ' compensation insurer is denying $ 250,000 in death benefits to Talley 's 11 - year - old son .
The boy 's grandmother , the child 's legal guardian , said Specialty Risk Services is taking the position that a racially motivated killing is personal , not work - related - even though the man charged with killing Talley had never met her before .
The insurance company , Dollar Tree and their lawyers are n't talking publicly about the case but are defending their position before a state appeals board that hears workers ' compensation disputes .
" I think it 's unfair .
It 's discrimination , " said Carol Frazier of Vallejo , who gained custody of her grandson , Larry Olden , after her daughter 's death and is challenging the insurer 's refusal to pay in a case that eventually could go to court .
" They 're saying ( the killing ) did n't arise out of her employment , except that in this case she would n't have been killed if she had n't been at work , " said Frazier 's attorney , Moira Stagliano .
" This person did n't know her , just walked into the store and picked her out . "
The opposition by Dollar Tree and its insurers to paying benefits to Talley 's son represents an attempt to set new limits on California 's workers ' compensation system , under which a company provides benefits to employees or their survivors for work - related deaths or injuries regardless of whether the firm was at fault .
Businesses have long assailed the system as overly generous to employees and as expensive , complaints that led to passage of state laws in 2003 and 2004 tightening limits on what medical treatment is covered by compensation payments .
The man accused of stabbing Talley , Tommy Joe Thompson , 45 , of West Sacramento , is tentatively scheduled to go to trial Dec. 10 in Solano County Superior Court on a charge of murder .
If convicted , he could be sentenced to life in prison .
Talley , of Fairfield , was 26 and working full time at the Dollar Tree on North Texas Street to support herself and her young son .
She was stocking shelves just after 9 a.m. on March 29 , 2006 , when a man walked in and stabbed her , authorities said .
The killer fled .
Thompson was arrested that evening .
He had previously served a prison sentence for beating his young son in 1994 , records show .
At a hearing in March in which Thompson was found mentally competent to stand trial , a defense psychiatrist , Herb McGrew , testified that Thompson had told him he stabbed Talley because she was black .
Thompson is white .
" You know that he got up that morning , and he said , ' I 'm going to kill a black person , ' " said Deputy District Attorney Dane Neilson , according to a transcript of the hearing .
" She was , unfortunately , the first person he saw , correct ? "
" Correct , " McGrew replied .
An insurance company lawyer later cited that exchange in a letter to Stagliano defending the denial of benefits to Talley 's son .
" The doctors testify that Mr. Thompson 's motivation in stabbing Taneka Talley was purely race motivated , " attorney Kelly Hamilton wrote .
" As such , it is our belief that our denial in this matter is proper . "
The compensation law does n't consider an on - the - job injury to be work - related if the motives were entirely personal - for example , if an estranged lover or spouse comes to the workplace and attacks an employee because of a private grudge .
The line can be hard to draw when one worker assaults another for personal reasons or when the injured employee was on a personal errand or instigated the assault .
But Stagliano said Talley 's death was definitely job - related .
" Taneka Talley was at work , doing her job , when she was killed , " the lawyer said .
" If she had not been in that store , she would not have been available to ( the killer ) , and she would still be alive .
" It 's shocking that Dollar Tree and its insurance carrier are using the alleged racist motivation of a killer as an excuse to get out of paying benefits , " Stagliano said .
Frazier , who works for the Richmond Parks and Recreation Department , said her daughter had a $ 15,000 life insurance policy .
It covered burial expenses , she said , but is nowhere near enough to care for a growing boy who needs new clothes every six months .
" His mother worked hard on her job for him to get a good education , to go to college , " Frazier said .
Larry , now in sixth grade , is " a very good student , he loves sports , really good in basketball - a normal little boy , " she said .
" He misses his mom . "
Whether you voted for Barack Obama or not , the footage of the joyous faces and cheering crowds in Chicago ’s Grant Park and cities across the globe could not help but evoke a sense of national pride .
While his win is of course a symbolic milestone for African - Americans and other minority groups , the election of Obama is a momentous victory for a commonly misunderstood group of approximately 76 million Americans : Generation Y .
Loosely defined as people born between 1980 - 1995 , the “ MTV Generation ” or the so - called “ Trophy Kids , ” have faced an onslaught of complaints and negative commentary from older generations since our lives began .
As children , they said we were spoiled , coddled , and made lazy by rampant instant gratification .
Entering adolescence , they complained of our sarcasm and unbridled cynicism ; and when Columbine happened , they surmised that our exposure to video games and movies had rendered us “ de - sensitized ” to violence and out - of - touch with reality .
During the teen years , our Baby Boomer parents — who enjoyed the legal right to drink alcohol at 18 ( at least in some states ) — were shocked and outraged by statistics indicating a high number of Gen Y members were imbibing underage .
Moreover , the Boomers , themselves witnesses to and participants in the “ free love ” era , criticized our casual attitude toward the opposite sex , charging Gen Y with promiscuity , immorality , and no sense of romance .
When the Boomers ’ own George W. Bush and his impossible War on Terror grew increasingly unpopular , incessant whining about the political apathy of Gen Y could be heard from coast to coast as older Americans wondered why the Millennials were not storming on Washington and rioting in the streets .
Now , as we enter the workforce as adults , members of Gen Y are being profiled as demanding , difficult to work with , praise - mongering , and " high maintenance . "
Enough is enough .
Enter President - elect Obama .
With polls showing a record voter turnout from the allegedly apathetic 18 - 24 age group , a demographic which favored Mr. Obama two - one , it ’s evident that the Hawaiian - born Barry O was able to rally this cynical , sloth - like group of Americans to not just care about politics , but to support his cause overwhelmingly .
The Obama camp achieved this through acute comprehension of the experiences , needs , goals , ideals , and collective consciousness of the Millennial Generation .
For those of us born somewhere on the cusp of the Reagan and George H.W. Bush years , Obama ’s message of change is a concept that resonates with us differently and perhaps more profoundly than any other age group in America .
As we grew up over the past decade or so , many circumstances have fostered a great skepticism and a widespread feeling of unease , even outrage , amongst us .
Even before the mind - boggling War on Terror wreaked havoc on the American psyche and sense of nationality , Gen Y grew up with big American scandals .
Back in junior high when TVs were still box - shaped , we switched on the tube after school and gained a perfunctory albeit dysfunctional education on oral sex as we watched the 42nd U.S. President get impeached .
We lived through the highly publicized Enron debacle and watched Martha Stewart , the very embodiment of traditional American homemaker , go to jail for insider trading .
Worst of all , we lived through the most horrendous attack on U.S. soil and with young , fragile and impressionable minds tried to comprehend why .
After that tragic day in September , we experienced our lives change forever as the entire world transitioned into a post 9/11 existence .
As the complicated War on Terror began , some said Osama bin Laden was dead , some said he was still alive .
President Bush told us Iraq had WMDs , many told us it did n’t .
With no comprehensible positive outcome and a number of our own friends and classmates dying in the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan , American authority figures seemed a lot less credible .
We felt increasingly bogged down by the sensory overload of bullshit and bad news .
What was a lie ?
What was truth ?
What was the corporate - owned MSM telling us and what were they not ?
What , in essence , was our reality ?
We watched movies like American Psycho and American Beauty and played video games like “ Grand Theft Auto ” that echoed our discontent with authority and disillusionment with the American status quo .
Influenced by anti-establishment cinematic icons like Ferris Bueller , Peter Gibbons , Max Fischer and Chris McCandless , we felt inspired to challenge and reject America as it was .
The Obama camp successfully tapped into Gen Y’s feelings of instability and disillusionment and offered a long overdue message of hope that empathized with our sentiments and worn - out distrust of the current system .
They knew large numbers of us traveled and studied abroad and yearned for a new American identity after witnessing firsthand the disregard foreigners of our own generation had for our country .
With his signature composure , confidence and consistency , Obama emphasized MLK ’s notion of the “ fierce urgency of now ” and helped Gen Y realize it was ready to leave behind old ideologies and embrace an emergent global consciousness with more innovative solutions to humanity ’s current issues .
Equally important to the message itself , the Obama campaign was able to win over such a large number of us stultified , out - of - touch 18 - 24 - year - olds because they understood the importance of the new , revolutionary ways we communicate .
They acknowledged the technological savvy of the first generation to grow up with PCs , the Internet , and cell phones and accordingly , reached out to us aggressively in our very familiar realm of cyberspace .
They realized that Gen Y did not suffer from lackluster political interest , but in fact we were constantly talking politics amongst ourselves in new , more sophisticated forums — email , Facebook , text message , blog , vlog , and Skype — that allowed us to reach each other quickly and anywhere on the globe .
Obama ’s key aides and consultants realized that these tools and the global interconnectivity of Gen Y would be integral to the success of its grass - roots campaign and accordingly , launched the most successful e-campaign yet seen .
In this way , the Obama camp and the Practical Generation , the Innovative Kids , demonstrated that swarming to D.C. , ingesting hallucinogenic drugs and burning your bras were not what you needed to do anymore to be part of a large - scale political movement .
With his position as president now secured , the pioneering Obama team will continue to utilize the internet as an important global - reaching democratic apparatus , as it plans to deliver “ fireside chats ” and “ State of the World ” addresses via webcast .
Amusingly , when the news broke that Obama triumphed in large part due to the “ energized youth vote , ” critics of Obama and the Gen Y - hating talking heads who complained of our apathy and lethargy just months before , whined that perhaps we had been too “ idealistic , ” too “ hopeful ” in electing the less experienced candidate .
But look around people — what else is there left for us to be but hopeful ?
Given the current mushrooming of the American population — i.e. the majority of U.S. citizens will be aging ex-hippy Baby Boomers and the minority will be us — the Millennials are charged with the daunting task of caring for a geriatric population on top of all those other things like reversing the economic crisis , finding a way out of the Middle East , developing renewable energy , and helping the Third World .
As Thomas Friedman points out , “ There is a good chance that members of [ Generation Y ] will spend their entire adult lives digging out from the deficits that we — the ‘ Greediest Generation , ’ epitomized by George W. Bush — are leaving them . ”
In helping to articulate the ideals and goals of Gen Y , Obama has largely helped us to recognize our developing identity and our power to change the tremendous shortcomings of modern American life and the past failures of American policies .
To all the unfaithful pessimists of the political punditry who think the idealistic , clever , resourceful , and ever pragmatic Gen Y will not improve America ’s various deficiencies , there is only one constructive response and it is quite simple :
Yes , we will .

The head coach of British Swimming , Dennis Pursley , has given his backing to the revolt by leading European coaches over swimsuits after the number of world records set this year reached 105 at the European Short - Course Championships in Croatia .
Fifteen out of the 17 top European nations , including Great Britain , have signed a protest which is to be presented to the world governing body FINA calling for a number of regulations to be discussed and implemented .
Their concerns centre on the technological advances in the design of swimsuits and the fabrics used , with records starting to fall immediately after the introduction of the Speedo LZR Racer suit in February .
Within six weeks more than 15 world records had fallen and in Rijeka nine marks went , including four to Amaury Leveaux alone .
The Frenchman became the first man to break the 45 - second barrier in the 100 metres freestyle and his time of 44.94 means almost two seconds has been taken off Alex Popov 's record in just 13 months .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The materials used in the suits include polyurethane panels which help the swimmers become more streamlined through the water and neoprene , a flotation device .
As a result the swimmer is allowed more speed and buoyancy in the water and fatigue is delayed .
Pursley said : " It demeans the records and kind of cheapens them to an extent .
Up to this generation of suits I think it 's just been maximising performance but I think we 're crossing the line to enhancing performance and to me that is a whole different area . "
FINA are set to meet with coaches and suitmakers in the next two months and Pursley wants action to be taken .
He added : " There is a strong consensus in the coaching community that feel that at the very minimum there needs to be regulation and there needs to be monitoring and there needs to be a strict approval process .
And whatever is approved needs to be available to all the teams and all the athletes at least a minimum of 12 months in advance of the competition . "
FINA regulations state no device should aid buoyancy , speed and endurance but when questioned further at the World Short - Course Championships in Manchester in April , the governing body insisted the swimmers were not using a device , but simply wearing a suit .
Now Pursley wants FINA to take a strong lead as he fears the next step is for suits to be designed for individuals .
He added : " It 's opening the door to go in a whole different direction that can possibly advantage some athletes and some teams to go above and beyond others and that 's not to mention all the ramifications below the top level . "
Suits you , sir :
The science of speed
* NASA helped with the design of the suit .
* Tests were performed to show where the biggest drag occurred on a swimmer 's body in order that the suit might reduce this drag .
* Body scans of 400 elite athletes in order to develop an efficient suit pattern .
* Five per cent less effort to go the same speed – a swimmer can use less energy to go a given speed , so they therefore have more energy to go faster or hold that speed longer .
PRINCETON , N.J. , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) -- U.S. President George Bush remains popular among conservative Republicans , despite his low overall approval rating , Gallup poll results indicated Tuesday .
While averaging a dismal 29 percent job approval rating among all Americans , Bush enjoys a 72 percent approval rate among conservatives , results from the Gallup Poll Daily tracking indicated .

Only four groups -- independents , and Republicans who identify themselves as moderate , liberal or conservative -- gave Bush ratings higher than 40 percent , and all are defined by political points of view , the Princeton , N.J. , polling agency said .
Because membership in these four groups overlaps -- such as Republicans and conservative Republicans -- Gallup reported Americans who are both Republicans and conservatives hold Bush in high esteem .
At the other end of the spectrum , groups giving Bush his lowest average approval ratings is dominated by left - leaning political groups , Gallup said .
Results are based on nationwide telephone interviews Dec. 1 - 9 with more than 9,000 adults .
The margin of error is 1 percentage point .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Sometimes a sharp phone can cut both ways .
AT&T saw its profits trimmed a little as its popular Apple iPhone turned into a huge sales success .
The Dallas phone giant missed Wall Street 's adjusted earnings expectations by 4 cents a share in the third quarter as iPhone - related sales costs eroded margins .
AT&T says it spent $ 900 million in the quarter on iPhone sales - that 's a whopping $ 375 in upfront costs for every new iPhone customer .
The impact of these expenses on earnings came as a surprise to investors and , it seems , the company , which had warned in July that iPhone sales would likely cut 11 cents per share off the bottom line this year .
But in Tuesday 's earnings announcement , AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) said the iPhone cost the company a dime a share in the third quarter alone , as it forked over an estimated $ 300 or more of its own cash to keep the price of the iPhone at $ 199 .
AT&T says it sold 2.4 million iPhones in the quarter , helping to attract 1.7 million net new post - paid subscribers .
This is a company milestone and an impressive achievement given the slowdown in wireless growth and the slump in consumer spending .
However , investors were not pleased by the drag on profits from the sensational iPhone performance .
AT&T shares were down 6 % Wednesday .
Apple ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) , meanwhile rose 7 % .
For its part , AT&T chief Randall Stephenson defended the costly exclusive arrangement with Apple and says the dilution will be less in the fourth quarter and even less in the first quarter of next year .
" We are confident the investment we made this quarter will generate significant returns , " Stephenson said on a conference call with analysts Wednesday .
The winner here , of course is Apple , which had a blowout iPhone sales performance , with 6.9 million of its iconic touchscreen phones sold in its fiscal fourth quarter .
Analysts cautioned that AT&T is taking a greater immediate risk for the sake of winning market share from rivals by taking their higher - paying customers .
Meanwhile , writes JPMorgan analyst Mike McCormack , AT&T is " transferring shareholder wealth to Apple . "
The painful costs of AT&T's iPhone success highlights the harsh effects of the telcos ' ongoing subsidy war .
With the rise in popularity of the more expensive smartphones like the iPhone and Research in Motion 's ( RIMM ) BlackBerry , AT&T , Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) and Sprint ( S , Fortune 500 ) have been underwriting bigger chunks of the phones ' costs in an effort to lure customers away from rivals .
This competitive pressure takes a big toll on cash flow at a time when AT&T is trying to dig out from under a $ 64 billion debt pile .
" In the current macroeconomic climate , this does n't seem very constructive , but in the rearview mirror it looks like the right move , " says Roger Entner with Nielsen IAG .
" You 've given people devices that gets them to spend $ 20 more a month with you . "
News of Wikipedia being blocked over controversial content usually originates out of countries like China , but this week 's Wikipedia drama comes courtesy the UK .
Thanks to a recommendation by the British watch group Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) , ISPs across the country blocked access to one or more pages on Wikipedia 's site , with some blocking access altogether .
Although the IWF has since backed down and removed the offending content from its list , questions still remain about the organization 's power to cause such widespread censorship .
According to a new statement posted to IWF 's website , the organization reconsidered the age of the controversial image at Wikipedia — a 1976 album cover by the Scorpions — and its wide availability online .
Although the IWF believes that the album cover could potentially be in breach of the Protection of Children Act of 1978 , the fact that the image is some 32 years old and posted pretty much everywhere on the Internet ( especially after this week ) has prompted the IWF to remove it from its list of illegal content .
" Any further reported instances of this image which are hosted abroad , will not be added to the list , " wrote the IWF .
" Any further reported instances of this image which are hosted in the UK will be assessed in line with IWF procedures . "
The controversy originates around the cover of a Scorpions album titled Virgin Killer .
The image pictures a naked girl who appears to be under the age of 18 , with a strategically - placed image of cracked glass over her .
The cover is featured on Wikipedia 's page about the album , as is traditional for most albums with entries on the site .
The IWF says that the image on Wikipedia was reported through the organization 's website and assessed by the IWF at that time .
" The content was considered to be a potentially illegal indecent image of a child under the age of 18 , but hosted outside the UK , " said the IWF .
As a result , the organization consulted with law enforcement and notified one partner agency overseas , and then added the URL to a list provided to local ISPs of sites that contain potentially illegal images of children .
That 's when things went crazy .
Some ISPs decided to block just the image , while others blocked the entire page ( text included ) , while others blocked all of Wikipedia — reports of the incident are all over the map .
Wikipedia users were unsurprisingly irked by the sudden decision to block various parts of the site due to an image that has been in public circulation for some 22 years .
Many have noted that the very same album cover is still featured on other web sites , including Amazon , that are allowed through the ISPs in question .
" The Internet Watch Foundation were clearly over reaching their remit when they blocked the text page on Wikipedia — there 's nothing illegal about the description of the album .
I 'd also question their wisdom about trying to block the image itself , " Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales told the UK - based Channel 4 News in response to the ban .
Wales pointed out the apparent discrimination against Wikipedia when the controversial image is still hosted on web sites around the world .
" As a result of their actions , the image is actually being seen by more people , it 's appearing on thousands of blogs today .
It will continue to be passed on .
What are they going to do ?
Are they going to block all of the web if it continues to be spread ? "
It 's certainly a good question .
Just because the IWF has backed down over the Virgin Killer album cover ( and only internationally - hosted versions of it ) does n't rule out similar occurences in the future .
What happens if people start reporting every instance of another controversial image and the ISPs react similarly each time ?
With concerns over potential Internet censorship already looming in the UK , this latest Wikipedia incident is going to have reverberations , despite the fact that access is already being restored .

Oversight – public relations and spin have replaced disclosure and transparency ; casual yet complex accounting and accommodating rating agencies left us blissfully unaware of the problems , and we revelled in our ignorance .

Feminist myths ' are making equality laws unfair to men '
Further sex equality legislation should be stopped because it is unfair to men , according to an analysis published by a Labour think tank .
The idea that all women at work are victims of discrimination is a ' feminist myth ' , argued a senior academic .
Many want to raise families rather than pursue careers .
' The myth that all or most women would be just as careerist as men , if only they were given the opportunity , has been exploded , ' Dr Catherine Hakim said .
While women can choose between work and family , men have fewer choices , a senior academic said
' The trend towards flexibility in the workforce has also made it clearer that some occupations and jobs will never be family friendly . '
The call from Dr Hakim will provoke unease among ministers and Labour MPs because it has been published by the Institute for Public Policy Research , the party 's most influential think tank over the past decade .
Business Secretary Peter Mandelson is already thinking about whether to push on with planned new family - friendly laws next spring because of their impact on small businesses .
However , the Government 's Equality Commission and feminist ministers are determined to bring in laws to combat what they see as widespread prejudice against women workers .
Dr Hakim , a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics , said : ' The most misleading feminist myth is that women are united in their goals and priorities .
' Around one quarter of women - and men - now remain childless , mostly by choice , and their interests and priorities differ substantially from those of parents .
' I predict that men will continue to dominate in the workforce and public life while women will continue to dominate in family life , even in the absence of sex discrimination , because there are some residual differences in tastes , values and lifestyle choices that have a cumulative impact . '
In a direct challenge to the official Whitehall view , she declared : ' So why do feminists continue to demand a strengthening of gender equality laws ?
' Largely because feminists continue to manufacture myths about women 's oppression . '
Dr Hakim said that while women could choose between work and family , men had fewer choices .
' Perhaps equality legislation should address this imbalance , ' she said
An iPhone hacker has successfully ported the open source Linux kernel to Apple 's popular mobile device .
Although the port is still at a very early stage of development and currently only supports a slim subset of the iPhone 's capabilities , it demonstrates the versatility of the Linux kernel and the ingenuity of iPhone modding enthusiasts .
The port was announced in a blog entry last week .
The post also includes a link to a video that demonstrates the software booting on an actual iPhone .
The lead developer , who writes under the pseudonym " planetbeing " , says that the port has a framebuffer driver and support for serial - over - USB , but still lacks critical features such as touchscreen support , sound , baseband and WiFi support , and accelerometer drivers .
The port includes a custom bootloader that enables users to choose whether to boot Linux or the iPhone 's own operating system at startup .
The code is distributed under GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) and is available from a GitHub repository .
Instructions that describe how to install it from an Ubuntu Linux computer are also available .
Because the port does n't have full touchscreen drivers yet , the only way to interact with the system is by using a keyboard on a host system that is connected to the iPhone via USB .
The port includes BusyBox , a collection of core GNU userspace utilities embedded in a single lightweight executable .
It provides the ash command shell and enough basic commands to manage and interact with a mobile Linux platform .
The port is a very big first step , but it is still very far from offering a viable alternative software platform for the iPhone .
The developers hope to expand on the porting effort and eventually bring Google 's Linux - based Android operating system to the device .
Some early Android porting experiments performed by other developers indicate that this could eventually be possible , but it 's definitely not going to be easy .
It 's likely that implementing baseband support will prove especially difficult .
Android was recently ported to the BeagleBoard , a hackable ARM board that was designed by TI for the hobbyist market .
The developers behind the OpenMoko project are also working on a porting effort , with the aim of putting Android on the FreeRunner handset .
The Android / iPhone port wo n't be completed overnight , and there are also some limitations of the Android user interface that will have to be addressed before it can be used practically on other kinds of devices .
For example , Android was designed for devices with full qwerty keyboards , so it does n't yet have an onscreen keyboard — a weakness that Google plans to fix at some point in 2009 .
The open source software community has been bringing alternative open software platforms to Apple 's portable devices for several years .
One previous example is the Rockbox project , which provides open replacement firmware for iPods and other digital audio players .
The new iPhone Linux project could eventually bring that same openness and freedom of choice to the iPhone and iPod Touch products .
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on Friday confirmed that it will abandon its practice of suing individuals for online piracy in favor of working with Internet service providers to track down offenders .
The Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) on Friday confirmed that it will abandon its practice of suing individuals for online piracy in favor of working with Internet service providers to track down offenders .
The RIAA is partnering with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and several undisclosed ISPs in order to alert the ISPs rather than the individual customer when it finds people who are swapping pirated tracks online .
This tactic has been used for some time now by the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) .
Cuomo will encourage ISPs to participate in this voluntary effort , which will be executed via a graduated response .
Instead of the RIAA sending lawsuits directly to consumers , the RIAA would notify the ISPs , who would then contact their customers .
People who ignore the warnings from their ISPs could be subject to a slowdown in service or loss of service completely , according to the Wall Street Journal , which first reported the story Friday morning .
In exchange for this voluntary system , record companies have agreed to stop suing individuals for thousands of dollars per download , a system that has resulted in RIAA lawsuits against everyone from teenagers to unwitting grandmothers .
The RIAA will also stop longer sent pre-litigation letters to colleges and filing " John Doe " lawsuits .
Pending lawsuits , however , will continue , and record companies have the right to sue those individuals who ignore the warnings from their ISPs .
Washington - based interest group Public Knowledge praised the plan , but expressed concern about consumers losing service and possible invasions of privacy .
Public Knowledge has " no objections " to the RIAA working with ISPs , but " we want to make certain that customers are not cut off from their Internet service or have their service altered solely on the basis of a claim by a copyright holder that file sharing is taking place , " Public Knowledge president and co-founder Gigi Sohn said in a statement .
Sohn also said that " any arrangements between RIAA and the ISPs should not involve the invasion of customer privacy through the filtering of Internet content .
The public deserves to know more about these processes before they are put into place . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) said the move was " long overdue " but also had some concerns .
" The recording industry will continue to press the thousands of pending lawsuits , presumably pushing for the usual four figure settlements , " EFF senior staff attorney Fred von Lohmann wrote in a blog post .
" How is it going to feel to be the last college student to settle in a fight that the recording industry has now admitted is n't worth the candle ? "
EFF also speculated that the graduated response would result in more music fans being " harrassed " by the RIAA .
" The problem is the lack of due process for those accused , " von Lohmann wrote .
" In a world where hundreds of thousands ( or millions ) of copyright infringement allegations are automatically generated and delivered to ISPs , mistakes are going to be made . "
Arts +Labs , a partnership between the Songwriters Guild of America and several leading technology and entertainment companies , praised the RIAA deal as " creative , positive and collaborative " approach .
" Experience has shown that most consumers will respond positively and switch to legal alternatives for future content downloads when they are informed that their downloading activities are inappropriate and that other easy - to - use , legal sources are widely available , " the group said in a statement .

The Only Thing Worse Than Viruses …
Our CTO once said :
“ The only thing worse than viruses — is virus protection software .
And the only thing worse than virus protection software — is free virus protection software . ”
So true .
The most frustrating bug reports we get at Newsvine are the seemingly random ones .
We ’ll get a cluster of reports from people who all of a sudden can’t vote , ca n’t comment , or ca n’t perform some other necessary function .
And none of the bug reporters seem to share common characteristics like what browser they are using , what proxy they are behind , or anything else .
On more than one occasion , the common thread has turned out to be that they had a certain anti-virus or “ internet security ” product installed on their machine .
The havoc that some of these programs wreak on HTML , javascript , and general HTTP connections is astounding to me sometimes .
I remember one instance where one of our image calls was to a file called “ poke.gif?ad=whatever ” .
The image was not a decorative element but a functional element which was necessary for dealing with our transactional logs .
It took days to figure out that the mere use of the word “ ad ” caused Norton to block the request completely .
If we changed the word “ ad ” to “ glad ” the problem was solved .
And even more paradoxically , if you just put an ampersand in front of the word “ ad ” , that also solved the problem .
Simply maddening , although it was a frustrating enough episode to at least plant a little bug in all of our heads about virus “ protection ” software : if you ’re trying to squash a bug that seems illogical or is n’t easily reproducible , always consider that it could be because of a user ’s security software .
Last night , I was trying to debug a problem with Newsvine ’s new commenting system with a user who was having issues , and it turns out he is using “ CA Internet Security Suite ” which came free with his RoadRunner broadband service .
I downloaded this thing and installed it into my Windows XP instance running inside of VMWare Fusion .
Oh my god is this software bad .
The first thing it does after it installs itself is to run a scan on my system .
It then gives me an extremely alarmist dialog box telling me my system has been “ infected with 36 instances of spyware ” .
It lists the spyware inside the dialog box .
All 36 pieces of “ spyware ” are actually just harmless ( and functional ) cookies from places like Newsvine and AT&T .
Just for kicks , I hit “ Remove ” and of course it prompts me to spend $ 70 for the full version just so it can clear my cookies .
Brilliant .
So then I open up a web browser and I notice that the CA software is now checking every single server call the browser makes against its database of “ safe ” and “ unsafe ” sites , slowing the browsing experience down to a crawl .
And then , just for kicks , I try to visit my Newsvine page at http://mike.newsvine.com, and here ’s the dialog box I get :
Blocked from my own site !
Because it ’s a “ dating site ” !
Ridiculous .
We have n’t resolved our problem yet with the commenting system , but something tells me it has something to do with this stuff .
Having used a Mac for the last 24 years , I ’ve just never really had to use anti-virus software .
It ’s a rude awakening seeing how the other half lives , in this case .
If I used Windows on a daily basis , I think I ’d opt not to use anti-virus software at all and instead set up automatic restore points once or twice a week .
VMWare Fusion lets you do restore points automatically which is really nice .
If I happen to contract a virus one day , I can just roll my machine back a few days and get rid of it .
Much better than having the Norton / CA gestapo stomping on my face every time I try to make a simple HTTP call .

WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors in Washington likely face an uphill fight in their case against five indicted Blackwater Worldwide guards who are expected to surrender to authorities Monday .
The case is crucial for the Justice Department , which is struggling to show it can hold U.S. security contractors accountable , as well as for Iraqi leaders , who have just stripped legal immunity from foreign guards .
The five Blackwater guards , protecting a State Department convoy , were involved in a Sept. 16 , 2007 , shooting incident ...

NBC will keep Jay Leno five nights a week , but in prime time , competing not with David Letterman , but with shows like “ CSI : Miami . ”
The network will announce Tuesday that Mr. Leno ’s new show will appear at 10 o’clock each weeknight in a format similar to “ The Tonight Show , ” which he has hosted since 1992 .
Five years ago NBC announced that it would hand the job of host of that franchise show to Conan O’Brien in May 2009 .
Since then the network has maneuvered to try to keep Mr. Leno , who continues to be the late - night ratings leader , fearing that he could leave and start a new late - night show on a competitor ’s network .
“ The Tonight Show ” is seen at 11:35 weeknights .
Mr. Leno , 58 , was known to have suitors , including ABC , the Fox network and the Sony television studio .
But he was apparently persuaded to stay at NBC after aggressive personal wooing by Jeff Zucker , the chief executive of NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric .
Updated : 11/21/08
To the owner of DesktopNexus.com — a site dedicated to sharing user - submitted desktop wallpaper — it sounded as if the attorney from the Toyota Motor Corporation on the phone was reading from a script .
He was basically repeating the same demand that Toyota had made over the course of six months in several emails :
The car giant wanted Harry Maugans to remove all images on his site containing a Toyota , Lexus and Scion gallery .
What was n’t clear — because Toyota did not submit a Digital Millennium Copyright
Act takedown notification — was whether Toyota was claiming ownership of any image containing one of their cars .
That radical claim would be enough to shivers down the spine of any gearhead .
“ I asked them for all the information that would be included in a DMCA request , including who owned the image , ” Maugans told Wired.com .
The attorney , who identified himself as Garrett Biggs , told Maugans that if he wanted that specific information , he would have to pay for it to be gathered .
No such payment has been made , and Maugans has n’t budged .
“ I have n't deleted a single Toyota , Lexus , or Scion image since any of this started . ”
Maugans ’ stand seems ballsy when you consider the size and legal power of a massive conglomerate like Toyota .
Yet Fred von Lohmann , Senior Intellectual Property Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation , feels Maugans ' refusal to take down the images is justified .
“ He does n’t have to respond , ” von Lohmann told Wired.com .
“ Toyota is on shaky ground here . ”
Since Toyota is not in the business of selling desktop wallpapers , von Lohmann sees that Toyota has no grounds to request that the images be removed unless they were created or owned by the company itself .
“ Toyota is selling cars , not car designs .
It ’s a very thin copyright . ”
As a site filled with user submissions , von Lohmann feels that DesktopNexus definitely fits into the class of sites — like
YouTube — protected by the DMCA , which allows for a safe harbor for site owners as long as they comply with proper takedown requests from copyright owners .
And ownership of the images is definitely the key issue in this controversy .
“ I showed him a couple of images that were definitely not
Toyota promotional photos , and the attorney would n’t say Toyota owned them , ” Maugans said .
Claiming copyright ownership is serious business .
If Toyota or anyone who makes a takedown request claims ownership of any image or media that is n’t truly theirs , they can be liable for perjury .
“ The message here is we can make your life very difficult , ” von Lohmann told us .
He feels that attempts like this to monitor fan activity are part of a larger effort by car companies .
While carmakers love to stir up “ viral ” conversation about their models , they ’re also very worried that the discussion can get out of hand .
Von Lohmann points to the attempt by Ford a few years ago to force sites with Mustang in their name to find new urls as an example of overreaching by automakers .
“ MacWorld has a right to have Mac in its name , ” von Lohmann said , and MustangHeaven.com has the right to use
Mustang in its name
And things are n’t going well for Toyota — and not just when it comes to sales .
Since news about Toyota ’s requests came out , users have been submitting some less than flattering images of Toyotas that no one would claim were official promotional images .
Maugans ' reluctance to bend immediately to a request from the lawyer of a multi-billion dollar corporation shows some insulation against the chilling effects of potentially unwarranted rights claims .
Yet other site owners who are n’t aware of the ins-and - outs of DMCA notifications may have taken down the content immediately , shuddering the kind of hardcore fandom that ’s at the core of using a
Scion or a Lexus as your desktop wallpaper .
“ These wallpapers are great advertisements for Toyota , ” said Maugans who insists that he ’s definitely willing to follow the law .
“ I want to make sure this is done correctly , ” he said .
So the ball is in your court , Toyota .
Submit a complete DMCA takedown notification , or let the poor guy be .
Update : Response from Toyota to DesktopNexus
The recent request Toyota made to have certain photos of Toyota vehicles removed from the public wallpaper site , DesktopNexus , was the result of an internal miscommunication .
To protect the legal rights and agreements we have with the photographers we hire , we ask that the photographs not be used for direct consumer advertising , sales brochures and the like .
If people wish to post their own photos of one of their own vehicles , that 's their right .
In fact , we 're pleased that people would want to show their Toyota vehicles to the world .
So have at it .
Consider the wallpapers on DesktopNexus to be fair game for personal use .
Please let your users know that we offer a sincere apology to the DesktopNexus site and its users for any inconvenience or disruption this miscommunication may have caused .
Thanks for your understanding ,

When challenging the maxim that Taxation is Theft , some people like to make an analogous argument : “ Think of it as rent , ” they say .
( I saw this on a reddit discussion about one of my posts . )
OK , let ’s think of it as rent A non-negotiable rent .
Backed by the “ social contract , so - called , a complete fiction which no man ever accepted because it was never lawfully offered , and one which may at any moment be unilaterally altered by the Landlord , who may reduce the quality of the services , add more services for which the tenant has n’t asked ( yet for which he still has to pay ) , may raise the rent , may reclaim the property , may evict the tenants on a lark , etc .
That ’s not the sort of rental agreement that free men would tolerate .
It is not rent if there ’s no way out .
The Antebellum slaves were not “ renting ” their lodging , and “ buying ” their sustenance with their labor ?
The difference is only one of degree ; we may have access to more property than they did in their time , but we ’re not “ renting ” our livelihood any more than they were .
It ’s not rent if there ’s literally nowhere to go without having to rent , from essentially the same landlord .
Since the tenants ( i.e. , taxpayers ) simply have no method by which they can opt - out , i.e , you ca n’t buy allodial title , it ’s only reasonable to conclude that taxes are definitely not rent .
Instead , they more closely resemble a feudal tribute , they are a “ fee ” which you are obliged under pain of death to pay “ voluntarily ” in exchange for “ services ” that you ca n’t opt not to purchase .
Rothbard was fond of describing taxes as “ ransom for permission to live ” , that fits .
Theft by any other name is still theft .

Helena Smith reports from Athens and discusses the social factors that led to the civil unrest Reuters
A general strike shut down schools , hospitals , flights and public services across Greece yesterday , touching off more riots that left dozens injured and the government severely shaken after five days of unprecedented civil unrest .
Stone - throwing youths fought pitched battles with riot police outside the Athens parliament as thousands of striking workers , in a separate demonstration , chanted their way through the capital .
Amid screams of " let parliament burn " , protesters hurled petrol bombs , marble slabs and pieces of cement at police who responded by firing rounds of teargas into the air .
The clashes , triggered by the police shooting of 15 - year old Alexandros Grigoropoulos , are the worst disturbances to hit Greece since the end of military rule in 1974 .
Mobs have laid siege to cities nationwide plundering public buildings , stores and cars before setting fire to them .
With the country shut down and Greece 's links to the world cut as a result of the strike , the conservative administration - already clinging onto power by a single seat in the 300 member House - found itself facing a political crisis .
Addressing the nation in a bid to contain the tensions , the prime minister , Costas Karamanlis , yesterday pledged financial support for those who had been materially affected and promised to protect individuals from further violence .
But opposition over the free - market conservatives ' fiscal policies and plans to privatise hospitals and schools is unlikely to fade soon .
Support for the government , even from the most diehard conservatives , has dropped , with 70 % telling pollsters they have mishandled the crisis .
" These protests are our answer to a government that always closes the doors in our face , " said student Yiannis Yiapitsakis .
Symbolic of the fear and loathing gripping Greece is the makeshift shrine erected on the spot in Athens where Grigoropoulos was shot dead .
In handwritten notes , cards , paintings and poems , Greeks of all ages not only honoured the young " martyr " but gave testimony to a country that appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
" You have paid for what people like me who belong to the generation of 50 - year - olds , know to be true , " wrote one father in a note placed on top of a pile of roses , candles and plants .
" That we are shaking with worry over the future of our children . "
Yesterday , according to a lawyer for the two police officers accused in the fatal shooting , a ballistic examination revealed that the schoolboy had died as a result of an accident after the bullet ricocheted .
Kim Elliott :
As you outline so well in your book and in various interviews in the U.S. media , the current financial crisis holds the possibility of being one of those moments when the shock doctrine can best be applied .
Can you comment on both the Harper government 's economic and fiscal statement introduced last week , and on the Opposition 's response to that - that is , the formation of a coalition - in the context of the shock doctrine ?
Naomi Klein : Yes , absolutely .
What I think we are seeing is a clear example of the shock doctrine in the way the Harper government has used the economic crisis to push through a much more radical agenda than they won a mandate to do .
At the same time we are seeing an example of what I call in the book a " shock resistance , " where this tactic has been so overused around the world and also in Canada that we are becoming more resistant to the tactic - we are on to them - and Harper is not getting away with it .
What I think is really amazing about this moment is whatever happens next - whether we end up with this coalition or not , we will have an extremely chastened Harper .
So the attempted shock doctrine has failed .
I think we can say that decisively .
Just to be clear , what I mean by the shock doctrine , as you know , is the use of crisis to push through unpopular pro-corporate policies .
This bundling of a whole package of policies : denying the right of public sector workers to strike , the attack on public financing of political parties , with the economic program - that is what failed , and people were offended by the opportunism of it .
This is what so many of us were worried about during the election - the context of a Tory victory in an economic crisis , because we know that there is this pattern of using an economic crisis to push through policies that were nowhere during the campaign .
KE :
This coalition gives us lots of opportunities , but it also poses some risks if it is successful .
I 'd like to ask you about that .
In an interview you had on Democracy Now ! , you said that part of the reason that Obama was appointing a host of neo-liberal economists was because there was a lack of " intellectual honesty " among progressives about the real legacy of the Clinton years .
Does the Canadian left , in a Liberal - led coalition , risk losing our understanding of the neo-liberal legacy of the Liberals , who during those same Clinton years were ripping up Canada 's welfare state , cutting social spending etc ?
NK : I think it is really important to remember , and I 've written about this in the book , and Linda McQuaig has written about it extensively , that it is the Liberals who actually implemented what I 'm describing in Canada .
They were elected on an economic stimulus platform in 1993 , with a huge mandate .
The Tories were wiped out in those historic elections .
And then they caved to pressure from Bay Street , from the corporate media and from the right - wing think tanks in the face of the debt crisis .
They turned around and broke their election promises when it came to NAFTA , when it came to job creation , and the famous 1995 Paul Martin budget came down which did so much damage to unemployment insurances ( which makes it particularly interesting that a key piece of the agreement for the coalition is about strengthening unemployment insurance ) .
So we need to have long memories about the Liberals , because they have done exactly what Harper has just done , in terms of using an economic crisis for a neo -liberal about turn .
That said , what I find most exciting about what is going on right now - beyond just getting rid of Harper , which is exciting in and of itself - is that we have this opportunity to show what proportional representation ( PR ) would look like , because all of this talk that this is a coup is a joke .
What is being proposed by this coalition is much closer to representative democracy than what we have right now , which is a government that has [ slightly more than ] 35 per cent of the popular vote in a turnout that was historically low , of 59 per cent of Canadian voters , which means that even though the Tories won more seats they had fewer actual votes than in the last election .
I think it is really important to talk about democracy , about what it actually means in this period .
In some ways I think it is even more important than talking about the policies , because our electoral system is broken .
Because of the Tories ' extraordinary opportunism and terrible calculation we now have an opportunity to see a better version of democracy and see more people represented in government .
To me the best case scenario that could come out of this is , one , you get the coalition , and , two , the NDP uses this moment to really launch a national discussion about why we need PR and that that becomes one of the things that comes out of this crisis .
Now , they do n't have the mandate for that right now , but we could come out of this with a national referendum on proportional representation .
People might actually like it , which would be really , really exciting .
KE : That is a very exciting possibility , and I wanted to ask you , if this coalition is successful , what are the two or three key issues that the NDP should focus on , the kinds of issues that were not covered in the agreement ?
NK : They 've put in writing what they 've agreed to .
I think it is going to maybe be up to the NDP to make sure that the EI improvements are protected .
KE : I 'm thinking of those issues that were not in the agreement like PR , or like withdrawal from Afghanistan - those issues that were not nailed down in the agreement .
NK : Those issues were n't nailed down because there is n't agreement on them , and that I think it is not really about whether the NDP holds the line on these issues , but about how the NDP uses this platform .
It is a historic opportunity , I think , to be very bold , not just because of what is happening in this country , but because of what is happening globally .
Another important role for the NDP , beyond putting proportional representation on the agenda , withdrawal from Afghanistan , is also the terms of the bailout .
The bailout for the auto industry is part of their agreement , but we do n't know what the terms of that agreement are going to be , and that is going to be really important in terms of negotiating a progressive automobile industry bailout - a green auto industry bailout , if such a thing is possible .
So that is a very important role that the NDP could play .
I think the best analogy , in terms of the kinds of concerns you are raising in regards to the Liberals and neo-liberalism , of being the party that continued and deepened Mulroney 's neo-liberal economic program , is to look at Gordon Brown .
He was finance minister for Tony Blair , really the face of neo-liberalism in Britain .
He is now overseeing what many are calling the death of New Labour , and the return to Keynesian economics in Britain .
That is because he is fighting for his political life .
That is because he was going down , until he started talking this way .
That is really what is at stake for the Liberals , I think .
This is also why I think the issue of political financing for political parties is so key .
The reason there is a little more latitude in Canada on these issues is because our political process is not massively owned by corporations as it is in the United States .
The way in which public financing for political parties has been presented in the press is " oh the politicians , they just got mad when they went after their money , " right ?
This is another key point that I think is somewhat related to the issue of proportional representation .
We need to be talking about our political process here , and the issue of public financing for political parties in elections is key to protecting and deepening democracy in Canada , and for keeping it out of corporate control .
It is not for nothing that the Tories are attacking that .
They see attacking public financing of political parties as a way to entrench their power .
KE : Should this coalition become government , what should we as progressive movements be doing in terms of using this as an opportunity to promote these kinds of progressive agendas , to support the NDP in a predominantly Liberal caucus ?
NK : I think it is PR , I really think that is the way in .
By pushing PR then it is not just about this one crisis .
It is about leveraging this situation to have a more democratic system .
It means that if the NDP does deeply disappoint us in this moment we could still end up with a better political system .
KE : Should the coalition happen what do you see as the long - term fall - out in terms of western voters in Canada ?
NK : I really think that we need to fight back this strategy .
We know what the talking points are from the right and from the West , and it is about playing up this idea of making a coalition with the Bloc , " with the separatists . "
What to me is so extraordinary is the temper tantrum being thrown in Alberta right now at the prospect of having to be ruled by a majority - by a coalition of parties representing the majority of the people in this country .
I really do think it is worth asking who the real separatists are , because of course the undercurrent of everything they are saying is that they will take our oil .
So who are the real separatists ?
KE : Do you agree then that we should be out there supporting the coalition ?
Attending rallies , mobilizing letter - writing campaigns ?
NK : Absolutely .
Listen , we 've been given a second chance , after these elections .
What is exciting about it is that a lot of people did get involved in the election to try to beat the Tories .
Maybe it started a little bit too late .
We were surprised a bit by how quickly the election happened , but you saw a lot of people getting involved in things like voteforenviroment .ca and the Department of Culture .
That was very much the spirit of it , it was anything but the Tories and it was kind of building a PR system without the cooperation of the political parties that got a lot of people excited during this election .
It was about just doing an end - run around the political parties who were not cooperating to try to keep out the Tories .
So , what is exciting about this political moment , and how people can get involved , is that this is building on that .
The political parties caught up with the grassroots movement that was happening anyway with those initiatives like voteforenvironment .
ca , Department of Culture , and people like Murray Dobbin who have been making these arguments pretty steadily outside of the political parties .
Now it is happening , and it is happening thanks to Stephen Harper and his extraordinary arrogance and over - reaching .
We can't lose this moment .
I just want to emphasize this point :
If even through smart tactics , Harper pulls this off , if he prorogues Parliament ; if the Governor General lets him get away with it ; if the Liberals lose their nerve over Xmas , then the Harper we will have in January will be a deeply chastened Harper .
What everybody agrees with is that he made a massive error , that he massively overreached , and his own party , his own base agrees with that .
Worst case scenario we dodged a bullet here .
Best case scenario , we leverage his overreach , his attempt to use a crisis to push through his ideological pro-corporate agenda to have a deeper democracy in our country , and to prevent forevermore a situation where a party with 35 per cent of the vote is government .

One of the most exciting aspects of the PlayStation 3 is that it allows users to install an alternative operating system .
You can't overwrite Sony 's GameOS or access privileged resources , but you can run your own applications on the new Cell Broadband Engine processor ( called the " CBE processor " or the " Cell " for short ) .
The Cell is the mighty brain of the PlayStation 3 , and this article explains how to access it by installing Linux on the console .
Brief Introduction to the Cell Processor
Before you start the installation , it helps to have a basic understanding of the target system .
The Cell is composed of nine processing cores -- eight Synergistic Processor Units ( SPUs ) and one Power Processor Unit ( PPU ) .
The SPUs were designed for high - speed number crunching , and each operates on multiple values at once .
When you read about the Cell 's performance in Folding@Home or in the Roadrunner supercomputer , the extraordinary speed is provided by the SPUs .
The PPU , on the other hand , was designed for general - purpose processing .
It 's not particularly fast , but it 's well suited for running an operating system and managing the SPUs .
You can think of the PPU as the coachman in an eight - horse carriage ; it makes high - level decisions and keeps the horses in line .
An Overview of the Linux - PS3 Installation Process
When installing Linux , the first task is to choose a distribution .
FixStars Solutions ( recent acquisitor of TerraSoft ) provides Yellow Dog Linux specifically for the Cell processor .
Many users have also had success with Ubuntu and Debian .
However , IBM's Cell Software Development Kit ( SDK ) is only supported on Fedora Core 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 .
For this reason , this discussion focuses on installing Fedora Core 9 on the PS3 .
The process consists of four main steps :
Obtain the Fedora Core 9 ISO for the PowerPC and burn it to a DVD .
Download the PS3 Add - on Tools ISO and burn it to a CD .
Reformat the PS3 hard drive to support Linux .
Install Linux using the add - on tools .
The rest of this article explains these steps in detail .
Part I : Obtain the Linux ISO for the PowerPC
The PPU 's architecture is based on IBM's PowerPC specification , so you 'll need the distribution of Fedora Core 9 that targets the PowerPC .
The following steps show how to obtain it .
Open a Web browser and go here .
Find a mirror site for your location .
In the column labeled Content , click on one of the transfer protocols ( http , ftp , or rsync ) .
In the mirror 's directory hierarchy , open the releases folder , then 9 , then Fedora , then ppc , then iso .
Save Fedora-9 - ppc-DVD.iso to your computer and burn it to a DVD .
Part II : Download the PS3 Bootloader
Open a Web browser and go here .
Save the CELL - Linux - CL_date - ADDON.iso file to your computer .
Burn this file onto a CD .
To boot an alternative OS on the PS3 , you need a PS3 - compatible bootloader .
The following steps explain how to acquire this .
This ISO file contains many Linux - related utilities for the PS3 , but for our purposes , two are particularly important : otheros.bld and kboot .
The first file , located in the PS3 / otheros directory , is the bootloader called by the PS3 when it starts in Other OS mode .
The second file provides a miniature Linux environment that makes it possible to install the full kernel on the PlayStation .
Part III : Reformat the PlayStation 3 Hard Drive
The following steps explain how to set aside memory on the console 's hard drive for the installation :
Turn on the PlayStation 3 and navigate to the Settings option in the main menu .
If you have n't already , update your firmware with Settings -> System Update .
The console will restart .
Select Settings ->System Settings and choose the Format Utility option .
Select Format Hard Disk , then Yes , then Custom .
You can allocate memory in three ways : assign all of the memory for the PS3 , assign 10 GB to Linux and the rest to the PS3 , or assign 10 GB to the PS3 and the rest to Linux .
I recommend the last option .
Choose between Quick Format and Full Format .
I recommend the quick version , which only takes seconds .
Select
Yes to delete all data on the formatted memory .
Press Enter to restart the PS3 .
Part IV : Install Linux Using the Add - on Tools
At this point , you should have a Linux DVD , an Add - on Tools CD , and a PlayStation with memory set aside for Linux .
If everything 's in order , you 're ready to start installing Linux .
The procedure is as follows :
Connect a USB keyboard and mouse to the console .
You can navigate through the menu with arrow keys and select options with Enter .
Insert the add - on CD into the console .
Go to Settings -> System Settings , and select Install Other OS .
The PS3 will search for a suitable bootloader and find otheros.bld on the CD .
Select Start and the PS3 will install the bootloader .
When the installation finishes , eject the CD and insert the Linux DVD .
Go back to the main menu and select Settings -> System Settings -> Default System .
You 'll see options for PS3 and Other OS , and your choice determines which operating system will start when you turn on the console .
Choose Other OS and Yes to restart the console .
When the PS3 restarts , two penguins will appear above a series of startup messages .
Enter the bold - faced text at the kboot prompt : kboot : linux64 xdriver=fbdev video=720p
The video parameter is optional and identifies your display ( 720 p , 1080i , or 1080 p ) .
The 720 p setting works well for most displays .
Note :
If your keyboard sends gibberish to the command line , it means it was designed for Windows .
You 'll need a different keyboard to continue the installation .
After a brief startup check , a Welcome to Fedora screen will appear .
Choose whether you want to test the DVD or not .
When the graphical installer appears , choose your language , your keyboard locale , and click Yes to initialize the hard drive .
The rest of the Linux installation is standard across all distributions of Fedora Core 9 .
Configure your network settings , your location , and the drive partitioning .
I recommend that you check Review and modify partitioning layout , remove at least 1 GB from the ext3 partition , and add the memory to the swap partition .
Once you 're finished , the installer will format the partition .
The Cell 's PPU wo n't run office applications quickly , so I recommend deselecting Office and Productivity .

When unveiling its search - data - driven Flu Trends modeler earlier this week , Google insisted it could never be used to identify the web habits of individual people .
Flu Trends , the company said , uses nothing but " anonymized " data .
Of course , no one knows what that means .
Following the release of the new disease tracker , two concerned watchdogs - the tech - minded Electronic Privacy Information Center ( EPIC ) and the medical - minded Patient Privacy Rights - tossed a letter at Google CEO Eric Schmidt , asking for an explanation .
" Would you agree to publish the technique that Google has adopted to protect the privacy of search queries for Google Flu Trends ? " the letter asked .
" As you know , there is considerable debate as to what constitutes ' anonymized ' data . "
Famously , when AOL released " anonymized " data into the wild back in the summer of 2006 , the world quickly realized it was n't that anonymous .
EPIC and Patient Privacy would like to know if Google has somehow succeeded where AOL failed .
" We 're asking Google : ' If you 've solved the problem of how to take individual search histories and provide some useful aggregate data without creating a risk of re-identification , let 's see it , let 's discuss it , let 's use it as a basis for solving some very hard privacy problems , " EPIC president Marc Rotenberg told The Reg .
Google 's
Trends service has long used aggregated search data to track the habits of the world 's web users .
But health - related data is a particularly touchy subject , and Rotenberg sees Flu Trends as a chance to broaden the public debate over data aggregation - and finally put some meaning into these anonymization claims .
The problem , Rotenberg says , is that data aggregation calls attention to specific data stored on Google 's servers , making it that much more vulnerable to , say , a subpoena or a national security letter .
" Let 's say that instead of Flu Trends , Google 's doing SARS Trends - tracking a very serious communicable disease , " he explains .
" If there 's a big SARS upsurge somewhere , the government would be at Google 's door asking where did that data come from . "
And that 's just one example .
" You can imagine any number of different scenarios where people would be interested in finding who the individuals are making those searches . "
In his letter to Schmidt , Rotenberg points to precedent .
" Census data , the quintessential form of aggregate data , was used during the Second World War to identity and then displace Japanese Americans , " the letter reads .
" The Department of Homeland Security sought information from the US Census about Muslim Americans in the United States after 9 - 11 . "
Schmidt has n't responded to the letter .
And after we asked about the letter , Google has n't responded to us .
But the world will keep knocking .
" This privacy issue is genuine and it needs to be solved , " Rotenberg tells us .
" Google even concedes that in saying that their data is anonymized and aggregated .
That 's great if it 's true .
But how do we know it 's true ? " ®
Please note : everything in this article refers to the 0.1.1 release .
The tip of the source tree is changing rapidly , so if you ’re using Ubiquity from a source checkout , some of its behavior may have changed by the time you read this article .
Two months ago I wrote a post describing the properties of the ideal linguistic interface .
Now that we ’ve released Ubiquity 0.1.1 , I want to look at how well the current state of the Ubiquity interface measures up to that ideal .
Where does it provide the desired behavior and where does it still fall short ?
Where are there clear and obvious improvements that can be made , and where are we puzzled by design questions still murky and nebulous ?
Is it easy to learn ?
How could it be easier ?
Is it efficient ?
How could it be more efficient ?
Is it expressive ?
How could it be more expressive ?
Yes , it ’s still in the public beta phase , so nobody should expect it to be perfect .
All the more reason to correct UI design problems now , before they get baked - in and people start getting used to them .
The parser nitty - gritty
You can get the general idea of how the parser works by reading the new users ’ tutorial and trying out Ubiquity for yourself .
However , there are some subtle - but - important parser behaviors that you might not notice at first glance .
In order to understand some of the issues going on with the interface , we will have to dive into the implementation details of the parser .
Ready ?
Here we go !
This is the parser ’s idea of an English sentence : A verb , optionally followed by arguments .
The verb is always the first word .
Each word after the verb is either part of the direct object or part of a modifier .
The direct object is a noun , and each modifier is a preposition followed by a noun .
Nouns can be multiple words ( “ hello everyone ” is a single noun ) , but verbs and prepositions are only single words .
The parser expects every sentence to be like that , but it understands that sometimes parts of the sentence will be abbreviated or left out entirely .
It ’s not fazed by sentences missing expected modifiers , missing direct objects , or even missing the verb .
It will also try to guess a partially - typed verb or noun ( from as little as one character ) .
On execution , the direct object noun and modifier nouns , if any , are extracted from the parsed sentence , and passed as arguments to the execute method of the verb object .
Verb matching
The parser starts by splitting the input on spaces to get a list of words .
It then looks at the first word to see if it matches any known verbs .
It ’s a “ match ” if a verb starts with the first word :
If the first word does match one or more verbs , then the parser attempts to do a “ verb - first completion ” :
If there ’s no match , then the parser assumes the user has skipped the verb and gone straight for the arguments , so it attempts a “ noun - first completion ” :
Watch what happens if you type “ calendar ” :
The input “ calendar ” does not match to any verbs — even though we have commands called “ add - to - calendar ” and “ check - calendar ” — because those verb names do n’t start with “ calendar ” .
Because it does n’t match a verb , the input “ calendar ” triggers a noun - first completion .
That ’s why you get suggestions you probably did n’t expect , like “ wikipedia calendar ” and “ yahoo - search calendar “ .
It ’s because the parser is treating the word “ calendar ” as a noun , and looking for verbs that could accept that noun as an argument .
Verb -First Completions
So , the first word of the input matched a verb , did it ?
Great !
Let ’s do a verb - first completion .
But wait a minute .
Why do we only compare the first word ?
Ca n’t a verb ever be more than one word ?
At the moment , no .
We introduced the extremely lame restriction that verbs can only be one word , in order to make things easier for the parser .
If you look at the command list , you ’ll see that none of the command names have spaces in them .
They have hyphens .
Watch what happens if you input “ add to calendar ” :
The first word , “ add ” , is matched to the “ add - to - calendar ” verb .
The “ to calendar ” part is parsed as arguments .
Single - word commands may be the standard in Bash , but that ’s not natural - language !
Typing “ add - to - calendar this ” is very awkward .
I would greatly prefer to be able to type “ add this to calendar ” .
I look forward to improving the parser to the point where command names no longer need to be restricted , and we can drop the hyphens .
Aside from that major problem , the verb - first parsing is pretty flexible .
See how it lets me provide the arguments in any order , for commands with multiple arguments :
The declaration of the email verb specifies that it takes a direct object , which can be arbitrary text , and one modifier , identified by the pronoun “ to ” , that must be a contact .
This declaration informs the parser that it should look for the preposition “ to ” , and consider any words following “ to ” as candidates for the “ to ” argument .
The word “ aza ” is given to the contact noun - type object , which looks through my contacts and produces two suggestions for completions ; both of these possibilities end up in my suggestion list .
Notice what happens if I give email a “ to ” argument that ’s not a match to anyone in my address book :
“ your mom ” is not a contact , and therefore “ to your mom ” is not a valid recipient .
But the parser wants to use every word of the input .
Since the “ message ” argument can accept anything , the parser treats “ to your mom ” as part of the message argument , and considers the “ to ” argument to still be blank .
Noun-First Completions
Sometimes it just makes more sense for the user to provide the noun first , instead of the verb .
For instance , if the user selects some content on the page and then invokes Ubiquity , it makes sense to suggest commands that could act upon that selection .
It also makes sense that if , say , “ check - calendar ” is the only command that can take a date as an argument :
then if the user just types a date , we should be able to figure out that check - calendar must be the verb they want .
So , we implemented noun - first completion .
If the first word of the input does n’t mach any verbs , then it will be passed through all of the noun types that the parser knows about , to figure out what noun type it could be .
For instance , an input of “ tomorrow ” gets a match from the Date noun type and the Arbitrary Text noun type .
( Because “ arbitrary text ” matches everything , of course . )
Next , the parser builds up a list of every verb that can take any of these noun types as an argument .
Since the “ check - calendar ” command takes a Date as an argument ( as declared in the command definition ) , it will appear as one of the suggestions if the input is “ tomorrow ” .
Hey , what gives ?
Why is n’t it suggesting “ check - calendar tomorrow ” ?
Well , actually it is generating that suggestion .
But since “ tomorrow ” matches the Arbitrary Text noun type , it ’s also generating suggestions based on every command that can run on Arbitrary Text , such as google and wikipedia .
And those are the suggestions we see first .
This is not so good .
We ’d prefer to see the more specific suggestions first .
Why do n’t we ?
The Suggestion List
The parser takes every possible valid completion and throws them all into the suggestion list .
Only the top five suggestions are actually displayed ; if we showed the entire suggestion list , it would often extend off the bottom of the browser window !
That ’s because we ’re taking every verb that matches the first word of the sentence — or , failing that , every verb that could use every noun type that matches the sentence — and producing multiple parsings based on it .
Parsing is ambiguous ( sometimes there are words that could either be part of a modifier or part of the direct object ) , and so every possible alternate parsing goes into the suggestion list .
This is the approach we use wherever and whenever we find ambiguity in the user input : produce every possible interpretation , and throw them all into the suggestion list .
As another example , when the input contains the magic word “ this ” , we suggest both the literal sentence and the sentence with the seletion substituted for “ this ” :
To expand “ this ” or not to expand “ this ” is an independent binary choice , so it does n’t just add one extra item to the suggestion list — it doubles the length of the suggestion list .
Each time we introduce more flexibility into the parser , the suggestion list grows geometrically !
The suggestion list is not currently being sorted .
Let me say that again :
The suggestion list is not currently being sorted .
At all !
I assumed throughout development that the only way the throw - everything - into - the - suggestion - list approach would possibly result in a usable interface was if the suggestion list should be sorted by quality , so the best suggestions always appear at the top .
To my great surprise , I discovered once I implemented the suggestion list that Ubiquity seems to work fairly OK without any sorting .
Not great , not humane , but usable .
We had other higher priorities so we delayed sorting until after the 0.1.1 release .
Now that 0.1.1 is out , the sorting algorithm is the main thing I ’m working on .
But for now , remember — when you type something into Ubiquity and see a list of five suggestions , those are n’t the best five , they ’re just the first five that the parser can come up with .
That ’s why you ’ll see google and wikipedia and so on as the suggestions for any noun that you select .
And that ’s why noun- first completion is n’t very useful as it currently stands .
Coming up next …
I ’m going to grade Ubiquity 0.1.1 on all the criteria I introduced in part 1 .
Then I ’m going to tackle the current lack of any naming standards , and what it means in a world of wide - open decentralized command development .
Option ARM Mortgages To Cause Next Wave Of Foreclosures
Some people took exception to a recent post about how alt - A and option ARM mortgages will be the next financial disaster .
The argument in the comments of that post is that interest rates are so low that resetting of interest rates wo n't make the monthly payments higher but rather lower .
But a lot of option ARM mortgage holders were not even paying enough per month to cover interest in the first place .
Known as an option ARM  and named  Pick - A - Pay by World Savings  it is now seen by an array of housing analysts and regulators as the Typhoid Mary of the mortgage industry .
Pick - A - Pay allowed homeowners to make monthly mortgage payments that were so small they did not cover their interest charges .
That meant the total principal owed would actually grow over time , not shrink as is normally the case .
Now held by an estimated two million homeowners , the option adjustable rate mortgage will be at the forefront of a further wave of homeowner distress that could greatly delay or even derail an economic recovery , mortgage industry analysts say .
Option ARM is yet another financial weapon of mass destruction .
 This product is the most destructive financial weapon ever deployed against the American middle class ,  said William J. Purdy III , a housing lawyer in California who is representing elderly World Savings customers struggling to repay their loans .
 People who have this loan are now trapped , and they cant get another loan . 
People become less willing to make their suddenly higher payments as the price of their house drops and they find themselves financially under water - owing more than their house is worth .
In some cases they never would have been able to make the higher monthly payments once the mortgage readjusted to cover interest costs .
Some were probably counting on flipping and moving on to another home at that point .
But in the game of housing musical chairs when the game stops it is those who are sitting in chairs who lose .
These mortgage holders and their banks and the American taxpayers all became losers .
Once upon a time in a distant era regulators did n't think federally insured financial institutions should offer such risky loans .
When Reagan era deregulation arrived , the Sandlers and two other competitors were able to market option ARMs for the first time in 1981 .
Before that , lawmakers balked at the loan because of its potential peril to borrowers .
World Savings initially attracted borrowers whose incomes fluctuated , like professionals with big year - end bonuses .
In the recent housing boom , when World Savings started calling the loan Pick - A - Pay , they began marketing it to a much broader audience , including people with financial troubles , like deeply indebted blue - collar workers .
The risky loans did n't just pull in people who had no business buying houses .
These loans so boosted demand for housing that they had the macroeconomic effect of driving up the prices of houses .
The rising prices pulled in more fools and so when the bubble inevitably popped it caused the deep long recession and big costs for the net taxpayers .
Legislators taking hard look at oil trading Oil prices fall , but concern in Washington over market manipulation lingers
NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 20 : Traders work minutes before the closing bell in the crude oil options pit at the New York Mercantile Exchange November 20 , 2008 in New York City .
Crude oil prices fell below $ 50 a barrel , the lowest since level since May 2005 , in another ominous sign for the economy .

For a few months this summer , the oil market speculator was one of Washington 's favorite whipping boys .
This ilk helped push oil prices steadily higher , shattering records that had lasted for decades .
As oil topped $ 145 per barrel , Congress started looking for ways to rein the speculators in .
Then oil prices plunged , and interest in the issue fizzled .
But that may soon change .
Democrats , who led the charge for increased oil market regulation , will return to Washington in the new year with solid majorities in Congress , a friendly White House and the determination to tighten regulation across America 's financial markets .
They will likely take another look at oil .
" This will remain an issue , " said Sen. Byron Dorgan , D - N.D. , who introduced oil market legislation this year .
" Because when the price of oil has gone from $ 50 to $ 147 and back , it 's clear to me and everyone else that this has nothing to do with supply and demand .
It has to do with speculation . "
In addition , the investment banks that have opposed oil market regulations in the past have far less clout than before .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" The banks are in a much weaker position right now , and they were the ones really fighting this , " said Tyson Slocum , director of the energy program at the Public Citizen watchdog group .
President - elect Barack Obama even made cracking down on oil speculation part of his energy platform during the campaign .
But he offered few specifics and gave the issue far less attention than he gave to renewable power and alternative fuels .
Among possible changes , Congress may try to assert more authority over unregulated oil swaps that do n't take place on any formal market .
Limits on the number of oil contracts a speculator can hold could be extended to cover those swaps as well as trading on electronic exchanges and overseas markets .
There 's still disagreement over how much speculators influence oil 's price .
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , a federal agency that regulates much of the American oil market , tends to downplay the role of speculators .
A commission task force concluded that the tight worldwide balance between petroleum supply and demand caused the price spike , not speculators .
Plenty of oil analysts disagree .
Many factors helped shove prices higher , including the growth of China 's economy and the decline of the American dollar .
But oil kept rising even as gasoline sales fell in the United States , the world 's largest oil consumer .
That would n't have happened if supply and demand really were driving the market , many analysts say .
" The entire move from $ 70 ( per barrel ) to $ 147 was people fleeing the dollar and looking at oil as an asset class , " said Amy Myers Jaffe , an energy research fellow at Rice University 's Baker Institute .
" It was speculators , so when they exited the market , we went right back to $ 70 . "
Speculators are investors who trade in oil or other commodities strictly as a financial investment - just as they would trade stocks and bonds .
They have no intention of taking delivery of a tanker - truck full of oil or gasoline .
They include hedge funds and investment banks as well as retirement funds .
Speculators focus on oil futures , contracts that allow the holder to buy oil at a particular price at a specific time in the future .
And the market where U.S. oil futures are traded - the New York Mercantile Exchange , or Nymex - has become a very busy , crowded place .
Since 2004 , the number of outstanding contracts on the oil market has more than tripled , while the number of traders almost doubled , according to the futures trading commission .
But not all oil trading happens on the Nymex .
Some takes place on purely electronic exchanges , which used to be exempt from many regulations .
And an unknown amount of oil trading happens as over - the - counter swaps , complicated private financial arrangements that do n't involve any formal market .
The government limits the number of contracts an individual speculator can hold on the Nymex , to prevent anyone from cornering the market , but those rules do n't apply to swaps .
That troubles many politicians , who often refer to swaps as a " dark market . "
Legislation this summer in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would have increased staffing levels at the futures trading commission and given it the authority to monitor swaps .
Under separate legislation introduced in October by Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , swaps would have counted toward each speculator 's contract limit .
" If we want fair play in the energy markets , we cannot continue to instruct the ( futures commission ) to swallow its whistle when it sees violations at the swaps ' end of ( the ) court , " Feinstein said at the time .
The idea of limiting swaps could resurface under the new administration .
So could other proposed market changes , such as raising the margin for trading in oil futures .
That step would require traders to put up more of their money as a prerequisite for trading , ensuring they could cover their obligations if their bets went wrong .
Some fixes have already been made , at least in part .
Language tucked into this year 's federal farm bill gave the futures trading commission authority over electronic exchanges .
Under congressional pressure , the commission also began collecting data on swaps trading and started monitoring overseas trading of American crude oil .
Those steps should be given a chance to work before Congress takes any further action , said Scott DeFife , senior managing director for government affairs with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association .
" Actions that the ( commission ) took have worked to help information reporting and disclosure , which are definitely things that market participants felt should help calm the markets , " he said .
Some Democratic lawmakers consider the steps taken this year to be a good start , but not enough to rein in speculators .
They do n't want to wait for the next price spike before acting .
" We can not be lulled into a false sense of complacency just because gas is back below $ 2 in some regions of the country , " said Rep. Bart Stupak , D - Mich .
" Addressing excessive energy speculation must be a key part of any new energy policy pursued by the new Congress and the Obama administration . "
The Nine Inch Nails concert at The Rose Garden started like many hard rock / industrial concerts – with a ton of smoke and bright lights .
The sea of strobes lit the Rose Garden in bursts of blinding lights as Nine Inch Nails belted out their first three songs in a full on sonic assault .
Then it all changed .
The stage went dark and the band moved to the front of the stage backed by a complex weaving of LCD lights and screens .
At that point the show was n’t just about the music anymore .
Reznor and company danced and moved in conjunction with a sea of light and color in something akin to a post modern living digital painting .
The rich tapestry of light and sound constantly evolved through out the show , taking the audience on a visual trip that probably could only have otherwise been achieved under the influence of some hallucinatory drug .
With this amazing feast of the senses , Nine Inch Nails moved through their large breadth of music touching on almost every album and digital release .
Bouncing around their musical time line , the band made each song sound as if it were new and fresh .
The middle of the show was a quiet contemplative series of songs from NIN ’s “ Ghosts ” release , which felt like it came from an entirely separate universe than the band ’s opening numbers .
The Ghosts block was surreal , meditative and beautiful .
Every song thereafter had some sort of amazing visual surprise attached .
On one Reznor moved around the stage interacting with a blanked of digital static that covered the stage , on another digital noise danced on the floor like snow and then flew to the heavens .
( No description of these visuals could ever do them justice although I tried to capture the NIN Portland experience on Twitter ) .
The final lap of the concert returned to the bright lights and strobe of the beginning , punctuating the complete journey the band had taken the audience through the show .
Coming back for an encore Reznor did a rendition of “ Hurt ” which felt as fresh and emotionally immediate as ever .
Reznor and NIN have taken a very different road musically .
They ’ve constantly foiled convention and defied confinement within the traditional music industry .
Now on tour they ’ve literally reinvented the concert going experience with an auditory and visual feast like none I ’ve ever seen .
There ’s no way you can experience this Nine Inch Nails experience any other way than running out and seeing them live , no photo , youtube video , DVD or Blu - Ray of this show will ever have the impact of the unmediated experience .
That experience makes Nine Inch Nails one of the preeminent bands to see live perhaps now even rivaling U2 .
Here are some photos of the concert ( photos by David Lawrence )

Eurozone growth is expected to remain little changed in 2009 The European Central Bank has lowered its eurozone interest rates to 3.25 % in an attempt to prevent a recession .
The bank reduced rates by half a percentage point amid increasing signs of slowing growth .
The Swiss and Danish central banks did the same .
ECB president Jean - Claude Trichet said further cuts could not be ruled out .
Separately , the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the eurozone economy would shrink by 0.5 % in 2009 , more than previously estimated .
More cuts ?
Speaking after the ECB rate cut , Mr Trichet said that the level of uncertainty stemming from the turmoil on the financial markets remained " extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead " .
He also said that inflation rates were set to continue falling , and added that the ECB had discussed the possibility of a bigger rate cut on Thursday
The comments leave the ECB room for more rate reductions , especially after the Bank of England slashed UK rates from 4.5 % to 3 % .
The last time ECB rates stood at 3.25 % was in October 2006 .
Swiss rate cut Also on Thursday , Switzerland cut its interest rates by a half percentage point , the second cut in a month .
Denmark 's central bank did the same , cutting its key rate by half a percentage point to 5 % .
The Swiss National Bank said it was cutting its the target range to 1.5 - 2.5 % , and intended to hold the rate in the middle of this range .
Following the cut in Swiss rates , Henrik Gullberg , an analyst at Deutsche Bank , said : " I am surprised , but it is clear central banks generally are determined to cut rates sharply now when the inflation threat is receding " .
The ECB cut rates by half a percentage point in October , as central banks worldwide , including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England , did the same in light of the worsening financial crisis .
Slowdown
In July this year , the ECB had raised rates to try to put a lid on growing inflationary pressures , but since then these pressures have eased considerably largely thanks to a sharp fall in oil prices .
While inflation - a main focus of the ECB - is at 3.2 % , it is coming closer to the target of under 2 % following the recent contraction .
" Inflation may go down to below 2.5 % by year end , " Natixis economist Ceric Thillier forecast .
A series of economic data released this week has shown how economies across the eurozone are slowing .
On Wednesday , figures showed that retail spending across the eurozone dropped in September , as consumers tightened their belts .
Retail sales dropped 0.2 % from August , and by 1.6 % compared with September 2007 .
On Thursday , the IMF predicted in its latest World Economic Outlook that the eurozone would shrink by 0.5 % next year , against an earlier prediction of 0.2 % growth .

Talk about getting creative to avoid use of the dollar ( the iranians are particularly keen to avoid use of the dollar in oil trading , it verges on a point of honor with them .
They have been selling oil to the Japanese with trades denominated in yen rather than the dollar as the reference currency for some time .
But in their case , as the news story below discusses , is also making a virtue of necessity ) .
However , the UN said that they expect agricultural goods barter to become more common .
From the Financial Times :
Thailand on Monday said it planned to barter rice for oil with Iran in the clearest example to date of how the triple financial , fuel and food crisis is reshaping global trade as countries struggle with high commodity prices and a lack of credit .
The United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organisation said such government - to - government bartering – a system of trade not used for decades – was likely to become more common as the private sector was finding it hard to access credit for food imports .
“ Government - to - government deals will increase in number , ” said Concepción Calpe , a senior economist at the FAO in Rome .
“ The lack of credit for trade could lead also to a resurgence of barter deals between countries , ” she added .
Officials and traders noted , however , that Iran was not typical because the US - led sanctions against its banks meant the country was facing difficulties financing agricultural trade even before the financial crisis .
Bangkok ’s commerce ministry said it was sending a delegation to Tehran to discuss the barter deal .
Thailand is the world ’s largest rice exporter , controlling a third of the global market , while Iran is one of the top 10 importers .
Last year Iran bought some 600,000 tonnes of rice from Thailand , but so far this year it has bought only 60,000 tonnes as it has waited for prices to fall .
The price of Thai medium - quality white rice soared to an all - time high of above $ 1,000 ( €798 , £ 641 ) a tonne in May but has since dropped to $ 660 a tonne on the back of a large global crop .
Prices are still well above their pre-crisis average of $ 250 a tonne .
Chaiya Sasomsab , Thailand ’s commerce minister , said Thai officials planned to travel to Iran by the middle of November to “ discuss the specifications of oil and rice that would be exchanged ” .
Agriculture officials such as Jacques Diouf , the FAO director - general , are warning that the financial crisis could deepen this year ’s food crisis through its impact on credit availability .
“ Borrowing , bank lending . . . all may be compromised by a deepening financial crisis , ” Mr Diouf said this month .
With some developing countries ’ official currency reserves facing serious depletion , particularly in Africa and Asia , agricultural officials said countries could barter more to avoid exacerbating their current account difficulties .
Ben Savage , managing director at London - based rice brokers Jackson Son & Co , said the full effects of the credit crunch had not been felt as most of current food trade related to contracts signed before the crisis .
“ Trade finance has tightened sharply and , in many cases , letter of credit confirmation fees have doubled or tripled , ” he said .
“ Exporters are reviewing the terms of payment they are ready to accept and credit they are prepared to give . ”
Agricultural commodities traders said that the banking cost to confirm a letter of credit – a common instrument to finance trading – has risen to 3 - 4 per cent of the value of the contract , up from 1 - 1.25 per cent before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September .
Some key reports today on architecture billings , existing home sales , and new residential construction provide additional evidence that a U.S. housing recovery is underway :
Architecture Billings Index ( ABI ) rose 1.5 points to a reading of 50.2 in August , according to the American Institute of Architects .
Any reading above 50 indicates an increase in demand for architects ' services .
The ABI is considered a predictor of U.S. construction activity nine to 12 months ahead .
1 . Reuters --
" A leading indicator of U.S. construction activity rose last month to its best level in five months , indicating that demand for design services is expanding , an architects ' trade group said on Wednesday .
The ( ABI ) rose 1.5 points to a reading of 50.2 in August , according to the American Institute of Architects .
Any reading above 50 indicates an increase in demand for architects ' services .
The ABI is considered a predictor of U.S. construction activity nine to 12 months ahead .
A separate measure of inquiries for new projects rose 0.9 points to 57.2 , the group said . "
MP : Both the Billing Index ( ABI ) and the New Projects Inquiry Index have risen in each of the last three months , and the ABI was at the highest level last month since March , while the inquiry index in August was the highest in six months .
Existing U.S. home sales surged in August by 7.8 % over July , marking the highest monthly increase in home sales in a year , according to today 's 2.surged in August by 7.8 % over July , marking the highest monthly increase in home sales in a year , according to today 's National Realtors Association ( NAR ) report .
Compared to last August , home sales this year were 9.3 % higher , and last month 's increase was the 14th consecutive year - over - year increase in home sales .
The median home sales price in August was $ 187,400 , a slight decrease from July 's median price of $ 187,800 , but above last August 's median price of $ 171,200 by 9.5 % .
According to the NAR , " The last time there were six back - to - back monthly price increases from a year earlier was from December 2005 to May 2006 .
The August increase was the strongest since January 2006 when the median price rose 10.2 percent from a year earlier . "
Other positive signs from today 's report include : a ) a reduction in the share of distressed sales in August this year ( 22 % ) compared to last year ( 31 % ) , b ) a reduction in the median marketing time from 92 days in August 2011 to 70 days last month ( almost one - third of homes sold in August were on the market for less than a month ) , and c ) a drop to only a 6.1 month supply of homes in August at the current sales pace , which except for a 6.0 month supply in January is the lowest inventory level of existing homes for sale since April of 2006 .
-- " U.S. builders started work on more homes in August , driven by the fastest pace of single - family home construction in more than two years .
The increase points to steady progress in the housing recovery .
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that construction of homes and apartments rose 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 750,000 last month .
That 's up from 733,000 in July , which was revised lower from last month 's initial estimate .
Single - family housing starts rose 5.5 percent to an annual rate of 535,000 homes , the best pace since April 2010 . "
MP : Single - family home starts last month were the highest for the month of August since 2008 , and were 27 % above last year , marking the largest year - over - year increase since April 2010 .
Further , the number building permits issued in August was 24.5 % above permits in the same month last year .
In both July and August , building permits were above 800,000 in each month , and it's been four years since there has been more than 1.6 million permits issued in a two - month period .
Bottom Line :
The evidence continues to accumulate pointing to a gradual , but steady housing recovery that is underway in the U.S.
As with any economic or housing recovery , it can be expected that the improvements in the U.S. housing market will be somewhat choppy at times .
But the fact that most of the main housing indicators ( existing - home sales , new home sales , pending sales , housing prices , asking prices , home affordability , etc. ) are showing gradual , but consistently positive signs of improvement would support the growing consensus that a sustainable housing recovery is underway .
Some Palin quotes from an interview with the Alaskan TV station , KTUU :
Q . There 's been an enormous amount of information about you that Alaskans have been exposed to the past couple of months -- and lots of it very critical .
What are Alaskans supposed to make of all this ?
A. Regarding information regarding my record , that is now out there , much of it that was based on misinformation was a very , very frustrating thing to have to go through when the record was never corrected .
And we would try to correct the record and too many in the media chose not to make those corrections .
Q. What misinformation are you talking about ?
A. Some of the goofy things like who was Trig 's mom .
Well , I 'm Trig 's mom ( raises her hand ) and do you want to see my medical records to prove that ?

NEW DELHI 
As negotiations started for the release of a Saudi - owned supertanker seized by pirates off Somalia , the Indian Navy said on Wednesday that one of its warships fought a battle at sea with would - be hijackers in the Gulf of Aden , sinking one suspect vessel and forcing the pirates to abandon a second as they fled .
The drama on the night - time waters of the Indian Ocean late Tuesday underscored the growing international concern at the audacity with which armed pirates , mostly based in Somalia , range across vast areas of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden , attacking at will .
The enormous Saudi - owned supertanker , Sirius Star , remained at anchor off the coast of Somalia on Wednesday , but there was no immediate word on the status of negotiations for its release .
In Rome , Prince Saud al - Faisal , the Saudi foreign minister , confirmed that the owners of the Star “ are negotiating on the issue ” and were “ the final arbiter of the issue ” , despite the Saudi government ’s official opposition to such discussions with “ pirates , terrorists or hijackers , ” according to news reports .
But he did not elaborate .
The health insurer Wellpoint is testing a new program that gives covered patients the option of going to India for elective surgery , with no out - of - pocket medical costs and free travel for both the patient and a companion .
The program is being tested at Serigraph , a printing company in Wisconsin whose managers have been looking for ways to curb rising health care costs , said Dr. Razia Hashmi , chief medical officer for national accounts for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield , which is affiliated with Wellpoint .
“ This is a first for us , ” Dr. Hashmi said .
“ We will be monitoring every aspect of this very closely , to make sure everyone is satisfied and there are good clinical outcomes . ”
By the year 2010 , more than 6 million Americans annually will be seeking medical treatment abroad , according to the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions , a consultancy .
The potential savings are significant .
Knee surgery that costs $ 70,000 to $ 80,000 in the United States can be performed in India for $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , including follow - up care and rehabilitation , Dr. Hashmi said .
Similar savings could be achieved for such common procedures as hip replacements and spine surgery .

Tim Jones of the Electronic Frontier Foundation has some good commentary on the news that the MPAA has asked Obama to spy on the entire Internet , and to establish a system where being accused of copyright infringement would result in loss of your Internet connection ( and your VoIP line , your access to your university , your lifeline to your parents in the old country , your means of participating in civic life , your means of fighting your parking ticket , etc etc etc ) .
The MPAA also wants Obama to lean on other countries ( notably Canada ! ) and force them to adopt US copyright laws .
Here , the MPAA is advocating for a number of things , the most problematic of which is a " three strikes " internet termination policy .
This would require ISPs to terminate customers ’ internet accounts upon a rights - holder ’s repeat allegation of copyright ingfringement .
This could be done potentially without any due process or judicial review .
A three - strikes policy was recently adopted by legislation in France , where all ISPs are now banned from providing blacklisted citizens with internet access for up to one year .
Because three - strikes policies do not guarantee due process or judicial oversight of whether the accusations of copyright infringement are valid , they effectively grant the content industry the ability to exile any individual they want from the internet .
Lest we forget , there is a history of innocents getting caught up in these anti-piracy dragnets .
( Copyfighter Cory Doctorow has wondered what would happen if the MPAA ’s erroneous notices were subject to a similar three - strikes law . )
Thankfully , members of the European Parliament vehemently rejected these measures , resolving that " The cut of Internet access is a disproportionate measure regarding the objectives .
It is a sanction with powerful effects , which could have profound repercussions in a society where access to the Internet is an imperative right for social inclusion . "
Let ’s hope the US government ’s decisions on this are as wise .

Dec. 10 , 2008
Comment from Old - Thinker News : Dr. Phyllis Mullenix became well known in the field of neruotoxicology when she developed a new , more accurate system of analyzing chemicals effects on the brain and central nervous system .
The new technology was called the Computer Pattern Recognition System .
She received funding from a variety of high profile sources , and consulted with Exxon , Mobil , 3M , DuPont and others in her early career .
She was very well received until she began to investigate the effects of fluoride on the central nervous system .
Ultimately , her career was destroyed because of her investigation .
This presentation by Phyllis was done two years after she was fired from her toxicology position at Forsyth Dental Center in 1994 .
Mullenix covers vital information regarding secrecy surrounding Fluoride and the Manhattan Project and much more .
For more information be sure to check out Christopher Bryson ’s book The Fluoride Deception .
A vital piece of information that Mullenix covers is a communication that took place between Harold Hodge ( head toxicologist for the Manhattan Project ) and Lt. Col. Rhodes on May 1 , 1946 .
Hodge writes in the letter , in which he uses “ F ” to abbreviate Fluoride ,
“ Would there be any use at making attempts to counter - act the local fear on part of the residents of Salem and Gloucester counties through lectures on F toxicology and perhaps the usefulness of F in tooth health ? ”

" This is great , but it 's also insufficient .
Red Hat announced way back in October 2007 that it had passed 3,000 certified applications , and currently has more than 3,400 , according to a Red Hat PR representative .
" In fact , I just ran a search of Red Hat 's independent software vendors catalog and came up with 4,314 certified applications .
" Now , it 's possible that " more than 2,500 " actually means " more than 4,314 , " but I suspect Novell just got its math wrong .
Indeed , Novell 's certified application list actually includes 2,549 applications , as of Monday . "
A striking feature of many cancer cells is that the DNA in their chromosomes is all jumbled up .
Chunks of DNA containing one or more genes have been ripped out of their chromosome and reinserted in a different place .
Other lengths of DNA have been transferred to a different chromosome altogether .
These rearrangements may degrade the cell 's regulatory systems , especially when a rearrangement cuts a gene in half , or separates it from the regions of DNA that control its activity .
Researchers led by Oliver A. Hampton and Aleksandar Milosavljevic at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston have now compared the genome of a type of breast cancer cell with that of normal cells .
They find 157 rearrangements , they report in the current issue of Genome Research .
The graphic summarizes their results .
Round the outer ring are shown the 23 chromosomes of the human genome .
The lines in blue , in the third ring , show internal rearrangements , in which a stretch of DNA has been moved from one site to another within the same chromosome .
The red lines , in the bull 's eye , designate switches of DNA from one chromosome to another .
ON the campaign trail , Barack Obama said he wanted to eliminate the Bush tax cuts for top earners upon taking office in January .
Now he seems to favor letting those cuts expire as scheduled , at the end of 2010 .
His apparent concern is that raising anyone ’s taxes immediately might worsen the economic crisis .
As Mr. Obama ’s senior adviser , David Axelrod , said when asked on Fox News about the delay , “ The main thing right now is to get this economic recovery package on the road , to get money in the pockets of the middle class , to get these projects going , to get America working again , and that ’s where we ’re going to be focused in January . ”
Of course , the government ’s first priority must be to stimulate spending as quickly as possible , deficits be damned .
But it ’s important to get the biggest possible stimulus for any given deficit .
To that end , it would make sense for Mr. Obama to stick with his original timetable .
Eliminating the Bush tax cuts right away would make it possible to generate a much larger immediate increase in total spending .
Higher tax rates for top earners would n’t appreciably reduce their spending .
A robust finding in behavioral research is that people are extremely reluctant to accept cutbacks in their standard of living .
Czech Prime Minister : Crisis Due To Limits On CapitalismLONDON -( Dow Jones ) - Loosening the European Union 's fiscal rules would threaten confidence in the euro and the euro zone , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek said Thursday .
The Czech Republic assumes the rotating presidency of the European Union for six months from January .
E.U. leaders have agreed on an EUR200 billion fiscal stimulus package .
Rules contained in the Stability and Growth Pact prohibit members from running a budget deficit of more than 3 % of gross domestic product or a total public sector debt of more than 60 % of GDP .
Speaking at the London School of Economics , Topolanek warned against an excessive fiscal response to the global economic crisis .
" I consider loosening the Stability and Growth Pact to be a direct threat to confidence in the euro zone and a dangerous precedent for the future , " he said .
Topolanek also warned against excessive regulation of financial services as a response to the crisis , comparing some recent proposals to " the fifth article of the Communist Manifesto .
"
He said the crisis had its origins in a " fatal failure of market intervention .
It was state support for mortgages that led them to be offered to people who were fundamentally incapable of repaying them .
" Topolanek added .
" It is not a failure of capitalism , it is lack of capitalism . " - By Paul Hannon , Dow Jones Newswires ; 44-20-7842-9491 ; [ email protected ]

The “ dirty little secret ” of the US bank bailout
27 October 2008
In an unusually frank article published in Saturday 's New York Times , the newspaper 's economic columnist , Joe Nocera , reveals what he calls " the dirty little secret of the banking industry " - - namely , that " it has no intention of using the [ government bailout ] money to make new loans . "
As Nocera explains , the plan announced October 13 by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to hand over $ 250 billion in taxpayer money to the biggest banks , in exchange for non-voting stock , was never really intended to get them to resume lending to businesses and consumers -- the ostensible purpose of the bailout .
Its essential aim was to engineer a rapid consolidation of the American banking system by subsidizing a wave of takeovers of smaller financial firms by the most powerful banks .
Nocera cites an employee - only conference call held October 17 by a top executive of JPMorgan Chase , the beneficiary of $ 25 billion in public funds .
Nocera explains that he obtained the call - in number and was able to listen to a recording of the proceedings , unbeknownst to the executive , whom he declines to name .
Asked by one of the participants whether the $ 25 billion in federal funding will " change our strategic lending policy , " the executive replies : " What we do think , it will help us to be a little bit more active on the acquisition side or opportunistic side for some banks who are still struggling . "
Referring to JPMorgan 's recent government - backed acquisition of two large competitors , the executive continues : " And I would not assume that we are done on the acquisition side just because of the Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns mergers .
I think there are going to be some great opportunities for us to grow in this environment , and I think we have an opportunity to use that $ 25 billion in that way , and obviously depending on whether recession turns into depression or what happens in the future , you know , we have that as a backstop . "
As Nocera notes : " Read that answer as many times as you want -- you are not going to find a single word in there about making loans to help the American economy . "
Later in the conference call the same executive states , " We would think that loan volume will continue to go down as we continue to tighten credit to fully reflect the high cost of pricing on the loan side . "
" It is starting to appear , " the Times columnist writes , " as if one of the Treasury 's key rationales for the recapitalization program - - namely , that it will cause banks to start lending again -- is a fig leaf ....
In fact , Treasury wants banks to acquire each other and is using its power to inject capital to force a new and wrenching round of bank consolidation . "
Early this month , he explains , " in a nearly unnoticed move , " Paulson , the former CEO of Goldman Sachs , put in place a new tax break worth billions of dollars that is designed to encourage bank mergers .
It allows the acquiring bank to immediately deduct any losses on the books of the acquired bank .
Paulson and other Treasury officials have made public statements calling on the banks that receive public funds to use them to increase their lending activities .
That , however , is for public consumption .
The bailout program imposes no lending requirements on the banks in return for government cash .
Already , the credit crisis has been used to engineer the takeover of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual by JPMorgan , Merrill Lynch by Bank of America , Wachovia by Wells Fargo and , last Friday , National City by PNC .
What the Wall Street Journal on Saturday called the " strong - arm sale " of National City provides a taste of what is to come .
The Treasury Department sealed the fate of the Cleveland - based bank by deciding not to include it among the regional banks that will receive government handouts .
It then gave Pittsburgh - based PNC $ 7.7 billion from the bailout fund to help defray the costs of a takeover of National City .
PNC will also benefit greatly from the tax write - off on mergers enacted by Treasury .
All of the claims that were made to justify the bank bailout have been exposed as lies .
President Bush , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Paulson were joined by the Democratic congressional leadership and Barack Obama in warning that the bailout had to be passed , and passed immediately , despite massive popular opposition .
Those who opposed the plan were denounced for jeopardizing the well being of the American people .
In a nationally televised speech delivered September 24 , in advance of the congressional vote on the bailout plan , Bush said it would " help American consumers and businessmen get credit to meet their daily needs and create jobs . "
If the bailout was not passed , he warned , " More banks could fail , including some in your community .
The stock market would drop even more , which would reduce the value of your retirement account ....
More businesses would close their doors , and millions of Americans could lose their jobs ... ultimately , our country could experience a long and painful recession . "
One month later , the bailout has been enacted , and all of the dire developments -- banks and businesses disappearing , the stock market plunging , unemployment skyrocketing -- which the American people were told it would prevent are unfolding with accelerating speed .
While Obama talks about the need for all Americans to " come together " in a spirit of " shared sacrifice " -- meaning drastic cuts in Medicare , Medicaid , Social Security and other social programs -- and the cost of the bailout is cited to justify fiscal austerity , the bankers proceed to ruthlessly prosecute their class interests .
As the World Socialist Web Site warned when it was first proposed in mid-September , the " economic rescue " plan has been revealed to be a scheme to plunder society for the benefit of the financial aristocracy .
The American ruling elite , utilizing its domination of the state and the two - party political system , is exploiting a crisis of its own making to carry through an economic agenda , long in preparation , that could not be imposed under normal conditions .
The result will be greater economic hardship for ordinary Americans .
The big banks will have even greater market power to set interest rates and control access to credit for workers , students and small businesses .
While no serious measures are being proposed , either by the Bush administration , the Republican presidential candidate or his Democratic opponent , to prevent a social catastrophe from overtaking working people , the government is organizing a restructuring of the financial system that will enable a handful of mega - banks to increase their power over society .
