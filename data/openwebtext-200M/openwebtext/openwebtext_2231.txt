The Internet was ablaze with speculation yesterday that the PlayStation Network ’s downtime for scheduled maintenance ( from 11 AM to 5 PM EDT ) meant that PS3 system software v2.40 was not too far in the offing .
Now , we have some seemingly concrete details on the update ’s release window , as well as the new features it will provide .
A little bird told CVG that we should expect to see the launch of v2.40 in about three weeks .
Hm ... three weeks ... hey , is n’t E3 in three weeks ?
Indeed it is !
Coincidence ?
I think not .
It seems like the perfect opportunity for Sony to show off the update ’s feature set and then debut it on the PlayStation Network .
As for what “ in - game XMB ” actually entails , hit the jump for the full list of features that CVG ’s anonymous tipster listed .
It includes the requisite messaging functions ( view , send , receive ) , as well as access to commonly - used XMB features like the download manager , friends list , and “ system BGM ” ( background music ) .
Sound - wise , you ’ll be able to do things like playing , stopping , switching tracks , enabling repeat or shuffle , and changing volume ( five levels ) .
The much - desired ability to play your own music from the XMB ’s Music tab in - game will be there , but there ’s no word yet on whether this will only be compatible with future titles .
One of the bullets in the list simply says “ Game category ” -- perhaps we ’ll be able to launch different games directly from the in - game XMB menu without having to quit out of the current game .
Sony has n’t confirmed ( or , for what it ’s worth , denied ) any of this -- hence , we ’ve slapped it with the trusty Rumortoid tag for now .
But if CVG is right , we ’ll soon know how much of this is fact , and how much is fiction .

Look , I 'm no prude .
I have a scheduled lovemaking session with my fiancÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ©e on the first of every month , and let me tell you : it gets pretty festive .
But I feel I 've got to draw some scrupulous attention to the ads for American Apparel I 've been seeing everywhere .
I first saw an ad on the back of a magazine at a family get - together at my father 's house , and immediately assumed he was a child pornographer .
After a very awkward ten - minute discussion and a bowl of spilled guacamole , it was explained to me that this :

was in fact an ad for a clothing store and not for a rainbow of underaged sex slaves as I had assumed .
Since then , I 've seen a number of these ads pop up , usually on the backs of magazines .
This has proved problematic , as I am a functioning illiterate and spend my time at the doctor 's office or in line at the grocery store perusing magazine backs .
Suffice to say , the healthy erection I achieved after leering at this ad for twenty minutes did n't help my attempt to persuade the checkout girl to give me a double coupon discount on a single coupon basket of mango slices .
If I could read or writeÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂwhich , again , I cannotÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂI would have probably put it together that the word ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂtightsÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ refers not only to leggings , but also to the woman 's vagina , and blown a load right there in aisle five .
A UK wo man called the police recently .
He wanted to report a large object hovering over the trees for quite some time .
The cops sent someone to check it out ... and it was the Moon .
Stories like that make me ( and everyone ) laugh .
How can you mistake the Moon for anything else ?
Yet people do it quite often .
They actually do n't recognize the Moon , the second brightest object in the sky .
Incredible .
Yet very credible .
So remember that when someone claims to have seen a UFO and also says it could n't possibly have been anything other than a flying saucer .
Ask them if they 're familiar with satellites , iridium flares , meteors , noctilucent clouds , halos , glories , parhelic arcs , crepuscular rays , autokinetic illusions , or even a flock of ducks .
I spend a lot of time looking at the sky , and I know most people do n't .
There 's a lot of stuff up there that can fool even experienced people , let alone those who do n't spend much time simply looking up .
The Moon .
Heh .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The number first appeared in headlines earlier this year : Nearly one in four of all prisoners worldwide is incarcerated in America .
It was just the latest such statistic .
Today , one in nine African American men between the ages of 20 and 34 is locked up .
In 1970 , our prisons held fewer than 200,000 people ; now that number exceeds 1.5 million , and when you add in local jails , it ’s 2.3 million — 1 in 100 American adults .
Since the 1980s , we ’ve sat by as the numbers inched higher and our prison system ballooned , swallowing up an ever - larger portion of the citizenry .
But do statistics like these , no matter how disturbing , really mean anything anymore ?
What does it take to get us to sit up and notice ?
Apparently , it takes a looming financial crisis .
For there is another round of bad news , the logical extension of the first :
The more money a state spends on building and running prisons , the less there is for everything else , from roads and bridges to health care and public schools .
At the pace our inmate population has been expanding , America ’s prison system is becoming , quite simply , too expensive to sustain .
That is why Kansas , Texas , and at least 11 other states have been trying out new strategies to curb the cost — reevaluating their parole policies , for instance , so that not every parolee who runs afoul of an administrative rule is shipped straight back to prison .
And yet our infatuation with incarceration continues .
There have been numerous academic studies and policy reports and journalistic accounts analyzing our prison boom , but this phenomenon cannot be fully measured in numbers .
That much became apparent to me when , beginning in 2000 , I spent nearly four years shadowing a woman who ’d just been released from prison .
She ’d been locked up for 16 years for a first - time drug crime , and her absence had all but destroyed her family .
Her mother had taken in her four young children after her arrest , only to die prematurely of kidney failure .
One daughter was deeply depressed , the other was seething with rage , and her youngest son had followed her lead , diving into the neighborhood drug culture and then winding up in prison himself .
The criminal justice system had punished not only her but her entire family .
How do you measure the years of wasted hours — riding on a bus to a faraway prison , lining up to be scanned and searched and questioned , sitting in a bleak visiting room waiting for a loved one to walk in ?
How do you account for all the dollars spent on collect calls from prison — calls that can cost at least three times as much as on the outside because the prison system is taking a cut ?
How do you begin to calculate the lessons absorbed by children about deprivation and punishment and vengeance ?
How do you end the legacy of incarceration ?
The US holds 1 in 4
of the world ’s prisoners .
This is not to say that nobody deserves to go to prison or that we should release everyone who is now locked up .
There are many people behind bars who you would not want as your neighbor , but in our hunger for justice we have lost perspective .
We treat 10 - year sentences like they ’re nothing , like that ’s a soft penalty , when in much of the rest of the world a decade behind bars would be considered extraordinarily severe .
This is what separates us from other industrialized countries :
It ’s not just that we send so many people to prison , but that we keep them there for so long and send them back so often .
Eight years ago , we surpassed Russia to claim the dubious distinction of having the world ’s highest rate of incarceration ; today we ’re still No. 1 .
If awards were granted to the country with the most surreal punishments , we would certainly win more than our share .
Thirty - six straight years in solitary confinement ( the fate of two men convicted in connection with the murder of a guard in Louisiana ’s Angola prison ) .
A 55 - year sentence for a small - time pot dealer who carried a gun during his sales ( handed down by a federal court in Utah in 2004 ) .
Life sentences for 13 - year - olds .
( In 2005 , Human Rights Watch counted more than 2,000 American inmates serving life without parole for crimes committed as juveniles .
The entire rest of the world has only locked up 12 kids without hope of release . )
Female prisoners forced to wear shackles while giving birth .
( Amnesty International found 48 states that permitted this practice as of 2006 . )
A ban on former prisoners working as barbers ( on the books in New York state ) .

America is expert at turning citizens into convicts , but we ’ve forgotten how to transform convicts back into citizens .
In 1994 , Congress eliminated Pell grants for prisoners , a move that effectively abolished virtually all of the 350 prison college programs across the country .
That might not seem like a catastrophe , until you consider that education has been proven to help reduce recidivism .
( This was the conclusion of a recent paper by the Urban Institute , which reviewed 49 separate studies . )
As the New York Times ‘ Adam Liptak has pointed out , our prisons used to be models of redemption ; de Tocqueville praised them in Democracy in America .
Many prisons still call themselves “ correctional facilities , ” but the term has become a misnomer .
Most abandoned any pretense of rehabilitation long ago .
Former California governor Jerry Brown even went so far as to rewrite the state ’s penal code to stress that the primary mission of that state ’s prisons is punishment .
Our cell blocks are packed with men and women who cannot read or write , who never graduated from high school — 75 percent of state inmates — who will be hard - pressed to find a job once they are released .
Once freed , they become second - class citizens .
Depending on the state , they may be denied public housing , student loans , a driver ’s license , welfare benefits , and a wide range of jobs .
Perhaps there is no more damning statistic than the fact that within three years , half will be convicted of a new crime .
Recently , there have been some hopeful signs .
In April , the Second Chance Act was finally signed into law ; it will provide federal grants to programs that help prisoners reenter society .
But our punishment industry — which each year spends millions lobbying federal and state lawmakers — has grown so massive and so entrenched that it will take far more than one piece of legislation to begin to undo its far - reaching effects .
Just look at our felony disenfranchisement laws , which prohibit 5.3 million people from voting — including 13 percent of African American men .
These numbers actually underestimate the scope of the problem , as many ex-prisoners believe they cannot vote even if they can .
And so the legacy of our prison boom continues :
We ’ve become a two - tier society in which millions of ostensibly free people are prohibited from enjoying the rights and privileges accorded to everyone else — and we continue to be defined by our desire for punishment and revenge , rather than by our belief in the power of redemption .

One pilgrim has been arrested after clashing with anti-pope protesters on the route of the pilgrim walk in Sydney .
The pilgrim , from Newcastle , allegedly jumped on a gay protester and punched him in the neck .
He was not charged and was released shortly after the incident .
About 1,000 protesters took up positions alongside the pilgrim walk for a rally against the Pope 's opposition to homosexuality and birth control .
Chanting " Pope go homo , gay is great " and singing " Pope is wrong , put a condom on " , the protesters threw condoms at the pilgrims , who were making their way to Randwick racecourse for an overnight prayer vigil .
A drag queen dressed in pink going under the moniker " Pope Alice " also paraded before the pilgrims , while other protesters wore T - shirts with slogans such as " Thank God I 'm an atheist " and " Bless me father for I am a homo " .
There was a heavy police presence at the protest , including officers on horses , and demonstrators were cordoned off from the bulk of the worshippers .
Most of the pilgrims reacted with smiles , waves and chants of their own but not all were happy about the protesters ' presence .
The pilgrims , who were attending the prayer vigil ahead of a papal mass Sunday involving an estimated 500,000 people , appeared unfazed by the protest , with some making peace signs as they passed by .
Maraget Leatuafi from New Zealand said pilgrims had been advised by World Youth day organisers not to retaliate if the protesters challenged their faith .
" They are allowed to have their say too about what they believe but maybe they need to do a bit more study ( about the church ) , " the 55 - year - old said .
Another pilgrim , Ruud , 15 , from the Netherlands , said he was not bothered by the protest .
" It is is their right to stand up for their views .
we live in a democracy , " he said .
Around 500,000 pilgrims are expected to be at the racecourse for tonight 's vigil and tomorrow mass .
The Harbour Bridge was re-opened to traffic at 5:00 pm after it was closed for the path of the pilgrimage .

The Bank for International Settlements ( BIS ) says global markets may still be set for severe economic downturn .
Last year , when inflation was low and the world economy was still strong and stable , BIS gave a a prescient warning about the growing risks that could bring it all undone .
In its latest annual report , released last night in Basel Switzerland , BIS gives a grim and candid assessment .
" The facts suggest that the magnitude of problems to be faced could be much greater than many now perceive ... while difficult to predict , their interaction does appear to point to a deeper and more protracted global downturn than the consensus view seems to expect , " the report says in part .
Despite this , it cautions against using rate cuts to bail out the world economy , arguing that loose monetary policy helped create the mess in the first place .
Satyajit Das is a risk analyst who tipped the global credit crisis .
" It 's an extraordinary statement of just how close the world economy is to a total financial meltdown , " he said .
Associate Professor Dick Bryan , an economist from the University of Sydney , uses the same adjective .
" It 's a quite extraordinary message , " he said .
" It 's a big statement that the world economy could potentially be facing one of the biggest crises for the last 150 years . "
Most central banks and the International Monetary Fund are tipping only a mild hit to world economic growth .
The Bank for International Settlements , whose chief economist Harry White is retiring , says they are wrong .
" The Bank for International Settlements goes to great lengths to juxtapose their own view to what they call the consensus and that consensus is saying that inflation will be a blip that it 'll only be around for a year and we 'll get recovery and they 're saying no , " Associate Professor Bryan said .
" The central banks have used loose monetary policy and low interest rates to bail themselves out of every crisis since 1987 and what they are saying is at some point in time the piper must be paid , " Satyajit Das said .
" The fears about higher inflation and what central banks can and can't do is really quite frank .
I think it would be best to sum up this report by saying the super - hero central banker is dead . "
The Bank for International Settlements notes parallels between the current financial turmoil and the great economic woes of modern history .
" The 1930s , the 1870s , they 're referring to parallels with the Asian financial crisis and they 're giving a big serve to the way in which the world financial system has been run , " Associate Professor Bryan said .
" The statements in here are talking about comparisons to the 1920s depression and is actually pointing fingers at central banks and their policies and their misunderstanding of how the financial system works and their love of the new - fangled things that have brought the world to the precipice of what could be one of the most major financial catastrophes in the history of economics , " Satyajit Das said .
He adds that he has never seen a report as dire as this from a global economic agency .
" It 's telling central banks that they got it wrong , that they should n't have let us get into this precarious position , that they should have been constraining credit earlier and that they 've put us in a position now where there just are n't clear policy options , " Associate Professor Bryan said .
Newswise —
We know the 2008 floods devastated Iowa , with 83 of the state 's 99 counties being declared disaster areas by Gov. Chet Culver .
But what we wo n't know for some time is the actual economic impact of those flood - damage losses , according to a new report by economists from Iowa State University 's Regional Capacity Analysis Program ( ReCAP ) .
The report , " Economic Impacts of the 2008 Floods in Iowa " ( http://www.econ.iastate.edu/research/webpapers/paper_12954.pdf), details how the economic impact of this year 's flooding will be calculated .
Once all of the official losses are reported , ISU economists say the total may approach or exceed the $ 1.45 billion in losses to crops , livestock , and personal property / income reported in the 1993 floods .
( ISU Professor of Economics Dan Otto was lead author of that October 1993 report . )
But until the current numbers are in , any early projections putting losses in the billions of dollars are premature , the ISU economists say .
" We can measure lots of things .
What we can't measure is the thing that people really , really want to know -- and that 's the cost to the state in terms of losses from the flooding , " said Liesl Eathington , director of ReCAP and lead author on the report .
" We wo n't know that until everyone reports the damage .
We also wo n't know that until some of the ( state , federal and private ) aid starts to flow in , which could take months -- or in some cases , even years . "
Eathington says economists will rely on government accounts of the economy , which come out quarterly , but only at the state level and usually with a one - year lag .
" And so it may be a year , two years , or three before we can actually look at the overall performance of the economy and figure out what the net effect was , " she said .
Otto 's 1993 report also figured in the net effect .
Taking into consideration offsets such as insurance , federal disaster payments and / or grants , and additional contributions , the report put total net ag losses at $ 676 million , net wealth losses at $ 113.1 million and lost personal income at $ 112 million from the ' 93 floods .
For now , economists can only estimate losses .
As an example , the ReCAP report estimates the loss to farmers from this year 's flooding .
The USDA reported that nine percent of corn acres and eight percent of soybeans have been flooded .
Assuming that half of that land is still able to be planted or replanted into soybeans , then ISU economist Dave Swenson calculated that the change in anticipated gross sales for Iowa 's crop farmers might be as much as $ 1.2 to $ 1.5 billion less than it otherwise might have been in a normal growing year .
When losses are officially reported and the economists begin to calculate the full extent of the damage , Eathington points out that the economic impact may overstate the effects on businesses and understate the effects on households .
" It 's easier to get numbers for businesses because they have those types of records , " Eathington said .
" They 're more likely to keep track of what they had and what they lost .
It 's much harder to get numbers for households .
And in a lot of cases ( of people who experienced flood losses ) , there 's no point in even tallying the household losses because they 're not going to be compensated . "
" I would think by next year , when you start looking at business in these towns that were flooded , you 're going to start seeing decline , " said Meghan O'Brien , a ReCAP economist who specializes in retail business .
" You might have a better picture of the overall health than you would with households , but even then , it 's something that will play out over years .
So I do n't know that you 'll have a firm grasp on actual business loss for a while . "
In the 1993 floods , real nonfarm Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in Iowa actually posted a 2.7 percent gain .
But the ISU economists warn that it may be different this time around because the economy was coming out of a recession in 1993 and could be entering one this summer .
But GDP is n't really a good gauge when it comes to measuring a disaster 's economic impact anyway .
" A contributing reason GDP went up in '93 is because of the rebuilding and disaster dollars that came into Iowa , " Otto said .
" These are measured by GDP and from an aggregate statewide measure , this was an economic stimulus .
On the other hand , there were certainly losses in personal wealth which is not measured in GDP accounts . "
" Caution must be used when looking at GDP growth following a disaster , " O'Brien said .
" It does not capture the whole story nor should it imply that floods have some net benefit for the economy .
Real people , especially those affected by the floods , can no more feel GDP growth than they can recover what was lost in the floods . "
The ReCAP staff plans to continue analyzing the economic impacts of the 2008 floods to Iowa as data becomes available .

ENGINEERS ' DREAMS
[ Note : although the following story is fiction , all quotations
have been reproduced exactly from historical documents that exist . ]
Ed was old enough to remember his first transistor radio — a Zenith Royal 500 — back when seven transistors attracted attention at the beach .
Soon the Japanese showed up , doing better ( and smaller ) with six .
By the time Ed turned 65 , fifteen billion transistors per second were being produced .
Now 68 , he had been lured out of retirement when the bidding wars for young engineers ( and between them for houses ) prompted Google to begin looking for old - timers who already had seven - figure mid-peninsula roofs over their heads and did not require stock options to show up for work .
Bits are bits , gates are gates , and logic is logic .
A systems engineer from the 1960s was right at home in the bowels of a server farm in Mountain View .
In 1958 , fresh out of the Navy , Ed had been assigned to the System Development Corporation in Santa Monica to work on SAGE , the hemispheric air defense network that was completed just as the switch from bombers to missiles made it obsolete .
Some two dozen air defense sector command centers , each based around an AN - FSQ - 7 ( Army Navy Fixed Special eQuipment ) computer built by IBM , were housed in windowless buildings armored by six feet of blast - resistant concrete .
Fifty - eight thousand vacuum tubes , 170,000 diodes , 3,000 miles of wiring , 500 tons of air - conditioning equipment and a 3000 - kilowatt power supply were divided between two identical processors , one running the active system and the other standing by as a “ warm ” backup , running diagnostic routines .
One hundred Air Force officers and personnel were stationed at each command center , trained to follow a pre-rehearsed game plan in the event of enemy attack .
Artificial intelligence ?
The sooner the better , Ed hoped .
Only the collective intelligence of computers could save us from the weapons they had helped us to invent .
In 1960 , Ed attended a series of meetings with Julian Bigelow , the legendary engineer who had collaborated with Norbert Wiener on anti-aircraft fire control during World War II and with John von Neumann afterwards — developing the first 32 x 32 x 40 - bit matrix of random - access memory and the logical architecture that has descended to all computers since .
Random - access memory gave machines access to numbers — and gave numbers access to machines .
Bigelow was visiting at RAND and UCLA , where von Neumann ( preceded by engineers Gerald Estrin , Jack Rosenberg , and Willis Ware ) had been planning to build a new laboratory before cancer brought his trajectory to a halt .
Copies of the machine they had built together in Princeton had proliferated as explosively as the Monte Carlo simulations of chain - reacting neutrons hosted by the original 5 - kilobyte prototype in 1951 .
Bigelow , who never expected the design compromises he made in 1946 to survive for sixty years , questioned the central dogma of digital computing : that without programmers , computers cannot compute .
He viewed processors as organisms that digest code and produce results , consuming instructions so fast that iterative , recursive processes are the only way that humans are able to generate instructions fast enough to keep up .
" Highly recursive , conditional and repetitive routines are used because they are notationally efficient ( but not necessarily unique ) as descriptions of underlying processes , " he explained .
Strictly sequential processing , and strictly numerical addressing impose severe restrictions on the abilities of computers , and Bigelow speculated from the very beginning about " the possibility of causing various elementary pieces of information situated in the cells of a large array ( say , of memory ) to enter into a computation process without explicitly generating a coordinate address in ' machine - space ' for selecting them out of the array . "
At Google , Bigelow 's vision was being brought to life .
The von Neumann universe was becoming a non-von Neumann universe .
Turing machines were being assembled into something that was not a Turing machine .
In biology , the instructions say " Do this with that " ( without specifying where or when the next available copy of a particular molecule is expected to be found ) or " Connect this to that " ( without specifying a numerical address ) .
Technology was finally catching up .
Here , at last , was the long - awaited revolt against the intolerance of the numerical address matrix and central clock cycle for error and ambiguity in specifying where and when .
The advent of template - based addressing would unleash entirely new forms of digital organisms , beginning with simple and semi-autonomous coded structures , on the level of nucleotides bringing amino acids ( or template - based AdWords revenue ) back to a collective nest .
The search for answers to questions of interest to human beings was only one step along the way .
Google was inverting the von Neumann matrix — by coaxing the matrix into inverting itself .
Von Neumann 's " Numerical Inverting of Matrices of High Order , " published ( with Herman Goldstine ) in 1947 , confirmed his ambition to build a machine that could invert matrices of non-trivial size .
A 1950 postscript , " Matrix Inversion by a Monte Carlo Method , " describes how a statistical , random - walk procedure credited to von Neumann and Stan Ulam " can be used to invert a class of n- th order matrices with only n2 arithmetic operations in addition to the scanning and discriminating required to play the solitaire game . "
The aggregate of all our searches for unpredictable ( but meaningful ) strings of bits , is , in effect , a Monte Carlo process for inverting the matrix that constitutes the World Wide Web .
Ed developed a rapport with the machines that escaped those who had never felt the warmth of a vacuum tube or the texture of a core memory plane .
Within three months he was not only troubleshooting the misbehavior of individual data centers , but examining how the archipelago of data centers cooperated — and competed — on a global scale .
In the digital universe that greeted the launch of Google , 99 percent of processing cycles were going to waste .
The global computer , for all its powers , was perhaps the least efficient machine that humans had ever built .
There was a thin veneer of instructions , and then there was this dark , empty , 99 percent .
What brought Ed to the attention of Google was that he had been in on something referred to as " Mach 9 . "
In the late 1990's , a web of optical fiber had engulfed the world .
At peak deployment , in 2000 , fiber was being rolled out , globally , at 7,000 miles per hour , or nine times the speed of sound .
Mach 9 .
All the people in the world , talking at once , could never light up all this fiber .
But those 15 billion transistors being added every second could .
Google had been buying up dark fiber at pennies on the dollar and bringing in those , like Ed , who understood the high - speed optical switching required to connect dark processors to dark fiber .
Metazoan codes would do the rest .
As he surveyed the Google Archipelago , Ed was reminded of some handwritten notes that Julian Bigelow had showed him , summarizing a conversation between Stan Ulam and John von Neumann on a bench in Central Park in early November 1952 .
Ulam and von Neumann had met in secret to discuss the 10 - megaton Mike shot , whose detonation at Eniwetok on November 1 would be kept embargoed from the public until 1953 .
Mike ushered in not only the age of thermonuclear weapons but the age of digital computers , confirming the inaugural calculation that had run on the Princeton machine for a full six weeks .
The conversation soon turned from the end of one world to the dawning of the next .
“ Given is an actually infinite system of points ( the actual infinity is worth stressing because nothing will make sense on a finite no matter how large model ) , ” noted Ulam , who then sketched how he and von Neumann had hypothesized the evolution of Turing - complete universal cellular automata within a digital universe of communicating memory cells .
For von Neumann to remain interested , the definitions had to be mathematically precise : “ A ‘ universal ’ automaton is a finite system which given an arbitrary logical proposition in form of ( a linear set L ) tape attached to it , at say specified points , will produce the true or false answer .
( Universal ought to have relative sense : with reference to a class of problems it can decide ) .
The ‘ arbitrary ’ means really in a class of propositions like Turing 's — or smaller or bigger . ”
“ An organism ( any reason to be afraid of this term yet ? ) is a universal automaton which produces other automata like it in space which is inert or only ‘ randomly activated ’ around it , ” Ulam ’s notes continued .
“ This ‘ universality ’ is probably necessary to organize or resist organization by other automata ? ” he asked , parenthetically , before outlining a mathematical formulation of the evolution of such organisms into metazoan forms .
In the end he acknowledged that a stochastic , rather than deterministic , model might have to be invoked , which , “ unfortunately , would have to involve an enormous amount of probabilistic superstructure to the outlined theory .
I think it should probably be omitted unless it involves the crux of the generation and evolution problem — which it might ? ”
The universal machines now proliferating fastest in the digital universe are virtual machines — not simply Turing machines , but Turing - Ulam machines .
They exist as precisely - defined entities in the Von Neumann universe , but have no fixed existence in ours .
Sure , thought Ed , they are merely doing the low - level digital housekeeping that does not require dedicated physical machines .
But Ed knew this was the beginning of something big .
Google ( both directly and indirectly ) was breeding huge numbers of Turing - Ulam machines .
They were proliferating so fast that real machines were having trouble keeping up .
Only one third of a search engine is devoted to fulfilling search requests .
The other two thirds are divided between crawling ( sending a host of single - minded digital organisms out to gather information ) and indexing ( building data structures from the results ) .
Ed's job was to balance the resulting loads .
When Ed examined the traffic , he realized that Google was doing more than mapping the digital universe .
Google does n't merely link or point to data .
It moves data around .
Data that are associated frequently by search requests are locally replicated — establishing physical proximity , in the real universe , that is manifested computationally as proximity in time .
Google was more than a map .
Google was becoming something else .
In the seclusion of the server room , Ed 's thoughts drifted back to the second floor communications center that linked the two hemispheres of SAGE 's ANFSQ7 brain .
" Are you awake ?
Yes , now go back to sleep ! " was repeated over and over , just to verify that the system was on the alert .
SAGE 's one million lines of code were near the limit of a system whose behavior could be predicted from one cycle to the next .
Ed was reminded of cybernetician W. Ross Ashby 's " Law of Requisite Variety " : that any effective control system has to be as complex as the system it controls .
This was the paradox of artificial intelligence : any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently ; and any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will not be simple enough to understand .
Some held out hope that the path to artificial intelligence could be found through the human brain : trace the pattern of connections into a large enough computer , and you would end up re-creating mind .
Alan Turing 's suggestion , to build a disorganized machine with the curiosity of a child , made more sense .
Eventually , " interference would no longer be necessary , and the machine would have ‘ grown up ’ . "
This was Google 's approach .
Harvest all the data in the world , rendering all available answers accessible to all possible questions , and then reinforce the meaningful associations while letting the meaningless ones die out .
Since , by diagonal argument in the scale of possible infinities , there will always be more questions than answers , it is better to start by collecting the answers , and then find the questions , rather than the other way around .
And why trace the connections in the brain of one individual when you can trace the connections in the mind of the entire species at once ?
Are we searching Google , or is Google searching us ?
Google 's data centers — windowless , but without the blast protection — were the direct descendants of SAGE .
It was n't just the hum of air conditioning and warm racks of electronics that reminded Ed of 1958 .
The problem Ed faced was similar — how to balance the side that was awake with the side that was asleep .
For SAGE , this was simple — the two hemispheres were on opposite sides of the same building — whereas Google 's hemispheres were unevenly distributed from moment to moment throughout a network that spanned the globe .
Nobody understood this , not even Ed .
The connections between data centers were so adaptable that you could not predict , from one moment to the next , whether a given part of the Googleverse was " asleep " or " awake . "
More computation was occurring while " asleep , " since the system was free to run at its own self - optimizing pace rather that wait for outside search requests .
Unstable oscillations had begun appearing , and occasionally triggered overload alerts .
Responding to the alarms , Ed finally did what any engineer of his generation would do : he went home , got a good night 's sleep , and brought his old Tektronix oscilloscope with him to work .
He descended into one of the basement switching centers and started tapping into the switching nodes .
In the digital age , everything had gone to megahertz , and now gigahertz , and the analog oscilloscope had been left behind .
But if you had an odd wave - form that needed puzzling over , this was the tool to use .
What if analog was not really over ?
What if the digital matrix had now become the substrate upon which new , analog structures were starting to grow ?
Pulse - frequency coding , whether in a nervous system or a probabilistic search - engine , is based on statistical accounting for what connects where , and how frequently connections are made between given points .
PageRank for neurons is one way to describe the working architecture of the brain .
As von Neumann explained in 1948 : " A new , essentially logical , theory is called for in order to understand high - complication automata and , in particular , the central nervous system .
It may be , however , that in this process logic will have to undergo a pseudomorphosis to neurology to a much greater extent than the reverse . "
Ulam had summed it up : “ What makes you so sure that mathematical logic corresponds to the way we think ? ”
As Ed traced the low - frequency harmonic oscillations that reverberated below the digital horizon , he lost track of time .
He realized he was hungry and made his way upstairs .
The oscilloscope traces had left ghosts in his vision , like the image that lingers for a few seconds when a cathode - ray tube is shut down .
As he sat down to a bowl of noodles in the cafeteria , he realized that he had seen these 13 - hertz cycles , clear off the scale of anything in the digital world , before .
It was 1965 , and he had been assigned , under a contract with Stanford University , to physiologist William C. Dement , who was setting up a lab to do sleep research .
Dement , who had been in on the discovery of what became known as REM sleep , was investigating newborn infants , who spend much of their time in dreaming sleep .
Dement hypothesized that dreaming was an essential step in the initialization of the brain .
Eventually , if all goes well , awareness of reality evolves from the internal dream — a state we periodically return to during sleep .
Ed had helped with setting up Dement 's lab , and had spent many late nights getting the electroencephalographs fine - tuned .
He had lost track of Bill Dement over the years .
But he remembered the title of the article in SCIENCE that Dement had sent to him , inscribed " to Ed , with thanks from Bill . "
It was " Ontogenetic Development of the Human Sleep - Dream Cycle .
The prime role of ‘ dreaming sleep ’ in early life may be in the development of the central nervous system . "
Ed cleared his tray and walked outside .
In a few minutes he was at the edge of the Google campus , and kept walking , in the dark , towards Moffett Field .
He tried not to think .
As he started walking back , into the pre-dawn twilight , with the hint of a breeze bringing the scent of the unseen salt marshes to the east , he looked up at the sky , trying to clear the details of the network traffic logs and the oscilloscope traces from his mind .
For 400 years , we have been waiting for machines to begin to think .
" We 've been asking the wrong question , " he whispered under his breath .
They would start to dream first .
Happy Lazy Sunday ,
Today we 're going to grind through our " Lazy Sunday " post with a quick script to update SSH keys network - wide , by using rsh ( the less secure of the two protocols ) .
Once you 've accomplished this ( or have already accomplished this ) and are happy with your network 's SSH setup , I 'd suggest disabling rsh altogether .
Then you can move on to quickly setting up your SSH keys all over the network , focus on maintaining the integrity of your sessions , if you have issues with that , and even setting simple SCP routines to help keep your network easy to manage .
My feeling is that , no matter what the circumstances ( unless they make it so you " have " to use it ) , rsh should always be disabled , no matter what version of Linux or Unix you 're running .
Certain software ( like SunCluster ) can experience very strange issues if you do n't allow it .
At least , up to version 3.1 .
I can only afford to keep myself in the almost - very - best , after all ;)
Enjoy your Sunday , and enjoy this little script :)
A lot of how you use it depends on the way your network is set up .
If it 's already secure , you can modify it slightly to use to update host keys , but it was mostly written for folks with a hybrid rsh / SSH setup , who want to move to full SSH implementation , so that keys can be upgraded everywhere at once from the same base set .
The only major assumptions this script makes is that you 've built openssl , openssh and zlib from source , want to install in /usr / local and are running this script from the top level directory of those builds .
It should be run with a list of servers following the command name :
host # ./sshdist.sh servera serverb serverc ...

Hi , everyone .
As many of you know , we released PS3 firmware update v2.40 last week , but had to take it offline temporarily because , for a limited number of users , the XMB would n’t display after the update was installed .
We ’ve been able to fix the problem , and I ’m happy to report that firmware update v2.41 will be released shortly .
We want to extend our apologies to the PlayStation community for any inconvenience .
Now we ’ll be looking forward to seeing everyone online and racking up those trophies !
Tuesday saw Seattle residents given the opportunity to voice their opinion on Mayor Greg Nickel ’s proposal to ban Styrofoam containers , and impose a fee on plastic and paper bags at the checkout at supermarkets and local stores .
And from what is slowly sliding out over the internets , the idea has been met with a warm reception .
The proposal was be enacted in a two stage process .
Beginning in January of 2009 , all foam products would be banned , but restraints and grocery stores would be allowed to switch to plastic products if they had n’t found a biodegradable replacement .
The second stage would go in to effect by 2010 , at which time all plastics would be banned , leaving only biodegradables .
During the January and July period , a 20 - cent per bag fee would be imposed in the checkout line at all grocery , convenience and drugstores .
The Seattle Post Intelligencer quoted Ravenna resident Liz Tatchell as saying she thought it was “ … a great step in the right direction , ” and “ It ’s more than just the bags — it ’s a lifestyle change . ”
They added that “ nearly all of the dozens of Seattleites … supported the proposal . ”
Naturally , there was some opposition from representatives of the grocery industry who want a flat fee rather than a per-bag charge .
But on the whole , it looks like Seattle residents are ready and willing to make the change to a more environmentally friendly future .

It was drawn for an Apple - themed demo party in 2006 .
I wanted to show that ASCII art was not just about animals and cartoon characters . "
This year 's E3 comes at a crucial time for the three big console makers .
Difficult and expensive launch periods have been completed , developers have got to grips with the demands of new hardware and a growing market of gamers is hungry for new content .
But what lies ahead for Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo ?
MICROSOFT XBOX 360 Eight years after Bill Gates first announced plans for a Microsoft games console , called the Xbox , the company has yet to lead the market significantly in any territory .
Factfile : Xbox 360
And for all the billions of dollars invested in Xbox the company has yet to see any financial return .
So has the Xbox project being a failure ?
Analyst Nick Parker , who has worked for all the console firms , said : " One could look at the maths and say yes , from a business point of view you would not have made the same moves seven years ago .
" But in terms of what they have achieved they have certainly built up the best online gaming console for the masses . "
He added : " It has n't been an easy ride for them ; they made some early mistakes with the brand and the product itself . "
The ugly black box of the original Xbox , its oversized controllers and noisy fan turned many gamers off .
" There is a lot of negative heritage from the previous model , " said Mr Parker .
Determined to get to market early , the Xbox 360 was the first of the current generation devices to reach eager gamers .
Piers Harding - Rolls , an analyst with Screen Digest , said : " They had a head of steam built but did n't deliver on it .
" Despite their early launch and success of Xbox they did n't build up a successful brand on continental Europe . "
The Xbox 360 has become synonymous with hard - core gaming , fuelled by the success of action titles such as Gears of War and the Halo franchise , and across continental Europe it is an image which turns many gamers off .
Mr Parker said : " Their issues are still with the brand in Europe .
They are fighting a very robust legacy brand in PlayStation . "
But Microsoft is preparing a major re-branding exercise to overturn many consumers ' preconceptions about the console .
" Europe is the true competitive front ; they see it as the tipping point , " said Mr Harding - Rolls .
He added : " They realise now that the European market is not the US market . "
An industry insider told BBC News that Microsoft had a " considerable war chest " to invest in re-positioning the image of the Xbox 360 to mainland Europe .
And software titles that appeal to a wider demographic will be a large part of that strategy .
At E3 Microsoft is expect to place a large amount of emphasis on family and social games , through software and peripherals .
In many ways Microsoft is attempting to wrestle away some of the success Nintendo has had with its Wii console .
But the job of re-inventing the Xbox 360 for a whole new market of gamers was " a big gamble " , said Mr Parker .
" But , " he added , " they have got to do it . "
NINTENDO WII " No - one predicted how successful the Wii was going to be , " said Mr Harding - Rolls .
Factfile : Wii After failing to deliver the success it had hoped for with the GameCube , Nintendo surprised many by taking a completely different route with its follow - up , the Wii .
" Nintendo was really astute to recognise the potential of social gaming and to see its popularity on platforms like the PC , translate it to the console space and have it on primary screens in the living room , " explained Mr Harding - Rolls .
Sony may have helped to pioneer social gaming on PlayStation 2 with Singstar and EyeToy , but Nintendo took the genre on and turned it into a global phenomenon .
" It 's almost a parallel games market , " said Mr Parker .
" There 's been a lot of talk recently about whether what they do is games or lifestyle assistants , " he added .
But that success has brought its own challenges .
" There are still question marks over its longevity , " said Mr Harding - Rolls .
" Of those people who go out and buy hardware and Wii Fit , how many will buy follow - up software ? "
But he added : " But it 's not a fad .
It 's a legitimate product with legitimate customer base . "
There are also question marks about some developers ' commitment to the platform long term .
" They are not investing huge amounts of cash into the market and letting Nintendo alone drive hardware sales , " said Mr Parker .
Developer David Braben , whose firm Frontier produced Lost Winds for the Wii , said the console was a key part of its plans .
He said : " There has been quite a lot of differentiation between the consoles , which has n't happened before with console generations .
" The type of people who buy Wii contrast with those who buy the other consoles .
That lets us develop something new and fresh for the console , instead of just another sequel . "
SONY PLAYSTATION 3 Delays , resentment over its high price , confusion over differing models and features around the world ; the birth of PlayStation 3 was anything but smooth .
Factfile : PlayStation 3
But all the signs point to Sony steering the PlayStation 3 into smoother waters .
Mr Parker said : " They are pretty much on track .
Analysts and journalists were expecting too much too quickly on PlayStation 3 .
" It was always going to take a long time .
But they are very loyal to PlayStation in Europe and now that the big games are hitting the shops people are buying the machine . "
Mr Harding - Rolls added : " To analysts , Sony 's launch figures were very good . "
For Sony , the next 12 months is about maintaining its momentum and trying to differentiate the PS3 from its direct rival , the Xbox 360 .
At E3 the company is tipped to push connectivity between the PlayStation Portable and the PS3 , as well as growing the use of user - generated content in gaming through the use of peripherals like EyeToy .
The company 's plans for the device as a multimedia hub are also expected to take shape at E3 , with reports of a movie download store and confirmation dates for the launch of peripherals like Play TV and its virtual world , Home , expected .
Long - awaited games such as Killzone 2 and LittleBigPlanet are now on the near horizon and Sony will be keen to flex its first - party development muscles .
Mr Harding - Rolls said : " Their key differentiator from rivals is their internal development capability .
The potential is there but they have n't fully delivered .
" Nintendo may be more prolific but they do n't have as many staff as Sony . "

I had never even heard of Warhammer until just over a year ago .
I had never seen the army pieces you could paint up or even played any Warhammer PC games .
So when a fellow World of Warcraft guild member said it was going to be the best MMO ever because it was being developed by Mythic Entertainment , the people that made Dark Age of Camelot , I shrugged it off .
I was too busy playing Ultima Online and never got into Dark Age of Camelot .
He kept babbling on and on about " Realm vs. Realm " and capturing keeps with siege weapons .
World of Warcraft was my game of choice and addiction at that time ; I could n’t imagine playing any other MMORPG .
Time traveling forward to the present , my love of World of Warcraft is done .
It was a great game , but it wore me down to a nub .
All my time in the game was spent chatting in the trade channel , waiting for the arena queues to pop and raid groups to fill up .
So , I did n’t hesitate one second when I received that golden ticket in my email that told me to come join the WAR .
You can bet that I played through Warhammer Online comparing it to World of Warcraft .
I played WoW for years , and my recent burn with Age of Conan had me approaching Warhammer Online even more cautiously .
The first thing I noticed while playing Warhammer Online was that the graphics do have a cartoony feel to them , similar to World of Warcraft .
While the style of the graphics have similarities , the detailing in Warhammer far outweigh those of it ’s predecessor .
Whether it ’s the massive buildings and cities , the vast environments or the armor and weapon graphics , the detail is everywhere in WAR .
I kept having to tell myself this was beta and not the finished product .
Mythic has split the game into two main factions , Order and Destruction .
Order consists of the Dwarves , High Elves , and Empire , while Destruction is made up of Greenskins , Dark Elves , and Chaos .
This type of setup is identical to World of Warcraft as well .
The differences are in how these zones are played out .
Dwarves and Greenskins , for example , share the same zone and are constantly at war with each other throughout the game .
It ’s not uncommon to see other factions aiding you in your battles , as no one is limited to only one zone and can take advantage of the flight masters at the war camps .
The character selection in WAR is unmatched .
You have ten unique classes per faction to pick from ; that ’s twenty for those who are n’t counting .
Let me repeat this , ten unique classes available for each faction .
The closest thing World of Warcraft has to this is the forced lore classes , the Tauren and Nightelf Druids .
Just the idea of never running into my same class on the other faction had me tickled .
The customization of characters is limited by the Warhammer IP and so you wo n’t find any characters with pink or blue hair .
My most recent character I tested on was the Dwarf Engineer .
He ’s a stubby guy with a twisted love of guns and explosives .
I gave him a long , braided beard with black hair , a couple earrings and nose rings and named him Engie ( catchy , huh ? ) .
I loaded into the game and found myself in a massive , stone and metal area .
Massive does n’t really do it justice .
If big is a White Castle burger , this was definitely the Hardee ’s monster burger .
It looked like I was in some type of juiced up siege weapon factory , with large explosions and machinery running .
After taking in the sights and sounds , I wandered over to the initial quest giver and started my leveling .
This underground mine is being overran by squigs and goblins .
Questing in World of Warcraft is boring and really does not tell a story until much later in the game .
All of this is gone in Warhammer : the quests smash the lore into your brain and before you know it , you ’re starting to resemble your character out of game .
Maybe not that drastic , but you definitely get a better feel of the story through even the first WAR quests .
My little Dwarf that could , Engie , picked up his first quest and was directed to run down and kill some squigs .
Those pesky two - legged creatures are always causing problems .
On the way down , I also picked up a quest to blow up a mine shaft and trap the greenskins inside .
I killed my four squigs easily with a few ranged shots and smacking them with my wrench and proceeded into the mine to blow up the shaft .
I found the trigger to drop the shaft on some goblins and I had completed my first two quests ever as a Dwarf .
If the questing alone has you excited to jump into WAR and smash some skulls , public questing should have your squirming in your chair .
Public questing is currently unique to only Warhammer Online , but it is definitely something that every developer will be including in their future MMOs .
PQ’s are just simply areas on the map that have objectives .
The first objective is usually something easy , like gathering supplies or killing easy NPCs .
After the first objective , the group aspect begins and you are asked to kill a set number of harder NPCs and finally down a boss NPC in the last phase .
After the boss is downed , a window pops up showing everyone ’s contribution in the public quest .
Loot is distributed by random rolling and the top contributers gain a scaling bonus to their rolls .
While it ’s more likely that a higher contributor will win the roll , it is still possible that the last place contributer gets first place in the loot .
Public quests vary in their difficulty and the loot from each public quest changes based on that difficulty .
Completing objectives and public quest phases earn your character influence points .
Influence is earned in three tiers and opening each tier allows your character to select loot .
I found myself farming these public quests with groups of people for the loot and influence .
Grouping is similar in ways to WoW , but differs in a few major areas that I noticed .
First , group sizes are six and not five like World of Warcraft .
Open grouping was the first major difference someone will notice .
When your character is not grouped , there is always an icon located below your character ’s healthbar .
Clicking the open group icon will open up a list of all open groups in your area and anyone can click the button to join .
This is great for those that do n’t like to spend time finding a group or trying to start one , letting the group form itself .
Private groups can be set in the group options , as well .
The other major thing about grouping that I noticed was there is not a penalty for questing in a warband .
Warbands are larger groups of groups of players .
Many public quests start out with a few people and grow into a nearly full warband by the time it ’s completed .
The loot system in World of Warcraft can bring a grown man to tears .
Hours and hours spent in raids and groups , farming the same thing over and over , only to get beat on the roll by someone who does n’t even need the item .
Do n’t forget that quest that took you three weeks to complete and only to find out that the item rewards are for a class that is n’t yours .
Warhammer Online does all it can to squash these annoyances .
Your quest loot is catered to your character ; Chaos Marauder quest loot is for a Chaos Marauder .
This also holds true for all loot from public questing .
Do n’t worry , though , there is still plenty of rare loot that drops off players and monsters that can be traded and sold to other classes .
The player vs. player ( PvP ) in Warhammer Online is something that reminds me of the old WoW days .
You know , way back when the struggle was n’t over arena gear and arena titles .
Back when the players would line up , all different levels , and compete in a virtual tug of war in Hillsbrad .
There was nothing to earn and no real reason to be there .
Along came the battlegrounds and arenas , and PvP in World of Warcraft became all about the honor , gear , and arena ranks .
What Warhammer does great is bring everything together in one massive RvR package .
Every quest you complete , every scenario you win , and every keep you smash through and capture all play a role in your character ’s , your guild ’s , and your realm ’s progression through the game .
I must add that there is nothing as chaotic and fun as trying to storm a keep with a large group of players inside defending .
Now just look at the detail on that boat .
The Tome of Knowledge feature in Warhammer Online has recently sent Blizzard into a fury to implement something similar into their game .
The tome allows you to track everything that your character has done .
Kill twenty five boars and you get a popup with an experience reward .
There are literally thousands of possible tome unlocks and trying to complete some of the more challenging could keep someone busy for months .
Multiple unlocks include titles , and these range from the silly to the really silly .
Mythic does a great job of adding their own sense of humor and keeping it Warhammer related .
Even though the Tome of Knowledge is not Mythic ’s own idea , the way they implemented it into the game is definitely unique .
It ’s a giant leap ahead of Blizzard ’s upcoming achievement system .
The tome is not simply about unlocks and rewards ; it tells your characters story , where you have been and what you have done .
There are many other features in Warhammer Online that ca n’t be compared to World of Warcraft , simply because they are unique to WAR :
Class trainers are able to train up any class in the game
A character can queue up for a scenario from anywhere with the scenario button .
Players have a small circular guide around their characters showing group members .
Flagging yourself for RvR in a lower tiered zone will make your character become a chicken with one health point .
Players automatically receive new storage bags as they level up and quest items are automatically stored in a separate bag .
Players can fully edit their User Interface ( UI ) and customize it to their preference .
The differences definitely exceed the similarities and I have not ran into anything yet in Warhammer that makes me wish it was more like World of Warcraft .
Mythic Entertainment did the impossible with Warhammer Online : it made me go from a skeptic to a rabid fan in a matter of hours .
It is what I have been waiting for in a MMORPG for a long time .
It takes all of the best parts of other MMOs , adds a crazy Warhammer twist , improves it in a unique Mythic way , and rolls it up into a big ball of MMO goodness .
The only question you should be asking yourself is how you are going to pass the time from now until September 18th .
WAR is coming !

Oil production has begun falling at all of the major Western oil companies , and they are finding it harder than ever to find new prospects even though they are awash in profits and eager to expand .
Part of the reason is political .
From the Caspian Sea to South America , Western oil companies are being squeezed out of resource - rich provinces .
They are being forced to renegotiate contracts on less - favorable terms and are fighting losing battles with assertive state - owned oil companies .
And much of their production is in mature regions that are declining , like the North Sea .
The reality , experts say , is that the oil giants that once dominated the global market have lost much of their influence — and with it , their ability to increase supplies .
“ This is an industry in crisis , ” said Amy Myers Jaffe , the associate director of Rice University ’s energy program in Houston .
“ It ’s a crisis of leadership , a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors , ” a term often applied to the biggest oil companies .
“ They are like a deer caught in headlights .
They know they have to move , but they ca n’t decide where to go . ”

Advertisement A live deep - sea fish has been caught at a record depth of 2,300 m on the hot vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
Three shrimp species were also pulled to the surface , researchers report in the journal Deep - Sea Research .
Scientists have engineered a new device that allows recovery of live animals under their natural pressure at greater depths than previously achieved .
Next they hope to be able to transfer the animals into an experimental lab to study their normal biology .
" Pressurised recovery has been around for the past 30 years , but this is the deepest fish - capture under pressure - the previous record was 1,400 m .
This is also the first time pressurised capture has occurred at a hydrothermal vent , " said Dr Bruce Shillito , marine biologist at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie , Paris , France .
The shrimp species were caught at 1,700 m ( 5,600 ft ; Mirocaris fortunata and Chorocaris chacei ) and 2,300 m ( 7,500 ft ; Rimicaris exoculata ) at two vent fields , Lucky Strike and Rainbow , on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge .
Scientists watch the deep - sea fish inside the Periscop onboard ship Dr Shillito explains : " At depths of over 1,000 m , it is difficult to recover animals alive .
Catching with no pressure is as good as catching dead .
Fish are the most fragile - even a fisherman with a 100 m line will probably reel in a catch whose gas bladder is in its mouth . "
Although the fish caught by the team was a zoarcid ( Pachycara saldanhai ) and had no gas bladder , it was sensitive to full decompression .
At the surface , under pressure , the fish was active and remained upright , however upon release of pressure its movement became uncoordinated and within a few minutes it was totally motionless .
A similar effect , caused by decompression , was also observed in the shrimp species .
At the surface , under pressure , most shrimps were in an upright position and swimming actively and continuously .
When a separate shrimp sample was caught and pulled to the surface without pressure , the animals jerked violently , and after a few hours were dead .
The samples were examined onboard the ship " Pourquoi Pas ? " during the Momareto cruise , which was organised by Ifremer , the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea .

The next step for Dr Shillito 's team is to be able to transfer its catch from the sampling device into a better equipped experimental tank , without decompression , allowing the scientists to observe the animals ' normal behaviour and responses to different environments .
" We are particularly interested in the Pompeii worm ( Alvinella pompejana ) , a vent worm which is thought to be the most thermo- tolerant marine organism , yet remains to be recovered in good enough shape .
It is intriguing to find out how heat - resistant this animal is , " Dr Shillito told BBC News .
Despite covering about 60 % of the Earth 's surface , the deep - sea floor ecosystem is poorly understood .
Dr Shillito says : " We urgently need to find out more about the place we are destroying . "
He adds : " At a time when we are over - fishing the depths of the ocean , we know more about cooking recipes than the biological features of deep - sea fauna . "
A new device
The new sampling system for pressured recovery , which has been named Periscop , was developed by Dr Shillito in conjunction with Mr Gerard Hamel , a mechanics engineer at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie .
It received funding from Exocet/d , a large European research programme .
It has three compartments which perform different tasks - capture at depth , recovery of the deep - sea species under natural pressure , and transfer to the lab with no decompression .
" In most previous attempts involving pressurised recovery , a single container fulfilled these three tasks - this may lead to contradictory technical requirements , " explains Dr Shillito .
The plastic capture box is attached to a submersible arm which allows movement and suction for sampling .
The animal is then transferred into a pressurised box .
This is kept at the same pressure as the sampling depth during ascent by a pressure compensator .
" We used pressurised water to maintain pressure , which is a safer and a simpler alternative to gas .
We hope this method of pressurised recovery will become standard , " Dr Shillito said .
As well as pressure shock , when animals are pulled to the surface they suffer from changes in temperature .
" The temperature at depths below 2,000 m is pretty constant all over the world - around 2 - 4C , yet the surface waters where we were sampling were 22 - 25 C , " explains Dr Shillito .
He adds : " Heating is difficult to prevent without getting out the heavy gear - using active cooling systems , requiring energy and computer controls - but at least we know that every sample has had the same temperature history ; they have the same background story . "

What are these ?
It 's a perfect fall - back phrase , used constantly by the President and members of the administration to gain acquiescence and passivity from the public , Congress , and the Courts without providing a substantive reason for any measure they proclaim is " absolutely vital " :
" If you knew what we know ... "
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
If Congress saw the intelligence about WMDs , they would understand why it was " absolutely vital " to invade a country that weapons inspectors said most likely had none .
If the inspectors only knew what the administration knew , they would change their minds .
That being so , why not fill the inspectors in ?
What could possibly be gained from not proving to the inspectors how wrong they were ?
If the Courts only knew all the evidence against the evil terrorists we keep in cages down in Cuba , they would understand why we can't let them have access to the justice system that has always been perfectly capable of conducting terror trials in the past , but is now woefully inadequate - we just can't tell you why , ' cause it 's a secret .
Just trust us .
Even when large numbers of those people we once assured you were " the worst of the worst " are quietly released , now inexplicably designated as " no longer enemy combatants . "
If all you common folk knew what we know , you 'd understand why we have to spy on your phone calls and e-mails , library records and internet activity , watch your every move with satellites , and keep records of your travel information , hotel stays , letters to the editor , political and social affiliations , which churches you attend , products you buy , and how much money is in your checking account .
Well , dammit , I want to know what you know .
If you want to send our sons and daughters to invade a country that has n't attacked us , on the basis that they have WMDs and pose an imminent threat , do n't just tell me to trust you - show me .
I want facts : credible testimony backed by hard evidence , proof that you have exhausted all diplomatic avenues , that you have a sound plan of attack , a plan to win the peace , and a plan to get the hell out when we 're done .
You do n't have to give away all the tactical and strategic details , but you owe me more than vague talk of " mushroom clouds " and fabricated stories of " yellow - cake " and " aluminum tubes . "
Do n't play on our emotions and appeal to our fears .
Give us the information we need to make intelligent , reasoned decisions - and then trust us to make them .
If you need more authority to conduct surveillance , ask for it before breaking whatever law you choose only because you doubt you can get the authority you need .
If you thought you could n't get it , you probably should n't have it .
It does n't take a rocket scientist to see that if you were afraid to get permission from the American People , you knew what you were doing was illegal .
Because if you knew what we know ,
you 'd know that a huge majority of American citizens despise you for the damage you have done to the country that we love more than any other .
You 'd know that we are appalled at the arrogance and incompetence you have displayed , and the precious honor and prestige , and lives you have squandered by your stubborn refusal to admit and correct your mistakes .
You 'd know that Americans place great value in our reputation as a champion of the Rule of Law and a defender of human rights - a long - held reputation which you have single - handedly destroyed in seven short years .
If you knew what we know , you would realize that the American People do n't want " protection " at any price .
What good is physical protection from terrorists if people are afraid of their own Government ?
You 'd know that in America , there are no such things as " free speech zones " , and that every square - foot of this nation is a place where First - Amendment rights are protected .
You 'd know , like your favorite predecessor , " Honest Abe " Lincoln knew , that public sentiment is everything , and without the Will of the People , nothing can be accomplished .
Opinion polls , despite your frequent proclamations to the contrary , really do matter .
Abe said so himself .
If Americans wanted a leader who did n't care what they wanted , we would elect Dick Cheney as all - powerful King and Dicktator , and transfer ownership of all public property and government programs to Halliburton , and assign all law enforcement functions to Blackwater .
If you knew what we know , you 'd know that it is unforgivably shameful to demand hundreds of billions of dollars to pay for your colossal blunder of a war , and refuse comparatively miniscule funds to make sure our children can see a doctor when they get sick .
Once , you had the chance to be remembered as one of the greatest Presidents ever to lead the nation .
If you knew what we know , you would understand that you are undoubtedly destined to be remembered as the worst .

War Criminals Must Fear Punishment .
That ’s why I went for John Bolton
George Monbiot – The Guardian ,
Tuesday June 3 2008
guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media Limited 2008
I realize now that I did n’t have a hope .
I had almost reached the stage when two of the biggest gorillas I have ever seen swept me up and carried me out of the tent .
It was humiliating , but it could have been worse .
The guard on the other side of the stage , half hidden in the curtains , had spent the lecture touching something under his left armpit .
Perhaps he had bubos .
I had no intention of arresting John Bolton , the former under - secretary of state at the US state department , when I arrived at the Hay festival .
But during a panel discussion about the Iraq war , I remarked that the greatest crime of the 21st century had become so normalized that one of its authors was due to visit the festival to promote his book .
I proposed that someone should attempt a citizens ’ arrest , in the hope of instilling a fear of punishment among those who plan illegal wars .
After the session I realised that I could n’t call on other people to do something I was n’t prepared to do myself .
I knew that I was more likely to be arrested and charged than Mr Bolton .
I had no intention of harming him , or of acting in any way that could be interpreted as aggressive , but had I sought only to steer him gently towards the police I might have faced a range of exotic charges , from false imprisonment to aggravated assault .
I was prepared to take this risk .
It is not enough to demand that other people act , knowing that they will not .
If the police , the courts and the state fail to prosecute what the Nuremberg tribunal described as “ the supreme international crime ” , I believe we have a duty to seek to advance the process .
The Nuremberg principles , which arose from the prosecution of Nazi war criminals , define as an international crime the “ planning , preparation , initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties , agreements or assurances ” .
Bolton appears to have “ participated in a common plan ” to prepare for the war ( also defined by the principles as a crime ) by inserting the false claim that Iraq was seeking to procure uranium from Niger into a state department factsheet .
He also organised the sacking of JosÃ© Bustani , the head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons , accusing him of bad management .
Bustani had tried to broker a peaceful resolution of the dispute over Iraq ’s alleged weapons of mass destruction .
Some of the most pungent criticisms of my feeble attempt to bring this man to justice have come from other writers for the Guardian .
Michael
White took a position of extraordinary generosity towards the instigators of the war .
There are “ arguments on both sides ” , he contended on the Guardian politics blog .
Bustani might have received compensation after his sacking by Bolton , “ but Bolton says that does not mean much ” .
In fact , Bustani was not only compensated at his tribunal , he was completely exonerated of Bolton ’s accusations and his employers were obliged to pay special damages .
White suggested that Iraq might indeed have been seeking uranium from Niger , on the grounds of a conversation he once had with an MI6 officer .
Alongside the British government ’s 45 - minute claim , this must be the best - documented of all the false justifications for the war with Iraq .
In 2002 , the United States government sent three senior officials to Niger to investigate the claim .
All reported that it was without foundation .
The International Atomic Energy Agency discovered that it was based on crude forgeries .
This assessment was confirmed by the state department ’s official Greg Thielmann , who reported directly to John Bolton .
No evidence beyond the forged documents has been provided by either the US or the UK governments to support their allegation .
White also gives credence to Bolton ’s claims that the war in 2003 was justified by two UN resolutions – 678 and 687 – which were approved in 1990 and 1991 , and that it was permitted by article 51 of the UN charter .
The attempt to revive resolutions 678 and 687 was the last , desperate throw of the dice by the Blair government when all else had failed .
When it became clear that it could not obtain a new UN resolution authorizing force against Iraq , the government dusted down the old ones , which had been drafted in response to Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait .
This revival formed the basis of Lord Goldsmith ’s published advice on March 17 2003 .
It was described as “ risible ” and “ scrap[ing ] the bottom of the legal barrel ” by Lord Alexander , a senior law lord .
After the first Gulf war , Colin Powell , General Sir Peter de la Billiere and John Major all stated that the UN ’s resolutions permitted them only to expel the Iraqi army from Kuwait , and not to overthrow the Iraqi government .
Lord Goldsmith himself , in the summer of 2002 , advised Tony Blair that resolutions 678 and 687 could not be used to justify a new war with Iraq .
Article 51 of the UN charter is comprehensible to anyone but the lawyers employed by the Bush administration .
States have a right to self - defence “ if an armed attack occurs against ” them , and then only until the UN security council can intervene .
On what occasion did Iraq attack the United States ?
Is there any claim made by the Blair and Bush governments that Michael White is not prepared to believe ?
Conor Foley , writing on Comment is free , suggested that my action “ completely trivializes the serious case ” against the Iraq war and claimed that I was seeking to “ imprison … people because of their political opinions ” , as if Bolton were simply a commentator on the war , and not an agent .
Does he really believe that the former under - secretary did not “ participate in a common plan ” to initiate the war with Iraq ?
What other conceivable purpose might the state department ’s misleading factsheet have served ?
And what more serious action can someone who is neither a law lord nor a legislator take ?
Bolton himself maintains that my attempt to bring him to justice reflects a “ move towards lawlessness and fascism ” .
This is an interesting commentary on an attempt to uphold a law which arose from the prosecution of fascists .
But there is one charge I do accept : that my chances of success were very slight .
Apart from the 300 - pound gorillas , the main obstacle I faced was that although the crime of aggression , as defined by the Nuremberg principles , has been incorporated into the legislation of many countries , it has not been assimilated into the laws of England and Wales .
This does not lessen the crime but it means that it can not yet be tried here .
This merely highlights another injustice : while the British state is prepared to punish petty misdemeanors with vindictive ferocity , it will not legislate against the greatest crime of all , lest it expose itself to prosecution .
But demonstration has two meanings .
Non-violent direct action is both a protest and an exposition .
It seeks to demonstrate truths which have been overlooked or forgotten .
I sought to remind people that the greatest crime of the 21st century remains unprosecuted , and remains a great crime .
If you have read this far , I have succeeded .

When Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon , he uttered unforgettable words .
But the next visitor to roam the lunar landscape may send back e-mail instead .
One of the teams competing in the Google Lunar X Prize is considering this rover concept for the mission .
more photos »
Welcome to a new kind of space race , where the earthly guest will be a machine and the goal is as much exploration as seeking out new business ventures .
The quest is part of the Google Lunar X Prize , which will put $ 20 million into the hands of the first privately funded team that can land a rover on the moon ; have it travel on the surface for 500 meters or more ; send back data , photos and video ; and do it all by December 31 , 2012 .
The prize drops to $ 15 million after that date and goes away altogether after 2014 .
One of the main requirements is to have as little government involvement in the project as possible .
" We believe that space should be open to anyone and everyone , especially those people who want to go , " said Becky Ramsey , the X Prize Foundation 's director of communications for space projects .
" The government has accomplished amazing things ... but we think that we can do it less expensively . "
The idea grew out of conversations between X Prize Chairman Peter Diamandis and Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page .
" We thought it would be a good fit , " said Tiffany Montague , technical program manager at Google and the company 's main representative for the Google Lunar X Prize .
" Many of us here are interested in space as a hobby , or we came from space backgrounds . "
Google , which is paying the main prize purse -- $ 30 million total , including bonus prizes -- hopes the competition will result in education , " interesting new content " and inspiration , she added .
" What I think this prize is really about is inspiring young minds and inspiring the global population to compete for a dream , " Montague said .
' Garage bands ' of space exploration
There are 13 teams officially competing in the race , but the X Prize Foundation expects that number to grow to about 25 .
The multinational lineup includes Americans , Italians , Romanians and a " mystery team , " which can hide its identity until July 20 , 2009 , under the rules .
See photos of the teams and their rover concepts »
The competitors include university scientists , business people , engineers , robotics experts and even students .
Ramsey said all of the teams are considered serious contenders , but not all of them are expected to be able to complete the task .
" I liken our teams to the garage bands of the space exploration world , " she said .
" These are the people who have a dream , who have a passion , who have the knowledge and ability and the drive , and they think they can do this .
So we 're giving them the opportunity . "
The teams face a number of daunting tasks , including figuring out how and where to launch , designing a craft that can complete the journey and making sure it can execute a required " soft landing . "
" The craft has to alight on the moon a little like you 'd expect an insect or a bird to land here on Earth , and it means that you can't impact or crash into the surface at high speed , " said Red Whittaker , chairman and CEO of Astrobotic Technology , one of the teams competing for the prize .
Once they land , the rovers must be ready to cope with extreme conditions .
Whittaker listed a vacuum environment , radiation , temperature extremes and soft terrain as some of the special challenges of the lunar landscape .
Expensive mission
Another big obstacle is the money .
Reaching for the moon -- literally -- is an immensely pricey endeavor , and the mission is likely to cost much more than the $ 20 million first prize , a fact the sponsors freely recognize .
" I think what 's important to keep in mind is that this is an incentive prize and is not meant to cover the costs of development , " Montague said .
" Instead , it is meant to be a catalyst to shake up industry and inspire breakthrough . "
To help finance their plans , the teams are seeking out investors , partners and sponsors .
Celestis , a company that launches cremated human remains into Earth 's orbit , recently announced that it has reached an agreement with two of the teams , Astrobotic and Odyssey Moon , to carry human ashes to the moon .
NASA could also be a customer for the teams , whose craft could carry scientific payloads , Ramsey said .
The agency believes that there 's potential for collaboration , but there 's nothing formal in the works , said David Steitz , a spokesman at NASA headquarters in Washington .
He added that NASA is giving a thumbs - up to the competition .
" We 're excited about anyone who 's excited about space .
We do n't claim to have a monopoly on exploration , " Steitz said .
The business of the moon
Many of the teams regard the race as just the start of a long - term business plan .
Astrobotic envisions a dozen lunar missions , scouting sites and offering payload services to businesses and governments , Whittaker said .
Odyssey Moon CEO
Robert Richards said his team also plans to keep coming back .
" We are absolutely committed to an enduring presence on the moon , " Richards said .
Watch Richards demonstrate rover designs »
" If we do n't win the prize , we will certainly cheer those who do , and we will continue with our efforts to provide a permanent , established mechanism for humanity to reach the moon in a very frequent and cost - effective way . "
But with so much money at stake , would it be possible for anyone to fake the mission in order to win the Google Lunar X Prize ?
Both Ramsey and Montague insisted that could not happen .
" [ The teams ] have to file a mission plan with us , " Ramsey said .
" They have to send back images and video from the moon .
I do n't think in this day and age that it would be possible to fake this signal coming back . "

A few weeks ago , the Rev. Jesse Jackson made something of a fool of himself .
There he was -- a historical figure in his own right -- threatening the castration of Barack Obama .
It was sad to see .
If I have often criticized Mr. Jackson , I have also , reservedly , admired him .
He is a late 20th century outcropping of a profoundly American archetype : the self - invented man who comes from nothing and , out of sheer force of personality , imposes himself on the American consciousness .
If he never reached the greatness to which he aspired , ...
Building a better collective memory
In your High School science classes you may have learnt Hooke ’s law , the law of physics which relates a spring ’s length to how hard you pull on it .
What your High School science teacher probably did n’t tell you is that when Robert Hooke discovered his law in 1676 , he published it as an anagram , “ ceiiinossssttuv ” , which he revealed two years later as the Latin “ ut tensio , sic vis ” , meaning “ as the extension , so the force ” .
This ensured that if someone else made the same discovery , Hooke could reveal the anagram and claim priority , thus buying time in which he alone could build upon the discovery .
Hooke was not unusual .
Many great scientists of the age , including Leonardo , Galileo and Huygens , used anagrams or ciphers for similar purposes .
The Newton - Leibniz controversy over who invented calculus occurred because Newton claimed to have invented calculus in the 1660s and 1670s , but did n’t publish until 1693 .
In the meantime , Leibniz developed and published his own version of calculus .
Imagine modern biology if the human genome had been announced as an anagram , or if publication had been delayed thirty years .
Why were Hooke , Newton , and their contemporaries so secretive ?
In fact , up until this time discoveries were routinely kept secret .
Alchemists intent on converting lead into gold or finding the secret of eternal youth would often take their discoveries with them to their graves .
A secretive culture of discovery was a natural consequence of a society in which there was often little personal gain in sharing discoveries .
The great scientific advances in the time of Hooke and Newton motivated wealthy patrons such as the government to begin subsidizing science as a profession .
Much of the motivation came from the public benefit delivered by scientific discovery , and that benefit was strongest if discoveries were shared .
The result was a scientific culture which to this day rewards the sharing of discoveries with jobs and prestige for the discoverer .
This cultural transition was just beginning in the time of Hooke and Newton , but a little over a century later the great physicist Michael Faraday could advise a younger colleague to “ Work .
Finish .
Publish . ”
The culture of science had changed so that a discovery not published in a scientific journal was not truly complete .
Today , when a scientist applies for a job , the most important part of the application is their published scientific papers .
But in 1662 , when Hooke applied for the job of Curator of Experiments at the Royal Society , he certainly was not asked for such a record , because the first scientific journals were n’t created until three years later , in 1665 .
The adoption and growth of the scientific journal system has created a body of shared knowledge for our civilization , a collective long - term memory which is the basis for much of human progress .
This system has changed surprisingly little in the last 300 years .
The internet offers us the first major opportunity to improve this collective long - term memory , and to create a collective short - term working memory , a conversational commons for the rapid collaborative development of ideas .
The process of scientific discovery – how we do science – will change more over the next 20 years than in the past 300 years .
This change will not be achieved without great effort .
From the outside , scientists currently appear puzzlingly slow to adopt many online tools .
We ’ll see that this is a consequence of some major barriers deeply embedded within the culture of science .
The first part of this essay is about these barriers , and how to overcome them .
The second part of the essay illustrates these ideas , with a proposal for an online collaboration market where scientists can rapidly outsource scientific problems .
Part I : Toward a more open scientific culture
How can the internet benefit science ?
How can the internet improve the way we do science ?
There are two useful ways to answer this question .
The first is to view online tools as a way of expanding the range of scientific knowledge that can be shared with the world :
Many online tools do just this , and some have had a major impact on how scientists work .
Two successful examples are the physics preprint arXiv , which lets physicists share preprints of their papers without the months - long delay typical of a conventional journal , and GenBank , an online database where biologists can deposit and search for DNA sequences .
But most online tools of this type remain niche applications , often despite the fact that many scientists believe broad adoption would be valuable .
Two examples are the Journal of Visualized Experiments , which lets scientists upload videos which show how their experiments work , and open notebook science , as practiced by scientists like Jean - Claude Bradley and Garrett Lisi , who expose their working notes to the world .
In the coming years we ’ll see a proliferation of tools of this type , each geared to sharing different types of knowledge :
There is a second and more radical way of thinking about how the internet can change science , and that is through a change to the process and scale of creative collaboration itself , a change enabled by social software such as wikis , online forums , and their descendants .
There are already many well - known but still striking instances of this change in parts of culture outside of science [ 1 ] .
For example , in 1991 an unknown Finnish student named Linus Torvalds posted a short note in an online forum , asking for help extending a toy operating system he ’d programmed in his spare time ; a volunteer army responded by assembling Linux , one of the most complex engineering artifacts ever constructed .
In 2001 another young unknown named Larry Sanger posted a short note asking for help building an online Encyclopedia ; a volunteer army responded by assembling the world ’s most comprehensive Encyclopedia .
In 1999 , Garry Kasparov , the greatest chessplayer of all time , played and eventually won a game of chess against a “ World Team ” which decided its moves by the votes of thousands of chessplayers , many rank amateurs ; instead of the easy victory he expected , he got the most challenging game of his career , a game he called “ the greatest game in the history of chess ” .
These examples are not curiosities , or special cases ; they are just the leading edge of the greatest change in the creative process since the invention of writing .
Science is an example par excellence of creative collaboration , yet scientific collaboration still takes place mainly via face - to - face meetings .
With the exception of email , few of the new social tools have been broadly adopted by scientists , even though it is these tools which have the greatest potential to improve how science is done .
Why have scientists been so slow to adopt these remarkable tools ?
Is it simply that they are too conservative in their habits , or that the new tools are no better than what we already have ?
Both these glib answers are wrong .
We ’ll resolve this puzzle by looking in detail at two examples where excellent online tools have failed to be adopted by scientists .
What we ’ll find is that there are major cultural barriers which are preventing scientists from getting involved , and so slowing down the progress of science .
A failure of science online : online comment sites
Like many people , when I ’m considering buying a book or electronic gadget , I often first browse the reviews at amazon.com .
Inspired by the success of amazon.com and similar sites , several organizations have created comment sites where scientists can share their opinions of scientific papers .
Perhaps the best - known was Nature ’s 2006 trial of open commentary on papers undergoing peer review at Nature .
The trial was not a success .
Nature ’s final report terminating the trial explained :
There was a significant level of expressed interest in open peer review …
A small majority of those authors who did participate received comments , but typically very few , despite significant web traffic .
Most comments were not technically substantive .
Feedback suggests that there is a marked reluctance among researchers to offer open comments .
The Nature trial is just one of many attempts at comment sites for scientists .
The earliest example I ’m aware of is the Quick Reviews site , built in 1997 , and discontinued in 1998 .
Physics Comments was built a few years later , and discontinued in 2006 .
A more recent site , Science Advisor , is still active , but has more members ( 1139 ) than reviews ( 1008 ) .
It seems that people want to read reviews of scientific papers , but not write them [ 2 ] .
The problem all these sites have is that while thoughtful commentary on scientific papers is certainly useful for other scientists , there are few incentives for people to write such comments .
Why write a comment when you could be doing something more “ useful ” , like writing a paper or a grant ?
Furthermore , if you publicly criticize someone ’s paper , there ’s a chance that that person may be an anonymous referee in a position to scuttle your next paper or grant application .
To grasp the mindset here , you need to understand the monklike intensity that ambitious young scientists bring to the pursuit of scientific publications and grants .
To get a position at a major University the most important thing is an impressive record of scientific papers .
These papers will bring in the research grants and letters of recommendation necessary to be hired .
Competition for positions is so fierce that 80 hour plus work weeks are common .
The pace relaxes after tenure , but continued grant support still requires a strong work ethic .
It ’s no wonder people have little inclination to contribute to the online comment sites .
The contrast between the science comment sites and the success of the amazon.com reviews is stark .
To pick just one example , you ’ll find
approximately 1500 reviews of Pokemon products at amazon.com , more than the total number of reviews on all the scientific comment sites I described above .
The disincentives facing scientists have led to a ludicrous situation where popular culture is open enough that people feel comfortable writing Pokemon reviews , yet scientific culture is so closed that people will not publicly share their opinions of scientific papers .
Some people find this contrast curious or amusing ; I believe it signifies something seriously amiss with science , something we need to understand and change .
A failure of science online : Wikipedia
Wikipedia is a second example where scientists have missed an opportunity to innovate online .
Wikipedia has a vision statement to warm a scientist ’s heart : “ Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge .
That ’s our commitment . ”
You might guess Wikipedia was started by scientists eager to collect all of human knowledge into a single source .
In fact , Wikipedia ’s founder , Jimmy Wales , had a background in finance and as a web developer for an “ erotic search engine ” , not in science .
In the early days few established scientists were involved .
Just as for the scientific comment sites , to contribute aroused suspicion from colleagues that you were wasting time that could be spent writing papers and grants .
Some scientists will object that contributing to Wikipedia is n’t really science .
And , of course , it ’s not if you take a narrow view of what science is , if you ’ve bought into the current game , and take it for granted that science is only about publishing in specialized scientific journals .
But if you take a broader view , if you believe science is about discovering how the world works , and sharing that understanding with the rest of humanity , then the lack of early scientific support for Wikipedia looks like an opportunity lost .
Nowadays , Wikipedia ’s success has to some extent legitimized contribution within the scientific community .
But how strange that the modern day Library of Alexandria had to come from outside academia .
The challenge : achieving extreme openness in science
These failures of science online are all examples where scientists show a surprising reluctance to share knowledge that could be useful to others .
This is ironic , for the value of cultural openness was understood centuries ago by many of the founders of modern science ; indeed , the journal system is perhaps the most open system for the transmission of knowledge that could be built with 17th century media .
The adoption of the journal system was achieved by subsidizing scientists who published their discoveries in journals .
This same subsidy now inhibits the adoption of more effective technologies , because it continues to incentivize scientists to share their work in conventional journals , and not in more modern media .
The situation is analogous to the government subsidies for corn- based ethanol in the United States .
In the early days these seemed to many people to be a good idea , encouraging the use of what people hoped would be a more efficient fuel .
But now we understand that there are more energy - efficient alternatives , such as grass - based cellulose ethanol .
Unfortunately , the subsidies for corn - based ethanol are still in place , and now inhibit the adoption of the more efficient technologies .
We should aim to create an open scientific culture where as much information as possible is moved out of people ’s heads and labs , onto the network , and into tools which can help us structure and filter the information .
This means everything – data , scientific opinions , questions , ideas , folk knowledge , workflows , and everything else – the works .
Information not on the network ca n’t do any good .
Ideally , we ’ll achieve a kind of extreme openness .
This means : making many more types of content available than just scientific papers ; allowing creative reuse and modification of existing work through more open licensing and community norms ; making all information not just human readable but also machine readable ; providing open APIs to enable the building of additional services on top of the scientific literature , and possibly even multiple layers of increasingly powerful services .
Such extreme openness is the ultimate expression of the idea that others may build upon and extend the work of individual scientists in ways they themselves would never have conceived .
The challenge of achieving a more open culture is also being confronted in popular culture .
People such as Richard Stallman , Lawrence Lessig , Yochai Benkler , Cory Doctorow , and many others have described the benefits openness brings in a networked world , and developed tools such as Creative Commons licensing and free and open source software to help promote a more open culture , and fight the forces inhibiting it .
As we have seen , however , science faces a unique set of forces that inhibit open culture – the centuries - old subsidy of old ways of sharing knowledge – and this requires a new understanding of how to overcome those forces .
How can we open up scientific culture ?
To create an open scientific culture that embraces new online tools , two challenging tasks must be achieved : ( 1 ) build superb online tools ; and ( 2 ) cause the cultural changes necessary for those tools to be accepted .
The necessity of accomplishing both these tasks is obvious , yet projects in online science often focus mostly on building tools , with cultural change an afterthought .
This is a mistake , for the tools are only part of the overall picture .
It took just a few years for the first scientific journals ( a tool ) to be developed , but many decades of cultural change before journal publication was accepted as the gold standard for judging scientific contributions .
None of this is to discount the challenge of building superb online tools .
To develop such tools requires a rare combination of strong design and technical skills , and a deep understanding of how science works .
The difficulty is compounded because the people who best understand how science works are scientists themselves , yet building such tools is not something scientists are typically encouraged or well suited to do .
Scientific institutions reward scientists for making discoveries within the existing system of discovery ; there is little place for people working to change that system .
A technologically - challenged Head of Department is unlikely to look kindly on a scientist who suggests that instead of writing papers they ’d like to spend their research time developing general - purpose tools to improve how science is done .
What about the second task , achieving cultural change ?
As any revolutionary can attest , that ’s a tough order .
Let me describe two strategies that have been successful in the past , and that offer a template for future success .
The first is a top - down strategy that has been successfully used by the open access ( OA ) movement [ 3 ] .
The goal of the OA movement is to make scientific research freely available online to everyone in the world .
It ’s an inspiring goal , and the OA movement has achieved some amazing successes .
Perhaps most notably , in April 2008 the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) mandated that every paper written with the support of their grants must eventually be made open access .
The NIH is the world ’s largest grant agency ; this decision is the scientific equivalent of successfully storming the Bastille .
The second strategy is bottom - up .
It is for the people building the new online tools to also develop and boldly evangelize ways of measuring the contributions made with the tools .
To understand what this means , imagine you ’re a scientist sitting on a hiring committee that ’s deciding whether or not to hire some scientist .
Their curriculum vitae reports that they ’ve helped build an open science wiki , and also write a blog .
Unfortunately , the committee has no easy way of understanding the significance of these contributions , since as yet there are no broadly accepted metrics for assessing such contributions .
The natural consequence is that such contributions are typically undervalued .
To make the challenge concrete , ask yourself what it would take for a description of the contribution made through blogging to be reported by a scientist on their curriculum vitae .
How could you measure the different sorts of contributions a scientist can make on a blog – outreach , education , and research ?
These are not easy questions to answer .
Yet they must be answered before scientific blogging will be accepted as a valuable professional scientific contribution .
A success story : the arXiv and SPIRES
Let ’s look at an example illustrating the bottom - up strategy in action .
The example is the well - known physics preprint arXiv .
Since 1991 physicists have been uploading their papers to the arXiv , often at about the same time as they submit to a journal .
The papers are made available within hours for anyone to read .
The arXiv is not refereed , although a quick check is done by arXiv moderators to remove crank submissions .
The arXiv is an excellent and widely - used tool , with more than half of all new papers in physics appearing there first .
Many physicists start their day by seeing what ’s appeared on the arXiv overnight .
Thus , the arXiv exemplifies the first step for achieving a more open culture : it is a superb tool .
Not long after the arXiv began , a citation tracking service called SPIRES decided they would extend their service to include both arXiv papers and conventional journal articles .
SPIRES specializes in particle physics , and as a result it ’s now possible to search on a particle physicist ’s name ( example ) , and see how frequently all their papers , including arXiv preprints , have been cited by other physicists .
SPIRES has been run since 1974 by one of the most respected and highly visible institutions in particle physics , the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) .
The effort SLAC has put into developing SPIRES means that their metrics of citation impact are both credible and widely used by the particle physics community .
It ’s now possible for a particle physicist to convincingly demonstrate that their work is having a high impact , even if it has only been submitted to the arXiv , and has not been published in a conventional scientific journal .
When physics hiring committees meet to evaluate candidates in particle physics , people often have their laptops out , examining and comparing the SPIRES citation records of candidates .
The arXiv and SPIRES have not stopped particle physicists from publishing in peer - reviewed journals .
When you ’re applying for jobs , or up for tenure , every ounce of ammunition helps , especially when the evaluating committee may contain someone from another field who is reluctant to take the SPIRES citation data seriously .
Still , particle physicists have become noticeably more relaxed about publication , and it ’s not uncommon to see a CV which includes preprints that have n’t been published in conventional journals .
This is an example of the sort of cultural change that can be achieved using the bottom - up strategy .
In the next part , we ’ll see how far these ideas can be pushed in pursuit of new tools for collaboration .
Part II : Collaboration Markets : building a collective working memory for science
The problem of collaboration
Even Albert Einstein needed help occasionally .
Einstein ’s greatest contribution to science was his theory of gravity , often called the general theory of relativity .
He worked on and off on this theory between 1907 and 1915 , often running into great difficulties .
By 1912 , he had come to the astonishing conclusion that our ordinary conception of geometry , in which the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees , is only approximately correct , and a new kind of geometry is needed to correctly describe space and time .
This was a great surprise to Einstein , and also a great challenge , since such geometric ideas were outside his expertise .
Fortunately for Einstein and for posterity , he described his difficulties to a mathematician friend , Marcel Grossman .
Grossman said that many of the ideas Einstein needed had already been developed by the mathematician Bernhard Riemann .
It took Einstein three more years of work , but Grossman was right , and this was a critical point in the development of general relativity .
Einstein ’s conundrum is familiar to any scientist .
When doing research , subproblems constantly arise in unexpected areas .
No -one can be expert in all those areas .
Most of us instead stumble along , picking up the skills necessary to make progress towards our larger goals , grateful when the zeitgeist of our research occasionally throws up a subproblem in which we are already truly expert .
Like Einstein , we have a small group of trusted collaborators with whom we exchange questions and ideas when we are stuck .
Unfortunately , most of the time even our collaborators are n’t that much help .
They may point us in the right direction , but rarely do they have exactly the expertise we need .
Is it possible to scale up this conversational model , and build an online collaboration market [ 4 ] to exchange questions and ideas , a sort of collective working memory for the scientific community ?
It is natural to be skeptical of this idea , but an extremely demanding creative culture already exists which shows that such a collaboration market is feasible – the culture of free and open source software .
Scientists browsing for the first time through the development forums of open source programming projects are often shocked at the high level of the discussion .
They expect amateur hour at the local Karaoke bar ; instead , they find professional programmers routinely sharing their questions and ideas , helping solve each other ’s problems , often exerting great intellectual effort and ingenuity .
Rather than hoarding their questions and ideas , as scientists do for fear of being scooped , the programmers revel in swapping them .
Some of the world ’s best programmers hang out in these forums , swapping tips , answering questions , and participating in the conversation .
Innocentive
I ’ll now describe two embryonic examples which suggest that collaboration markets for science may be valuable .
The first is Innocentive , a service that allows companies like Eli Lilly and Proctor and Gamble to pose Challenges over the internet , scientific research problems with associated prizes for their solution , often many thousands of dollars .
For example , one of the Challenges currently on Innocentive asks participants to find a biomarker for motor neuron disease , with a one million dollar prize .
If you register for the site , it ’s possible to obtain a detailed description of the Challenge requirements , and attempt to win the prize .
More than 140,000 people from 175 countries have registered , and prizes for more than 100 Challenges have been awarded .
Innocentive is an example of how a market in scientific problems and solutions can be established .
Of course , it has shortcomings as a model for collaboration in basic research .
Only a small number of companies are able to pose Challenges , and they may do so only after a lengthy vetting process .
Innocentive ’s business model is aimed firmly at industrial rather than basic research , and so the incentives revolve around money and intellectual property , rather than reputation and citation .
It ’s certainly not a rapid - fire conversational tool like the programming forums ; one does not wake up in the morning with a problem in mind , and post it to Innocentive , hoping for help with a quick solution .
FriendFeed
FriendFeed is a much more fluid tool which is being used by scientists as a conversational medium to discuss scientific research problems .
What FriendFeed allows users to do is set up what ’s called a lifestream .
As an example , my lifestream is set up to automatically aggregate pretty much everything I put on the web , including my blog posts , del.icio.us links , YouTube videos , and several other types of content :
I also subscribe to a list of about one hundred or so “ friends ” ( a few are listed on the right in the screenshot above ) whose lifestreams I can see aggregated into one giant river of information – all their Flickr photos , blog posts , and so on .
These people are n’t necessarily real friends – I ’m not personally acquainted with my “ friend ” Barack Obama – but it ’s a fantastic way of tracking a high volume of activity from a large number of people .
As part of the lifestream , FriendFeed allows messages to be passed back and forth in a lightweight way , so communities can form around common interests and shared friendships .
In April 2008 , Cameron Neylon , a chemist from the University of Southampton , used FriendFeed messaging to post a request for assistance in building molecular models .
Pretty quickly Pawel Szczesny replied , and said he could help out .
A scientific collaboration was now underway .
The original request and discussion is shown here :
FriendFeed is a great service , but it suffers from many of the same problems that afflict the comment sites and Wikipedia .
Lacking widely accepted metrics to measure contribution , scientists are unlikely to adopt FriendFeed en masse as a medium for scientific collaboration .
And without widespread adoption , the utility of FriendFeed for scientific collaboration will remain relatively low .
The economics of collaboration
How much is lost due to inefficiencies in the current system of collaboration ?
To answer this question , imagine a scientist named Alice .
Like most scientists , many of Alice ’s research projects spontaneously give rise to problems in areas in which she is n’t expert .
She juggles hundreds or thousands of such problems , re-examining each occasionally , and looking to make progress , but knowing that only rarely is she the person best suited to solve any given problem .
Suppose that for a particular problem , Alice estimates that it would take her 4 - 5 weeks to acquire the required expertise and solve the problem .
That ’s a long time , and so the problem is on the backburner .
Unbeknownst to Alice , though , there is another scientist in another part of the world , Bob , who has just the skills to solve the problem in less than a day .
This is not at all uncommon .
Quite the contrary ; my experience is that this is the usual situation .
Consider the example of Grossmann , who saved Einstein what might otherwise have been years of extra work .
Do Alice and Bob exchange questions and ideas , and start working towards a solution to Alice ’s problem ?
Unfortunately , nine times out of ten they never even meet , or if they meet , they just exchange small talk .
It ’s an opportunity lost for a mutually beneficial trade , a loss that may cost weeks of work for Alice .
It ’s also a great loss for the society that bears the cost of doing science , a loss that must run to billions of dollars each year in total .
Expert attention , the ultimate scarce resource in science , is very inefficiently allocated under existing practices for collaboration .
An efficient collaboration market would enable Alice and Bob to find this common interest , and exchange their know - how , in much the same way eBay and craigslist enable people to exchange goods and services .
However , in order for this to be possible , a great deal of mutual trust is required .
Without such trust , there ’s no way Alice will be willing to advertise her questions to the entire community .
The danger of free riders who will take advantage for their own benefit ( and to Alice ’s detriment ) is just too high .
In science , we ’re so used to this situation that we take it for granted .
But let ’s compare to the apparently very different problem of buying shoes .
Alice walks into a shoestore , with some money .
Alice wants shoes more than she wants to keep her money , but Bob the shoestore owner wants the money more than he wants the shoes .
As a result , Bob hands over the shoes , Alice hands over the money , and everyone walks away happier after just ten minutes .
This rapid transaction takes place because there is a trust infrastructure of laws and enforcement in place that ensures that if either party cheats , they are likely to be caught and punished .
If shoestores operated like scientists trading ideas , first Alice and Bob would need to get to know one another , maybe go for a few beers in a nearby bar .
Only then would Alice finally say “ you know , I ’m looking for some shoes ” .
After a pause , and a few more beers , Bob would say “ You know what , I just happen to have some shoes I ’m looking to sell ” .
Every working scientist recognizes this dance ; I know scientists who worry less about selling their house than they do about exchanging scientific information .
In economics , it ’s been understood for hundreds of years that wealth is created when we lower barriers to trade , provided there is a trust infrastructure of laws and enforcement to prevent cheating and ensure trade is uncoerced .
The basic idea , which goes back to David Ricardo in 1817 , is to concentrate on areas where we have a comparative advantage , and to avoid areas where we have a comparative disadvantage .
Although Ricardo ’s work was in economics , his analysis works equally well for trade in ideas .
Indeed , even were Alice to be far more competent than Bob , Ricardo ’s analysis shows that both Alice and Bob benefit if Alice concentrates on areas where she has the greatest comparative advantage , and Bob on areas where he has less comparative disadvantage .
Unfortunately , science currently lacks the trust infrastructure and incentives necessary for such free , unrestricted trade of questions and ideas .
An ideal collaboration market will enable just such an exchange of questions and ideas .
It will bake in metrics of contribution so participants can demonstrate the impact their work is having .
Contributions will be archived , timestamped , and signed , so it ’s clear who said what , and when .
Combined with high quality filtering and search tools , the result will be an open culture of trust which gives scientists a real incentive to outsource problems , and contribute in areas where they have a great comparative advantage .
This will change science .

Shirley Wu and Cameron Neylon have stimulating blog posts where they propose ideas closely related to collaboration markets .
Scientists at Leeds University , England believe that they have found the answer to how a lot of our unconscious actions are generated — by simply following our herd of brethren !
A new study demonstrates that it only takes about 5 % of people to have a decisive influence on the direction that a crowd of people would take , and the rest simply follow .
Prof. Jens Krause a behavioral ecologist , with PhD student John Dyer , designed a series of experiments at Leeds where groups of people were asked to walk around randomly in a large hall .
Within the group , a selected few participants received more detailed instructions about how and where to walk .
Participants were not allowed to communicate with any another person but had to stay within an arms length of each other .
The study showed these “ snake - like patterns ” people unconsciously adopted , as they began following others without being unaware that they were doing so .
In a way , they had adopted a consensus decision , but being totally unaware of it .
The study used different crowd sizes to assess the leader - to - follower ratios at each level , and it soon emerged that the bigger the crowd size , the smaller the number of decision makers required .
In large crowds of 200 or more , 5 % of the group was enough to influence the direction in which it traveled !
“ There are many situations where this information could be used to good effect , ” Prof .
Krause of the University ’s Faculty of Biological Sciences stated in a recent interview .
“ At one extreme , it could be used to inform emergency planning strategies and at the other , it could be useful in organizing pedestrian flow in busy areas . ”
According to Prof .
Krause , the study started as part of studying animal grouping behaviour , and as it convincingly demonstrates , there are strong parallels between human crowds and animal flocks , which might be instinctual .
But on a metaphorical plane , does this study explain phenomena like fashion fads and opinion shifts too ?

This week , ISPs agreed to work with the BPI to reduce file - sharing in the UK .
When someone gets ' caught ' the ISPs will send out a warning , 100 % based on music industry provided ' evidence ' .
Not even the ISPs know if the claims of the BPI are true , so the evidence is totally unchallenged , a perfect position for the music industry .
On Thursday , every type of media outlet in the UK – newspapers , Internet , radio shows , TV and teletext all bristled with the same news .
Six major ISPs had agreed to start sending out warning letters to alleged file - sharers after the government ordered action to decrease online piracy .
Most people seem to be interested in what happens after a letter is received , but who decides who gets a letter in the first place ?
Well , that ’s the self - appointed job of the BPI ( the British Phonographic Industry ) , a completely commercial organization set up to serve the interests of the music business and they do n’t want you to know ( in any detail ) how their file - sharing tracking systems work .
The same systems would ’ve been used should they have been successful in their demands for “ 3 strikes and you ’re out ” yet there is zero transparency – everyone is supposed to blindly accept what they say as truth and that simply ca n’t be healthy .
In recent comments , a Carphone Warehouse spokesman further indicated that it is expected to take action against its customers based purely on the ‘ evidence ’ provided by the BPI .
“ What we have agreed to do is to write to our customers and advise them there ’s been an alleged infringement , ” he said .
“ We ’re very clear that we do n’t know if that ’s the case or not , we ’ve just been told there has been and we want to advise them of that . ”
So in a nutshell , the BPI provide all the ‘ evidence ’ , and the ISPs have to blindly believe it and take action against their own customers .
To think that a commercial organization like the BPI is allowed to provide its own unchallenged allegations in such a completely non-transparent manner is the real outrage in all of this .
If the BPI is to be trusted with such power , it has to be held accountable .
If it is to remain credible in its role as the “ UK MP3 Police ” its systems must be opened up to public scrutiny .
Once they are proved to be accurate by a panel of independent experts , then all well and good , but the fact remains that the BPI only give a vague indication of how they operate and have no intentions of elaborating .
Matt Philips , Director of Communications at the BPI refused to tell TorrentFreak how they gather their evidence , so any right - minded individual with an interest in this issue might find themselves asking : “ What exactly are they afraid of ? ”
Clearly , it should be possible from their detailed records for an ISP to confirm or deny the technical evidence provided by the BPI .
However , they are n’t in a position to do this since it would be a massive breach of customer privacy .
Instead , the word of the BPI is taken at face value .
In a response , some Swedish ISPs have voiced their opinions too .
“ We do n’t want to act like police and feel that a system similar to that in the UK is a deep invasion of privacy , ” said Annika Kristersson of Tele2 , adding : “ It would entail us having to spy on our customers . ”
Everyone makes mistakes and no system is flawless so it ’s essential to have a verification process before throwing accusations around .
Until then , take comfort in knowing that the file - sharing equivalent of home - made , untested , uncalibrated police speed cameras of unknown design and ability are operated by people with a vested interest and are passing judgment on you , your children and potentially ( should the BPI get its way ) your whole Internet future .
A little transparency to inspire confidence is n’t too much to ask .
Police officers have enrolled in training that would have been unlikely before Sept. 11 .
Officers attended a terrorist bombing school in New Mexico , learned how to interpret deceptive responses in interviews , studied unconventional weapons and clandestine explosives laboratories and attended classes in terrorism prevention and suicide bombings .
Today , the boat still patrols the harbor , especially when liquefied natural gas tankers arrive from overseas .
The stanchions around police headquarters are in place .
The S.U.V.’s , loaded with emergency response gear , have been distributed to field units who use them as part of regular patrols .
Most officers have learned to put on and take off their emergency gear , but none of the equipment or training has been needed to respond to a terrorist threat .
From 2002 to this year , the department went from zero to more than $ 11.6 million in total domestic security grants , according to Police Department figures , while other criminal justice grants , like those from Justice Department programs used to pay overtime and hire more officers , dwindled to less than $ 4.5 million for the same period .
One Justice Department program , the Byrne Justice Action Grant , which helps the police fight violent crime by paying for overtime and other policing costs , has suffered heavy cutbacks .
Providence ’s Byrne grant was reduced to $ 118,000 this year , from $ 388,000 in 2007 .
The Bush administration has proposed eliminating money for the program in its 2009 budget .
Larry Reall , a 21 - veteran of the Providence Police Department , is the liaison to the local Joint Terrorism Task Force .
He has top - secret security clearance and access to classified computer databases at the local F.B.I. office down the street from City Hall .
In Detective Reall ’s six years on the job , none of the hundreds of leads he has chased have turned up a terrorist .
But he keeps looking , convinced that his work has made the city safer and may have deterred a potential extremist before a threat materialized .
“ It ’s not whether we are going to be attacked ; that ’s probably not going to happen , ” Detective Reall said .
“ But I do n’t think that you can let your guard down .
Just because nothing has happened does n’t mean that something wo n’t . ”
Police experts said Providence ’s experience was similar to that of other cities around the country .
Looking back , local law enforcement agencies took on new counterterrorism responsibilities when violent crime rates had plunged to statistical lows .

The gap is partly explained by last summer 's price cut , but it's also a clear snapshot of the weakening economy .
DVD buffs may be switching over to lower - cost plans , in exchange for receiving fewer discs at any one time .
Margins also took a year - over - year dip , but that 's the result of the popularity of the company 's movie streaming service , which Netflix offers at no additional cost to existing subscribers .
That led earnings to grow by just 4 % to $ 26.6 million .
The increase looks rosier on a per-share basis , leaping 14 % to $ 0.42 thanks to the company 's ambitious share repurchase efforts .
The end result ?
While Wall Street nailed the company 's top line , Netflix clocked in just ahead of the $ 0.40 - a- share profit that analysts were expecting .
That left the market more favorably disposed toward Netflix than it had been three months ago .
Shares got slammed as the company simply met Mr. Market 's profit target , even as its stock approached fresh highs .
Sole survivor
Netflix is succeeding in an industry that has proven problematic for nearly everyone else .
Wal - Mart ( NYSE : WMT ) pulled out three years ago .
Amazon.com ( NASDAQ : AMZN ) sold its European copycat service earlier this year .
Blockbuster ( NYSE : BBI ) is still hacking away , though its Total Access growth has stagnated now that Blockbuster hiked its mail - delivery service 's prices to achieve profitability .
Meanwhile , Netflix keeps on rolling .
Even offering up its " free " movie streaming service to paying subscribers on computers -- and making the home - theater migration through deals to offer the service on Roku boxes , LG electronics , and eventually Microsoft ( NASDAQ : MSFT ) Xbox 360 consoles -- is n't getting in the way of earnings , even with the associated studio royalty and chunky bandwidth tabs .
That Watch Now service is becoming a juicy carrot for Netflix , at a time when Amazon , Blockbuster , and Apple ( NASDAQ : AAPL ) are angling to charge for their digital deliveries .
How can they compete , even if the Netflix streaming library has a smaller selection of titles ?
Set course for tomorrow
The company 's guidance for all of 2008 seems fairly consistent with its last prediction in April .
Netflix is keeping its year - end subscriber target between 9.1 million to 9.7 million members , and narrowing its revenue range to between $ 1.364 billion and $ 1.379 billion .
It 's slightly raising its profitability projection to between $ 1.19 a share and $ 1.31 a share , but that -- again -- is the handiwork of the company 's aggressive share - buyback efforts .
Netflix is keeping its net income outlook in line with the $ 75 million to $ 83 million it targeted three months ago .
There 's really no reason for Netflix to put the brakes on its share - buyback joyride .
The company 's debt - free balance sheet is padded with nearly $ 5 a share in cash .
Its ability to remain cash flow - positive while rolling out its movie - streaming service during a challenging economy is great .
Netflix seems to have more than enough confidence in its ability to continue to innovate without having to fall back on its greenbacks .
So what else can it do with that money , beyond buybacks and possibly instituting a cash dividend as it matures ?
Netflix could go the consolidation route , but who would it buy ?
It 's ripping the competition to shreds .
Gamefly may be a tempting target , but Netflix would have been renting video games already if it believed in that niche .
Its best buys would be popular entertainment content sites , but most of the good ones , like Rotten Tomatoes , IMDB , and Movies.com , are already owned by much larger companies than Netflix .
The company could always approach Hollywood Media ( NASDAQ : HOLL ) to acquire movie hub Hollywood.com , but since Netflix has been reluctant to run other sites , perhaps that money is best used to bankroll indie flicks , which it can then serve up as exclusive Netflix rentals .
Either way , Netflix is a survivor , mastering the art of profitable DVD lending as it positions itself for a post - optical - disc future .
Be kind , rewind these earlier stories :
France has reopened a labyrinth of medieval quarries under the northern town of Arras which the British army converted into an underground hideout for 24,000 soldiers during World War I .
The BBC's Emma Jane Kirby went to investigate .
Soldiers endured cold and damp before the hell of the trenches Eighteen metres ( 60 ft ) underground and immediately I 'm cold , slightly unnerved by the dimness of the light and very uncomfortable as the chalky ceilings constantly drip freezing water on my head .
Although these secret caves were a huge step up from the horror of the World War I trenches , this was no cushy billet either .
Used briefly as an air raid shelter in World War II , the caves were sealed and largely forgotten about .
But now they are a museum .
After an hour wandering around the network , my clothes are damp and my teeth are chattering .
The 24,000 soldiers who were hiding here for eight days before the Battle of Arras in 1917 must have been chilled to the bone before they surfaced into the daylight to fight for their lives .
Poignant messages
The traces of the former occupants are everywhere .
Graffiti on every wall tells the tale of the frightened soldiers , chiselling their initials into the chalk , desperate to leave some mark of their existence .
A mystery lady was carved on one of the walls I stop beside a rough love heart and can just make out the letters L and J and I imagine how , 91 years ago , J must have been nervously waiting for her sweetheart L to come home .
The Battle of Arras was so bloody that it is almost inevitable he did not .
A little further along , an artistic soldier had painted a woman 's face onto the wall .
She is ethereally beautiful and Madonna - like - a loved wife , an adored mother or perhaps just a much - needed fantasy or a lucky charm ?
The tunnels are wide and tall - 12 m high in some places - which allowed the British army to create a highly sophisticated network .
There was an operating theatre and a hospital with 700 beds , there were cook houses , post boxes for the soldiers to write their letters home and even a light railway .
Throughout the 19 km ( 12 miles ) of interconnecting tunnels , each pillar was clearly marked with a number to help the soldiers find their way around .
Familiar names
Each cave section was also given a name by the engineers who helped create them .
The southern part that makes up the museum is called Wellington , named , perhaps wistfully , by the homesick soldiers of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company .
Angela Convers , the museum tour guide , told me the Northern section ( not open to the public ) had been dug by Yorkshire miners .
" It 's funny to think that hidden 20 metres under this little French town , and completely unknown to them , you have Glasgow , Edinburgh , Crewe and London ! "
On Easter Sunday , the day before the Battle of Arras , the soldiers held a service to pray for courage .
You can still see the melted wax on the pillars they used as a makeshift altar and a painting by a soldier of his comrades at prayer .
At 0530 the next morning they were marched to Exit 10 and told to climb the stairs to the outside world .
At the last moment they were ordered to leave their great coats behind to allow them greater freedom of movement .
As the hatch lifted , the first thing the men would have seen was that it was snowing .
The briefest glimpse into Arras cemetery tells the story of what happened to most of those soldiers .
During the six weeks of battle , the British army alone recorded 4,000 casualties per day .
In the daylight , I remembered a prayer of thanksgiving carved into the chalky wall of a tunnel by a soldier grateful not to be in the mud of the trenches : " Thanks be to God for providing us with this shelter from shells and bullets . "
The tunnels gave only a temporary respite from the horrors of the Great War .
The second the trap doors opened , the protection abruptly ended .

Alaska Scandal : More to Come ?
Alaska 's only congressman is also reportedly under investigation .
July 30 , 2008  -- Sen. Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) is n't the only U.S. lawmaker whose fortunes are likely threatened by his ties to an obscure oil services company known as Veco .
Republican Don Young , Alaska 's only congressman , has reportedly been under investigation for his ties to the company , as well .
According to " The Wall Street Journal " , which broke the news of the Young investigation a year ago , prosecutors have reportedly been looking at whether Young took bribes , illegal gratuities or unreported gifts from Veco .
Young , who has met with Justice Department lawyers and has reported spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees , has declined to comment on the investigation .
Michael Anderson , a spokesman for Young 's re-election campaign , said Tuesday the congressman was not aware of any new developments in the investigations into him , " but it 's not inherent on the Department of Justice to keep us informed .
. . about [ its ] progress or the lack of progress . "
Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney declined to comment , noting that " we have not confirmed or denied any such investigation . "
On Tuesday a federal grand jury charged Stevens with failing to report gifts from Veco , including cars and free labor for a home in Girdwood , Alaska the senator called " the chalet . "
While prosecutors alleged that Stevens took actions to benefit Veco , he has not be charged with bribery .
Federal investigators already have a number of cooperators .
Among them are , Veco 's former chairman , Bill Allen , who pleaded guilty to bribing at least four Alaska legislators .
Another former company vice president , Rick Smith , who once fundraised for Young , is also cooperating with investigators , according to the Associated Press , and has reportedly allowed the FBI to tape conversations he had with Young .
Contacts with Veco , however , are not Young 's only concern .
Federal investigators are also reportedly looking into Young 's efforts to earmark $ 10 million to build an interchange on a Florida highway known as the Coconut Road , and campaign contributions from a developer who stood to benefit from the interchange .
Young 's lawyer , John Dowd , has said he has advised Young not to discuss the matter .
Dowd could not be reached for comment .
A former Young staffer , Mark Zachares , pled guilty last year in connection to his ties to now - convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
According to the terms of his plea agreement , Zachares and his wife are cooperating with investigators .

I decided a couple of months ago that my haphazard unit testing practices were not covering enough of my Rails projects ’ code .
It ’s easy , when you ’re the only developer on a project , to get pretty lazy about a lot of things , and testing is one of them .
See , I believe firmly in testing .
Untested code is unreliable code .
I wanted to be more rigorous .
So I decided to use RSpec .
I ’d been poking around it for a while , but I decided to commit and dive in .
It has been a rocky road .
Read on for my Pro-and - Con review of programming with RSpec .
Wise Investment or Rabbit Hole ?
First of all , it took a long time to get up and running .
I started out with the documentation at the RSpec site , which is decent but terse .
I got a lot more from the Peepcode screencasts , which were very fine .
But I soon realized I would have to adjust my thinking to behavior - driven development ( BDD , since everything has to have an acronym ) .
Mocks , stubs , distinct suites of tests for controllers and views ?
After working through all the examples I could find twice , I was still not quite “ getting it ” –I understood how the examples worked , but when I tried to retrofit my existing applications by writing specs , it was a miserable experience .
It got worse .
I was still using Rails 1.2.x , but the spec scaffolding was Rails 2.0 style , with RESTful concepts everywhere and quite a bit of attention to routing .
Routing ?
I was flashing back to the not so good days .
Was this really necessary ?
Did my application really need to pass tests for a non-existent XML layer ?
Was n’t this an awful lot of work ?
Fortunately , I was in the midst of reading The Rails Way , by Obie Fernandez , which has really good chapters on routing , REST , and RSpec for that matter .
So I was able to get some traction , and soon I was working on a new section of one of my applications , a dynamic table for tracking students ’ desired grades and actual scores , and I was spec’ing first .
It took a really long time .
I thought I ’d be done with the whole section in two weeks .
Six weeks later I ’m about halfway done .
I ’m going a lot faster now , and I think I ’ll get the second half finished in much less time .
I ’m lucky to have a client who ’s both busy with other matters and very patient with me .
I guess one was to look at the experience is that I ’ve been fortunate to have a chance to learn a technology on the job .
Learning RSpec puts a valuable feather in my cap .
But has it been worth it ?
Or would I be better off having delivered my project , sent the invoice , and settled down to work on something else ?
I guess that depends on how valuable I think RSpec is , specifically to me as a self - learner and one - man programming shop .
Pro and Con
So , without further ado , here are my person thoughts about RSpec after working with it this summer .
This is subjective , as I ’ll point out below .
The executive summary would be “ I ’m ambivalent . ”
The details …
Pro : Comprehensive
Using one of the dozen rake tasks available to me after I installed Rspec and Rspec for Rails , I could scaffold up comprehensive specs as well as corresponding models , controllers , and views .
These specs encompass all the concerns of Rails 2 , so working through them is a sure way to make sure you ’re on the right path .
The breadth of the specs , especially for controllers , was such that almost every time I would cheat and make a little change to a controller method , I would almost certainly get called on it , especially with autotest running in the background .
Con : Verbose
The flip side of comprehensiveness is verbosity , which feels very un-Rubylike .
The starting controller spec clocks in at 430 lines of code .
That ’s before you start adding any interesting methods .
And the view specs can get completely out of hand : it ’s very tempting to write what amounts to an element - by - element description of a page ’s HTML .
Pro : Lots of Good Tools
Most of the time , it is n’t hard to figure out how to spec something using the tools Rspec gives you .
My favorite is probably the ‘ xhr ’ method for specifying AJAX - initiated requests :
xhr :post , : create , :recordable_subject => {} , :recorder_id => ' 101 '
The rich set of selector options for identifying HTML elements is also awesome .
Con : Inarticulate Error Messages
As good as the tools are , it ’s disappointing to get error messages that do n’t make sense or do n’t tell you anything .
For instance , if you accidentally pass an object instead of an integer ID to an Active Record class ’s find method , you ’re likely to be told that the class does n’t have a find method .
And half of your view spec errors will be explained “ < false > is not < true > ” .
More helpful information would save RSpec ’s users a lot of time .
Pro : MVC Enforcement
Rspec makes it very hard to mix up your models ’ and your controllers ’ concerns .
RSpec ’s controller specs are designed not to hit the database .
You have to stub and spec objects , methods , and return values .
This drives you away from examining the internal state of objects , and that ’s exactly right .
If you feel like you need to test something about a model object ’s state , it ’s time to write a model spec .
Also , if you ’re tempted to write a bunch of state - manipulating code into your controller , you ’d almost certainly be better off putting it in your models .
Con : Feels Like Work
This is tied to my negative reaction to the verbosity of specs .
I ’m ripping off Paul Graham ’s comment , “ Object - oriented programming generates a lot of what looks like work . ”
For a while , I felt good about creating specs , because it felt like progress .
But working and tested code is progress .
And the more time you have to spend on specs , the less time you can spend on the code it tests .
I have begun to look at spec’ing as less productive and less fun .
This morning , for instance , I realized I could make a change to a creation template and change a two - step process into one step .
Then I realized how much spec’ing I would have to do — to the controller and the view — and I suddenly wished I had an offshore team to farm it all out to .
Pro : “ Should ” Vocabulary
The verbosity and work are somewhat mitigated by the ingenious BDD idiom of RSpec .
Even using Textmate shortcuts so I do n’t have to type out all those repetitive “ describe ”s and “ it should ”s , it sinks in anyway .
I ’m writing specs .
I ’m describing what the code should do .
The idiom warps your thinking in subtle , excellent ways .
For instance , I was trying to figure out how routing was working in my application , because I felt the routing specs were n’t giving me the whole picture .
I used a trick from Obie ’s book and used the Rails console to examine the routing object .
Great .
But what was I looking for exactly ?
There sure was a lot of information in there .
Then I realized I had a complete list of what the routing object should be doing : I had the specs .
And I could paste entire hashes of params and paths into the console to confirm for myself what the routing object was doing .
That was a completely unexpected payoff for the work of spec’ing the routes .
Con : Tight Coupling Too Easy
This is the big problem , I think .
It ’s really a problem with mock objects , but it comes up a lot in RSpec and there is n’t a way completely around it .
In a controller spec , you have to tell your spec how your mock objects should behave .
You have to tell the spec that in a create method the model object is going to receive a save request .
In fact , you have to spell out a lot about how the method is implemented , at the level of the controller and the objects that come into and go out of existence .
It is n’t long before you find you ’re typing everything twice , copying and pasting code between files , and al sorts of alarms start going off in your head .
Is it really necessary to be this precise ?
If a controller spec passes , and then you make a change to a method that clearly does n’t break the method — a sanity check in a web browser or mongrel ’s tailed dev log proves it — and yet your tests now fail , is n’t something wrong with this picture ?
Some Recommendations
So , as I said , I ’m not sold on RSpec yet .
I like a lot about it , but I think it exacts a price in time , complexity , verbosity , and unwanted coupling .
Here are some ways I am trying to minimize these costs .
It ’s advisable to stub , not mock , when possible
Stubs are much more forgiving because they do n’t establish expectations .
So for behavior you do n’t think is critical to the task you ’re spec’ing , stub , do n’t mock .
I point you to Martin Fowler ’s essay on mocks and stubs .
I could n’t say it better .
DRY it up a bit
Yes , RSpec favors clarity over the Don’t Repeat Yourself directive , but sometimes repetition and verbosity obscure the meaning of specs .
As an example , the default spec code for a controller ’s routing looks like this :
it " should map { : controller => ' floppy_eared_bunnies ' , :action => ' show ' , : master_id => 12 , :id => 1 } to masters/12/floppy_eared_bunnies /1 "
do
route_for ( : controller => " floppy_eared_bunnies " , :action => " show " , : id => 1 ) . should == " / masters/12/floppy_eared_bunnies/1 "
end
it " should generate params { : controller => ' floppy_eared_bunnies ' , action => ' show ' , : master_id => ' 12 ' , :id => ' 1 ' } from GET / masters/12/floppy_eared_bunnies /1 "
do
params_from(: get , " / masters/12/floppy_eared_bunnies /1 " ) .
should == {:controller => " floppy_eared_bunnies " , :action => " show " , : master_id => ' 12 ' , :id = > " 1" }
end
That ’s clear insofar as it reads like English , a natural language .
But lots of long sentences in English are unclear .
And when you ’re working with these long statements that wrap in your editor , it gets to be hard work to parse the statements and find the relevant information .
A better approach would pull what ’s relevant out to the fore and hide all the rest away .
It would also , incidentally , DRY things up :
params = {:controller => ' floppy_eared_bunnies ' , :master_id => " 12 " }
rtings = [
# SHOW
{:params => params.with( : action => ' show ' , :id = > " 1 " ) ,
: path => " / masters/12/floppy_eared_bunnies /1 " ,
: method => : get
} , ...
]
rtings.each { |r|
it " should map #{r [ : params].to_display_string} to # {r [ : path ] } " do
route_for ( r[ : params ] ) . should == r[ : path ]
end
it " should generate params #{r [ : params].to_display_string} from # {r [ : method ] } # {r [ : path ] } " do
params_from ( r [ : method ] , r[ : path ] ) . should == r[ : params ]
end
}
FYI , that to_display_string method is something I added to the Hash class to provide a nice bracketed listing of keys and values .
Find your own way
Finally , here ’s some advice you could get from Lucy Van Pelt for cheap .
It all depends on your situation .
You have to decide for yourself whether it ’s worth it .
I usually have to teach myself things .
I do n’t have a team of people here in my den with me to bounce ideas off of , and I do n’t have an employer who will send me to training .
So I have to get a lot of use out of the things I take the time to learn , and I have to get that value quickly .
So for me RSpec and BBD has been tough .
But I see the value , so I ’m sticking with it for now .
RSpec is another technology that makes me wonder whether Ruby and Rails will continue to be appropriate one - coder shop technologies , the kind of tools you can use by yourself and get things done quickly , or whether it ’s gaining weight and becoming better for teams .
I ’m going to keep a close eye on that .

BARACK OBAMA set himself a difficult task for his extraordinary appearance in Berlin on Thursday July 24th .
He said that he came not to campaign but to deliver a “ substantive address ” on the pointy - headed subject of trans -Atlantic relations .
Yet the crowd was expected to number in the tens of thousands .
The listeners were mainly European , but the real audience was in America .
He needed to tell voters what they want to hear , while rousing those who had flocked to see him .
He sought to remind people of American presidents who had become legends by winning Berliners ' hearts and minds , but could not afford to appear presumptuous .
In the end he largely pulled it off , though the speech was not quite as substantive as advertised and the mood did not quite attain euphoria .
The police estimated that over 200,000 people — perhaps the largest live audience that Mr Obama has ever addressed — thronged the boulevard that stretches between the Prussian Victory Column and the Brandenburg Gate .
Despite jams at the entrances and poor reception at the back of the crowd , most did not appear to be disappointed .
He was “ cosmopolitan , not only American , ” said Garunya Karunahramoorthy , a student of international relations from Berlin .
In bowing to a foreign audience , Mr Obama seemed to give new life to the idea of the American century .
Mr Obama achieved that by fusing an older tradition of American beneficence with a contemporary emphasis on multilateralism , which he was careful to call “ partnership ” .
The Berlin setting gave him a chance to make partnership seem the most patriotic thing in the world , and he exploited it to the full .
He began by reminding Berliners that America had helped them to break the Soviet - imposed blockade of 1948 - 49 and to knock down the Berlin wall four decades later .
But he acknowledged that the relationship had lately become troubled .
“ On both sides of the Atlantic , we have drifted apart ” , he admitted .
Europe began to see America “ as part of what has gone wrong ” , overlooking its sacrifices for “ freedom around the globe ” .
And America , he confessed , had “ made our share of mistakes ” .
The bits of Mr Obama 's rhetoric that were most popular with the locals were aimed at convincing them that America would make fewer mistakes in an Obama presidency .
It would “ reject torture and stand for the rule of law ” , strive for “ a world without nuclear weapons ” and follow the Germans ' example in setting ambitious targets for reducing carbon emissions that cause global warming .
The American Mars would no longer trample the sensitivities of the European Venus .
“ America has no better partner than Europe ” , he declared .
If Mr Obama had left it at that , his Republican rivals might have put together a case that he was keener to defend European values than American ones .
But he was staunch in defence of American interests , and made it plain that partnership would come with a price .
“ We must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it ” , he declared .
“ Iran …must abandon its nuclear ambitions . ”
But the United States cannot accomplish such tasks on its own .
And that means that reluctant Europeans — Germans in particular — will have to contribute more than they have done to such ventures as the war in Afghanistan .
“ My country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO 's first mission beyond Europe 's borders is a success . ”
Participants in Mr Obama 's meetings with German chancellor Angela Merkel and foreign minister Frank - Walter Steinmeier report that he charmed and impressed them .
The throng was also content , although one man rightly wondered “ how he could deliver ” on everything he promised .
Mr Obama 's view of the world is no sunnier than George Bush 's : it is equally menaced by terrorists and weapons of mass destruction and genocide and more so by global warming .
But Mr Obama promises — in fact demands — a more co-operative approach to solving such problems .
New walls threaten to divide religions , tribes and classes .
The answer , he said , attempting to sound like Kennedy and Reagan rolled into one , is to tear them down .

Given a recent misunderstanding of the phrase " useful resources , " aI do not limit my reading to resources which support my views , or even to those which appear to be accurate .
Reading opinions contrary to what I believed has been very useful at times : sometimes verifying my previous assumptions , sometimes encouraging me to change them .
Even resources which , in my opinion , are simply inaccurate are sometimes useful : these can give valuable insights intosome people or groups believe what they do .
It is my opinion that some of the resources in this blogroll are neither accurate , nor unbiased .
I do , however , believe that they are useful in understanding the War on Terror , the many versions of Islam , terrorism , and related topics .
Last month , the New York state Attorney General , Andrew Cuomo , announced that a sting operation had uncovered an indifference on the part of Internet service providers regarding complaints about child porn accessible through their networks .
Using a combination of legal threats and public shaming , Cuomo was able to get three ISPs to drop access to the entire alt . * hierarchy of Usenet , a move that encouraged California to request similar measures .
Now , in a sign that these efforts against child porn were becoming a movement , Cuomo has announced the launch of a web site , nystopchildporn and agreements with two more ISPs .
AOL is the subject of one of the new agreements , which is n't much of a surprise , given that its corporate sibling , Time Warner Cable , had already signed on with Cuomo .
It will apparently require no changes on its part , as CNET reports that the company had already implemented a policy of blocking child porn access .
AT&T is the other , and , given that it 's apparently the US ' largest service provider , it represents a significant accomplishment for the AG .
Apparently , AT&T 's efforts will be as indiscriminate as those pursued by Verizon , in that they plan on blocking access to the entire alt .
binaries .* hierarchy .
Cuomo's new web site signifies that he 's clearly not done yet .
It includes contact information for 20 ISPs that presumably operate in New York , and text of a letter to send to them to urge that they sign on to the campaign .
Its promised link to a printable PDF of the letter , however , is nonfunctional .
Andrew Cuomo
Regardless of how you feel about Cuomo's efforts or the implementation of his agreements by the ISPs , it 's difficult to interpret the new site as anything more than an effort in self promotion .
Its intent is signaled by the entry page , which is entitled " Press Releases " and contains an animation that rotates through four photos of Cuomo announcing the site 's launch .
Three of the four sentences in the draft letter to ISPs include Cuomo 's name , and the fourth refers to him by his title .
The letter is also notable for the fact that it no longer focuses on the actual accessibility of child porn via the ISP , and instead simply requests they join in Cuomo 's campaign .
The rapid shift of focus from an identifiable problem to a high - publicity campaign seems as likely to produce cynicism as it is to lead to progress on the underlying issue .
Researchers have taken a first snapshot of how a class of highly reactive molecules inflicts cellular damage as part of aging , heart disease , stroke , cancer , diabetes , kidney disease and Alzheimer 's disease to name a few .
According to a study published today in the journal Cell , researchers have discovered a tool that can monitor related damage and determine the degree to which antioxidant drugs effectively combat disease .
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which include free radicals , are highly reactive molecules that force change upon many molecules they encounter .
The body uses ROS to signal for wound healing and to destroy invaders .
Excess amounts , however , damage sensitive cell components , including proteins and DNA , in a process called oxidative stress .
ROS are kept in check by the body 's natural antioxidants , but when uncontrolled can lead to disease .
These highly reactive molecules are created as a side effect when structures within all human cells , the mitochondria , use oxygen to convert food into energy for life .
Researchers once thought that altered mitochondrial function was important only in rare genetic diseases , but recent studies have revealed that oxidative stress plays a role in conditions that afflict many millions of patients .
As a result , mitochondrial medicine is gaining momentum as groups like the Mitochondria Interest Group at the National Institutes of Health , professional societies and drug companies push basic science toward drug discovery .
" Our study provides a better glimpse of why a cell under assault by disease makes 10 times as many reactive oxygen species as the same cell when healthy , " said Shey - Shing Sheu , Ph.D. , professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester Medical Center , and a study author .
" We have discovered a chemical tool for investigating how diseases cause damage , mitochondrion by mitochondrion , which should represent a tremendous advance as both a disease biomarker and for drug discovery . "
Meltdown at the Powerhouse
The primary role of mitochondria is to convert food into chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the molecule used by all human cells to store energy .
To drive ATP production , electrons are passed along a series of enzymes , but a few " leak " during the process .
Leaked electrons react with available oxygen to form the reactive oxygen species , termed superoxide .
The emerging theory is that excess superoxide production causes the mitochondria to swell and rupture , resulting in a " cellular energy crisis " that ultimately leads to cell death in the many diseases of oxidative injury .
In the Cell study , researchers used a newly patented , protein - based probe to discover , and make visible , for the first time , fleeting bursts of superoxide production in mitochondria termed " superoxide flashes . "
The superoxide bursts oxidize cysteine residues in the probe , causing it to emit fluorescent light , which can then be detected and analyzed for patterns .
Experiments not only identified superoxide flashes for the first time , but also confirmed that they exhibit a similar size and duration , regardless of the cell type they occur in .
This uniform pattern of low - level superoxide production in the mitochondria of healthy cells is normal , perhaps keeping the ROS signaling system ready to fire , researchers said .
The one quality of superoxide flashes found to vary was frequency , which dramatically increased during disease .
The research team looked at one kind of oxidative stress in particular : that caused when the oxygen supply to the heart is initially cut off ( e.g. during a heart attack or stroke ) and then re-established .
When heart muscle cells were exposed to a non -oxygen solution for six hours , superoxide flash frequency decreased four - fold , to one event per 100 seconds .
Upon re-introduction of oxygen , superoxide production increased eight - fold , confirming past work that re-oxygenation after a heart attack comes with a burst of destructive and uncontrolled superoxide production and oxidative stress .
Existing methods for measuring superoxide production involve chemical indicators or older protein probes , but these previous methods are not specific for superoxide , are damaged by light and provide a limited signal above background noise .
The new probe is more sensitive , specific to superoxide , provides a stronger signal than other probes , and is the first to permit reversible measurements of superoxide levels on a millisecond timescale .
The research team also created a genetically engineered mouse that expresses the probe within the mitochondria of all of its cells .
These " superoxide mice " will enable researchers in the future to quantify the impact of uncontrolled mitochondrial superoxide production across many diseases .
Efforts to develop antioxidant drugs ( e.g. vitamin E ) to treat diseases of increased oxidative stress have met with limited success to date because they tried to eliminate ROS , rather than maintain the right amount , Sheu said .
He established the Mitochondrial Research & Innovation Group ( MRIG ) at the Medical Center in 2002 with the goal of designing therapies to deliver precise amounts of antioxidants to the mitochondria of diseased cells only .
MRIG teams are , for example , screening through compounds to confirm that oxidative stress can be reversed by mitochondria - specific drugs .
The new superoxide flash probe will provide a powerful tool for determining the effectiveness of new classes of antioxidant drugs in reducing superoxide production at the right place and time .
The " birthday " for superoxide flashes came in June of 2003 in the lab of Robert Dirksen , Ph.D. , associate professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the Medical Center , when Linda Groom observed spontaneous bursts of fluorescent light using the newly developed protein - based superoxide indicator .
The current paper 's lead author was Wang Wang , Ph.D. formerly a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging at the National Institutes of Health .
Aiwu Cheng , Jinhu Yin , Weidong Wang , Edward Lakatta and Mark Mattson also contributed from the NIH , as did Joseph Kao from the University of Maryland .
Also contributing from Peking University in Beijing were Huaqiang Fang , Wanrui Zhang , Jie Liu , Xianhua Wang , Kaitao Li , Peidong Han , Ming Zheng , and Heping Cheng , the corresponding author .
" One co-author on the current paper , Dr. Cheng of Peking University , 15 years ago published a seminal study regarding local calcium release events , or calcium sparks , " Dirksen said .
" This study has been cited more than 900 times and has provided a major contribution to our understanding how the heart beats and why it fails .
We believe that our serendipitous discovery of local mitochondrial superoxide flash events could be even more important because superoxide flash frequency may provide an accurate , real - time picture of how uncontrolled oxidative stress contributes to the progression of several , debilitating cardiovascular and neurological diseases .

CNN reported the p
Mergesort and Quicksort are two well - known sorting algorithms , familiar to both researchers and practitioners .
Both are typically presented as examples of divide and conquer .
Other than this fact , they are usually not seen to be very closely related .
Let ’s look at Mergesort and Quicksort in a somewhat unusual way that will make them appear as two sides of the same coin .
Suppose we want to sort a list of items \ ( a_1 , a_2 , \dots , a_n\ ) .
In Mergesort , we split the list into two parts : \( L = a_1 , \dots , a_{n / 2}\ ) , and \( R = a_{n / 2+1} , \dots , a_n\ ) .
We recursively sort \ ( L\ ) and \ ( R\ ) , then merge the two sorted lists to obtain the final , sorted output .
How do we sort \ ( L\ ) and \ ( R\ ) recursively ?
We split them further into equal parts ( let ’s assume for simplicity that \ ( n\ ) is a power of two , so this always works ) , until parts consist of single elements , which are already trivially sorted .
So , at the bottom of the recursion tree , we have \( n\ ) singleton - lists , consisting of \ ( a_1 , a_2 , \dots , a_n\ ) .
Assuming that the splitting has happened “ in place ” , these items are still stored in their original order , “ sorted by their index ” \ ( 1,2 , \dots , n\ ) .
See the following illustration .
The bottom - most line contains the elements in their original order , one in each “ box ” .
As we come out of the recursion , we merge neighboring “ boxes ” in pairs , putting their elements in the correct order .
So within each box , elements are sorted “ by value “ .
Observe that neighboring boxes in the same line are sorted “ by index “ , in the sense that their ordering preserves the original order : indices in any box are smaller than indices in the next box to the right .
For example in the second line from the bottom , the first box will contain \ ( ( a_1 , a_2 ) \ ) or \ ( ( a_2 , a_1 ) \ ) , the next box will contain \( ( a_3 , a_4 ) \ ) or \ ( ( a_4 , a_3 ) \ ) , etc. the point being that 1 and 2 are both smaller than 3 and 4 .
This is Mergesort .
Can we reverse the arrow of time and go from the top towards the bottom ?
Well , that would be strange , because at the top we have a single box , so this would mean that we start with a single list that is already sorted , which would n’t make sense .
But what if by “ sorted ” we meant “ sorted by index “ , meaning that the entries are stored as \(( a_1 , a_2 , \dots , a_n ) \ ) .
There is of course no harm in assuming this , as this is indeed how the input is presented .
So let ’s update the figure .
Instead of bottom - to - top , let ’s go top - to - bottom .
Let ’s also swap “ by value ” and “ by index ” throughout .
So now we go from a single box , sorted by index ( meaning an unsorted input list ) to a list of boxes sorted among them by value ( meaning a sorted output list in the bottom ) .
So conceptually , this looks very much like a valid sorting algorithm .
What is it ?
Does it have a name ?
Yes , it is Quicksort .
Let ’s think it through again : we start with a list ( sorted “ by index ” ) , and we produce from it two lists , sorted between them “ by value ” .
This means that all entries in one are smaller than all entries in the other ( this is essentially the partitioning step of Quicksort : we split the elements into those smaller , and those greater or equal than a pivot ) .
What does it mean that “ within a box ” the entries are now sorted “ by index ” ?
This just means that on both sides of the partitioning we preserve the original ordering of entries .
This is not true in every implementation of Quicksort , but it is a technicality we can certainly enforce if we want to .
Observe that we assumed that Quicksort splits the list in two equal parts , something we can achieve if we use the median as pivot ( in practice of course a random pivot works just fine and is usually faster ) .
So there you have it .
Quicksort and Mergesort are “ duals ” : you get one from the other by running time backwards , and swapping “ by value ” and “ by index ” in the invariants they maintain ( or alternatively , swapping “ between ” and “ within ” ) .
Surprising ?
Obvious ?
Is this view of practical use ?
What about other sorting algorithms ?
For the latter question , observe that we can extend this view to accommodate unequal splits , or in an extreme case , just splitting off ( or merging ) one element from / to a longer list .
In this view , we obtain ( essentially ) InsertionSort , respectively SelectionSort , which also appear as duals of each other .
This latter duality extends further , and holds even if we do insertion , resp .
selection by fancy data structures , such as self - adjusting binary search trees and adaptive tournaments as heaps .
These ideas are explored in a different direction in an article here .
There are also other dualities on ordered sets and data structures ( the word itself is quite overloaded ) .
Exploring dualities often suggests new concepts by symmetry or analogy .
As for the discussion of this post , here is an illustration of both sides .
Illustration of the sorting duality .
Consider the following sequence .
Let the first element be \ ( a_0 = 0 \ ) .
Then , for \( a_i\ ) , when \ ( i>0\ ) , let ’s do the following .
Consider the last element \ ( a_{i - 1}\ ) .
Did this element appear previously in the sequence ?
If not ( meaning that \( a_{i - 1}\ ) is its first occurrence ) , set \( a_i\ ) to \ ( 0 \ ) .
If \( a_{i - 1}\ ) did appear before , then let \( a_k\ ) be its previous occurrence .
Set \( a_i\ ) to the value \ ( i - 1 - k\ ) ( meaning , “ how far back did we see this value ? ” ) .
So , we have 0,0 , 1,0,2,0,2,2,1,6 , …
For example , the last 6 is there because the previous element 1 has appeared 6 positions earlier .
This is known as Van Eck ’s sequence and appears as A181391 in the wonderful On - line encyclopedia of integer seqences .
It has been added to OEIS by Jan Ritsema van Eck in 2010 .
There are many interesting properties of this sequence ( for instance , it was shown that it contains infinitely many zeros ) , and even more intriguing open questions .
For more details see the OEIS entry , or these slides by OEIS founder N.J.A. Sloane .
Here is a variation on the above sequence :
Instead of counting the “ number of elements ” , let ’s count only the “ number of distinct elements ” .
That is , again we start with 0 , and then if the last element was new , we write 0 , otherwise we write “ how many distinct elements ” have we seen since its previous appearance .
So the sequence goes : 0,0, 1,0,2,0,2,2,1,3 , …
For example , the last 3 is there because between the previous element 1 and its last appearance there are 3 distinct elements : 0,1,2 .
I thought of this sequence independently , but searching for it on OEIS I found that it has been considered before by Nathaniel Shar , who added it to the OEIS as A268755 .
See here for a plot .
The rule for defining the sequence is similar to the concept of “ working set ” in the theory of data structures , which refers exactly to the number of distinct queries seen since the previous occurrence of the last query .
Therefore , I think a fitting name for the sequence would be “ working set sequence ” .
So what can we say about the working set sequence ( a.k.a .
Shar ’s sequence ) ?
Does it also contain an infinite number of zeros , similarly to the Van Eck ’s sequence ?
I generated about half a million elements by computer , and the answer seems yes .
It could happen , of course , that at some point the sequence reaches a cycle that it can never escape , such as 1,1,1,1,1 , … or the less trivial … , 1,2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2,3,2,2,1,3,3 , … ( exercise : check that this is really a cycle ! )
However , the computer experiment suggests that this does not happen , and eventually every positive integer appears in the sequence .
Can this be proven formally ?
Yes !
Let ’s leave this as an exercise ( I added a proof sketch to the OEIS entry ) .
As a hint , an easier property to observe is that \ ( k\ ) can appear only after \ ( 0 , … , k - 1\ ) have already appeared .
Theorem .
The working set sequence contains infinitely many zeros .
Zeros seem to appear much less frequently in the working set sequence than in Van Eck ’s sequence .
But how frequent are they ?
Empirically it seems that there is a gap of roughly a constant times \ ( k\ ) between the \ ( k\ )th and \ ( k+1 \ ) th zeros , although nothing like this has been proven .
Also , the zeros often come in pairs : if , for a long time there have been no new elements , eventually the new element \ ( k\ ) comes , followed by \ ( 0\ ) , and then , since \ ( 0\ ) has also not appeared for a very long time , there is high chance that \ ( k+1,0\ ) follow right away .
This seems to be the case quite frequently .
Overall , however , nothing seems to be known about the statistics of this sequence , e.g. the asymptotic growth rate of \( a_n\ ) .
The indices of new elements in the working set sequence ( or alternatively , the indices of zeros minus one ) have been added to OEIS as A275668 .
I mentioned above two possible cycles in the sequence ( although they do n’t actually appear if we start from 0 ) .
What is the set of all possible cycles , does it have a nice characterization ?
How many different cycles are there with \ ( k\ ) distinct elements ?
These questions are open .
Finally , another open question about the working set sequence ( as far as I know , the same question is open for the Van Eck ’s sequence as well ) : Problem .
Does every pair of nonnegative integers ( a , b ) eventually appear in the working set sequence as a pair of consecutive elements ?
( except for ( 1,1 ) of course , which cannot appear ) .
[ NOTE added August 2017 ]
As pointed out by Jan Ritsema van Eck in a comment ( see below ) , the Van Eck sequence also excludes pairs of the type ( p, p+1 ) .
Prove it as a fun exercise , it is not difficult !
So let ’s modify the conjecture to also exclude ( p, p+1 ) pairs besides ( 1,1 ) .
The conjecture does n’t seem extremely plausible to be honest ( as Jan points out , there are weaker statements one should prove first ) , so let ’s formulate it as a challenge , to move things forward .
Can you find an ( a , b ) pair not of the form ( p, p+1 ) and not ( 1,1 ) that does not appear in the van Eck sequence A181391 ?
This observation does not apply to the working set sequence .
For example , ( 4,5 ) appears at positions ( 21,22 ) .
So the similar challenge is : Can you find an ( a , b ) pair other than ( 1,1 ) that does not appear in the working set sequence A268755 ?
Some of the books I read ( and liked ) in 2015 , and my impressions of them .
Previously : 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 .
John Maynard Smith , Eörs Szathmáry :
The Origins of Life : From the Birth of Life to the Origin of Language
A very clear explanation of evolution from the chemical basis up to “ cultural evolution ” .
Updated version of older book “ Major transitions … ” of same authors .
Describes evolution at the level of genes , individuals and groups .
Often takes an “ information - theoretic ” view .
Does n’t give the “ full picture ” of life and evolution but gives a flavour of the forces at work , and the messiness , in some cases arbitrariness of local details , of conflicts and co-operations , etc .
Together with work of Dawkins , some of the clearest explanations of evolution .
While at it , I opened Darwin ’s original and skimmed about a third of it .
The first impression of “ The Origin of the Species ” is how readable and accessible it still is almost 160 years after its writing .
It is organized in a logical way , starting with a wealth of examples , building up evidence until the inevitable conclusion almost presents itself .
Especially interesting is the frankness with which Darwin discusses possible objections to his theory .
One must agree with the reviewer who writes about the Origin of Species that it “ makes me proud to be a human being ” .
Ha -Joon Chang : Bad Samaritans : The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism Funny and accessible book with critique of globalization and mainstream economic theories .
Main thesis could be summed up as : countries that are rich today became rich through policies and strategies that are in many ways the opposite of what they propose as development strategies for poor countries .
Many contrarian ideas ( e.g. corruption not automatically bad , etc. ) , most of them well argued .
Enjoyed chapter that ridicules “ culturalist ” views in economics .
Douglas R. Hofstadter , Daniel C. Dennett :
The Mind ’s I : Fantasies And Reflections
On Self & Soul Charming collection of essays and short literary works loosely around the topics of the mind , consciousness , identity , etc .
The essays are from various sources , including fiction authors like Stanislaw Lem or Jorge Borges , or the authors themselves , who also comment on the essays of others .
Favourites : Hofstadter ’s tortoise and achilles dialogues , “ A Conversation With Einstein ’s Brain ” , Smullyan ’s “ Is God a Taoist ? ” , etc. Bertrand Russell : The Conquest of Happiness Lighthearted essays — sometimes surprising opinions ( e.g. praise of boredom , etc. ) , tries to understand the sources of happiness and unhappiness .
Reaches a similar conclusion as Csikszentmihalyi’s “ flow ” - theory , his “ recipe ” summed up as : skillful preoccupation – such as the exercise of a craft + a friendly interest and curiosity towards people and phenomena .
Written almost 100 years ago , still timely , notices some changes in society that are even more profound today .
Randall Munroe : What If ? Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions Bought as gift , but ended up reading it myself .
Predictably funny and interesting .
Robert Musil : The Man Without Qualities Masterful , gigantic , complex , fragmentary , sometimes with quirky humor , etc .
Have been reading it on and off for the whole year , and will be continuing it in 2016 as well :)

Elemér Kiss : Mathematical Gems from the Bolyai Chests
This book is the result of the in - depth study of the unpublished manuscripts of the mathematician János Bolyai , and his correspondence with his father , Farkas Bolyai .
The book convincingly argues that contrary to popular opinion , Bolyai continued productive mathematical work throughout his life ( after his early work on non-euclidean geometry ) , and working in isolation , he made independent observations esp. on number theory and the theory of complex numbers , some of which were only discovered later by others .

Read in 2015 :
hardy ( adjective ) : : able to live through difficult conditions ( such as a cold winter or a drought ) : strong and able to accept difficult or unpleasant conditions ( Merriam - Webster ) G.H. Hardy was an eminent English mathematician , also known for his popular and influential book “ A Mathematician ’s Apology “ .
In this extended essay he argues among other points that mathematics has a deep intrinsic beauty , and it is worthy to be pursued for its own sake .
I tried very hard to like this essay , but failed miserably on every occasion .
It would be too easy to mock from our 21st century perspective Hardy ’s mistake when he uses number theory as an example branch of mathematics with absolutely no practical applications ( which by the way Hardy views as a huge positive ) .
However , I also find the main point about mathematical beauty I mentioned before not very convincingly presented , even if you already agree with him ( like I do ) before opening the book .
But what I disliked most were Hardy ’s strong opinions such as “ there is no scorn more profound , or on the whole more justifiable , than that of the men who make for the men who explain .
Exposition , criticism , appreciation , is work for second - rate minds ” , and in another paragraph “ it is a tiny minority who can do something really well , and the number of men who can do two things well is negligible ” and finally the notorious “ mathematics is a young man ’s game ” .
To express my dislike of this essay , I am making the modest proposal of a Hardy prize in mathematics , to be awarded to people who achieve significant mathematical results in ways contrary to the letter and the spirit of Hardy ’s book ( we can never know of course , whether Hardy himself would consider the results of any significance , although we can guess with good confidence . )
More positively , the fictional Hardy prize recognizes : pure mathematical work deeply influenced by practice and applications or by teaching and other expository work
mathematicians ( men or women ) who started their mathematical career or achieved their most significant result at a relatively late age
mathematicians who went about their mathematical career in a less than straightforward way , possibly having strong interests or accomplishments outside mathematics , possibly doing mathematics as a hobby Ignoring historical examples ( some of which Hardy must have known ) , as a small ( and quite random ) initial sample from our times I would suggest as first recipients : Persi Diaconis , Marjorie Rice , Preda Mihăilescu , Yitang Zhang , Raymond Smullyan .
This post is of course only half - serious ( unless someone takes the initiative in such a direction ) .
Would such a prize make sense ?
This post benefited from discussions with colleagues , who would probably prefer to stay unnamed .
I was also informed by this post .
Recently , together with my colleagues Parinya Chalermsook , Mayank Goswami , Kurt Mehlhorn , and Thatchaphol Saranurak , we published three papers about binary search trees .
All three are available on ArXiv as preprints .
In this post I briefly and informally describe some results and ideas from these papers .
Binary search trees ( BST ) are perhaps the simplest data structures that are not entirely trivial , and they form the basis of several more advanced data structures and algorithms .
BSTs are part of every computer science curriculum , and there is a rich theory describing their properties .
Surprisingly , many aspects of BSTs are still not understood , so they are an active field of research .
Searching a single element in a BST is straightforward , and the cost of the search depends on how far the searched element is from the root of the tree .
If we search more than one element , we might want to change the tree after each search , to make future searches more efficient .
What is the best way to transform the tree after each search ?
The splay tree of Sleator and Tarjan from 1983 gives one possible such strategy .
Splay trees have many nice properties , for example , they are as good as the best static tree for a given sequence ( “ static ” here means not changed between accesses , and I am sweeping some details under the rug here ) .
Sleator and Tarjan conjectured that even more strongly , splay trees are as good as any “ dynamic ” tree , i.e. any sequence of changes in the tree between accesses .
This last statement is the famous dynamic optimality conjecture .
If true , this would be quite surprising : splay trees just “ react ” to each access , without knowing what accesses will come next .
The conjecture says that knowing the future does n’t help much .
Even the best strategy for changing the tree ( tailored to a given sequence ) cannot beat splay trees ( again , some details omitted here ) .
The conjecture is wide open .
For more information about such questions I recommend the survey of Iacono .
Now our recent results .
1 . Self - adjusting binary search trees : what makes them tick ?
Splay trees are considered quite mysterious : they execute some local transformations that just “ happen to work ” .
We know that splay trees have many nice properties ( including the static optimality mentioned before ) , but the proofs are a bit unintuitive .
What is special about splay trees that gives them these properties ?
Are there other algorithms that have similar properties ?
So we look at a general class of algorithms that preserve some properties of splay trees and relax others .
Such an algorithm accesses an element in a BST , then transforms the search path into some tree , such that the accessed element becomes the root .
We identify some simple conditions of this transformation that are sufficient to guarantee that the algorithm shares some of the nice properties of splay trees .
We look at splay trees in a different way , that makes it obvious that they fulfill these conditions .
We also show that some other known algorithms and heuristics fulfill these conditions , which explains why they are efficient .
We also identify some new heuristics that fulfill the conditions but have not been studied before .
Finally we ask , are our conditions necessary for a BST algorithm to be efficient ?
In a limited sense , we show that they are , but the results in this direction are not conclusive .
See the paper for details .
2 . Pattern - avoiding access in binary search trees I mentioned that splay tree is conjectured to be as good as any other BST algorithm , even those that can see into the future , for any possible sequence .
However , for most “ random ” sequences , even the theoretically best BST algorithms are quite inefficient , making the question vacuous in that case .
The interesting cases are those sequences that have “ some useful structure ” that BST algorithms can exploit .
So , if we want to show that splay trees ( or some other algorithm ) are efficient , we need to show that they do well on such “ structured ” input .
The literature on dynamic optimality describes a number of such “ useful structures ” .
One example is “ dynamic finger ” : loosely speaking , if successive searches are for values that are close to each other , then search should be efficient .
A special case of this is “ sequential access ” : if we just search the values in increasing order from 1 to n , then search should be really efficient .
In this paper we describe a new kind of structure , that has been studied in depth in mathematics , but not in the context of BSTs .
We show that search sequences should be executable efficiently by a BST algorithm if they are free of some fixed pattern .
See this page for a description of patterns .
This generalizes the “ sequential access ” mentioned before in a different direction , and it also includes other known structures as special case .
We explore this topic in detail in the paper , giving some general results , and some stronger results for special cases .
3 . Greedy is an almost optimal deque Again , studying input with some structure , we look here at a sequence of insert and delete operations into a BST , with the restriction that we can only delete or insert “ at the two ends ” , that is at values that are the current maximum or minimum of the values in the tree .
Such sequences are called deque sequences .
It was conjectured a long time ago by Tarjan , that splay trees can execute deque sequences very efficiently ( in linear time overall ) .
This is not yet known , but the known results are so close to this , that the difference is only theoretically interesting ( which makes it even more interesting :) .
In this paper ( and the previous one ) we look at a different algorithm , introduced independently by Lucas and Munro a few years after splay trees , and later extended by Demaine , Harmon , Iacono , Kane , and Pătraşcu .
We show that this algorithm ( called Greedy BST ) is almost linear on deque sequences .
This “ almost ” again hides a small factor that is only of theoretical interest , although a little bit larger than the corresponding factor known for splay trees .
The details are in the paper .

Part I .
Ha-Joon Chang : 23 Things They Do n’t Tell You About Capitalism .
A series of observations about the world economy , capitalism , free trade , planning , development , inequality in society , etc. – the chapter titles sound contrarian and provocative , but the opinions are mostly common sense and argued with clarity although not equally convincingly – many of the statements are challenging mainstream economics dogma , but the author does construct a few strawmen too .
One of the recurring themes is that economic systems are never of a “ pure ” kind as described in textbooks , instead , they are both messier and more interesting .
Readable , pragmatic , non-ideological .
Some of the ideas reminded of NN Taleb ’s work .
Michael Nielsen : Reinventing Discovery : The New Era of Networked Science .
The book describes several recent ( and some less recent ) developments and projects that have changed how scientific research is done and to some extent make us think about what scientific research even means .
It presents a compelling vision of the future of science and it is a “ calls to arms ” to embrace and popularize these new ideas and techniques , and to invent new tools .
More concretely , the book talks about open access publishing ( e.g. arXiv ) , open source software ( e.g. Linux ) , online collaboration ( e- mail , wikis , forums , but more specifically the recent Polymath project ) , “ data - driven intelligence ” ( predicting influenza , automated translation , Sloan Digital Sky Survey ) , citizen science ( protein folding , amateur astronomy ) , etc. etc .
The book also discusses limitations and obstacles , often due to misaligned incentives in the academic world .
The book is excellent , it inspires and motivates — two minor criticisms : selection is somewhat arbitrary – could have included other projects too , and the overall narrative that all these fit into a common thread is slightly forced .
David Gale : Tracking The Automatic Ant : And Other Mathematical Explorations .
A book that contains puzzles , interesting mathematical ideas and results , short opinions on various aspects of mathematics .
The topics are loosely connected , the format is similar to that of Martin Gardner ’s or Douglas Hofstadter ’s collections .
A common theme throughout the book is the exploration ( often computer - assisted ) of large mathematical structures , such as the solution space of a puzzle , particularly when classical approaches fail .
It is one of the best recreational mathematical books I ’ve ever read , covering a rich variety of topics , difficult to summarize in a review .
Donald E. Knuth : Digital Typography .
A collection of Donald Knuth ’s articles and essays on the topic of digital typography , mostly related to the creation of the TeX and Metafont systems , and the transformation of digital typesetting ( esp. of math -y text ) .
Wonderful in its attention to detail ( there is a chapter on the letter S ) .
I found the linebreaking algorithm and the design of the AMS Euler font in collaboration with Hermann Zapf especially interesting , as well as the whole idea of parametrized fonts .
We get glimpses into the intricacies of typography , where nothing is as simple as it seems from the outside .
Part II .
Masha Gessen : Perfect Rigor : A Genius and the Mathematical Breakthrough of the Century .
I read the German translation of this biography of Grigory Perelman .
What I liked :
– the fascinating story of Perelman with interesting facts and details I did n’t know before
– interesting facts about the school system and the academic world in the Soviet Union
What I did n’t like :
– fascination with Clay Prize and other external accolades
– the author somewhat unsympathetic to Perelman and to mathematicians in general – taken out of context any personal quirk can be made to look monstrous ( I quite agree with this review here ) .
– occasional “ narrative fallacy ” , attempt to make various facts fit together smoothly William Aspray : John von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing .
A book about the life of John von Neumann and his contributions to several fields , with special focus on computer science and numerical calculus , as well as about his work in science planning and management .
Unusually for a biography , the book gets quite a bit into technical details ( which I liked ) , and tries to trace the evolution of von Neumann ’s thinking on various topics .
The book focuses on his work and not so much on his personal details , when it does “ get personal ” , it is almost universally positive , leaving any unflattering aspects to other biographers .
Andrew Hodges : Alan Turing : The Enigma .
Less worldly - smart and successful than von Neumann , but his work just as important to the foundations of computer science .
Also the intellectual interests of these two men are somewhat parallel , going from mathematical logic to the theoretical foundations of computing , to the engineering task of actually building computers , and finally to biological systems .
This biography is incredibly detailed and well documented – not only discusses technical ideas , but also sets the broader context of the intellectual currents of the day .
Describes the life and thoughts of Alan Turing ( reconstructed mostly from letters ) to an extreme level of details .
The parts about the work at Bletchley Park on breaking the Enigma are very interesting .
Also the parts about the Colossus and Ace computers – the technical details and decisions are interesting but in some places the administrative back and forth gets bit too tedious .
In summary , this is a definitive biography that paints a comprehensive picture of Alan Turing .
Martin Aigner , Günter M. Ziegler : Proofs from THE BOOK .
A collection of some of the most beautiful mathematical proofs .
I was at first suspicious that such a concept would work as a book , and the selection is of course somewhat subjective , but the book is in fact excellent , and seems accessible for the most part from high school level onwards ( requiring significant effort of course , but repaying it well ) .
I think this book is one of the best possible gifts to anyone who loves mathematics .
Part III .
Andreas M. Hinz , Sandi Klavzar , Uros Milutinovic , Ciril Petr : The Tower of Hanoi – Myths and Maths .
I reviewed this book for William Gasarch ’s column .
Most people remember the Tower of Hanoi puzzle as something quite simple , interesting mainly as a textbook example of recursion , and as an example of a problem where powers of two appear naturally .
In reality , as the book demonstrates , the Tower of Hanoi has a very rich mathematical structure , and as soon as we tweak the parameters we surprisingly quickly find ourselves in the realm of open problems .
The rest of the review can be read here .
Günter Ziegler : Darf ich Zahlen ? ( German ) .
A nice , light - hearted book amout mathematics and the process of doing it , also containing anecdotes about famous mathematicians .
Makes a nice present and good for learning German .
Früher war noch viel mehr Lametta ( German ) .
A pleasant collection of short - stories loosely related to Christmas .
As the stories come from different sources and styles , the difficulty of their German is very uneven – so it is quite good to test and improve language skills .
Michael Kohlmeier : Sagen des klassischen Altertums ( German ) .
The myths and stories of classical Greek antiquity retold in an informal style with insight and wit .
Based on a popular radio and TV show of the author .
The book is quite amazing , and good for practicing German , although the informal style does not necessarily make it very easy to read .
Part IV .
Franz Kafka : The Metamorphosis .
A classic about which nothing can be said that has n’t been said already .
I found it rather disturbing in places .
Also , of the classics , maybe among the more easily accessible in German .
4/5 Paul Auster : The Invention of Solitude .
A novel developing some autobiographical themes and stories – the first half is in a straightforward memoir format , the second part is a fictitious “ book of memories ” , written in third person and mixing storytelling with essayistic parts of varying depth .
Overall , the main theme of the book is fatherhood and the relationship between father and son .
As such , I found it insightful and moving in places , with good stories to tell , a bit sentimental and overwritten in others .
3/5 Charles Bukowski : Women .
The thinly veiled autobiographical ( anti ) hero of the book , Henry ( Hank ) Chinoski describes himself as M Sade without the intellectual depth .
Maybe the same applies to this book and Bukowski himself .
A more generous critic calls him the great de-Disney - fier of our age .
A bit annoying narcissism , good storytelling and turns of phrase .
3/5 Kurt Vonnegut : Cat ’s Cradle .
I found this book both very clever and very entertaining .
On the surface a short and funny Dr Strangelove story – describing as an aside possibly the best fictitious religion ever created , and throwing in concepts that haunt you long after finishing the book : karass , duprass , granfalloon , wampeter – several layers of satire intermixed with insight on human character and society .
Like all good magic realism , walks the fine line between cynicism and significance .

Cuckoo hashing is a simple and elegant method for collision - resolution in hash tables .
The resulting dictionary data structure is easy to implement , quite efficient in practice and it is also interesting theoretically ( there are several interesting open questions about its properties ) .
I made a small visualization of how Cuckoo hashing works .
The demo uses JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas , so it should work in most browsers .
Let me know if you find it useful or if you have any feedback .
The demo is loosely inspired by Jason Davies ’
Bloom filter visualization .
Here is my old post about Bloom filters .
Already there are signs that these less formal and more individual efforts are filling a vacuum created by a decline in activity among the independent advocacy groups  so - called 527s and similar operations  that have played a large role in negative politics in the last several election cycles .
Especially on the conservative side , independent groups have reported trouble raising money , and some of the biggest players from 2004 have signaled that they will sit it out this time around .
The shift has by no means gone unnoticed by the campaigns .
And while strategists in both parties suspect that traditional political operatives affiliated with the campaigns or parties frequently pose as independent grassroots participants by hiding behind anonymous Web identities , few have been caught this year .
The change has added to the frenetic pace of the campaign this year .
“ It ’s politics at the speed of Internet , ” said Dan Carol , a strategist for Mr. Obama who was one of the young bulls on Bill Clinton ’s vaunted rapid response team in 1992 .
“ There ’s just a lot of people who at a very low cost can do this stuff and do n’t need a memo from HQ . ”
That would seem to apply to people like Robert Anderson , a professor at Elon University in North Carolina whose modest YouTube site features videos flattering to Mr. Obama and unflattering to Mr. McCain , or Paul Villarreal , who from his apartment in Wilkes - Barre , Pa. , has produced a harsh series of spots that attack Mr. Obama and make some claims that have been widely debunked .
Counting the audience for such videos can be tricky , as sites like YouTube list only the number of times they have been viewed , not the number of people who view them .
That said , according to YouTube , Mr. Villarreal ’s video was viewed about 50,000 times .
And it cost him just $ 100 to produce , for software , he said .
He said he had no connection to the Republican Party or the McCain campaign , though he said he had reached out to them and not heard back .
The better - circulated political videos have generally come from people with some production experience .
One of the most widely seen anti-Obama videos was created by Jason Mitchell , who produces evangelical Christian programming in Durham , N.C .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Traci and Brian Bruckner between them commute 800 miles a week to and from their respective jobs -- his 30 miles away from their home in one direction , hers 50 miles away in another .
Gas station owner Osama Elkhawad holds on to the money given to him by a customer to prepay for fuel at his station in Arlington , Virginia , June 11 , 2008 .

With gas prices up 25 percent up since they moved to Wayne , Nebraska , just two years ago , Traci says they have been forced to cut back everywhere and postpone replacing the car Brian relies on to get to work .
“ It has 200,000 miles on it so we need to get a new one , ” she said .
“ But we just ca n’t afford to . ”
The spike in fuel prices pinching U.S. consumers is creating special challenges in the country ’s rural heartland , where residents typically earn less than their urban counterparts and travel longer distances -- often in older , less efficient vehicles -- to get to work .
Experts worry that if the surge continues -- while prices have eased over the past month , the cost of an average gallon is still up 30 percent over the past year and double what it cost four years ago -- it may threaten a three - decade - long population rebound that helped revitalize the country ’s rural core .
For much of the 20th century , most rural U.S. counties saw their population shrink as mechanization of agriculture eliminated jobs and pushed residents toward the big cities .
But that began to shift in the mid-1970s , as Americans began to flock back into rural areas .
Today , an estimated 50 million Americans -- about 17 percent of the population -- reside in the countryside .
Only one - fifth of those live in so - called exurban areas -- on the fringes of cities .
The rest live in places like Tipton , Iowa , the town of 3,200 where Bob Bird moved a decade ago to enjoy the simplicity -- and affordability -- of rural life .
“ It ’s a great place to live , ” said Bird , who drives 80 miles a day to his job as a roofer in Davenport .
“ But you ca n’t work here . ”
Like Bird , many Tipton residents support themselves by driving to jobs in Davenport , as well as cities like Iowa City and Cedar Rapids .
“ When I got here , 10 years ago , gas was $ 1 a gallon , ” said Bird .
“ It was n’t even a factor .
I just enjoyed living in the country and so we just kind of took it in stride .
But now it ’s a little crazy . ”
Experts say a number of factors contributed to the urban exodus and the rural renaissance , including frustration with housing costs , schools , crime and congestion associated with cities .
But cheap gas prices also played a role , making it possible for Americans to enjoy the best of both worlds : the peace , quiet and perceived affordability of rural living while still getting paid in big city dollars .
“ Commutes of 35 , 40 miles each way are not uncommon out here in the country , ” said Chuck Hassebrook , the executive director of the Center for Rural Affairs , a policy analysis and advocacy group focused on rural life in the upper Midwest and Great Plains .
“ So higher gas prices hurt . ”
Higher gas prices also make rural life a lot less idyllic , and less attractive to the urban refugees they rely on to sustain their populations .
In rural areas on the fringe of urban areas , the so - called exurbs where an estimated 10.8 million people lived in 2000 , according to the Census , access to commuter rail networks or car pools gives residents alternatives .
But out in the real country , where another 40 million people live , there are few alternatives to the automobile .
Telecommuting -- working an office job from home -- has n’t really taken root .
As a result , the pain of higher fuel prices is magnified .
“ There ’s no car - pooling out here , ” said Anna Marie Percuoco , a stay - at - home mom in Long Grove , Iowa , population 600 , whose husband drives a pickup truck 30 miles a day to his job in the city of Davenport .
Kenneth Johnson , a sociologist at Loyola University in Chicago , said that if the rural renaissance ends because places like Long Grove and Tipton stop attracting new residents , the economic effects wo n’t be confined to the countryside .
“ Energy cost acceleration cuts both ways , ” said Johnson , whose research has focused on trends in small - town America , noting that the urban areas are dependent on the broad rural labor markets for their workers .
Experts say another key question is what effect high energy prices will have on the rural areas , like those around the Great Lakes , that have seen their populations rise as they have become popular places to vacation or build a second home .
Johnson said migration to those counties , particularly in the more remote parts of northern Michigan , northern Wisconsin and northern Minnesota , has already started to slow because of the U.S. housing slump , which has made financing a second home using equity in the first a lot harder .
“ If energy prices begin to have an impact it could really slow growth , ” he said .
Steve Grubbs , whose Davenport - based sign - making company employs a number of rural residents , said those workers are already feeling the pinch .
“ I have one guy who has switched to riding his motorcycle in every day to save on gas , ” Grubbs said .
“ I do n’t know what he ’s going to do this winter . ”
To help ease the pain , Grubbs has begun offering prepaid gas cards as a reward to employees .
Interest in the cards has been significant , he said .
Bird , the Tipton resident who works in Davenport , is n’t ready to give up the rural lifestyle just yet .
But he is in the market for a more fuel - efficient vehicle for his daily commute .
Used , of course .
Babylon reached number five in the UK and 57 in the US Singer David Gray has warned that US interrogators playing loud music as a form of " torture " - including his own song Babylon - was no laughing matter .
" Only the novelty aspect of this story gets it noticed ...
Guantanamo greatest hits , " he said .
" What we 're talking about here is people in a darkened room , physically inhibited by handcuffs , bags over their heads and music blaring at them . "
His track Babylon is reportedly a favourite of US interrogators in Iraq .
It does n't matter what the music is - it could be Tchaikovsky 's finest or it could be Barney the Dinosaur
David Gray
Repeatedly playing loud music to suspected terrorist detainees is also a standard interrogation technique in Guantanamo and other US bases .
" That is torture , " the singer - songwriter told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight .
" That is nothing but torture .
" It does n't matter what the music is - it could be Tchaikovsky 's finest or it could be Barney the Dinosaur .

" It really does n't matter , it 's going to drive you completely nuts . "
He said such torture formed part of a US " retaliation to a few terrorist acts " .
" No - one wants to even think about it or discuss the fact that we 've gone above and beyond all legal process and we 're torturing people , " he added .
Babylon - from his White Ladder album - was Gray 's breakthrough single , reaching number five in the UK in 2000 .
White Ladder reached number one in the UK and number 35 in the US .

What are these ?
I ’ve been playing with Erlang over nights and weekends off and on for a few months now .
I ’m loving it for several reasons .
First off , it ’s completely different than any other programming language I ’ve worked with .
It makes me think rather than take things for granted .
I ’m intrigued by concurrency abilities and its immutable no - shared - state mentality .
I do go through periods of amazing productivity followed by hours if not days of figuring out a simple task .
Luckily the folks in #erlang on irc.freenode .
net have been extremely patient with myself and the hundreds of other newcomers and have been extremely helpful .
I ’m also finding that those long pain periods are happening less frequently the longer I stick with it .
One of the things that truly blew me away about Erlang ( after the original Erlang Now ! moment ) is its bit syntax .
The bit syntax as documented at erlang.org and covered in Programming Erlang is extremely powerful .
Some of the examples in Joe ’s book such as parsing an MP3 file or an IP v4 datagram hint at the power and conciseness of binary matching and Erlang ’s bit syntax .
I wanted to highlight a few more that have impressed me while I was working on some network socket programming in Erlang .
There are several mind - boggling examples in Applications , Implementation and Performance Evaluation of Bit Stream Programming in Erlang ( PDF ) by Per Gustafsson and Konstantinos Sagonas .
Here are two functions for uuencoding and uudecoding a binary :
uuencode ( BitStr ) -> << ( X+32 ) :8 || << X:6 >> <= BitStr >>. uudecode ( Text ) -> << ( X - 32 ) :6 || << X:8 >> <= Text >>.
UUencoding and UUdecoding is n’t particularly hard , but I ’ve never seen an implementation so concise .
I ’ve also found that Erlang ’s bit syntax makes socket programming extremely easy .
The gen_tcp library makes connection to TCP sockets easy , and Erlang ’s bit syntax makes creating requests and processing responses dead simple too .
Here ’s an example from qrbgerl , a quick project of mine that receives random numbers from the Quantum Random Bit Generator service .
The only documentation I needed to use the protocol was the Python client and the C++ client .
Having access to an existing Python client helped me bridge the “ how might I do this in Python ? ” and “ how might I do this in Erlang ? ” gaps , but I ended up referring to the canonical C++ implementation quite a bit too .
I start out by opening a socket and sending a request .
Here ’s the binary representation of the request I ’m sending :
list_to_binary ([<< 0:8 , ContentLength:16 ,UsernameLength:8 >> , Username , << PasswordLength:8 >> , Password , <<?REQUEST_SIZE:32 >> ] ) ,
This creates a binary packet that complies exactly with what the QRBG service expects .
The first thing that it expects is a 0 represented in 8 bits .
Then it wants the length of the username plus the length of the password plus 6 ( ContentLength above ) represented in 16 bits .
Then we have the username represented as 8 bit characters / integers , followed by the length of the password represented in 8 bits , followed by the password ( again as 8 bit characters / integers ) .
Finally we represent the size of the request in 32 bits .
In this case the macro ?
REQUEST_SIZE is 4096 .
While that ’s a little tricky , once we ’ve sent the request , we can use Erlang ’s pattern matching and bit syntax to process the response :
<< Response : 8 , Reason : 8 , Length:32 , Data : Length / binary , _ Rest / binary >> = Bin ,
We ’re matching several things here .
The response code is the first 8 bits of the response .
In a successful response we ’ll get a 0 .
The next 8 bits represent the reason code , again 0 in this case .
The next 32 bits will represent the length of the data we ’re being sent back .
It should be 4096 bytes of data , but we ca n’t be sure .
Next we ’re using the length of the data that we just determined to match that length of data as a binary .
Finally we match anything else after the data and discard it .
This is crucial because binaries are often padded at the beginning or end of the stream .
In this case there ’s some padding at the end that we need to match but can safely discard .
Now that we have 4096 bytes of random bits , let ’s do something with them !
I ’ve mirrored the C++ and Python APIs as well as I could , but because of Erlang ’s no shared state it ’s going to look a little different .
Let ’s match a 32 bit integer from the random data that we ’ve obtained :
<< Int:32/integer - signed , Rest / binary >> = Bin ,
We ’re matching the first 32 bits of our binary stream to a signed integer .
We ’re also matching the rest of the data in binary form so that we can reuse it later .
Here ’s that data extraction in action :
5> { Int , RestData} = qrbg:extract_int ( Data ) .
{-427507221 , <<0,254,163,8,239,180,51,164,169,160,170,248,94,132,220,79,234,4,117 , 248,174,59,167,49,165,170,154 , ...>>}
6 > Int. -427507221
I ’ve been quite happy with my experimentation with Erlang , but I ’m definitely still learning some basic syntax and have only begun to play with concurrency .
If the above examples confuse you , it might help to view them in context or take a look at the project on google code .
I have also released an ISBN - 10 and ISBN - 13 validation and conversion library for Erlang which was a project I used to teach myself some Erlang basics .
I definitely have some polishing to do with the QRBG client , but isbn.erl has full documentation and some 44 tests .
The Florida Public Service Commission has “ unanimously and enthusiastically ” approved a plan to build America ’s largest commercial solar - power plant in the state .
The committee also gave the green light to a further two facilities , due to go on - line in 2009 .
Florida Power & Light have selected SunPower to construct the three solar - power plants in the center of the state .
The largest , a 75 - megawatt plant in Martin County on the East Coast , will be connected to a natural gas plant .
Another 25 - megawatt plant in DeSoto County will be the largest photovoltaic facility in the country , while a third , 10 - megawatt photovoltaic facility is to be housed at the Kennedy Space Center .
Speaking about the project , Howard Wenger , SunPower ’s Senior Vice President , Global Business Units said , “ These agreements confirm the growing trend in the U.S. to build solar power plants at a scale rivalling those in market - leading countries such as Germany and Spain . ”
The Florida decision follows a raft of recent political moves to boost the development of solar and other renewable energy sources in the U.S. Last week , Pennsylvania launched a Bill establishing a $ 650 million energy fund to support the sector .
Earlier in the month , the U.S. Senate introduced the 10 Million Solar Roofs
Act of 2008 , while the end of June saw House Democrats introduce a national feed - in tariff for renewable energy projects .

How does the current inflation affect ordinary people ?
The rate of inflation is now at five million percent .
The minimum wage is around 100 billion dollars .
That wo n’t pay for transport to work , let alone rent and food .
And you can forget about schools fees or medical bills .
The ISO is pushing for workers to be paid in the South African rand .
Some companies already do this for their managers , but it is workers who are really suffering .
What is the situation after the run-on election ?
[ NB
This interview took place before Zanu - PF and MDC went into official talks ]
Even after claiming victory in the recent election President Robert Mugabe has no solution to the economic crisis and is desperate to cling to office .
He might turn to the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) to try and get Western sanctions lifted .
He has yet to form his cabinet and his tone has softened to the opposition .
He has released from jail the MDC ’s secretary general Tendai Biti and the two remaining Women of Zimbabwe Arise ( Woza ) leaders .
So he might be looking to negotiate , but he might also try to proceed as things were before .
Or he might go for a military government .
During the election period he appointed military personnel to run all the government departments .
Though Mugabe does n’t want to die in office , he is afraid to step down .
He fears the international courts might prosecute him for atrocities in the early 1980s in Matabeleland if someone he does n’t trust replaces him .
His military leaders are people who he has worked with closely .
That is where his power lies , so he may choose to rely on them , though that would leave him otherwise very isolated .
While there have been calls in the West for sanctions against Zimbabwe , no one should support them .
More sanctions will mean more poverty .
The West says it is targeting high cabinet officials , but it is the poor who are hit .
The government and the rich still go shopping in Dubai .
In the capital Harare you still see very expensive cars driving around .
Mugabe himself recently bought a new bulletproof limousine .
In Britain we hear a lot about calls for military intervention .
What do people in Zimbabwe think about this ?
After the disaster of Iraq , few on the left internationally think Western intervention would be a good idea .
But worryingly there are some in Zimbabwe who disagree .
There is even a popular song among MDC supporters that goes , “ Saddam is gone , Mugabe is next . ”
They think the same method that ousted Saddam Hussein will free us from Mugabe .
They hope for intervention because they are exhausted .
They think invaders will only attack Zanu - PF .
But on the left we know that the people who welcomed the US troops as liberators in Somalia in 1993 soon came to hate them as they shot ordinary people .
So , What kind of resistance is needed ?
Mugabe is a great pretender , who speaks left and acts right .
The truth is he only rediscovered his left voice when he was faced with the threat of the MDC in 2000 .
Before that he had n't talked left since the early 1980s .
He was happy with the imperialists when he was imposing their structural adjustment programme and getting a knighthood .
To bring real change we need to regroup all the social movements in a united front with the MDC itself , so that we initiate a process of civil disobedience and a rejection of Mugabe ’s presidency .
If the MDC comes to power the Western - imposed sanctions will be removed .
Also there will be a space for democratic organisations .
Groups like Woza bring together all the people who are fighting for their rights .
If they become united such forces can be a very great force in challenging Mugabe .
A People ’s Convention in February brought many organisations together .
Unfortunately some of the leading people in it subordinated themselves to the MDC ’s election strategy .
Now I think they will come back to work around the people ’s charter , which was launched from the convention .
The ISO is intervening by putting demands on the leadership of the movement .
The two we plan to concentrate on are a new democratic people - driven constitution and a national minimum wage that is linked to inflation .
We know that if we get Mugabe out of office we will still have a real fight on our hands – the MDC ’s neoliberal leadership are not friends of the workers .
The role of socialists and trade unionists in Britain is very important .

Last Stand of the Tallgrass Prairie
Tallgrass prairie once covered 170 million acres of North America , but within a generation most of it had been transformed into farmland .
Today less than 4 % remains intact , mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills .
Established on November 12 , 1996 , the preserve protects a nationally significant remnant of the once vast tallgrass prairie ecosystem .
Here the tallgrass makes its last stand .

Listen to Shannyn Moore of KUDO 1080 AM and Greg Palast on the Exxon Valdez Verdict
[ Thursday , June 26 , 2008 ]
Twenty years after Exxon Valdez slimed over one thousand miles of Alaskan beaches , the company has yet to pay the $ 5 billion in punitive damages awarded by the jury .
And now they wo n't have to .
The Supreme Court today cut Exxon 's liability by 90 % to half a billion .
It 's so cheap , it 's like a permit to spill .
Exxon knew this would happen .
Right after the spill , I was brought to Alaska by the Natives whose Prince William Sound islands , livelihoods , and their food source was contaminated by Exxon crude .
My assignment : to investigate oil company frauds that led to to the disaster .
There were plenty .
But before we brought charges , the Natives hoped to settle with the oil company , to receive just enough compensation to buy some boats and rebuild their island villages to withstand what would be a decade of trying to survive in a polluted ecological death zone .
In San Diego , I met with Exxon 's US production chief , Otto Harrison , who said , “ Admit it ; the oil spill 's the best thing to happen ” to the Natives .
His company offered the Natives pennies on the dollar .
The oil men added a cruel threat : take it or leave it
and wait twenty years to get even the pennies .
Exxon is immortal – but Natives die .
And they did .
A third of the Native fishermen and seal hunters I worked with are dead .
Now their families will collect one tenth of their award , two decades too late .
In today 's ruling , Supreme Court Justice David Souter wrote that Exxon 's recklessness was ” profitless ” – so the company should n't have to pay punitive damages .
Profitless , Mr. Souter ?
Exxon and its oil shipping partners saved billions – BILLIONS – by operating for sixteen years without the oil spill safety equipment they promised , in writing , under oath and by contract .
The official story is , “ Drunken Skipper Hits Reef . ”
But do n't believe it , Mr. Souter .
Alaska 's Native lands and coastline were destroyed by a systematic fraud motivated by profit - crazed penny - pinching .
Here 's the unreported story , the one you wo n't get tonight on the Petroleum Broadcast System :
It begins in 1969 when big shots from Humble Oil and ARCO ( now known as Exxon and British Petroleum ) met with the Chugach Natives , owners of the most valuable parcel of land on the planet : Valdez Port , the only conceivable terminus for a pipeline that would handle a trillion dollars in crude oil .
These Alaskan natives ultimately agreed to sell the Exxon consortium this astronomically valuable patch of land — for a single dollar .
The Natives refused cash .
Rather , in 1969 , they asked only that the oil companies promise to protect their Prince William Sound fishing and seal hunting grounds from oil .
In 1971 , Exxon and partners agreed to place the Natives ' specific list of safeguards into federal law .
These commitments to safety reassured enough Congressmen for the oil group to win , by one vote , the right to ship oil from Valdez .
The oil companies repeated their promises under oath to the US Congress .
The spill disaster was the result of Exxon and partners breaking every one of those promises – cynically , systematically , disastrously , in the fifteen years leading up to the spill .
Forget the drunken skipper fable .
As to Captain Joe Hazelwood , he was below decks , sleeping off his bender .
At the helm , the third mate would never have collided with Bligh Reef had he looked at his Raycas radar .
But the radar was not turned on .
In fact , the tanker 's radar was left broken and disasbled for more than a year before the disaster , and Exxon management knew it .
It was just too expensive to fix and operate .
For the Chugach , this discovery was poignantly ironic .
On their list of safety demands in return for Valdez was “ state - of - the - art ” on - ship radar .
We discovered more , but because of the labyrinthine ways of litigation , little became public , especially about the reckless acts of the industry consortium , Alyeska , which controls the Alaska Pipeline .
Several smaller oil spills before the Exxon Valdez could have warned of a system breakdown .
But a former Senior Lab Technician with Alyeska , Erlene Blake , told our investigators that management routinely ordered her to toss out test samples of water evidencing spilled oil .
She was ordered to refill the test tubes with a bucket of clean sea water called , “ The Miracle Barrel . ”
In a secret meeting in April 1988 , Alyeska Vice - President T.L. Polasek confidentially warned the oil group executives that , because Alyeska had never purchased promised safety equipment , it was simply “ not possible ” to contain an oil spill past the Valdez Narrows — exactly where the Exxon Valdez ran aground 10 months later .
The Natives demanded ( and law requires ) that the shippers maintain round - the - clock oil spill response teams .
Alyeska hired the Natives , especiallly qualified by their generations - old knowledge of the Sound , for this emergency work .
They trained to drop from helicopters into the water with special equipment to contain an oil slick at a moments notice .
But in 1979 , quietly , Alyeska fired them all .
To deflect inquisitive state inspectors , the oil consortium created sham teams , listing names of oil terminal workers who had not the foggiest idea how to use spill equipment which , in any event , was missing , broken or existed only on paper .
In 1989 , when the oil poured from the tanker , there was no Native response team , only chaos .
Today , twenty years after the oil washed over the Chugach beaches , you can kick over a rock and it will smell like an old gas station .
The cover story of the Drunken Captain serves the oil industry well .
It falsely presents America 's greatest environmental disaster as a tale of human frailty , a one - time accident .
But broken radar , missing equipment , phantom spill teams , faked tests — the profit - driven disregard of the law — made the spill an inevitability , not an accident .
Yet Big Oil tells us , as they plead to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve , as Senator John McCain calls for drilling off the shores of the Lower 48 , it can't happen again .
They promise .

KNOXVILLE , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
A man accused of fatally shooting two adults and wounding seven others at a Knoxville church told police the church 's liberal teachings prompted him to attack , according to court papers .
Jim Adkisson said liberals should be killed because they 're ruining the nation , according to an affidavit .
Jim David Adkisson told investigators all liberals should be killed and admitted he shot people Sunday morning at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church , according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate WBIR .
Also , a four - page letter police found in Adkisson 's vehicle indicated he was motivated by frustration over being unable to obtain a job , authorities said Monday .
Police said Adkisson , 58 , of Powell , Tennessee , walked into the church 's sanctuary during a children 's musical performance and fired a shotgun before being overpowered by congregants and arrested .
Adkisson -- who police said was n't a member of the church -- has been charged with one count of first - degree murder .
According to the affidavit requesting to search Adkisson 's home , the suspect told investigators liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country .
Adkisson also blamed Democrats for the country 's decline , according to the affidavit .
" He felt that the Democrats had tied his country 's hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets , " the affidavit said .
" Because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement ... he would then target those that had voted them into office . "
Killed in the shooting were Linda Kraeger , 61 , and Greg McKendry , 60 , police said .
Witnesses said McKendry , an usher and board member at the church , tried to shield others when he was shot , according to The Associated Press .
Watch scene at church after shooting »
Four of the seven surviving wounded were still in the University of Tennessee Medical Center on Monday evening .
Officials there said two patients were in critical condition and one was " stable . "
The hospital would not release information about the fourth person .
At a news conference Monday , Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen IV said Adkisson left a note in his vehicle before entering the church , thinking police would kill him after the shooting began .
Owen said the letter , signed by Adkisson but not addressed to anyone , expressed hatred for gay people and what he called the liberal movement .
According to Out & About , a gay newspaper based in Nashville , Tennessee , the church was home to several gay and gay - friendly groups and recently posted a " gays welcome " sign " as part of its long - range planning to conduct more outreach and welcome " to gay men and lesbians .
The church , on its Web site , describes itself as a community that has worked for social change -- including desegregation , women 's rights and gay rights -- since the 1950s .
The case is being investigated as a hate crime , Owen said .
Owen also said the letter expressed Adkisson 's frustrations at not being able to find employment .
Authorities also discovered a letter from the state government telling Adkisson he was having his food stamps reduced or eliminated , police said .
Owen said Adkisson has resided in the Knoxville area for three or four years and his last known employment was in 2006 .
Neighbors told The Associated Press Adkisson had been a truck driver , and Owen said Adkisson has an associate 's degree in mechanical engineering .

" He did express that frustration , that the liberal movement was getting more jobs , " Owen told reporters .
" And he felt like he was being kept out of the loop because of his age . "
Watch police chief describe latest findings »
Investigators found 76 shotgun shells in the church , Owen said .
Three rounds were fired from a 12 - gauge shotgun that was brought into the church hidden in a guitar case , police said .
There is " an indication he was not targeting the children , " but that has not been conclusively determined , Owen said .

During a search of Adkisson 's home , investigators confiscated a handgun , a sawed - off shotgun barrel and books by conservative commentators , authorities said .
The shooting came eight years after Adkisson , according to divorce documents , threatened to kill his fourth wife and himself .
In a 2000 complaint filed in Tennessee 's Anderson County , his then - wife , Liza Alexander , said she was " in fear for my life and what he might do . "
She also claimed that Adkisson " drinks heavily every day , and becomes belligerent , and makes threats . "
" My husband , Jim David Adkisson told a friend of mine that one of his options is to blow my brains out and then blow his own brains out ( I heard him say this ) , " Alexander wrote in her petition for a protection order , which she was granted .
The only criminal record authorities have found of Adkisson shows two instances of driving under the influence -- one in California " a number of years ago " and one " more recently " in Tennessee , Owen said .
Authorities have been told that Adkisson was once in the military , a member of the 101st Airborne Division , Owen said .
Lt. Col . Anne Edgecomb , an Army spokeswoman , said there is a record of a Jim David Adkisson who served beginning in 1974 .
He was released from active duty in 1977 and discharged in 1980 .
He was a helicopter repairman with the 163rd Aviation Co. at Fort Campbell , Kentucky -- part of the 101st Airborne Division .
Adkisson 's military record shows that in 1977 he was demoted from a specialist 4th class to private .
Information about why Adkisson was demoted was n't available .
Neighbors said Adkisson was quiet and kept to himself .
" He never went anywhere .
He never had anybody over .
Just , it was really quiet .
He rode a motorcycle and you know he would go out on the weekends on his motorcycle , but other than that , you never heard from him , " Melissa Coker told WVLT - TV .
Coker told the AP that Adkisson had been a truck driver , but she did n't think he'd been working steadily in the past six months .
" He 's just a really , really nice guy , " Coker told the AP .
Adkisson 's landlord said she did not know him well enough to make any comments on his character but said he was a good tenant who paid his bills , according to CNN affiliate WBIR - TV .
Bail was set at $ 1 million late Sunday .
Police said people were recording videos of the children 's performance when the shooting happened , and investigators were reviewing the videos .
Information on what , if anything , the videos show of the shooting was n't immediately available .
Three of the wounded were relatives who were visiting the church for the first time Sunday .
WVLT identified the three as Joe Barnhart , 76 ; Jack Barnhart , 69 ; and Betty Barnhart , 71 , who was treated and released Sunday .
A statement released by the family Monday said : " The entire Barnhart family would like to thank our friends and the community for their calls , visits and prayers .
...
Our family members continue to recover and we ask that your prayers continue for all that have been involved in this tragic event . "

Sick of High Gas Prices ?
Turn To Smart Cars or the Aptera
Fuel efficient cars and alternative forms of transport come in all shapes and sizes .
Are we ready for the Smart Car or the Aptera ?
The unrelenting increases in gas prices in the United States have started to significantly affect the way we conduct ourselves .
It ’s just one of the reasons why I ’m rejoicing about my decision to toss my commute and quitting my job for the time being .
A lot of people have the same idea , which unfortunately results in a lot of flux in our community of late .
People are opting to work more closely to where they live , thus effecting changes in our neighborhood : my kids have lost some long - time teachers to the gas hikes , while we ’ve had service workers in our area decide that their jobs were no longer worth the cost of travel .
So what can we do about this besides cut back on travel ?
Well how about changing how we travel ?
Just for fun , I ’ve investigated a few options to our beloved gas guzzling S.U.V.s and family vans that may just be what you ’ll see down the road en masse in the years to come .
If you look around , you may start noticing that those folks who ’ve unloaded these gas hogs :
Are now appearing much happier , like this guy :
According to the New York Times , 20 % of vehicles sold last April was a smaller model ( compact or subcompact ) .
Contrast that to 10 years ago , when trucks and S.U.V. ’s were the rage — back then , one in eight vehicles sold was a compact .
When you ’ve taken the steps to reduce your need for fuel and you ’re no longer dependent on a costly resource , it can only be described as liberating .
“ I had to smile the other day when I filled my tank for $ 18 and the guy next to me had a Ford Explorer and the pump was clicking past $ 80 , ” said Mr. Strom , a 66 - year - old retired manager of a Chevrolet dealership .
Let ’s take a quick look at other possibilities that can help us ( almost ) forget about high fuel costs forever .
# 1 A Cute Hybrid .
It ’ll be the day when we see these Prius taxis everywhere .
~ooOoo~ ~ooOoo~
# 2 Weird New Electric
Cars like this Aptera .
More and more electric cars are hitting the market , though many are still in the prototype stage .
Some dealers are now taking reservations and have long waiting lists despite some of their more obscene prices ( e.g. Tesla ) .
For the record , the Aptera , a diesel - electric hybrid , gets 250 miles to the gallon .
~ooOoo~ ~ooOoo~
# 3 Go smaller with Micro - Compact Cars .
Everyone knows compacts are great for gas conservation , so why not go for micro-compact cars ?
If you ’re keeping a conventional , standard - sized model for family use , you can still opt to own one of these tiny cars for commuting purposes .
The only issue I have with them is that you ’re pretty much toast if you get into a mishap with a larger vehicle ( well , just like you would be if you were riding a motorbike ) !
Europe is big on Smart Cars , will the U.S. follow suit ?
The Corbin Sparrow seems like a step up from the diminutive golf cart .
~ooOoo~ ~ooOoo~
# 4 You can always stick to the traditional two wheelers , like the Self - Powered , Manual Bicycle , especially for shorter trips .
~ooOoo~ ~ooOoo~
# 5 How about this Motorized Scooter called the Segway ?
They ’re just the ticket if you ’d rather not make your legs do the walking !
Some shortcomings of this high tech scooter : the price tag is $ 5,000 , they go no faster than 12.5 miles an hour and need to be charged every 25 miles .
They offer no protection from the elements ( same issues as a bike or a motorbike ) and are most practical if your commute is fairly short .
But you ’ll never have to fill up with gas when you travel this way !
For a clever way to use the segway , take a look over here .
~ooOoo~
# 6 A Traveling Bowling Ball .
An alternative concept that ’s outside of the box ( or wheel ) 😉 .
Funny idea , too bad it ’s not real ( haha ! ) .
Out of all the forms of transport here , this is the only one that you ’ll probably never see on the roads …. at least , during your lifetime !
Any other ideas about what we may be seeing on our freeways in a decade ….
or when gas hits $ 10 a gallon ?

Bush applauds passage of telecom immunity , signs bill Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008
Print This Email This The Senate gave President Bush what he wanted Wednesday , sending him a bill expanding his surveillance authority and granting legal amnesty to telecommunications companies that facilitated his warrantless surveillance program .
On a 69 - 28 vote , the Senate approved an administration - backed update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act after striking down amendments to modify its immunity provision .
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) voted for the FISA update , while his former primary opponent Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) voted against it .
Republican candidate John McCain skipped the FISA vote altogether .
President Bush applauded both major parties on Wednesday .
" This vital intelligence bill will allow our national security professionals to quickly and effectively monitor the plans of terrorists outside the United States , " he said , " while respecting the liberties of the American people . "
" This bill will help our intelligence professionals learn who the terrorists are talking to , what they 're saying , and what they 're planning , " he went on .
" It will ensure that those companies whose assistance is necessary to protect the country will , themselves , be protected from lawsuits for past or future cooperation with the government . "
Bush signed the bill early Thursday afternoon .
Opponents of legal amnesty for telecommunications companies that facilitated President Bush 's extra-legal warrantless wiretapping program were dealt a decisive blow Wednesday , but advocates vowed to challenge the bill in court .
An amendment sponsored by Sens. Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) and Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) to strip telecom immunity from an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act failed 32 to 66 , although that was more support than the 31 votes a similar amendment received in February .
The shift appears to be a result of Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) voting in favor of the amendment -- she did not vote last time -- and Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) skipping the vote -- he opposed the measure last time .
Immediately after the vote on Feingold and Dodd 's amendment , the Senate voted down another offering from Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) , which would have let the court decide not to grant immunity if it decides the warrantless spying was unconstitutional .
The amendment failed 37 - 61 .
Senators then moved to an amendment from Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) , which would have delayed a decision on immunity until Congress receives reports on the warrantless wiretapping from inspectors general of the agencies involved in the program .
That measure failed 42 - 56 .
Obama voted in favor of the Feingold / Dodd and Specter amendments , although he has said he will vote for the final FISA bill even if the immunity provision remains .
The Illinois Senator has taken heat from supporters for reneging on an earlier pledge to oppose any FISA update that would grant immunity .
If Obama hoped to avoid criticism from the right by agreeing to support what he said was a vital intelligence - gathering measure , he perhaps underestimated his political opponents .
McCain 's campaign released a statement earlier Wednesday echoing criticism from the left .
" A few short months ago , Barack Obama outwardly opposed terrorist surveillance legislation , saying that he would filibuster any bill that includes immunity for American telecommunications companies that had been asked by the government to participate in the program , " said the statement from McCain 's campaign .
" Today , the U.S. Senate will approve legislation providing the immunity Barack Obama supposedly opposed , and despite his promise , he will not support a filibuster .
What Barack Obama will do is show that he 's willing to change positions , break campaign commitments and undermine his own words in his quest for higher office . "
The Republican National Committee also sent out a release attacking Obama for his position shift .
The Republican presidential candidate missed every vote on the FISA bill Wednesday to campaign in Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan .
Feingold , Dodd , Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and other opponents of the administration - backed FISA update excoriated their colleagues from the Senate floor .
The bill that was headed toward passage , they argued , would eliminate any independent oversight of the National Security Agency 's lawless surveillance of Americans Bush authorized .
" It could not be clearer that this program broke the law , and this President broke the law .
Not only that , but this administration affirmatively misled Congress and the American people about it for years before it finally became public ,  Feingold said of the warrantless wiretapping program .
Bush said his " Terrorist Surveillance Program " began after 9/11 , although no one outside a few members of Congress knew about it until the New York Times revealed the program 's existence in December 2005 .
Dodd said the constitutionality and legality of that program was " a matter for the court to decide , " which the grant of immunity would prevent .
Leahy said the immunity would cut off what is perhaps the only remaining avenue for oversight and accountability since the administration has stonewalled congressional inquiries into Bush 's wiretapping program .
" It is clear that the administration did not want the Senate to evaluate the evidence and draw its own conclusions , " Leahy said .
" Again , it sought to avoid accountability . "

Congressman Robert Wexler —
Our campaign for accountability for the Bush administration is making legitimate progress .
I am pleased to announce to you that the House Judiciary Committee has met my public call for Scott McClellan ’s immediate testimony with action :
Today , Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers officially invited Mr. McClellan to testify under oath on Friday , June 20th at 10 AM .
After all of our hard work pushing for impeachment hearings for Vice President Cheney “ “ the McClellan hearing provides our cause with a legitimate opportunity to showcase the crimes and violations of this Administration for the American people , the mainstream media , reluctant members of the Democratic party , and sensible Republicans .
This hearing provides us our first genuine opportunity to enter the public consciousness and change the dynamics that have prevented true accountability for Bush and Cheney .
Mr. McClellan was a major figure in the Valerie Plame / CIA scandal , as well as a leading propagandist for the Bush White House ’s deliberate attempts to hide the true costs of this war from the American public .
As such , Mr. McClellan will testify under oath ( and be subject to perjury charges should he lie ) and be asked about the following matters :
What role did President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and key administration officials take in the effort to reveal the identity of covert CIA agent Valeria Plame Wilson “ “ thus destroying her network and putting lives in jeopardy ?
What role did President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and key administration officials take regarding the firing of U.S. Attorneys or political reasons ?
What role did President Bush , Vice President Cheney , key administration officials take in conspiring to blatantly break U.S. and International laws prohibiting the use of torture ?
I call on Mr. McClellen to immediately accept this invitation and testify under oath as he previously agreed to while being interviewed on national television .
During the hearing I will have roughly five short minutes to question Mr. McClellan and undercover the illegalities committed by this Administration “ “ which is why it is critically important that every representative on the Judiciary Committee hears your voice .
Please let them know that you demand answers to these questions .
Nor should it stop there : Karl Rove has thumbed his nose to the Judiciary Committee ’s subpoena “ “ joining Harriet Miers , Joshua Bolten and Vice President Cheney ’s Chief of Staff David Addington as the only Administration officials in history to claim Congress has no power to even bring them before a committee to be questioned .
I have called for Karl Rove to be held in inherent contempt and for the other renegade officials to appear as required by their subpoenas , or be forced to do so by the House Sergeant of Arms .
What the Judiciary ’s request of McClellan proves is that if we stay vigilant “ “ if we call loudly and repeatedly for accountability – that we become very difficult to ignore .
Please stay tuned .
I hope for more developments soon .
With great respect ,
Congressman Robert Wexler

Without wanting for a moment to give the impression that it's anything other than a wonderful way to earn a living , there are times in a rock critic 's life when the soul sighs , and one faces the blank screen with heavy heart and empty head .
Last week was one such time .
A new Coldplay album .
When , all too frequently , people say how great it must be to earn one 's corn writing about music , it 's hard to disabuse them of that opinion .
Of course it 's great !
But I tend to offer one small caveat : it 's not just writing about music that you enjoy – often , duty makes demands beyond one 's personal tastes .
And while experience , or low cunning , might spare one unnecessary exposure to the reviewer 's less vital duties – hip - hop album tracks entitled " Intro " , " Interlude " or " Telephone Skit " , triple - albums by Prince , or the solo projects of sundry Rolling Stones – sometimes an act is so huge , so current , that it 's impossible to ignore their enervating new release .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A new Coldplay album .
" Well , at least I 'm not dodging sniper bullets in Helmand , " you tell yourself , and set about the task in hand , knowing it 's going to be no more rewarding an experience than the last time you deliberately exposed yourself to their mawkish stadium - rock anthems .
Though actually , who knows ?
After all , this one 's produced by Brian Eno , and he even managed to make U2 bearable for an album or two .
But Eno 's presence begs its own question , of course .
I recall an occasion back in the Eighties , when the young Eddie Murphy , his career then in the ascendant , was drafted in to salvage an appalling Dudley Moore comedy called Best Defense , through the insertion of about 10 minutes of extraneous footage of him pootling about in an army tank .
The film was still terrible , and when asked why on earth he had accepted the part , Murphy shrugged and said : " There was a knock at my door , and when I opened it four men came in bearing an enormous cheque . "
One can only wonder how many musclebound oafs were required to carry the cheque that persuaded Eno to produce Coldplay 's new album .
I mean , given his rarefied cultural tastes , surely it can't have been the project highest on Eno 's wish - list ?
And what with all the U2 royalties , he could n't conceivably need the money .
In the event , the album is almost exactly as I expected , if a tad shorter on Big Anthems than the previous three .
The rhythms are a bit busier , and a bit more ethnic , and Chris Martin 's little falsetto catch – one of modern music 's most irritating tropes – has been rationed out more parsimoniously .
( Thanks , Eno ! )
Pop 's favourite Brianiac has ensured the sonic prerequisites are all in good order .
And in a few cases , the songs do seem to be about things , rather than just anaemic expressions of emotional indulgence and limp consolation , like X & Y .
Things like death , and war , and power .
It 's ... not much , really , but not so little as to be completely worthless .
It 's the new Gold Standard of Average Music .
And given the competition currently battling for that dubious honour , this is no mean feat .
Almost an achievement , in fact .
But do n't just take my word for it .
Tomorrow you can buy the album and hear for yourself – as will untold millions around the globe .
Viva La Vida has already broken the record for iTune 's biggest album presale , and will doubtless repeat the success of X & Y , which reached No 1 in all 15 territories surveyed in Wikipedia 's comparative chart , and shifted upwards of 10 million units .
Not Thriller , perhaps , but then ... oh go on , you finish the joke .
The strange thing is , I can't seem to find anyone who bought X & Y , or who intends to buy Viva La Vida .
For that matter , I have never encountered one person who has a kind word to say about Coldplay .
None of my personal or professional acquaintances , nobody in the street or the local café , not a single soul will admit to liking Coldplay or purchasing their music .
Indeed , most seem to agree that they epitomise everything that 's wrong with modern rock music .
So who 's buying all their albums ?
Who are those masses politely arrayed in their thousands at stadiums when Coldplay play ?
Is it some secret society , an Opus Dei of dreary anthemic music ?
And where do they congregate , other than at stadiums and arenas ?
Do they have parties ?
And if so , how many slash their wrists at these parties ?
What 's the attrition rate ?
Yes , yes , I know , I should n't be so hard on them – after all , being Coldplay fans , they have it hard enough already .
But it does seem to be the case that Coldplay have become one of those definitive cultural dividers , the twain of which shall never meet .
They 're sort of the anti-Sex Pistols , an act that repulses not through outrage , bad manners and poor grooming , but through their inoffensive niceness and emollient personableness .
In 1977 , EMI could n't divest themselves of the troublesome Pistols quick enough , you might recall ; but in February 2005 , that same corporation 's whopping share - price fall of 46.25 p ( to £ 2.35 ) was largely attributed to the announcement that Coldplay 's X & Y would not be released during that fiscal year , as originally expected .
This corporate impact is especially ironic given Coldplay singer Chris Martin 's highly publicised advocacy of anti-corporate , pro-Fair Trade principles , just one of several ways in which the band offers a pale reflection of their most obvious influence , Radiohead .
Their music sounds like Radiohead with all the spiky , difficult , interesting bits boiled out of it , resulting in something with the sonic consistency of wilted spinach ; it retains the crowd - pleasing hooks and singalong choruses while dispensing with the more challenging , dissonant aspects and sudden , 90 - degree shifts in direction .
Chris Martin 's decision to sing in a register that , at times , strains his vocal almost to a yodel brazenly apes Thom Yorke 's more skilful and restrained use of a similar vocal gambit .
But where Yorke 's subtler employment brings soul into prog-rock , Martin 's gauche overuse has become a cliché , which itself has been aped by the likes of James Blunt , perhaps the band 's chief rival in musical mawkishness .
Another obvious comparison would be with Pink Floyd : they evoke much the same oceanic sense of unease and uplift , and employ the same type of widescreen arrangements , though as with their Radiohead influence , there 's little hint that Coldplay share the Floyd 's questing artistic temperament .
Nor could they emulate the distinctive lyrical approaches of Yorke or Roger Waters , both of whose work is simply too acerbic and bitter , and frequently too twisted and ambivalent , for such innate populists to handle .
So what Coldplay invariably fall back on is the disingenuous empathy of lines like , " Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely , too ? " and " Are you lost or incomplete ... can't find your missing piece ? " , lines feeding off the soul - carrion of the insecure and lonely while offering no solutions , merely crumbs of solace expanded to wedding - cake size by the musical monumentalism within which they 're set , so their fans can have their cake and eat themselves up at the same time .
Songs like " Trouble " , from their debut album Parachutes , and " In My Place " , from A Rush of Blood to the Head , are anthems of amorphous yearning designed to be as widely applicable as possible ; all - purpose wallows whose self - pitying , apologetic tone sounds utterly bogus .
When Martin sings , " If you go and leave me down here on my own , then I 'll wait for you " , it 's clear that we 're the ones missing out , that though he may be down , his smug self - sacrifice occupies the emotional high ground .
By 2005 's X & Y , the band had shifted slightly from outright self - pity to broader misgivings , a move marked by the shift from first - person to second - person in songs like " Fix You " and " A Message " , cunningly enlisting their audience as co-mopers through songs of solace articulating vague , windy concerns – " I 'm scared about the future and I want to talk to you " , " When you feel so tired and you can't sleep / Stuck in reverse " , etc – invariably resolved in mealy - mouthed platitudes like " I will try to fix you " and " You do n't have to be alone " .
There 's no real sense of grappling with the social or political causes of the problems , just a bland emotional poultice applied to the wound .
They 've become the sonic security - blanket for millions of fans , their tracks sweeping by with the epic solemnity of state funerals , their huge , heartbreaking chord changes sucker - punching you with emotional logic while sapping any anger or political engagement – in the existential sense – that you might otherwise experience .
Instead , Chris Martin offers a consoling arm around the shoulder and a nice cup of tea .
But rarely can a claim have been less borne out by circumstance than " I will fix you " : with Coldplay , it 's never more than cold comfort .
In this respect , the band 's name is one of the most appropriate in rock .
It 's redolent of pale complexions and dead emotions : whenever I hear it , it always evokes a glassy - eyed fish on a fishmonger 's slab , ice melting from its scales .
Ironically , it was coined by Tim Rice - Oxley , who had stopped using it for his own band as he considered it " too depressing " .
Rice - Oxley was apparently invited to join Coldplay , but instead chose Keane , which suggests a serious frying pan / fire interface .
Still , at least it was n't Snow Patrol or Athlete , the weediest of the Coldplay copyists trailing in the band 's wake .
Sometimes , it seems as if an entire generation of UK indie bands has been blighted by their slavish adoption of the Coldplay formula , with would - be anthemic hooks and choruses , gushing affectations of maudlin sincerity , and the sort of deracinated , wholefood ' n ' soymilk attitudes that are steadily strangling the life out of rock 'n'roll .
With luck , the wheel will turn again and drop them in the dumper , as it did with the laddish Oasis copyists that preceded them .
But at least Oasis promulgated the kind of spirit and energy that galvanises the soul , rather than the notion that all problems can be assuaged by impotent sympathy set to repetitive piano ostinatos .
The band 's political emptiness is most glaring in the ironically titled " Politik " , whose list of vague demands ( " Give me time and give me space , give me real do n't give me fake ... " ) and call to " open up your eyes " betray a dismal lack of political coherence .
They 're not entirely to blame , I concede , nor are they alone in their simpering revisionism : for just as Thatcherism brought a wave of arrogant , sod - you selfish celebrocracy to Eighties pop , so , too , did Blairism effectively wipe out the ideological component of modern pop , emptying it of grass - roots political impetus in favour of less troublesome , easily harnessed celebrity - gesture politics .
Not even Tony Blair , though , could be as bereft of driving principle as a band who sing – as Coldplay have – " I 'm going to buy a gun and start a war / If you can tell me something worth fighting for " .
So , just how long a list do you want , lads ?
On another , possibly longer , list , there 's plenty more to dislike about Coldplay – most of it , admittedly , concerning Chris Martin , the world 's least impressive rock star by virtually any criteria connected with rock 'n ' roll as we know it .
There 's the celebrity - spouse syndrome that casts Chris ' n '
Gwynnie as the scented - candle , low - fibre equivalent of Brad ' n '
Ange ; the scrubby non-beard that Chris Martin shares with Jensen Button ( have you ever seen the two of them together in the same place ? ) ; calling a child Apple , rather than , say , Veal ( far tastier , and less likely to get bullied at school ) ; and much more besides .
But for me , it 's the band 's anguished professions of supposed political concern , while simultaneously indulging the rampant self - pity of the most cosseted , comfortable constituency of music fans the world has ever known – that 's the most irritating aspect of Coldplay .
Rock 'n 'roll used to be a rallying cry , a clarion call ; now , in their hands , it 's just a palliative .

You already knew that watching movies like Jumper or the Planet of the Apes remake makes your brain hurt , but now neuroscientists have proof .
When you watch a great movie , your brain marches in lockstep with the brains of the other viewers .
Terrible movies invoke synaptic chaos .
Could filmmakers use this knowledge to create movies that intentionally tap into your neural responses ?

A bunch of scientists at New York University made their test subjects watch several movies while recording their brain patterns with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI - basically like stop - motion MRI ) .
We checked , and none of the scientists was named Dr. Clayton Forrester or TV's Frank .
In any case , the subjects watched a Hitchcock movie , a portion of The Good , the Bad and the Ugly and an episode of " Curb Your Enthusiasm . "
They also watched unedited footage of a concert in a park as a control .
The results showed that the brain patterns of subjects watching a " good " movie ( Hitchcock ) were remarkably similar - 65 percent similar , in fact .
The number diminished slightly with The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , and further for the sitcom , with similarity bottoming out with the raw footage ( around 5 percent ) .
The researchers did not test the subjects with Monster A Go - Go or Star Force : Fugitive Alien II , but then they probably would n't have been able to get informed consent .

For two years , authorities said , a mother subjected her son to what veteran detectives described as shocking , ritualistic abuse .
The 5 - year - old was hung by his hands and wrists from a door jamb and beaten with some sort of leash or chain , police said .
He was routinely denied food and water , burned with cigarettes on his body and genitals , and left to sit in his own urine and feces .
In the past few weeks , his hands were held to a hot stove , according to Capt .
Fabian Lizarraga , causing injuries that may leave them permanently disfigured .
Starkeisha Brown , the boy ’s 24 - year - old mother , allegedly committed the acts for about two years without detection -- until a bizarre series of events last week .
Advertisement
“ It causes you to question the humanity of some people , ” Assistant Police Chief Earl Paysinger said about the abuse .
“ Whether they have a heart or a soul . ”
It started with an anonymous tip to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services saying there was a problem at the South Los Angeles apartment near 110th and Figueroa streets .
On Monday , June 9 , Brown and her live - in girlfriend , Krystal Matthews , 19 , were ordered to a children services office along with the boy to discuss the allegation of abuse .
Instead , the pair left the abused boy with a complete stranger and attended the meeting with a healthy - looking 4 - year - old they said was Brown ’s son , along with a girl of about 6 , authorities said .
Police said they are trying to determine those children ’s identities .

They told the stranger , “ ‘ Watch him for us . ’
They said ‘ We ’ll be right back , ’ ” Lizarraga said .
While the women were being interviewed , the stranger who had been asked to watch the boy started asking people in the neighborhood what he should do with the 5 - year - old , who looked sickly and injured .
Eventually someone called authorities .
Officials got word of the boy ’s condition as they were interviewing Brown and Matthews and began asking more pointed questions and challenging the pair ’s story , Lizarraga said .
Halfway through the interview the two women sprinted from the office , abandoning the 4 - year - old and his sister at the office , police said .
Advertisement
“ They realize that no one is buying their ruse , ” said Lt. Vincent Neglia of the LAPD ’s Abused Child Unit , and “ they bug out . ”
Lizarraga said it was fortunate that the stranger sought help .
He “ had the sense that something was not right , that the situation he had been placed in was not right , ” the captain said .
Had Brown brought in her own son , the social worker would have seen a child with a pot belly suggestive of severe malnutrition , burns across his body in various stages of healing , bruises , and badly damaged and burned hands , Neglia said .
Some scars appeared to be fairly old .
“ This was n’t just one big beating , ” Neglia said .
“ You can tell by the different stages of injuries that this was prolonged . ”
Advertisement
Police said the most severe malnourishment occurred in the last two to three months .
Authorities launched a hunt for Brown and Matthews while authorities took the child to a hospital where he remains .
The boy was in guarded condition through last week , but is beginning to show signs of improvement , authorities said .
Matthews was arrested Friday and Brown turned herself in to police on Saturday .
Advertisement
They were arrested on multiple charges , including suspicion of torture , and the pair are scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday .
Both women have a history of crime and violence .
According to court documents , Matthews was sentenced to three years probation earlier this year for assault with a deadly weapon .
The boy ’s mother served a total of two and a half years in prison for two separate convictions : one for felony robbery of an elderly woman in 2003 and later for petty theft , when she and another woman stole a bracelet and other items from a Macy ’s department store .
Most recently , Brown was incarcerated from March 2006 to January 2007 .
During that period , the boy was in the custody of relatives , authorities said .
Advertisement
Police said the bulk of the abuse appeared to begin when Brown was released on probation .
Neglia said that Brown ’s probation officer recently had a hard time locating her because she was not living at her listed address .
Children services officials , citing confidentiality rules , would not disclose why the boy was returned to his mother after she was released from prison and whether appropriate checks on the boy ’s welfare were made , given that she was on probation .
DCFS spokesperson Stuart Riskin said there were about 160,000 calls each year to the agency ’s child protection hotline .
Advertisement
In the South Los Angeles neighborhood where Brown and Matthews lived with the boy , neighbors said they were shocked to hear of the abuse and some said they were angered it had not been reported earlier .
“ Everybody ’s furious , ” said Katherine Irvin , who recently moved into an adjacent house she said was abandoned by a group of men .
“ They must ’ve heard something . ”
Detectives said Monday that they were still trying to determine why a mother would so badly abuse her son .
“ So far we have not come up with the answer , ” Lizarraga said .
“ Our victim was not on anybody ’s radar , either law enforcement or DCFS .
He was n’t in the system ; there was no recent [ reported ] abuse that could be seen , ” he said .
Advertisement
Since reports of the abuse became public , dozens of people have called police and social service agencies looking for ways to help the boy , authorities said .
One elderly woman called police to see if she could donate her most recent Social Security check , authorities said .
Those interested in contributing can contact Michael Wrice with the DCFS at 213-739-6202 .

( CNN ) -- The U.S. Coast Guard closed 98 miles of the Mississippi River from New Orleans , Louisiana , southward after a fuel barge and a tanker collided early Wednesday , spilling more than 400,000 gallons of fuel oil .
Coast Guard personnel try to contain a fuel oil spill in the Mississippi River in New Orleans on Wednesday .
The closure -- on what is a major shipping route between the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico -- could last days , and the cleanup could take weeks , said Capt .
Lincoln Stroh , the Coast Guard chief in New Orleans .
The collision between the Liberian - flagged chemical tanker Tintomara and the barge pushed by the tug Mel Oliver happened about 1:30 a.m.
Wednesday , splitting the barge nearly in half and dumping more than 419,000 gallons of oil into the river , the Coast Guard said .
The accident happened just north of the massive bridges connecting downtown New Orleans to the west bank of the Mississippi , the Coast Guard said .
The tanker was undamaged .
See a map of where the spill happened »
The Coast Guard said Wednesday evening that the tug had no properly licensed crew on board at the time of the collision .
No injuries were reported , and the National Transportation Safety Board said it has dispatched investigators to look into the accident .
The accident left a sheen of oil over much of the river and its banks .
Booms were deployed to contain the oil , and skimmers are being used to suck it off the surface , said Petty Officer Thomas Blue , a Coast Guard spokesman .
Watch scenes from the oil spill »
The spill is much smaller than the ones that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , when the Coast Guard estimated that more than 7 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Mississippi and nearby waterways .
But Wilma Subra , a chemist who advises the Louisiana Environmental Action Network , said the oil could affect wildlife and work its way up the food chain into residents , many of whom fish for subsistence .
" This is a spill that occurred in a very urban area , and it can impact a very large number of people , " she said .
The oil , widely used as marine fuel , is heavier than diesel but lighter than crude , and it is likely to stick to rocks , trees and wildlife , Stroh said .
" Some will evaporate with sunlight , but there will be residuals in the waterway which need to be cleaned up , " he said .
However , State Department of Environmental Quality officials said the oil is so thick that it could sink , which would complicate the cleanup , the Times - Picayune of New Orleans reported .
The Mississippi is the primary source of drinking water for the region , and workers have deployed booms around intakes for local water systems , said Paul Book , the head of the cleanup effort for barge owners American Commercial Lines .
Water intakes in the oil spill area -- those for Algiers , Gretna , St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish -- were closed to prevent contamination , though residents there still could get water through their taps because of reserve supplies , the Times - Picayune reported .
A swifter - than - normal current quickly drew the slick downstream .
The Coast Guard initially closed 29 miles of the river but expanded that to 98 miles by Wednesday evening , the service said .
The heavy , sticky oil left a " real strong " smell hanging over much of downtown New Orleans , said Carl Bauder , who runs a barber shop near the foot of Canal Street .
The Coast Guard 's closure of traffic shut down commuter ferries across the river , said Bauder , who lives in the West Bank neighborhood of Algiers .
" [ The oil has ] done a lot of damage to our Moonwalk area and down by the aquarium , " he said .
Department of Environmental Quality officials said they did n't believe breathing the air near the river would be a problem , adding that emergency personnel were checking the air with portable monitors and had n't found dangerous hydrocarbon levels , the Times - Picayune reported .
New Orleans is among the largest U.S. ports .
More than 30 ships were queued early Wednesday afternoon , waiting to pass through the closed zone , Coast Guard spokeswoman Jaclyn Young said .
Ships approaching the mouth of the river from the Gulf of Mexico were being asked to stay out , Stroh said .

Summary
The term " In God We Trust " was first put on U.S. currency during the Civil War , 88 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence .
It was done as a political maneuver to remind waring factions that they had much in common , including their belief in God .
As evidenced below , there has always been pressure to promote specific religions in currency , and the U.S. went out of its way to avoid the promotion of any particular religion .
It took another hundred years later for " In God We Trust " to appear on paper money , and again , this was for political purposes , in the 1960s during the era of " MCarthyism " when a big fear over " Godless Communism " was sweeping the nation and causing all sorts of unpleasant and embarrassing government activities .
Even if you erroneously presuppose that the nation was intended to be founded on Godly beliefs , the motto , " In God We Trust " in no way endorses Christianity over any other religion such as Judaism or Islam .
The inclusion of this motto , like many acts of Congress , was the result of political maneuvering , with the specific intent in this case to quell unrest at a time of civil war .
This story is similar to the One Nation Under God story , where references to religious beliefs were introduced into society much later , in response to the current political climate ( at that time , the Cold War with largely non-religious Russia ) .
US Treasury Statement
From the US Treasury Site [ 1 ]
The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on United States coins largely because of the increased religious sentiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase received many appeals from devout persons throughout the country , urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins .
From Treasury Department records , it appears that the first such appeal came in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 .
It was written to Secretary Chase by Rev. M. R. Watkinson , Minister of the Gospel from Ridleyville , Pennsylvania , and read :
Dear Sir :
You are about to submit your annual report to the Congress respecting the affairs of the national finances .
One fact touching our currency has hitherto been seriously overlooked .
I mean the recognition of the Almighty God in some form on our coins .
You are probably a Christian .
What if our Republic were not shattered beyond reconstruction ?
Would not the antiquaries of succeeding centuries rightly reason from our past that we were a heathen nation ?
What I propose is that instead of the goddess of liberty we shall have next inside the 13 stars a ring inscribed with the words PERPETUAL UNION ; within the ring the allseeing eye , crowned with a halo ; beneath this eye the American flag , bearing in its field stars equal to the number of the States united ; in the folds of the bars the words GOD , LIBERTY , LAW .
This would make a beautiful coin , to which no possible citizen could object .
This would relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism .
This would place us openly under the Divine protection we have personally claimed .
From my hearth I have felt our national shame in disowning God as not the least of our present national disasters .
To you first I address a subject that must be agitated .
As a result , Secretary Chase instructed James Pollock , Director of the Mint at Philadelphia , to prepare a motto , in a letter dated November 20 , 1861 :
Dear Sir :
No nation can be strong except in the strength of God , or safe except in His defense .
The trust of our people in God should be declared on our national coins .
You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest and tersest words possible this national recognition .
It was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18 , 1837 , prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States .
This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress .
In December 1863 , the Director of the Mint submitted designs for new one - cent coin , two - cent coin , and three - cent coin to Secretary Chase for approval .
He proposed that upon the designs either OUR COUNTRY ; OUR GOD or GOD , OUR TRUST should appear as a motto on the coins .
In a letter to the Mint Director on December 9 , 1863 , Secretary Chase stated :
I approve your mottoes , only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR , so as to read OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY .
And on that with the shield , it should be changed so as to read : IN GOD WE TRUST .
The Congress passed the Act of April 22 , 1864 .
This legislation changed the composition of the one - cent coin and authorized the minting of the two - cent coin .
The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary .
IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two - cent coin .
Another Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 .
It allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that " shall admit the inscription thereon . "
Under the Act , the motto was placed on the gold double - eagle coin , the gold eagle coin , and the gold half - eagle coin .
It was also placed on the silver dollar coin , the half - dollar coin and the quarter - dollar coin , and on the nickel three - cent coin beginning in 1866 .
Later , Congress passed the Coinage Act of February 12 , 1873 .
It also said that the Secretary " may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto . "
The use of IN GOD WE TRUST has not been uninterrupted .
The motto disappeared from the five - cent coin in 1883 , and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938 .
Since 1938 , all United States coins bear the inscription .
Later , the motto was found missing from the new design of the double - eagle gold coin and the eagle gold coin shortly after they appeared in 1907 .
In response to a general demand , Congress ordered it restored , and the Act of May 18 , 1908 , made it mandatory on all coins upon which it had previously appeared .
IN GOD WE TRUST was not mandatory on the one - cent coin and five - cent coin .
It could be placed on them by the Secretary or the Mint Director with the Secretary 's approval .
The motto has been in continuous use on the one - cent coin since 1909 , and on the ten - cent coin since 1916 .
It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins , half - dollar coins , and quarter - dollar coins struck since July 1 , 1908 .
A law passed by the 84th Congress ( P.L. 84-140 ) and approved by the President on July 30 , 1956 , the President approved a Joint Resolution of the 84th Congress , declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States .
IN GOD WE TRUST was first used on paper money in 1957 , when it appeared on the one - dollar silver certificate .
The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1 , 1957 .
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( BEP ) was converting to the dry intaglio printing process .
During this conversion , it gradually included IN GOD WE TRUST in the back design of all classes and denominations of currency .
As a part of a comprehensive modernization program the BEP successfully developed and installed new high - speed rotary intaglio printing presses in 1957 .
These allowed BEP to print currency by the dry intaglio process , 32 notes to the sheet .
One - dollar silver certificates were the first denomination printed on the new high - speed presses .
They included IN GOD WE TRUST as part of the reverse design as BEP adopted new dies according to the law .
The motto also appeared on one - dollar silver certificates of the 1957 - A and 1957 - B series .
BEP prints United States paper currency by an intaglio process from engraved plates .
It was necessary , therefore , to engrave the motto into the printing plates as a part of the basic engraved design to give it the prominence it deserved .
One - dollar silver certificates series 1935 , 1935 - A , 1935 - B , 1935 - C , 1935 - D , 1935 - E , 1935 - F , 1935 - G , and 1935 - H were all printed on the older flat - bed presses by the wet intaglio process .
P.L. 84-140 recognized that an enormous expense would be associated with immediately replacing the costly printing plates .
The law allowed BEP to gradually convert to the inclusion of IN GOD WE TRUST on the currency .
Accordingly , the motto is not found on series 1935 - E and 1935 - F one - dollar notes .
By September 1961 , IN GOD WE TRUST had been added to the back design of the Series 1935 - G notes .
Some early printings of this series do not bear the motto .
IN GOD WE TRUST appears on all series 1935 - H one - dollar silver certificates .
Below is a listing by denomination of the first production and delivery dates for currency bearing IN GOD WE TRUST :
DENOMINATION PRODUCTION DELIVERY $ 1 Federal Reserve Note February 12 , 1964 March 11 , 1964 $ 5 United States Note January 23 , 1964 March 2 , 1964 $ 5 Federal Reserve Note July 31 , 1964 September 16 , 1964 $ 10 Federal Reserve Note February 24 , 1964 April 24 , 1964 $ 20 Federal Reserve Note October 7 , 1964 October 7 , 1964 $ 50 Federal Reserve Note August 24 , 1966 September 28 , 1966 $ 100 Federal Reserve Note August 18 , 1966 September 27 , 1966
Analysis
It 's important to note that at the time of adoption of the the motto , " In God We Trust " on U.S. Currency , the nation was in a state of civil war .
One major reason for accepting this motto involved encouraging fighting states to recognize that both the North and the South felt God was on their side , and this was a means of trying to heal the divide .
It 's also worth nothing that the currency merely mentions " God " which is very ambiguous and in no way an endorsement of any specific religion .
It 's highly doubtful the country or Congress , even during a time of war amongst itself , would have ever specifically mentioned " Christianity " or " Jesus " in such a manner .

Here 's a memo from newly titled " senior strategist for communications and message " Robert Gibbs painting McCain in the deep purple of confusion .
The self - professed candidate of “ straight talk ” and “ experience ” spent today changing his position on gay adoption , adopting Senator Obama ’s position that we need more troops in Afghanistan after having resisted taking that position , flip flopping on whether he ’d send U.S. or NATO troops ( he actually offered three different explanations on where those additional troops would come from ) , and referring to a country that has n’t existed since 1992 for the second time in two days .
Afghanistan
LAST WEEK : Christian Science Monitor Reported that McCain “ Has Resisted Calls For More Troops In Afghanistan . ”
“ McCain has resisted calls for more troops in Afghanistan and has rejected criticism that the Iraq war is detracting from efforts to secure Afghanistan .
He labeled Barack Obama ‘ naïve ’ for saying he'd strike terrorist targets in Pakistan with or without the cooperation of President Pervez Musharraf .
…
Aides to the Arizona senator said Wednesday that he continued to view success in Iraq as the best chance for victory in the global war on terror .
‘ As on many things , Senator Obama is not listening to our commanders , and Senator McCain is , ’ says Kori Schake , a senior policy adviser to McCain .
‘ General David Petraeus believes Iraq is the central front in the war on terror .
Al Qaeda has even said it is .’ … Ms. Schake 's comments came about two hours after Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said additional troops were needed in Afghanistan but that too many were tied down in Iraq to send more . ”
[ Christian Science Monitor , 7/7/08 ]
TODAY ( MORNING ) : McCain Called for Sending Three Additional Brigades to Afghanistan and Suggests They Would Come From Iraq .
According to a press release issued by the McCain campaign on Tuesday morning , McCain would announce in a speech that he now supports sending at least three additional brigades to Afghanistan :
“ The status quo in Afghanistan is unacceptable , and from the moment the next President walks into the Oval Office , he will face critical decisions about Afghanistan .
… John McCain Supports Sending At Least Three Additional Brigades To Afghanistan .
Our commanders on the ground say they need these troops , and thanks to the success of the surge , these forces are becoming available , and our commanders in Afghanistan must get them . ”

“ Speaking to reporters on his bus after today 's speech , McCain indicated that he'd be open to those additional troops coming from NATO . ” [ MSNBC , 7/15/08 ]
TODAY ( EVEN LATER IN THE AFTERNOON ) : McCain Campaign Further Clarifies Proposal , Saying The Troop Increase Would Be Comprised Of Both NATO And US Forces .
“ McCain spokeswoman Nicolle Wallace said later that U.S. troops will compose some of the additional brigades McCain would send to Afghanistan , but not all of them .
‘ Will we contribute ?
Of course we will , ’ she said . ”

GAY ADOPTION
SUNDAY : New York Times Quoted McCain Saying That He Does n’t Believe In Gay Adoption .
“ Mr. McCain , who with his wife , Cindy , has an adopted daughter , said flatly that he opposed allowing gay couples to adopt .
‘ I think that we ’ve proven that both parents are important in the success of a family so , no , I do n’t believe in gay adoption , ’ he said . ”
[ New York Times , 7/13/08 ]
TODAY : McCain Campaign Clarified Position ; Said It Was A State Issue And That McCain Believes “ Caring Parental Figures Are Better For The Child Than The Alternative . ”
“ On Tuesday , as criticism of McCain 's comments spread , his campaign elaborated on the candidate 's views .
‘ John McCain could have been clearer in the interview in stating that his position on gay adoption is that it is a state issue .
...
He was not endorsing any federal legislation , ’ a campaign statement said .
‘ Sen. McCain 's expressed his personal preference for children to be raised by a mother and a father wherever possible , ’ the statement added .
‘ However , as an adoptive father himself , McCain believes children deserve loving and caring home environments , and he recognizes that there are many abandoned children who have yet to find homes .
John McCain believes that in those situations that caring parental figures are better for the child than the alternative . ’ ”

Czechoslovakia
For the Second Day In A Row , McCain Refers to Czechoslovakia – A Country That No Longer Exists .
As MSNBC noted , “ For the second time in two days , McCain has made a reference to ‘ Czechoslovakia . ’
His answers were about contemporary events , not history .
McCain did not use the current name Czech Republic , the country formed in January 1993 when Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
The first instance was yesterday during a media news availability and the second today during a town hall meeting . ”
[ MSNBC ’s First Read ,
7/15/08 , http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/07/15/1200003.aspx]
ABC News Noted That This Is n’t The First Time McCain Has Mistakenly Referred to Czechoslovakia .
“ In early 2000 , then - Gov. George W. Bush told Roger Simon , then with U.S. News & World Report , that he was befuddled by how soft the media was on Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz .
‘ I do n't think there is any plot ; I hope there is n't , ’ Bush said .
" But it 's an amazing phenomenon , I 'll tell you that .
It 's like the flap over the foreign - leader deal .
A guy gets up and quizzes me -- it 's my fault for trying to answer -- but John McCain says something about the ' ambassador to Czechoslovakia . '
Well , I know there is no Czechoslovakia ( there 's a Czech Republic and a Slovakia ) , but yet it did n't make the nightly national news .
I 'm not going to gripe about it , but the media question is starting to pop up . ’
Apparently that Czechoslovakia lesson never took , because McCain keeps making that mistake , eight years later . ”

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Every once in a while most of us will go through what psychologists and philosophers call an existential crisis .
It can happen to anyone at any moment of their lives even when things seem to be going normal from the outside .
Many people use the phrase existential crisis without even knowing if they ’re going through one , so we ’ve made a list to help you identify the signs that you or maybe a closed one is going through an existential crisis .
1 ) You Feel You ’re Losing Your Identity
Experiencing an existential crisis means that you either miss the person you used to be or that you ’re wondering how your life would be different if you had done something different in your past .
Maybe you feel you do n’t know yourself as much as you used to or you feel a stranger in your skin or feel like a puppet and someone else is moving the strings .
This can lead to feelings of guilty and anxiety for loosing your identity .
2 ) Things Seem To Have Lost Meaning
The coffee you loved has no taste , your favorite movie seems dull , and your current job brings no life satisfaction .
The things that made your life had meaning are now so boring that you begin to wonder what got you into those things in the first place .
This can also apply to close relationships with friends , family members and your lover .
3 ) You Worry Too Much
It ’s normal to worry from time to time , but when it becomes excessive worry you can end up feeling overwhelmed and anxious .
Your small worries have intensified to existential worries about your job , your partner , your skills , your life and your hobbies .
You worry about things like :
Whether you chose the right partner
If you actually have a future in your career
If you ’ve made the right decisions this far
These worries intensify as you get deeper into this state , and they can make you see your life from a negative perspective .
4 ) You ’ve Lost Motivation
Living your life has never felt heavier before .
Every step you make takes up a lot of energy from you .
Even the smallest chores seem demanding , like brushing your teeth , doing your bed and washing the dishes .
You are not as motivated as before and your body energy is n’t helping .
5 ) Death Becomes A Common Concern
You have started to think about dead more than usual .
You feel you can die at any moment and that all your life will be gone in a second .
This is the moment where you start wondering what have you done so far in your life because you are not really afraid of death , you ’re afraid of dying without a real contribution to the human kind .
6 ) It Feels Like You ’re Wasting Your Time
Time flies by all of us .
We wish we could just pause it and live eternally , but we can ’t .
You feel that every second must be lived doing something remarkable and incredible and when you do n’t do so you feel useless and a waste of oxygen .
These feelings can bring doubt and fear to your already troubled experience .
Should We Worry About It ?
Existential crisis can lead to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression if they ’re not treated on time and properly .
Now that you can ( for the most part ) identify if you or someone you love is going this ordeal , the next step is to devise a plan to deal with the existential crisis and overcome it .
The Paradox Of Too Much Freedom
It may sound paradoxical , but having too much freedom can be overwhelming .
Since there are many ways you can live your life it is inevitable that at some point of it you wonder if you made the right choices , you ’re not crazy , you ’re a rational human .
Every option has its downsides .
You think you ’d be happier in a different town or with a different job but that is only because you ’ve only seen the surface , but if you had the opportunity to live in this reality you ’ll see that is just as difficult as the one you ’re living .
You feel your life has no meaning because you are the protagonist , you are only focusing on yourself and are not seeing the big picture .
The thing is that you will always feel a little dissatisfied from time to time no matter what life choices you make .
That ’s human nature after all .
You feel like your life has no meaning because you are only focusing on yourself and your goals .
If you focus on the advances that humanity has made , you ’ll realize how much we have advanced as a group , and that has happened because of the millions of lives that did ordinary things .
After all you are alive because your ancestors chose to raise children , make a living and stay healthy .
Our presence on this planet is limited and there is very little time to do everything we would like to do .
Life can mean whatever you want it to mean , looking for meaning is what gives life meaning after all .
In a million years all your friends will be dead and no one will remember your name , so enjoy the very little time you have , learn to appreciate the big picture , and do n’t worry about feeling you ’re not making a contribution .
As long as you make a decent amount of money , you have a few people that care for you and you live in a good enough city you will be just fine .
About Those Companies Brought Down by Rumors . . .
Here 's a question I 'm curious about :
We 've heard from oh - so - many people how whisper campaigns have brought down so many firms like Bear Stearns ( BSC ) and Indy Mac ( IMB ) and Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) and now Lehman Brothers ( LEH ) .
Why is it that all these rumor - mongerers and shorts are only bringing some firms to their knees ?
How come they always seem to be the over - leveraged , under - capitalized , unhedged , most poorly - managed companies ?
Is n't it funny that all of the firms that are the subject of such rumors have so many similar characteristics ?
Bear and Lehman and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and AIG and . . . the list goes on and on .
Why is it never the firms with strong balance sheets , good business models , making lots of profits ?
Why are n't we terrified that these powerful shorts go after Intel ( INTC ) or Google ( GOOG ) or Apple ( AAPL ) or Berkshire ( BRK ) or GE or Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) ?
Or is that merely a funny and unexplainable coincidence ?
According to Jamie Dimon , a whispering campaign can bring down a firm .
Vanity Fair blames shorts and CNBC .
If that 's true , why not go short Bear AFTER it fell 100 ?
Why not go after a really big firm , with lots of room on the downside to make even more money ?
Perhaps an alternative explanation is in order .
Yesterday 's pasting of Lehman ( LEH ) was based on a rumor that Pacific Investment Management Co. ( aka PIMCO ) , manager of the world 's biggest bond fund , and SAC Capital , one of the world 's largest and most actively trading hedge fund , were backing away from the firm .
Both came out and reaffirmed that they were still Lehman customers -- but it had the feel to me of a manoeuvre , and not a true and full disclosure .
My best guess :
We are likely to find out what the full truth is some time from now .
How much does anyone want to bet me that we will find out in a few quarters that each of these firms were cutting back a big chunk of their business with Lehman ?
Any takers ?

HP 's new laptop joins new breed of ultralights HP 's svelte new offering is rugged and priced to sell

Hewlett - Packard is jumping into the emerging low - cost , ultra- portable notebook market with a laptop designed for students and frequent travelers .
HP introduced the 2133 Mini-Note PC , a 2.6 - pound aluminum - clad laptop , which starts at $ 499 for a Linux operating system and $ 599 for Windows Vista .
The device , which comes with an 8.9 - inch high - resolution screen and keyboard slimmed down by 8 percent , will be available through HP 's corporate sales channels , HP.com and other online stores and will ship on April 15 .
The Mini-Note is part of a new breed of lightweight , low - cost laptops designed for users who want easy portability and Internet access without a large price tag .
Taiwanese PC manufacturer
Asus helped shine a light on the category last year with the introduction of the Eee PC , a line of compact notebooks starting at $ 300 .
ASUS estimates that it will sell 5 million Eee PCs by the end of the year .
Other PC vendors such as Acer are expected to unveil their own ultra-portables in summer .
Last week at its Developer Forum , Intel showed off its new power - efficient Atom processors , which will power upcoming light laptops called netbooks .
" You can see from the success of the Eee PC , it looks like 2008 will be the year of the ultra- portable device , " said Michael Gartenberg , an analyst with Jupiter Research .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The HP Mini-Note will be marketed to school districts looking to outfit their students with laptops , as well as business travelers looking for a convenient companion device .
HP executives hope the Mini-Note will drive sales with those two groups through its basic features , which also include a 1.2 - GHz processor , 1 GB of memory , a 120 - GB hard drive , an internal collision guard that protects the drive when the laptop is dropped , and a Webcam that comes standard in the Windows edition .
Technology analyst Rob Enderle said HP 's move into ultra-portables will help set an early bar for rivals in terms of price and performance .
" This is hugely aggressive for HP because this is will establish a new price range for small notebooks , " Enderle said .
" We 've had $ 400 to $ 500 laptops before , but they were big and heavy and you did n't want to give it to your child .
This is a real laptop computer , not a crippled box . "
At least 13,000 people protested in Seoul , police say
South Korean police have used water cannon to disperse thousands of people in the capital Seoul protesting against the resumption of US beef imports .
The protests took place as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice insisted in Seoul that US beef was safe to eat .
South Korea suspended US beef imports in 2003 after a case of mad cow disease , or BSE , was identified there .
Earlier this week , it formally lifted the ban , allowing shipments of meat from young US cattle .
An agreement on ending the ban was reached in April and it was due to be lifted in May , but this was twice postponed as protests continued , despite reassurances that US meat was safe .
Anger
At least 13,000 people demonstrated in Seoul on Saturday , police said .

The police erected barricades , using buses to prevent the protesters from marching towards the presidential office .
" We do n't need US troops , we do n't need US mad cows , " read some of the slogans .
Public anger in South Korea remains high at what is perceived by many as the government 's readiness to cave into Washington and ignore health concerns .
The latest protest came as Ms Rice was visiting Seoul .
" I can only say that American beef is safe and that we hope in time the South Korean people will listen to that , and will be willing to listen to what their government is saying and what we are saying , " Ms Rice said .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters Life ! ) -
As if rising gasoline prices were n’t enough , motorists are being hit by higher parking charges , with London coming up tops as the world ’s most expensive city to park your car , according to a survey .

Parking your car in the City , London ’s financial district , costs on average $ 68.07 a day , or $ 1,166.87 a month , while parking in the popular West End entertainment district cost $ 1,135.76 month , according to an annual survey by real estate firm Colliers International that was conducted in June .
Sydney , Australia , came in second , with parking costing $ 774.76 a month , closely followed by Hong Kong at $ 742.40 a month .
Perth , also in Australia , was fourth at $ 610.42 a month .
In the United States , New York City ’s Midtown was the priciest place to park at $ 585 a month , followed by the city ’s Downtown at $ 462 a month .
“ We continue to observe a direct correlation between the rising cost of monthly parking and the ongoing strength of the office real estate market , ” said Ross Moore , director of market and economic research at Colliers International .
“ This dearth of parking and accompanying rise in cost , coupled with skyrocketing fuel prices exacerbates the everyday headaches faced by commuters . ”
The Colliers survey tracked 64 downtown areas in the United States and Canada as well as 74 cities in Europe , the Middle East , Africa , Asia and Latin America .
In Europe , Stockholm was the second most expensive place to park after London ( $ 508.92 a month ) while Santiago , Chile was Latin America ’s priciest place at $ 200 a month .
In the Middle East and Africa , Tel Aviv , Israel and the Gulf city of Dubai were tied at the top spot with monthly parking costing $ 198.48 while Cape Town , South Africa , came in second at $ 137.77 a month .
And if you ’re looking for the world ’s cheapest place to park , head to Jakarta , the car - clogged capital of Indonesia , where monthly parking costs a mere $ 26.07 .

Wikipedia defines an aquitard as " an impermeable layer along an aquifer . "
It 's not clear to us how that translates into bicycle helmets and spandex , but it must make sense to Sarah Crane , who submitted this photo with the note , " We are aquitards .
Our super power is the ability to stop water . "
The CIA is set to confirm to Congress that the Syrian installation destroyed by Israel last September was a nuclear reactor .
The CIA - the US Central Intelligence Agency - is set to confirm that the Syrian installation destroyed by Israel on September 6 , 2007 was a nuclear reactor .
CIA representatives will brief members of a Congressional intelligence subcommittee .
The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that the installation was meant to produce plutonium , and was partially funded by North Korea .
Israel bombed the reactor before it attained its planned capacity to manufacture plutonium for nuclear weapons , the CIA says .
The Congressional subcommittee session is to deal with Syrian - North Korean relations , amidst reports that a possible deal is in the works to remove North Korea from the American list of of state sponsors of terrorism .
At the presentation at Congress , which will be repeated afterwards to reporters , the intelligence officials will show video images showing Korean faces among the workers at the Syrian plant .
Other pictures show what appears to be the construction of a reactor vessel inside the building .
Shortly after the Israel attack , Syria bulldozed the area and constructed a new building there , which it has not allowed foreign visitors to enter .
Israel , the U.S. and Syria have never divulged details about the attack , and today 's presentation is a major departure from this policy .
Israel is reportedly not happy with the change , fearing that it will revive the tensions between Syria and Israel .
Syrian media reported on Wednesday that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has agreed in principle to hand over the entire Golan Heights to Syria .
Syrian Immigration Minister Boutina Sha'ban confirmed the reports , while Olmert 's office was silent .
Two years ago , Olmert said , " As long as I serve as prime minister , the Golan Heights will remain in our hands because it is an integral part of the State of Israel . "
He was quoted in Israeli newspapers as reported by the French news agency AFP .
Nationalist Knesset Members said Olmert was recklessly endangering Israel with his consent to give away the strategic heights .

Technology is supposed to make life easier , but it does n't seem that way when you 're struggling to wrangle 289 new e-mail messages , dealing with a hard - drive crash , or suddenly realizing that you left an important file on the office computer .
Thankfully , plenty of tools can help .
We 'll tell you which ones are worth trying , and we 'll also suggest some practices that you can incorporate into your workday to use tech tools more effectively and efficiently .
1. Telecommute by Remotely Controlling Your Office Computer
You can work from home -- but use the computer in your office -- through remote control software such as LogMeIn ( free version available ) or TightVNC ( free ) .
You can view the remote computer full screen , launch and close programs , read e-mail , copy and paste text between PCs , and access any files you left behind .
Save money on gas , claim home equipment on your taxes , and convince your boss that you 'll be more productive without leaving your house .
Even the iPhone has some VNC clients , such as Mocha VNC and Teleport .
If you do n't need full remote control but you do require access to your office or home files , set up Microsoft 's free file - syncing tool , FolderShare .
Your files will always be up - to - date , no matter where you 're working or where you last updated them .
2. Schedule Automatic Hard - Drive Backups , Locally and Remotely
Backing up your critical files is as exciting as purchasing home insurance , but just as important , too .
Do n't risk losing your irreplaceable digital photos by making empty promises to yourself to burn a couple of DVDs every few months .
Instead , set up software and services to do the job for you while you concentrate on more - exciting projects .
First , save yourself from an " OMG my hard drive crashed ! " catastrophe with a top backup program .
Or get started now with a free copy of SyncBackSE , and schedule regular backup jobs to your external FireWire drive , thumb drive , or network drive .
( If you have FTP - server access , SyncBack can back up to that as well . )
Of course , local backup is n't enough .
To protect your data against fire , lightning , theft , or other disasters , you want to back up your data to a remote server over the Internet .
Both Carbonite and Mozy Home offer affordable unlimited server space and utilities that quietly back up your data in the background while you work .
3. Work Faster and More Efficiently Without a Mouse
Streamline your computer work by teaching yourself keyboard shortcuts for your common actions , such as Ctrl - S to save , Ctrl - T to open a new tab in Firefox , and Ctrl - C and Ctrl - V to copy and paste ( see our list of additional shortcuts ) .
Then , become a keyboard master with the help of a keyboard launcher such as the free Launchy ( Windows ) or Quicksilver ( Mac ) .
You can start programs , open documents , and even do advanced actions such as resizing images and moving files without moving your hands from the keyboard .
You can also assign key combinations that automatically type out common phrases -- such as user names , passwords , addresses , and e-mail signatures -- with utilities like TypeItIn ( Windows ) or TypeIt4Me ( Mac OS X ) .
4. Lose Weight , Get Fit , Save Money , and Increase Your Mileage Online
A new crop of social self - improvement sites help you monitor how much you 've eaten , exercised , and spent , to motivate you and keep you on track .
Web services such as FitDay and Weight Watchers log and guide your diet and fitness regimen .
If Quicken or Microsoft Money has become too complicated to update , you can track your spending , balance your checkbook , and run charts on expenditures versus income at personal - finance sites Mint.com and Wesabe .
As for your car , avoid online gas scams .
Additionally , you can squeeze the last bit of mileage out of every expensive tank of gas with a miles - per - gallon tracker like Fuelly or MyMileMarker .
Entering your information into such sites gets you personalized suggestions , comparisons , and a community of like - minded people who can offer support and suggestions .
5. Clear Out Your Inbox Every Day
Beat e-mail overload once and for all by emptying your inbox completely -- and keeping it that way .
The " Inbox Zero " philosophy says that e-mail messages are just calls to action -- not clutter that we need to hang on to .
Create three folders or labels in your e-mail client : Action , Later , and Archive .
Each day when you check your e-mail , make a decision and do something with every new message you 've received until you 've moved them all out of your inbox and reduced your message count down to zero .
Ruthlessly delete the messages you do n't need , on the spot .
Respond to the ones that will take under 2 minutes .
File messages that you want to keep for future reference in the Archive folder , those that will take longer than 2 minutes to reply to in Action ( and add those to - do items to your list ) , and messages you need to follow up on at a subsequent date ( such as Amazon shipment notifications ) in Later .
Then breathe a sigh of relief when you see that glorious declaration : ' You have no new mail .
'
Joe Stiglitz is a very smart man , perhaps the most prolific economic theorist of his generation .
His book Whither Socialism ?
contains a list of over 160 articles which he had published in the leading journals of our profession .
For his work on asymmetric information , Stiglitz was justly awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics .
However , Stiglitz is also scandalously sloppy as a public intellectual .
Robert Skidelsky recently summed up Stiglitz 's problem as follows : " he lacks the eloquence , urgency , and passion of the preacher , while he has too often abandoned the rigor of the scientist . "
Stiglitz , in fact , seems to write words down in public forums just because he has thoughts pop into his head and without really thinking through what it is he is saying rigorously .
He thought it , therefore it must be right .
It is an example of the excesses of the college professor pontificating in class --- remember the scenes with Sam Kinison in Back to School .
Now Stiglitz has written an op -ed that claims that Neo -Liberalism has reached its end .
In this op - ed he actually claims that neo-liberalism was never supported by economic theory nor economic history .
Instead , neo-liberalism was a political doctrine supported by interest groups .
So much for the Nobel winning ideas of Hayek , Friedman , Stigler , Buchanan , Coase , Becker , Lucas and V. Smith .
So much for the empirical evidence on the governmental causes of the Great Depression , the historical record on economic performance and political tryanny under communism , the failed efforts at development planning in Africa and Latin America , etc .
One must remember that Stiglitz actually wrote once that while " Chicago economics was well - funded , it was not well - founded . "
See just whatever thought pops into his head goes immediately to paper .
Not only does he dismiss in this latest op - ed an entire stream of intellectual history in economics from Adam Smith through J. B. Say and Bastiat to Mises and Hayek , and the other thinkers I named , but he is trying to dismiss without any data analysis the positive benefits of market reforms for much of the world over the past 30 years .
Again , lets remember this is just an op - ed -- though of course one written by a thinker that is internationally recognized and respected as an economist .
Thankfully , Andrei Shleifer 's " The Age of Milton Friedman " will be published in the Journal of Economic Literature , and it contains data and argument that demonstrates the empirical record is contrary to what Stiglitz suggests so professional opinion has yet to be completely swayed over to Stiglitz 's opinion on theory and evidence .
A Malaysian woman has been jailed for two years for hooking up with the " teapot worshipping "
Sky Kingdom cult , contrary to Sharia law which prohibits born Muslims converting to other religions .
Former teacher Kamariah Ali , 57 , was cuffed in 2005 when the powers that be clamped down on the cult and demolished its two - storey sacred teapot symbolising the " purity of water " and " love pouring from heaven " .
While Malaysia has constitutional guarantees of freedom of worship , apostasy is off the menu for the Muslim population .
Mrs Ali previously served 20 months in 1992 for the offence , and Sharia High Court judge Mohammed Abdullah had no hesitation handing down further time .
He said he'd " considered aspects of public interest and the sentiments of Muslims in the country " , and told the defendant : " The court is not convinced that the accused has repented and is willing to abandon any teachings contrary to Islam .
I pray God will open the doors of your heart , Kamariah . "
Ali 's lawyer , Sa'adiah Din , protested to reporters : " This has to stop .
They can't be sending her again and again to prison for this .
She informed the court that she is not a Muslim .
She does n't come under Sharia court anymore . "
An appeal hearing will tomorrow " consider [ Ali's ] plea for a lighter sentence and to defer the date of her sentencing " , the Malaysia Star notes . ®
And the IT angle ?
Who cares ?
You get one chance in your career to write the Malaysian teapot - worship headline , and by the Lord Harry and Saint George this hack was n't going to let it pass .
@GadgetPlay : From the article :
" At £ 1.10 a litre , the bioethanol is only slightly cheaper than conventional petrol , but is estimated to produce 85 per cent less carbon dioxide .
The grapes used for Charles 's fuel have already been fermented into wine on an English vineyard near Swindon , Wiltshire .
Its owners bottle all they can , but cannot produce more than their EU quota .
Rather than destroy the excess , the vineyard now sells it to the Gloucestershire biofuels supplier Green Fuels , where it is distilled . "
I understand economies of scale and cushions against problem patches to essentially require growing more than will be used , and there will always be some excess , often in the form of unsold wine ( or destroyed wine to maintain product scarcity and higher prices . )
Here , however , with the EU quotas you are essentially guaranteed that excess .
How much excess will vary from year to year , but the waste problem ( environmental and otherwise ) is in the EU quota system not the re-purposing of the wine .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) --
For the first time sumo wrestling 's governing body can recall , one of its revered athletes has been nabbed for drug possession .
Fans expect dignity from their sumo wrestlers , so the drug arrest has stunned Japan .
Police arrested 335 - pound Soslan Aleksandrovich Gagloev -- better known as Wakanoho -- on Monday .
They say they found a third of a gram of marijuana in his wallet .
That 's enough to land him in prison on a diet of forced labor for five years if he 's convicted .
It 's the latest black eye for a sport closely intwined with Japanese culture and history .
Fans have long expected humility and dignity from their sumo wrestlers , so the drug arrest has stunned people in Japan , where the national sport has taken a beating in the last year or so .
First , police charged three sumo wrestlers and their stable master with beating a teenage sumo to death last year .
They deny it .
Then Japan 's top sumo -- Asashoryu -- apologized on national TV after being caught in an apparent lie .
He pulled out of an exhibition tournament , saying he was hurt .
But television cameras caught him playing soccer in his native Mongolia days later , apparently without injury .
The Japan Sumo Association suspended Asashoryu -- the first time the country 's yokozuna , or top sumo , has received that punishment .
Now comes the drug arrest .
Do n't Miss Sumo hazing allegations rock Japan
Police say they found marijuana in Wakanoho's wallet on June 24 and arrested him Monday after an investigation .
The 20 - year - old Russian wrester , who stands six feet four inches , has not entered a plea , authorities said .
But the arrest prompted the Japan Sumo Association to apologize to fans and pledge to investigate .
Sumo wrestling , which traces it roots back 1,500 years , is struggling not just within its ranks , but in popularity , as well .
Fewer Japanese boys are entering the tough life of sumo , so the Sumo Association is recruiting foreigners like Wakanoho and Asashoryu .
Attendance is down at the stadiums , as more Japanese embrace soccer and baseball .
All these struggles may have a silver lining .
" These allegations , be they true or false , this one included , they 're all turning points to a more open sumo , " says Mark Buckton , a sumo analyst for the Japan Times .
" It 's good for the sport in the end .
It can open up the sport , make them follow modern society . "

Do you wake up in the morning with a dry mouth and sore throat ?
Are you irritable and tired throughout the day and suffer from headaches ?
Do you have trouble remembering or learning things ?
You may be among the 90 % who have no earthly idea they are victim to one of the most common types of sleep related breathing disorders , Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) .
This condition disrupts breathing while you are asleep , sometimes over 100 times throughout the night .
You may have no recollection that you struggled for breath , snored , choked and gasped to get your breath back .
The National Institute of Health states that 12 million Americans are affected with OSA , the more serious form of sleep apnea .
There is a lack of awareness by both the public and health professionals , so unfortunately the majority of us remain undiagnosed and therefore untreated , despite the fact that this serious disorder can be life threatening and is as common as adult diabetes today .
Most of us do n't understand what happens when we have OSA .
We 're unaware the body is starved of oxygen which can cause a dangerous drop in oxygen levels .
Drastic , life threatening problems can develop when the organs of the body are affected in this way and your risks for high blood pressure , heart attack and stroke increase dramatically .
If you fear your memory and learning problems are an early sign of dementia or Alzheimer 's , it may not be that at all but rather OSA and the drop in oxygen levels when you stop breathing repeatedly during the night .
Concurrently , sleep deprivation compromises the immune system , induces poor mental and emotional health , causes irritability , and slows our reaction time .
In fact untreated sleep apnea may be responsible for job impairment and motor vehicle crashes .
Sleep apnea may be treated by simply changing your behavior :
Get treatment for allergies or sinus problems , stabilize sleep hours , sleep on your side , gargle with salt water , use an air humidifier by your bedside , eliminate drugs , alcohol , cigarettes and lose excess weight ; which are good health habits to establish regardless .
Along with behavioral changes , the powerful antioxidants found in green tea may help thwart cognitive problems associated with OSA , according to a study published in the American Thoracic Society 'sGreen tea contains compounds called polyphenols which work by counteracting oxidative stress or cell damage in the brain .
Signs of oxidative stress and changes in the brain have been documented among some patients with OSA , the study cites .
Green tea polyphenols may represent a potential interventional strategy for patients with this sleep disorder says David Gozal , study author , MD , and professor and director of Kosair Children 's Hospital Research Institute at the University of Louisville .
An unusual remedy that has captured the interest of Jan Hedner , MD at Sahlgrenska University , Goteborg , Sweden is the benefit from an ingredient in a poisonous African bean .
The drug , physostigmine , is the main ingredient of the deadly Calabar bean , once used in Africa in certain rituals .
After testing on patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea , Dr. Hedner and his colleagues concluded that this strange ingredient may cut the number of breathing pauses in patients with OSA and provide a new treatment option if the results are maintained in long - term studies .
The findings appear in the Other studies are being conducted using 5 - HTP ( 5 - hydroxytryptophan ) , a safe and natural compound produced by the body from tryptophan and found in many foods , but most commonly extracted from the seeds of the Griffonia plant .
5 - HTP has been standard for decades in Europe to treat depression and sleep problems among other things .
Use of it is in the early stages here in the USA , and as clinical studies show , is of benefit in the treatment of sleep disorders .
Accessible treatments are out there which include the use of a mask - like machine ( CPAP ) ; not that attractive to wear as part of your bedtime attire , but effective at keeping the airflow smoothly flowing through your airways .
There are also small devices which can be comfortably inserted into the mouth at night to hold your tongue in place and another type that forces the lower jaw forward and down to open the airway .
You can find more information by consulting a sleep specialist at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine , your local support group , A.W.A.K.E. ( American Sleep Apnea Association ) , and the American Academy of Dental Sleep Medicine .
If you 're suffering from some of the symptoms discussed here , do n't assume it 's just an unfortunate bad night 's sleep .
It could be a bad night 's sleep with dire consequences .
If you 're one of the 12 million with Obstructive Sleep Apnea , get diagnosed and begin treatment .

Following a dramatic appearance by Hillary Clinton on the packed floor of the Democratic Convention , Barack Obama , the Hawaiian - born son of a mother from Kansas and a father from Kenya , was finally and officially named the party 's presidential candidate last night .
Mrs Clinton swept on to the convention floor just as her home state , New York , was being called upon to cast its vote during a raucous roll - call of the delegates of all states .
In a striking gesture of unity after all the months of bitterness , Mrs Clinton took the microphone to formally ask that the vote be suspended and that the convention approve the Obama nomination by acclamation .
" With eyes firmly fixed on the future , in the spirit of unity ... let 's declare together in one voice , right here right now , that Barack Obama is our candidate and he will be our president , " she said , reading from a script .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" I move Senator Barack Obama of Illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the Democratic Party " she added , lifting the roof of the convention hall .
Her request was instantly accepted by Nancy Pelosi , the convention 's presiding officer .
Mrs Pelosi then announced that Barack Obama had accepted the nomination .
The stage is now set for Denver 's vast outdoor arena where tonight , on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King 's " I Have a Dream " speech , Mr Obama will deliver an address upon which hangs the outcome of November 's American presidential election , and the hopes of the first black man with a real shot at the White House .
Eight years ago , such a scenario would have been laughable .
Obama was broke and without political friends of any consequence .
He had to gatecrash the 2000 Democratic Convention in Los Angeles after arriving on a cheap flight at the last minute .
A rental car company rejected his maxed - out American Express card and he watched Al Gore accept the party 's nomination on television screens at the perimeter of the convention centre .
Tonight will seem a millennium away .
This time , it will be Gore in the audience lending support to the candidate on whose slender shoulders the Democrats ' hopes lie .
The psychodramas surrounding Hillary Clinton have also been dealt with following the rapturous reception for her barnstorming speech to the convention on Tuesday .
Senator Obama 's acceptance of the nomination before 70,000 people is set to be an extraordinary political event .
The task at hand is to energise the party and reconnect Obama 's " colourblind " vision for the country with those Republicans who were briefly enthralled by his electrifying promise to unify America 's angry and divided politics .
Back in 2000 , at the age of 39 and with his career crashing around him , his hopes seemed to have flamed out after he had been trounced while trying to unseat a well - liked black Congressman .
He recalls being terrified that for all his dreams he was about to disappear from public life – just as his talented Kenyan father had done before him .
Last night , he arrived in Denver on a private Boeing 757 with his name emblazoned on the side .
It was yet another giant step in the remarkable journey from ambitious local politician to global political superstar , who may from January be President of the world 's troubled superpower .

Tonight , millions of Americans – and millions more around the world – will hang on his every word .
But John McCain , whose campaign is ratcheting up the attacks on Obama 's inexperience with every hour , will be watching too .
Even Obama 's decision to choose the experienced political warhorse Joe Biden as his running mate has not given him the hoped - for " bounce " in the polls .
Yet , during the past eight years , it is Obama 's extraordinary ability to rise to the occasion that has marked him out from the crowd .
Campaigning this week in four battleground states – Wisconsin , Iowa , Missouri and Montana – he has worked late into the night with a pen and yellow pad , crafting in longhand what is expected to be the speech of his lifetime .
Mr Obama has given hundreds of stump speeches over the past two years , some of them inspiring , many of them repetitious .
But it is an address delivered in 2002 to a group of war protesters in which he flatly stated his opposition to the invasion of Iraq that he considers his best .
Just a year after 11 September 2001 , with Mr Bush riding high and polls supporting an invasion – and just as he was preparing to run for the US Senate – he committed what many thought to be political suicide .
" I do n't oppose all wars , " he said .
" What I am opposed to is ... a war based not on reason , but on passion , not on principle but on politics . "
That seemingly foolhardy , if prescient , statement made him the only top - tier presidential candidate flatly to oppose the war before it was launched .
Until 2004 , he languished in the backwaters of Chicago , an obscure state senator – the lowest form of pond life in national politics .
Then he was noticed by John Kerry , the Democratic candidate of that election year .
Wooden and uninspiring , Kerry was on the lookout for a talented black politician .
After seeing Obama skilfully work a room of white voters , he soon invited him to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston .
It was just 17 minutes long but the speech captured America 's attention .
The speech , which Obama insisted on writing himself , was hailed as a classic by the political world and earned him comparisons to John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King .
It has become part of the myth of Obama 's effortless rise as a political phenomenon .
But behind the legend lies a cunning , an extraordinary ambition and an unrivalled attention to detail that he learnt going door to door as a community organiser in Chicago 's South Side .
That trademark micro-management was in evidence again yesterday as his campaign succeeded in short cutting the roll - call of states – thereby avoiding the embarrassment of the biggest states declaring for Hillary Clinton .
The Obama camp ensured that long before most Americans switched on their TVs last night – Barack Obama was already the Democratic nominee to become the 44th US president .

Guess what ?
The iPhone 3G is pretty much as Steve Jobs described it .
The first reviews are out , with Walt Mossberg , Edward Baig and our own David Pogue all finding much to like .
Mainly , they like all the things they liked last year about the original iPhone , plus the key new features : faster browsing speed and a GPS navigation system .
They do n’t like the things we knew Apple left out : video , photo messages and so on .
And they note the limitations : spotty high speed data coverage on AT&T , limited use of the GPS for turn - by - turn navigation , and a slight price increase hidden in the combination of a lower upfront cost with higher monthly fees .
There is a bit of new information .
All the reviewers found that the phone ’s sound quality — still rather important despite all the other features — is much improved .
Mr. Mossberg tested the phone ’s battery life and found it inferior to the first version .
He found that the phone had four and a half hours of talk time , less than the five hours Apple promised , and far less than the seven and a half hours his first - generation iPhone delivered using the same test .
More significantly , Mr. Mossberg found that his iPhone 3G ran out of power before the end of one day ’s use .
Even this is not so much of a surprise .
A year ago when asked why Apple did n’t use the faster 3G network on the first iPhone , Mr. Jobs , Apple ’s chief executive , said the hit to battery life would be too much .
( Mr. Jobs , of course , is the envy of every politician for his painless ability to flipflop with impunity . )
The real story with the iPhone is what we do n’t know yet :
What all the new software that will become available for it will be .
Maybe these will add up to little more than the mobile equivalent of Facebook ’s sheep - throwing geegaws .
I do n’t think so , however .
My instinct is that Apple has created a platform that will lead to a lot of creativity that will result in useful and interesting applications .
A personal note here for those of you following my own spending on technology : I ’ve decided to buy a 16 gig iPhone to replace my nondescript Samsung dumbphone issued by the Times .
( I ’m already on AT&T by some accident of history , so that switch is n’t a problem . )
I ’ve decided to put my money where my posts are , betting that in fact this is the computer and media access device I want in my pocket .
I ’ll let you know if I regret the choice .
BERLIN ( AP ) 
The U.S. has done the least among the world 's eight biggest economies to address global warming , a study released Thursday found .
The G8 Climate Scorecards 2008 , released Thursday ahead of next week 's gathering of the Group of Eight on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido , also found that none of the eight countries are making improvements large enough to prevent temperature increases that scientists think would cause catastrophic climate changes .
The gathering includes the heads of states of the U.S. , Japan , Britain , Germany , France , Italy , Canada and Russia .
Regine Guenther , director of the World Wildlife Fund Climate Change Program in Germany , told reporters in the German capital that G8 leaders should commit to reducing emissions in their countries 40 % by 2020 and 80 % by 2050 .
" If we do n't achieve that , the world 's climate will change in ways that we can't even imagine today , " Guenther said .
The scorecard ranked Britain as the developed nation that has done the most to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and reach targets set by the Kyoto Protocol .
France and Germany are close behind .
Germany was praised for its investment in renewable energy .
" But all three countries are at best half as far along the road as they should be , " a statement announcing the study said .
The scorecard was compiled by Ecofys , a Dutch consulting company , and commissioned by the World Wildlife Fund and insurer Allianz SE .
Joachim Faber , an Allianz board member who helped compile the scorecards , said a global emissions trading market is important to fighting climate change , and that the EU should lead its development .
" The EU - specific trading system we have at the moment must serve as model system for one that we can found outside the EU , for the world economy , " he said .
The study criticized low energy efficiency in the U.S. , but said there was hope in legislation under consideration by Congress and initiatives led by non-governmental groups .
The study also analyzed — but did not rank — five of the world 's fastest growing economies : Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
" These countries cannot be measured with the same ruler as industrialized countries , " the statement said .

Researchers at Purdue University are developing a miniature refrigeration system , small enough to fit inside laptop computers .
According to the researchers , the implementation of miniature refrigeration systems in computers can dramatically increase the amount of heat removed from the microchips , therefore boosting performance while simultaneously shrinking the size of computers .
Hamas said today it would accept a Palestinian state on land occupied in the 1967 war , but it would not explicitly recognise Israel .
Khaled Meshaal , the leader of Hamas , said the group would " respect Palestinian national will even if it was against our convictions " , an apparent reference to a referendum on a peace deal .
His comments came at a news conference in Damascus , Syria , after a rare series of meetings between the former US president Jimmy Carter and Hamas Islamists in the West Bank , Cairo and Damascus .
At an earlier press conference , Carter said Hamas would accept a two - state peace agreement with Israel as long as it was approved by a Palestinian referendum or a newly elected government .
Carter , who spoke in Jerusalem , said Hamas had told him it would support the results of a referendum or election on a final - status peace agreement negotiated by the Palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , even if Hamas itself opposed the agreement .
The former president and Nobel peace prize - winner admitted he had failed to convince Hamas to begin a unilateral ceasefire in Gaza , the scene of continued violence .
" If President Abbas succeeds in negotiating a final - status agreement with Israel , Hamas will accept the decision made by the Palestinian people and their will through a referendum ... or by a newly elected Palestinian national council ... even if Hamas is opposed to the agreement , " Carter said in a speech at the King David hotel .
" Verbatim , this is their language , " he said .
Carter insisted he was not acting as a mediator and he noted his visit was not endorsed by either the Israeli or the US government , so there was little sign it would advance the so - far fruitless Middle East peace talks between Abbas and the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert .
He acknowledged that Hamas still refused to recognise explicitly Israel 's right to exist , or to renounce violence , or to recognise previous peace agreements .
The movement did not agree to speed the release of an Israeli corporal captured two years ago , although it did tell Carter it would let the soldier , Gilad Shalit , write a new letter home to his parents to prove he was still alive .
Carter condemned attacks by Hamas as " despicable " and " acts of terrorism " .
Yet he sounded encouraged by his talks , which included meetings with Meshaal and the most powerful Hamas leader in Gaza , Mahmoud Zahar .
" They said they would accept a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders if approved by Palestinians and they would accept the right of Israel to live as a neighbour next door in peace provided the agreements negotiated by Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas were submitted to the Palestinians for their overall approval , even though Hamas might disagree with some terms of the agreement , " Carter said .
The Hamas position reflected a key agreement known as the Prisoners ' Document , which Hamas signed with its rival Fatah , led by Abbas , two years ago .
However , that agreement was overtaken by a near civil war between the two rival groups .
The Hamas leaders also told Carter a " national reconciliation " between Hamas and Fatah was necessary for any peace agreement to work , even though the two sides appear a long way from a rapprochement .
One Hamas spokesman in Gaza , Sami Abu Zuhri , immediately cast doubt over Carter 's words when he said the idea of a referendum on a peace agreement " does not mean that Hamas is going to accept the result of the referendum " .
He said Palestinians living abroad would have to take part in the vote , not only those in the occupied territories .
Carter said it was widely acknowledged on the ground that any progress under the current peace talks , which were launched in Annapolis last November , was so far " of no significance " .
" Since Annapolis the peace process has regressed , " he said , citing the continued growth of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the economic blockade on Gaza .
He argued there should be talks with Hamas in order to resolve the Middle East conflict .
" We believe the problem is not that I met with Hamas in Syria , " he said .
" The problem is that Israel and the United States refuse to meet with these people who must be involved . "
The computer program Captain ’s Log ­– originally used with individuals diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , brain injuries or learning disabilities – is being adapted to rehabilitate Ugandan children who are survivors of cerebral malaria .
Michael Boivin , a Michigan State University associate professor of neurology and ophthalmology and of psychiatry , and Bruno Giordani , a University of Michigan associate professor of psychiatry , are leading the project .
“ So far as we know , this will be the first attempt to implement a cognitive rehabilitation training program in Uganda with children in the aftermath of brain injury , ” Boivin said .
“ Such programs for children with special needs are readily available in America , and in other parts of the developed world , but not in Africa . ”
Every 30 seconds a child in Africa dies from malaria - around 1 million every year , he said .
Cerebral malaria is a severe form of malaria that affects the brain and is fatal in about 15 percent to 30 percent of the cases for hospitalized children .
“ Our most recent follow - up evaluation of our cerebral malaria children indicates that 26 percent of them have persisting mild to moderate cognitive impairment , mostly in the area of attention and to some extent in visual - spatial working memory , ” Boivin said .
The computer game is a comprehensive set of computerized cognitive training programs consisting of five modules including developmental , visual motor skills , conceptual skills , numeric concepts with memory skills and attention skills .

The research team is hoping that this intervention can help cerebral malaria - affected school - age Ugandan children improve their cognitive skills , leading to improvements for both activities of daily living and school - related learning and skill development .
“ The program attempts to do so with the use of 33 multilevel brain - training exercises designed to help develop and remediate attention , concentration , memory , eye - hand coordination , basic numeric concepts , problem solving - reasoning skills , self - esteem and self - control , ” Boivin said .
Originally developed in 1985 , the program is used with children 6 years and older and adults and has been used in a variety of therapeutic , school and home settings in all 50 states , U.S. territories and 23 foreign countries .
Also , the program has been adapted for use in a wide range of non-English speaking settings .
Boivin and Giordani have trained a Ugandan study team to help implement and evaluate the program .
“ We trained our study team at Mulago Hospital in Uganda , and they helped us in testing the program , ” Boivin said .
“ The onsite project research manager , Paul Bangirana , can now program and set up Captain 's Log on his own . ”
This pilot study is supported by a Global Health Research and Training grant from U - M and through Boivin ’s startup faculty funding .
In addition , the study will provide an opportunity to establish partnerships between the U - M Neuropsychology Section ; MSU International Neurologic and Psychiatric Epidemiology Program ; and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health , Makerere University School of Medicine , Uganda .

Aromas of cinnamon , carob and honey fill the tiny kitchen in Corrie Hanton 's Lakewood apartment .
After pulling a large apple cinnamon muffin in a bone - shaped cake pan from the oven , she explains that the healthy treat is designed for a special occasion -- like a doggie birthday party .
The muffins are among a range of pet food created by Hanton , who extends her holistic approach to nutrition to her four ferrets : Joey , Hobbes , Haley and Jools , who regularly enjoy home - cooked meals .
In January , she decided to do the same for other animals .
She founded Pet Pastries , a home - based business that sells freshly made pet food with specialty ingredients .
That includes using herbal remedies in custom treats for pets with specific health issues .
For example , she puts the dietary supplements glucosamine , chondroitin and MSM -- which some humans take for joint health -- in some of her snacks for animals with malformed hips or arthritis .
Hanton believes that a healthy diet and lifestyle can reduce trips to the vet and prolong pets ' lives .
To address the lifestyle aspect , she plans to open a holistic wellness center for pets .
" This is somewhat new territory , " Hanton said .
" But I think if it was available it would catch on . "
The wellness center , to be called Pet Pastries and Playland , would include separate indoor and outdoor play areas for pets of different sizes , a coffee shop where owners and pets could hang out together , and a clinic featuring the services of a holistic veterinarian .
Finding the right facility , though , has been tough .
Especially since Hanton is only looking at Lakewood .
She likes the area because it 's walkable and pet friendly .
But she 's been unable to find a big enough retail space and is waiting for something to open up .
Until then , Hanton is focused on filling pet food orders for neighbors , animal shelters and people across the country who find her online .
Hanton and her husband , Michael , moved to Lakewood from Trumbull County in 2005 to be closer to their work with an event marketing company .
After about a year , both decided that the industry was n't for them .
" We quit on the same day , " she said , noting that they had no real plan at the time .
But , it all worked out .
Her husband put his full - time focus on a home remodeling business that he had been operating on the side .
And Hanton , who grew up on a 100 - acre farm in Trumbull County , focused on her true passion : working with animals .
" I had an opportunity to say , What do I really want to do ? " she said .
She had just finished a two - year correspondence program in holistic care for companion animals and began putting some of her new knowledge to use when her ferret , Joey , was diagnosed with a tumor of the pancreas .
She put him on a ferret version of a macrobiotic diet , cutting out most sugar and avoiding the use of processed or refined foods .
She put her family , including son Kyle , on a similar diet at the same time .
Soon , Hanton began making pet food for friends , family and the animal shelters where she volunteered .
She also made contacts at K9 Kingdom , a doggie day care in Richmond Heights where she had picked up a part - time job .
" Late last year , I realized the business needed to be on the books , " Hanton said .
" I realized I was actually making a decent living off of it . "
To date , she said dog snacks , which come in more than a dozen flavor varieties including peanut butter and oatmeal banana , are by far her most popular product .
Debbie Frye of Manassas , Va. said she found Pet Pastries shortly after it opened in January while searching for doggie treats that included vitamin E for her chocolate lab , Puma .
She hoped the vitamin could help heal the facial scar Puma was born with .
Frye tried feeding the puppy vitamin E supplements , but she would spit them out .
Now she buys a three - month supply of vitamin - filled treats from Hanton for about $ 100 .
Frye freezes them , as they lack the preservatives found in commercial foods .
Puma , and Frye 's black lab , Max , gobble up three or four a day , she said .
Frye said it 's tough to measure the effect of the vitamin E , which is often used in skin care products and is sometimes promoted as being able to soften the appearance of scars .
But she said she plans to continue feeding Puma the treats , in addition to a regular diet of store - bought dog food and home - cooked meals .
" It 's not going to hurt her , it 's only going to help her , " Frye said .
Tony Buffington , a veterinary nutrition professor at Ohio State University 's College of Veterinary Medicine , pointed out that the medicinal effects of many herbs and dietary supplements are up for debate .
In most cases , " it 's not scientific , it 's emotional , " he said .
Buffington also said there 's no research he knows of that shows homemade food is better for an animal 's health than store - bought food .
" The quality of most of the commercial pet food is better than the quality of food humans eat , " he said .
Buffington says it comes down to the owner 's personal preference .
Most important is to be sure that the animal 's nutrition is balanced , he said .
He recommends consulting a veterinarian before making any drastic changes to a pet 's diet .

The Continuing Cheapening of the Word " Terrorism "
Illegally diverting water is terrorism :
South Australian Premier Mike Rann says the diversion of water from the Paroo River in Queensland is an act of terrorism during a water crisis .
Anonymously threatening people with messages on playing cards , like the Joker in The Dark Knight , is terrorism :

Investigators say 18 - year olds Brian Stafford and Justin Dirico left eight threatening playing cards at the Pearisburg Wal - Mart on Saturday , August 9th .
The cards read “ 9 people will die ” and “ 9 people will suffer ” with the date 8 - 15 - 08 .
A ninth card was found on a car at the Dairy Queen on Sunday , August 10th .
I ’ve written about this sort of thing before .

If you ca n’t tell , we ’re pretty hooked on the latest and greatest in green prefab design .
One big problem , though , is that there ’s a huge amount of noise and not all that much action – plenty of fabulous prefab designs and museum / conference exhibits , but very few actual installations ( and even fewer mid-market installs , which is where prefab has to go in order to make a true difference in our housing stock ) .
Finally , the log jam seems to be breaking .
Several firms have begun to produce green prefab homes for real people in small but growing numbers .
This past month , Marmol Radziner , a prefab company here in Southern California , made a splash with some pretty showy installation videos on local media outlets .
These homes are either a ) high end or b ) for the firm ’s founders , so they ’re still a ways away from mass - market .
But , the videos do a good job of showing what elements make prefab homes unique ( factory construction , rapid installation , modular components ) and at least to me suggest that they ’re not all that far away from being able to replicate these installations on a larger and thus less expensive scale .
So , take a few minutes out of work and check out this great video from the LA Times on the installation of one of the homes .
And continue to hope for the day when all you have to do is walk down the street instead of visit the local museum to see a beautiful green prefab home near you .
( our apologies for whatever ad the LA Times is running in front of this clip – when I last viewed it it was a Chevy Pickup ad – ugggggg ) .
Land soon to become a new housing estate has yielded an unexpected treasure – a 2,000 - year - old skeleton , believed to be that of a prince , a warrior or a priest .
Planning permission has been granted for more than 600 houses in open fields at North Bersted near Bognor .
But before the work could go ahead , an archaeological survey had to be carried out on the site to check if there was anything of historical interest under the topsoil .
What the team from the Thames Valley Archaeological Services found was beyond their wildest dreams .
After digging tirelessly for several months they have made numerous discoveries .
The excavations revealed Bronze Age boundary ditches and evidence of occupation , four Middle Bronze Age bronze axes known as palstaves , an Iron Age roundhouse and a Roman building set among fields .
But there was more .
Hidden just below the surface was a burial mound containing a well - preserved skeleton of a man that had lain undisturbed for about 2,000 years .
Around him were three pots containing various items suggesting he was a man of wealth .
Steve Ford , a director of the archaeological service , said : “ The deceased , a mature male more than 30 years old , was laid out in a grave and was accompanied by grave goods .
“ These comprised three large pottery jars placed at the end of the grave , presumably containing offerings to the gods or food for the journey into the afterlife , an iron knife and several items made of bronze .
“ One appears to be a helmet and the other a shield boss .
“ Also present are two bronze latticework sheets highly decorated , perhaps used to cover a shield .
“ The burial and its grave goods seems to have been placed in a large coffin or casket bound by iron hoops with an iron framed structure placed on top . ”
The intricate metalwork is so unusual that even the professor of European archaeology at Oxford University , Professor Barry Cunliffe , who visited the site , said he had seen nothing like it before .
In order to remove the objects from the ground without damaging them , they were lifted in blocks of soil by a specialist conservator for more delicate excavation and conservation in a laboratory .
Mr Ford said the pottery indicated that the burial took place either at the end of the Late Iron Age or just into the Roman period , around AD 50 .
He said the burial was similar to famous graves of the Late Iron Age found in Hertforshire , Kent and Essex .
All of these , he said , are likely to have been graves of princes , chiefs or possibly priests but that they were all dated a little earlier than the North Bersted site .
Building work on the land has been temporarily halted by developers Berkeley Homes and Persimmon Homes due to the credit crunch .
The eight students walked into a room at Lincoln High School prepared to discuss an issue many people , including some of their teachers , considered taboo .
They were blunt .
Carlos Garcia , 17 , an A student with a knack for math , said , “ My friends , most of them say , ‘ You ’re more Asian than Hispanic . ’ ”
“ I think Carlos is Asian at heart , ” said Julie Loc , 17 , causing Carlos to laugh good - naturedly .
Asian students who get middling grades often get another response , she said .
“ They say , ‘ Are you really Asian ? ’ ” Julie said .
Advertisement
“ It ’s sad but true , ” said Eliseo Garcia , a 17 - year - old with long rocker hair , an easy manner and good grades .
“ I had an Asian friend , but he did n’t necessarily get that great a grades .
We used to say , ‘ He ’s Mexican at heart . ’ ”
What accounts for such self - deprecating humor ?
Or the uneven academic performance that prompts it ?
The state ’s top education official , Supt .
Jack O’Connell , called for that kind of discussion last fall when he decried the “ racial achievement gap ” separating Asian and non-Latino white students from Latinos and blacks .
At The Times ’ request , the Eastside students gathered to talk about this touchy subject .

Lincoln Heights is mostly a working - class Mexican American area , but it ’s also a first stop for Asian immigrants , many of them ethnic Chinese who fled Vietnam .
With about 2,500 students , Lincoln High draws from parts of Boyle Heights , El Sereno and Chinatown .
Both the neighborhood and student body are about 15 % Asian .
And yet Asians make up 50 % of students taking Advanced Placement classes .
Staffers can’t remember the last time a Latino was valedictorian .
“ A lot of my friends say the achievement gap is directly attributable to the socioeconomic status of students , and that is not completely accurate , ” O’Connell said .
“ It is more than that . ”
Advertisement
But what is it ?
O’Connell called a summit in Sacramento that drew 4,000 educators , policymakers and experts to tackle the issue .
Some teachers stomped out in frustration and anger .
No Lincoln students stomped out of their discussion .
Neither did any teachers in a similar Lincoln meeting .
But the observations were frank , and they clearly made some uncomfortable .
--
To begin with , the eight students agreed on a few generalities : Latino and Asian students came mostly from poor and working - class families .
Advertisement
According to a study of census data , 84 % of the Asian and Latino families in the neighborhoods around Lincoln High have median annual household incomes below $ 50,000 .
And yet the Science Bowl team is 90 % Asian , as is the Academic Decathlon team .
“ Look at the statistics .
It ’s true , ” said George De La Paz , 17 , whose single mother works as a house cleaner .
Asian parents are more likely to pressure their children to excel academically , the students agreed .
“ They only start paying attention if I do n’t do well , ” said Karen Chu , 15 , whose parents emigrated from Vietnam .
“ They do n’t reward me for getting straight A’s .
I do n’t get anything for that .
But if I get a B , they ’re like , ‘ What ’s this ? ’ ”
Advertisement
If her grades slipped , she said , her parents laid on the guilt extra thick .
“ My parents are always like , ‘ If you do n’t do well in school , then it ’s all going to be worth nothing , ’ ” Karen said , laughing nervously .
Julie Loc , the daughter of a seamstress and a produce - truck driver , said that if she gets a B , her parents ask whether she needs tutoring .
She said her father used to compare her to other people ’s children , noting their hard course loads or saying , “ They have a 4.3 [ grade - point average ] .
Why do you only have a 4.0 ? ’ ”
Julie said her mother , Kin Ho , finally told her father to stop making comparisons .
Ho , in an interview , said with a slightly embarrassed smile , “ My daughter has embraced American culture , where she expects my reassurance and approval .
Our children , if they did something well , they would ask us if we were proud of them , if they did good .
They ask if we love them . ”
George said his mother , a Mexican immigrant , has high expectations for him too , but she is not so white - knuckled when it comes to school .
She wants him to do well -- he ’s now thinking of college -- but the field of endeavor is up to him .
Advertisement
“ She said , ‘ I came here to do better for you , ’ ” he said .
“ But that ’s about it .
Being happy and getting by , that ’s what she wants . ”
For Carlos Garcia , the one with the knack for math , the message from his parents was to focus on school .
Neither got to finish grade school in their native countries .
His mother , Maribel , from El Salvador , is a homemaker ; his father , Santos , a Mexican immigrant , is a drywall finisher who once took Carlos and his older brother to work with him -- to scare them away from manual labor .
Two of their children have college degrees , one is still in college and Carlos , the only Latino on Lincoln ’s Academic Decathlon team , wants to attend Caltech .
Ericka Saracho , 16 , an A student , said her Latino family did not push her to do well in school .
When she got a rare B , “ they ’re like , ‘ Oh , wow , Ericka finally got a B !
How do you feel about that ? ’ ” she said .
She is one of the few Latina students on Lincoln ’s Science Bowl team .
Advertisement
The students talked not just about parental expectations , but also about those of peers .
Karen drew laughter when she said of other students , “ They expect me to be smart .
Even if , like , I do everything wrong on purpose , they still copy off of me -- as if I ’m right just because I ’m Asian . ”
She said expectations came into play in an even odder way in Lincoln High ’s hallways .
“ In our school we have tardy sweeps , and normally the staff members let the Asians go , ” Karen said .
“ They do n’t really care if we ’re late . ”
The group , nodding , erupted into laughter .
“ They do n’t even ask them for a pass sometimes , ” George added .
Advertisement
“ Generally speaking -- like it ’s stereotypical that Asians all do better -- I also think there ’s a stereotypical view that Asians are usually late , ” Julie said .
“ They ’ll come to school late , but they ’ll get to class and do their work . ”
This drew more laughter .
--
Many factors influence academic performance : class size , poverty , and school and neighborhood resources .
But as the discussions at Lincoln show , expectations loom large .
Advertisement
Fidel Nava , a coordinator for English learners at Lincoln , said some Latino students say that Asians get higher grades simply because , well , they ’re Asian .
“ In a sense , they have come to believe that it ’s OK for Asians to be smart and not for Hispanics , ” said Nava , who immigrated from Mexico at 14 .
Nava , the only one of six siblings to go to college , said he was once like many of his students .
His parents wanted the children to finish high school , but there also was an expectation that they get jobs and help the family .
“ A lot of my relatives do n’t see my job as a stressful job at all , ” Nava said .
“ If I tell them I ’m tired , they say , ‘ Why ?
You ’re not doing any labor .
You ’re not doing anything . ’ ”

Rocio Chavez , 18 , said that even though her older sister graduated from high school , their mother did n’t really expect her to go to college .
“ I guess she did n’t expect that from me , either , ” Rocio said .
“ And now that I ’m going to move on to college , she ’s kind of scared .
She gets kind of sad I ’m leaving .
She ’s like , ‘ You ’re supposed to graduate from high school , go to work and help me out . ’ ”
Frank D. Bean , a professor of sociology at UC Irvine ’s Center for Research on Immigration , Population and Public Policy , has studied the Mexican work ethic and found that work and education occupy the same pedestal , and in some cases , work is even more valued .
Bean said his research shows that children of Latino immigrants , if they drop out of school , are more likely to be working than most other students who leave school .
Advertisement
“ In Latino families , being able to work to provide defines your manhood , your worthiness , ” said Min Zhou , a UCLA sociology professor who has studied working - class Korean and Chinese communities .
Latino and Asian families in Lincoln Heights were essentially in the same socioeconomic boat , she said , but Asian immigrants were more likely to have been more affluent and had better education opportunities in their native countries .
Of course , there are exceptions to stereotypes at Lincoln .
“ My mom just wants me to pass , ” said Thin Lam , 17 .
But
Thin said counselors assumed he wanted to take a slew of AP classes , and a counselor urged him to take AP calculus .
Advertisement
“ I said , ‘ Yeah , sure , I want to take it , ’ ” he said .
“ In the end , I dropped it . ”
--
A few hours after the eight students concluded their discussion , some teachers gathered in Principal James Molina ’s office .
“ I feel a little bit uncomfortable talking about racial and ethnic generalizations , ” said Cynthia High , a 20 - year teaching veteran now in charge of teachers ’ aides and other programs .
Advertisement
“ In some situations , it sparks a good conversation .
In others , it ’s more taboo - ish to talk about it , ” said William Olmedo , who teaches AP physics .
Barbara Paulson , who coordinates Lincoln ’s magnet program and teaches AP biology , said it had been understood for a long time that teachers needed to try harder to recruit Latino students for AP classes because “ the Asian kids come on in droves . ”
Gilbert Martinez , who teaches AP government , said he did n’t think the school did as good a job as it could to raise expectations among Latino students and to get them into AP classes .
“ But I do , ” Paulson said .
Advertisement
“ I ’m not saying you , Barbara .
I ’m saying all over . ”
Olmedo said many capable Latino students refused to take AP classes or join other academically rigorous activities .
Teachers said they were saddened by self - defeating attitudes .
“ I think the thing I always hear from the Latino kids is , ‘ Oh , well , Miss , he ’s Asian , she ’s Asian .
Of course they do well , ’ ” said Alli Lauer , who teaches English .
“ It ’s frustrating to hear them do it to each other . ”
Advertisement
But as one student said in a separate interview , many Latino students are responding to cues .
Johana Najera , 17 , said the Academic Decathlon offers a not - so - subtle cue about who belongs .
“ We already know that it ’s Asian , and they kind of market it more for Asians , ” Najera said .
She noted that the shirts for the Academic Decathlon team have a logo done in the style of anime , Japanese animation .
“ It appeals more to Asian students , ” she said .
Martinez turned the conversation toward parents ’ attitudes , summarizing a discussion from one of his Chicano studies classes .
“ Let ’s say a Latino student is studying and an Asian student is studying , ” Martinez said .
“ The Latino parent will often say , ‘ Hey , come help me out real quick , then you can go back to your studying . ’
Where the Asian parent will say , ‘ Oh , you ’re doing your homework .
OK , you finish , and then after you ’re done , you come help me . ’ ”

High recalled a good Latino student she had a few years ago .
He also was a gang member .
“ He would wear baggy pants , and he would load up his pants with books , ” she said .
“ He looked around to make sure no one was seeing him so he could look like the baddest kid in the block . ”
The teachers were then asked about tardy sweeps , the topic the students had found so amusing .
Was it true that Asians could wander outside class without a hall pass ?
“ My Asian kids laugh at that , ” Olmedo said .
“ I say , ‘ Take the pass . ’
They say , ‘ I ’m Asian .
Who ’s going to ask an Asian student for a pass ? ’ ”
Advertisement
“ Oh , you ’re kidding ! ” High said with a gasp .
“ I ’ll send one of my [ Latino ] boys out just to get water , and here comes the security , ‘ Please make sure you send him out with a pass , ’ and I ’ll say I will , ” Olmedo continued .
“ And the Asian kid will walk around the whole campus , the whole day , the whole week , for a whole month ! ”
Don Brewer , an English teacher , said some Latino students were allowed to slide by without hall passes , including athletes and others involved in school activities .
“ But you know , ” Brewer said , “ when you ’re looking down the hall and you see that one kid pop out , you go , ‘ OK , he ’s Asian .
I can go back in . ’
You know , I think that happens .
It ’s obvious it happens . ”

High shook her head .
“ But I must say I do n’t feel comfortable with that .
And if we ’re doing that , that ’s not OK .
That ’s just not OK . ”
“ Oh , it ’s happening , ” Olmedo said .
“ It ’s happening . ”

The Man Who Named the Grassy Knoll
T
The Kennedy motorcade from Love Field through Dallas included a news " pool car " loaned by the telephone company .
It was the fifth car behind President Kennedy .
Riding in the right front was Malcolm Kilduff , Mr. Kennedy 's acting press secretary .
In the middle sat senior White House correspondent Merriman Smith of United Press International ( UPI ) .
Thanks to a long - standing agreement to alternate seats with the competing wire service , Associated Press ( AP ) , Mr. Smith sat directly in front of the car 's only radio telephone .
In the back seat sat the AP's Jack Bell , Robert Baskin of The Dallas Morning News and Bob Clark of ABC News .
When the shots were fired , Mr. Smith 's car rode several hundred feet behind the president .
The reporter had time to hear and see reactions from the crowd and police escorts , one of whom , Bobby Hargis , immediately stopped , jumped off his Harley - Davidson and raced up the nearby hill to a low concrete wall , passing horrified spectators lying on the ground .
As officer Hargis ran , the pool car picked up speed entering the Triple Underpass to Stemmons Freeway and the wild race to Parkland Hospital .
Mr. Smith grabbed the radio telephone and called the Dallas UPI office , which sent out his dispatch at 12:34 , four minutes after the shooting .
" Three shots were fired at President Kennedy 's motorcade today in downtown Dallas , " he reported , and news bulletins around the world began with that short statement .
Meanwhile , in Anna , Illinois , WRAJ - AM owner and manager Don Michel responded to the UPI teletype warning bells and relayed those early reports to his startled listeners .
Fortunately , Mr. Michel did something few others had presence of mind to do .
He saved the UPI dispatches and filed them away , figuring someday they would be valuable for history .
He was right .
Mr. Michel placed those rare pages on loan to The Sixth Floor Museum , where several have been on display since opening day in 1989 .
One of the pages in our archive reveals that in a dispatch sent almost exactly 25 minutes after the assassination , Mr. Smith reported " Some of the Secret Service agents thought the gunfire was from an automatic weapon fired to the right rear of the president 's car , probably from a grassy knoll to which police rushed . "
No other news reports or witness interviews are known to contain the phrase " grassy knoll " at that time .
In fact , tapes of local news coverage reveal that " grassy knoll " was later repeated by a few other reporters for several hours until investigators became convinced the shots originated from the old Texas School Book Depository .
Yet it remains an historical fact that police and spectators immediately ran to the grassy knoll , not to the Depository building .
And UPI 's Merriman Smith reported it first .
So that 's the story , as best as can be determined so many years later .
Some researchers like to credit witness Bill Newman with the phrase , but the video tape shows he was n't the one .
Newman appeared on WFAA - TV in Dallas about 15 - 20 minutes after the shooting .
He said the shots came from behind him , " up on the mall , " or " up on the knoll . "
Careful study of the tape shows him forming his lips to make the " mmm " sound , not " nnn . "
And he did not say " grassy " at any time .
David Friedman on Property Rights By Arnold Kling
He wrote ,
The right to decide whether or not I turn on the lights in my house is worth more to me than to my neighbors , so in principle I should be able to buy their permission .
The problem is that there are a lot of people living within sight of my house .
Buying permission from most of them does no good , since I need permission from all .
The result is likely to be a difficult bargaining game , with at least some of my neighbors trying to extort from me a sizable fraction of the value of my land in exchange for their permission to use it .
This suggests that , in deciding how property rights ought to be bundled , there are two important considerations .
The first is that , so far as possible , rights should go in the bundle where they are most valuable .
The right to control the air a foot over a piece of land is worth more to the owner than to anyone else , so ownership of land usually includes ownership of the space immediately above it .
The second is that , since the proper composition of bundles of rights will often be uncertain and may change over time , they should be defined in a way that makes it as easy as possible to trade rights .
Property rights should be defined in a way that minimizes the transaction costs of likely transactions .
I wonder if this can be used to look at intellectual property .
My instinct is that drug patents make sense , but that software patents do not .
( Amazon ’s attempt to patent “ one - click ordering ” was a notorious example of the latter .
So was Blackberry ’s loss of a patent - infringement case . )
My instinct is based on the idea that a drug company has put a lot of effort into research and testing that a copycat company can avoid .
However , somebody who comes up with a software concept might have done so in an afternoon , and the copycat company might also have done so .
One way to think of this is that with ordinary property , assigning rights reduces transaction costs .
With intellectual property , assigning rights imposes transaction costs between the owner and the infringer .
The question should now be whether the benefits of the intellectual property rights exceed the transaction costs that are imposed .
With software patents , the transaction costs are very high , and the benefits in terms of stimulating innovation are little , if any .
Note that I have not said that someone should be allowed to copy software .
I think that software copyright is legitimate .
But patenting an idea for what software might do is objectionable , in my view .
I have just read Friedman ’s The Machinery of Freedom for the first time , so expect at least one more post on that book shortly .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The nightmare scenario for U.S. economic authorities is here : confidence in their ability to rescue the country from a housing - led financial panic is now at its lowest level since the crisis began .
The sun lights the exterior of the New York Stock Exchange , as people walk past on the shadowed street , July 16 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Chip East
This means losses for investors , already totaling nearly half a trillion dollars , could mount even further over the next few months , with implications for business investment and the overall health of the economy .
“ You see a massive potential for financial meltdown on a global scale , ” said T.J. Marta , fixed - income strategist at RBC Capital Markets .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , testified before Congress this week on the country 's precarious financial state .
They were met with unusually fierce questions from lawmakers on the feasibility of a plan to provide extra funding for mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N .
“ I will use every power in my arsenal to stop this , ” said Jim Bunning , Republican Senator from Kentucky , berating the Treasury initiative in no uncertain terms .
The government ’s vow to back the institutions largely failed to restore faith in a near - term recovery for battered financial markets .
After a momentary jolt higher on Monday , U.S. stocks ended lower .
The Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday slipped below 11,000 for the first time in two years .
U.S. shares did recover on Wednesday , but this was largely due to a rapid retreat in oil prices than any renewed confidence in credit markets or growth prospects .
“ People ’s horizons are moving out to 2009 and they are still not seeing any end in sight and with credit losses increasing that ’s really not good news , ” said Steve Goldman , market strategist at Weeden & Co. , in Greenwich , Conn .
“ The backstop with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae does n’t deal with heart of the problem : foreclosures , supply . ”
BAILOUT FATIGUE
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together own or guarantee about $ 5 trillion in mortgages , about half of the entire U.S. mortgage market .
The bond market ’s reaction to the Treasury ’s vow to support the government - sponsored entities was telling .
U.S. Treasury bond prices rallied sharply on Tuesday despite a 9.2 percent year - on - year jump in producer level inflation , the biggest in almost 30 years .
This counterintuitive reaction for government debt , whose fixed returns make them highly - sensitive to inflation , indicates just how frantic investors have become .
They would rather hold paper whose value might be eroded over time than face the prospect of immediate losses in riskier assets like equity shares or asset - backed bonds .
“ No one knows where it is going to end for stocks , ” said Robert Macintosh , chief economist at Eaton Vance Corp. , in Boston .
“ Talk about a negative tone , no matter what anybody says or does it seems to get worse . ”
Especially hard hit , U.S. bank shares fell this week to their lowest level since 1996 on fears of seemingly endless losses .
The renewed risk aversion was also salient in very short - term government bills .
The TED spread , the gap between 3 - month bills and interbank rates of similar maturity , has widened to its worst levels since April .
And this has happened even as Libor rates steady , highlighting the acute nature of the safety bid .
Bills rates barely budged on Wednesday despite a pullback in longer - dated Treasuries ’ prices .
At the forefront of investor worries is the collapse of California - based mortgage lender IndyMac .
Regulators seized the company on Friday after a bank run in which customers panicked over the firm ’s survival withdrew $ 1.3 billion over 11 business days .
This was one of the largest bank failures in U.S. history .
THE LENGTHENING SHORT LIST
The scariest thing about it is that things seem to be getting worse rather than better .
Gerard Cassidy , another RBC analyst , estimates that more than 300 U.S. banks could close their doors in the next three years , double what he had estimated back in February .
Only a handful have failed so far .
With a number of banks set to report earnings this week , Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N did surprise the market on Wednesday with losses that were less severe than some had feared .
Nonetheless , confidence in the overall financial system remains in shaky .
Saturated with bad news , investors appear to have thrown in the towel .
As they do this , the risks that both consumers and businesses will face further retrenchment at the same time is growing .
Bernanke appeared conscious of this possibility , using his testimony to back away from earlier assertions that the risks to economic growth had diminished .
“ The possibility of higher energy prices , tighter credit conditions , and a still - deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth , ” he said , even while stressing concerns about inflation .
Back in April , the International Monetary Fund got some criticism for offering an estimate of total crisis - related losses , including insurance and home equity , that reached the $ 1 trillion mark .
At the time , many analysts believed that number was too high .
With the crisis deepening , the estimate may have prove conservative .
It recently emerged that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , or FDIC , has a secret list of about 90 banks that could run into trouble .
Developments surrounding Fannie and Freddie suggest that list could get longer .
“ This incident is not the last one , ” financier George Soros said of the deterioration in sentiment surrounding Fannie and Freddie .
He described the current turmoil as the “ most serious financial crisis of our lifetime . ”
( Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel )
Looks like the “ reveal ” may be a few short years away .
Maybe it will finally be understood just how deeply the rottenness and fraud has gone :
to imagine the IMF investigating the US financial system is unthinkable , or was .
But , at the weekend , Der Spiegel reported that the IMF would conduct a full investigation into virtually every aspect of it .
Der Spiegel wrote that the IMF had “ informed ” Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke of plans that would have been unheard of in the past : a general examination of the US financial system .
The IMF ’s board of directors has ruled that a so - called Financial Sector Assessment Program is to be carried out in the US .
This , Der Spiegel wrote , “ is nothing less than an X - ray of the entire US financial system ” , adding that “ no Fed chief in US history has been forced to submit to the kind of humiliation that Ben Bernanke is facing ” .
The fact that the IMF is knocking on the very doors of its parents and waving legal papers about who lost the house , the car and the kids will , if the past is anything to go by , be buried in the US by pom-pom waving on CNBC telling all what a great time it is to buy .
A little over a year ago– in one of my pessimistic phases– as the subprime mess was just starting to become apparent to the masses , I penned a post about the potential end of the American financial empire .
I pointed out that the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency and the petrodollar allows the US to inflate without experiencing the pain that should follow .
I said that as alternative currencies gain momentum , there was the chance that other nations might ditch the dollar , and send them all back here for that visible inflation to occur in rapid form .
This action by the IMF may be the catalyst .
There ’s already a lack of faith in the American financial position .
Nobody has been willing to publicly acknowledge , though , that the emporer is naked .
Once that happens , it makes it much more likely that other nations will act to protect their interests from being hurt by our economic collapse .
In the long run , fixing our economic system will be a positive event .
But in the long run , we ’ll all be dead .
There may be a lot of pain in the interim .

Fringe GOP candidate spends Hitler 's birthday with neo -Nazis Nick Juliano
Published : Monday April 21 , 2008

An outlandish long - shot seeking the Republican nomination for an Indiana congressional seat spent Sunday at a neo -Nazi gathering celebrating the birth of Adolf Hitler .
Tony Zirkle is running for the 2nd District GOP nomination , but he has no support from local party officials , and the front - running candidate there refused to even participate in a recent debate with Zirkle , for fear of legitimizing his candidacy .
Zirkle said he would speak to any group that invites him , and that he admired the American National Socialist Workers Party 's concern about " prostitution of young white women , " according to WSBT - TV .
Overthrow.com , a Web site associated with the " white advocacy " organization , reported that Zirkle " spoke on his history as a states attorney in Indiana , prosecuting Jewish and Zionist criminal gangs involved in trafficking prostitutes and pornography from Russia and the Zionist entity . "
The comments were forcefully denounced by other local Republicans , the station reports .
" I cannot believe that in 2008 anyone could think so backwards , " Luke Puckett , another GOP candidate for 2nd District congressman , said in reaction to Zirkles comment .
 The R next to Tony Zirkles name does not stand for Republican .
It stands for repulsive , ' " Chris Riley , chairman of the St. Joseph County Republican Party , told WSBT - TV .
" The Republican Party stands for two basic principles : individual freedom and government accountability .
Nazi socialism and fascism is the polar opposite of those two principles so for him to align himself with this puts him at the opposite end of the political spectrum from Republicans .
And the visual images of Tony Zirkle standing in front of a Nazi flag are nauseating and repulsive . "
A look at Zirkle 's Web site suggests his common ground with the neo - Nazis extends even further .
He cites Hitler in his section on the War on Terror , and has expressed anti-Semitic views elsewhere .
Zirkle 's outlandish views have made him a frequent target of political satire blog Wonkette .
And he 's swiftly dismissed as a " fringe lunatic " by fellow Republicans .
Previously , Zirkle has questioned whether racial integration was a good idea , and he 's proposed sending sex offenders to the guillotine .
The suggestion that pornography " pimps " be subjected to the guillotine came during a 2006 campaign against then - incumbent Chris Chocola .
He garnered 30 percent of the vote in that primary .
Chocola decided not to run again after losing to Democrat Joe Donnelly .
Zirkle 's message does n't seem to be eliciting much beyond mockery so far this year .
Only six people showed up for a recent debate featuring Zirkle , which Puckett skipped .
At a discussion board on his campaign Web site , Zirkle is virtually the only author .
Less than half of the 11 posts ( all started by Zirle ) generated any respone , and only one other person posted anything at all .
The axiom of choice
This is one half of a two - part article telling a story of two mathematical problems and two men : Georg Cantor , who discovered the strange world that these problems inhabit , and Paul Cohen ( who died last year ) , who eventually solved them .
The first of these problems — the axiom of choice — is the subject of this article , while the other article explores what is known as the continuum hypothesis .
Each article is self - contained , so you do n't have to read both to get the picture .
Cantor :
The infinite match - maker
Georg Cantor was a German logician who , in the late 19th century , achieved a feat which scientists , philosophers , and theologians had previously only dreamed about : a detailed analysis of infinity .
For Cantor personally , the consequences of this triumph were not happy .
Unable to solve one of the questions his work opened up , known as the continuum hypothesis , he became obsessive and miserable with his failure .
This fixation combined with personal tragedy , the death of his son , and the public insult of having his work rejected as being " one hundred years too soon " , Cantor spent the last years of his life in and out of sanatoria .
Georg Cantor
Cantor 's discovery was that there is not just one infinity , but a never - ending hierarchy , each infinitely bigger than the last .
It 's a mind - bending thought , but the entrance to his exotic world is a surprisingly easy and familiar concept .
Suppose you have two collections of objects .
Call them collection A and collection B . How could you tell which is bigger , or if the two are the same size ?
Of course , you could just count all the objects in collection A , then count all the objects in collection B , and compare the two numbers .
But it might be easier ( and eliminate the risk of losing count ) , to try to match the two sets up : pair every object from A with one from B , until one or the other runs out .
Sets which can be matched up are the same size , and sets which can't are different .
This idea could hardly be simpler , but in Cantor 's hands it yielded an extraordinary discovery : he proved that some infinite sets can never be matched with others .
So immediately we have to conclude that there are different levels of infinity , with some bigger than others .
( You can find more about the consequences of this idea in the second part of this article The continuum hypothesis . )
Sets and politics
Once Cantor had let his infinite cat out of its bag , his new subject , set theory , attracted excitement and scepticism in equal measure .
Through his own work and that of Henri Lebesgue , it quickly became incorporated into respectable mainstream subjects such as analysis and geometry .
At the same time , belief in different levels of infinity seemed to some people to go against human instinct , and even Cantor himself said of one of his more counter - intuitive results " I see it , but I do not believe it " .
So perhaps it 's understandable that many in the mathematical community were reluctant to accept these bizarre new ideas .
Principal among the sceptics was Leopold Kronecker , a purist who believed that the only real mathematics was that which could be reached from the integers ( whole numbers ) in a finite number of steps .
To Kronecker , the rest was all fantasy and fiction .
This attitude was summed up in his saying " God created the integers , all else is the work of man " .
To him , Cantor 's work played far too freely with concepts that came from nowhere : while Cantor generalised about theoretical matchings between theoretical sets , Kronecker would trust only specific matchings between sets which he could write down and understand .
Kronecker went so far as to denounce Cantor as a " scientific charlatan " and " corrupter of youth " , and was one of several influential mathematicians to oppose his work .
Even Cantor 's friend Magnus Mittag - Leffler , the editor of the prestigious journal Acta Mathematica , persuaded him to withdraw his work from publication , as being " one hundred years too soon " .
Paradoxes and axioms
But others were more receptive to Cantor 's ideas .
Inspired by him , the logicians Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell came to believe that the whole of mathematics could be built up from the ground , starting only with basic logic and set theory .
Bertrand Russell
In 1901 , Frege was about to publish the second volume of a work which tried to do exactly that : The Basic Operations Of Arithmetic .
But at the last minute , Russell wrote to him with a discovery which not only undermined Frege 's own work , but also threatened to bring the whole edifice of set theory crashing down .
Sets are collections of objects , and if the set includes the object , then we say that is a member of , written .
Of course some sets are members of other sets .
For instance , the set of Alsatian dogs is itself a member of the set of all breeds of dog .
Theoretically , might it even be possible that some sets are members of themselves ?
Set theorists of the time reasoned that the set of all sets must be an example of a set which was a member of itself .
Russell 's Paradox was a simple contradiction based on this idea : let be the collection of exactly those sets which are not members of themselves .
Then , is a member of itself ?
Think about it !
Either way , you get a contradiction .
Russell 's was not the first paradox to come out of set theory .
In fact , Cantor had discovered one himself , thinking about the size of the set of all sets .
But Russell 's was so simply stated as to be devastating : it led unavoidably to the conclusion that there was something badly wrong with Cantor 's set theory .
Set theory 's awkward adolescence lasted for the first two decades of the 20th century : the main challenge was to resolve Russell 's paradox .
Several people tried , unsuccessfully , starting with Frege , in a hastily written amendment to his treatise , and including in 1923 the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein .
Russell himself did find a way through , and with Alfred North Whitehead , he set about attempting what Frege had not managed : using logic and set theory to put the whole of mathematics on a firm foundation .
Their three volume work Principia Mathematica , published between 1910 and 1913 , showed how to build numbers and other mathematical objects from scratch , using only sets and logic .
Famously , it takes until page 86 of the second volume to prepare the necessary ingredients to prove that 1 + 1 = 2 , which is accompanied by the comment " The above proposition is occasionally useful " .
Early set theory could accommodate infinity , but threw up confounding paradoxes .
Russell and Whitehead realised that it was necessary to be more careful about what could count as a " set " than the naive " collection of objects " definition of Cantor 's era .
The way to resolve Russell 's paradox was to formulate a more restricted definition of " set " , so that nonsensical objects such as Russell 's X and the set of all sets would not be allowed to count as sets after all , and no set would be allowed to be a member of itself .
Their solution was an elaborate stratification of sets , where every set was assigned a level , and only allowed to include as members sets of lower levels .
This sort of system is known as type theory , and its descendants remain important today , especially in computer science .
But the search went on for a freer , less cumbersome foundation for mathematics .
The answer eventually arrived , based on the work of Ernst Zermelo .
Zermelo had been working in set theory since the beginning of the century , and in 1922 , Abraham Fraenkel and Thoraf Skolem discovered how to put the crucial final touch to his work .
What they found was a straightforward list of axioms which govern the behaviour of abstract sets .
This system is known as ZF after Zermelo and Fraenkel .
ZF is such a logically streamlined system that real - life collections of objects ( such as breeds of dog ) do not fit in very easily ( at least without adjustments ) : ZF describes a universe built entirely from abstract sets .
These can be members of each other , but they are not built from more basic objects .
For mathematical purposes , ZF was exactly what was required : strong enough to support the whole of Cantor 's infinite world , but weak enough to avoid the paradoxical monsters he and Russell had found .
The axiom of choice
The purpose of axiomatic systems such as ZF ( or Russell and Whitehead 's ) is to describe the whole of mathematics , or at least a great chunk of it , from a small number of fundamental assumptions .
Principia Mathematica provided the template for building up mathematics from ZF , and this version of set theory still underpins almost the whole subject today : all numbers and virtually every mathematical object can easily be constructed within a set - theoretic universe founded on ZF .
So did ZF prove once and for all that Kronecker and the other doubters were wrong ?
It certainly did look as if Cantor 's infinities had finally been placed on a solid footing .
But all the same , there was one issue which remained mysterious .
The purpose of working from axioms was to make mathematics rigorous so that the leaps of faith and strokes of inspiration which naturally form part of every mathematician 's work can be verified properly from these basic rules .
However , back in 1904 Zermelo had identified a principle which mathematicians use frequently ( and even unconsciously ) , but which did n't seem quite to fit this bill .
In particular it played an important ( though uncredited ) role in Cantor 's original match - making .
The principle is this : suppose you have a collection of sets : A , B , C , etc. , and you want to create another set by taking one element from A , one from B , one from C , and so on .
It seems obvious that you should be allowed to do this .
But sometimes there is no clear way to isolate particular elements from A , B , C , etc .
You may not have explicit lists of their elements , and of course there could be infinitely many of these sets .
If there is a rule you can use to choose an element from each set , then it's no problem : to use Russell 's analogy , if A , B , C , etc. are pairs of shoes , then ZF allows you to say " form a new set by picking the left shoe from each pair " .
But if they are pairs of indistinguishable socks , and if you have infinitely many of them , there is no explicit way to do this .
At least , not without the axiom of choice , which always allows you to say " choose one sock from each pair " .
If you 're dealing with pairs of shoes , you can always pick one .
If it 's socks , though , you 're in trouble .
Paul Cohen : Building different universes
If ZF was the bedrock of mathematics , and the axiom of choice was true ( as most people believed ) , then the presumption was that it should somehow be possible to deduce it from ZF .
Mathematicians spent many years trying to do exactly this , but without success .
This was frustrating : the axiom of choice was a simple enough property , and if ZF was to serve as the foundation of mathematics , then far more complex mathematical questions should be resolvable solely by reference to it .
Or so people thought .
Paul Cohen
However , this hope had to be drastically revised in 1931 , when the great logician Kurt Gödel proved his celebrated incompleteness theorems .
A consequence of these was that ZF does not form a complete system .
That is to say ZF is not after all enough to settle every conceivable question about sets and numbers .
This may seem disappointing , but it is not a particular failing of ZF : Gödel had shown that it would be impossible to write down any system which was complete and simultaneously strong enough to describe ordinary arithmetic .
In 1940 Gödel showed that at least the axiom of choice was compatible with ZF : it does not introduce any contradictions into the system .
Paul Cohen 's triumph was the invention of forcing , a powerful technique for building new universes of sets which obey ZF , but which can be tailored to satisfy extra conditions too .
In 1962 , Cohen used forcing to build a universe which obeyed ZF , but which did not satisfy the axiom of choice .
This was the opposite of what Gödel had shown : it meant that the falsity of the axiom of choice is also compatible with ZF .
So Cohen had proved that the axiom of choice is independent of ZF : it is equally consistent either that it holds , or that it fails .
The world without choice
These days , most people opt to use ZFC — that is , ZF with the axiom of choice added in .
However , it remains an object of study today .
Many interesting criteria have been found which are logically equivalent to it , including some coming from other parts of mathematics altogether .
From the perspective of Cantor 's infinities , an important one is the principle of trichotomy : for any two sets A and B , either A is bigger than B , or B is bigger than A , or they are the same size .
This may seem obvious , but if the axiom of choice is false , then you can find infinite sets which simply cannot be compared to each other .
Some mathematicians do object to the axiom because of its non-constructive nature : it asserts the existence of a particular set , without telling you how to get it or what it looks like .
Certainly , Leopold Kronecker would not have liked it .
As well as having ideological reasons to oppose it , some people are simply intrigued by the peculiar world without choice , where certain ordinary mathematical objects may not exist , and different definitions of what it means to be " finite " may fail to coincide .
That is not to say that the axiom of choice itself does not produce some surprising consequences .
The Banach - Tarski Paradox is the unnerving fact that you can take a three - dimensional ball , use the axiom of choice to chop it into five pieces , and then by only rotating and sliding the pieces around , you can assemble them into two new balls , each exactly the same size as the original .
Strange things happen even in a world with choice .

The Olympics will be the biggest sporting event ever hosted by China In just 66 days ' time , after a three - and - a - half hour opening ceremony designed to " spread the essence of Chinese culture to the world " , the Beijing Olympics will muscle in on TV schedules and news reports across every continent .
China 's Communist Party rulers have been dreaming of this moment for at least 15 years .
Winning and then staging what are sure to be spectacular and successful games will help justify the party 's continued rigid authority , and let it bask in most Chinese people 's excitement to be hosts .
But the games will also be seen as one of history 's most expensive , and well - orchestrated , coming - out parties .
After three decades of breakneck economic growth , the gleaming new airport , sports stadiums , ring roads and underground stations are set to send a powerful message around the world - that China has arrived .
Neighbours ' unease
So how should the rest of us respond ?
It 's a pretty rootless society , highlighted by the fact there 's 100 m people on the move , looking for jobs
Prof Jonathan Spence Clearly it is a moment for celebration , that a country which for large parts of the 20th Century suffered civil war , famines , political mayhem and introversion , is now wealthy , stable and worldly enough to begin the new century with such confidence .
Yet many will also be watching with unease .
For neighbours like Japan or India , China 's revival as an economic and political power is also a challenge , especially over energy resources .
For the US , China 's increased military spending makes it an emerging Pacific Ocean rival .
China 's environmental problems are serious enough for the whole world to choke on .
And it continues to be ruled by an unelected elite ready to lock up critics and pander to nationalism to serve its cause .
' Entry into the big time ' Professor Jonathan Spence , who delivers this year 's BBC Radio 4 Reith Lectures , is well placed to make sense of the competing visions .
Born and educated in England , he moved to Yale University in the US in 1965 and is now one of the West 's most eminent historians of China .
His best - selling books - like The Search for Modern China and To Change China - have explored first European then American attempts to understand the continent - sized country , and also our fascination with it .
" China sees [ the Olympics ] as its entry into the big time , even more so than their huge trade success , " he says .
" There 's a feeling [ in China ] that Chinese were not admired in the West , that China was on the less desirable end of the scale , in sports , and terms of strength .
Now , China is going to take 25 gold medals , some in person - to - person competition .
For people in China , the thought of winning all that is intoxicating , " he says .
Sense of the past
In delivering the Reith lectures , which this year celebrate their 60th year - a particularly propitious anniversary in China - Prof Spence has tried to appeal to a general audience , rather than specialists in China 's long history .
" If you 're not interested in it , it sounds very technical , the dynastic cycle is very hard to sort out , " he says , with a donnish tolerance .
So there are to be four lectures .
The first is on Confucius , the 5th Century BC thinker whose teachings came to dominate Chinese ideas of social justice and family relations .
Confucius was outlawed as feudalistic by the Communist Party after 1949 .
But in the last two decades there has been an upsurge in popular interest - epitomised by the academic - turned - celebrity Yu Dan , whose book on the Analects has sold more than 10 million copies .
The reasons are complex .
New generations are trying to make sense of their past , some fear a moral vacuum now that communism has been upstaged by market economics .
And economic growth has led to tremendous social upheaval , forcing millions of people to leave their rural homes to find work .
" It 's a pretty rootless society , highlighted by the fact there 's 100 m people on the move , looking for jobs .
And there 's no simple formula for moral behaviour that schools can instil .
" So in that sense , Confucius is vacuum filler , and you can pump up different aspects to fill your needs , " Prof Spence says .
The last lecture is about changing Chinese ideals of the body , from the bound feet and queue of the Qing dynasty , to the 7ft6in ( 229 cm ) international basketball and advertising star Yao Ming .
The other two will explore British and American interactions with China - though Mr Spence hints that while British traders were there first , it is now only the US which realises China 's future potential .
" In the UK , one gets the sense that people think it 's just another country , " he says .
Power hold
But what will that future look like ?
The West 's consensus view is that so long as the economy keeps hauling millions of people out of poverty , the Communist Party can survive in power .
Its challenges are enormous .
Twenty million people enter the job market each year and need to be found work .
We could wish they [ the Chinese ] changed much faster , but we should be glad they are changing at the speed they are
Prof Jonathan Spence
A recent increase in local - level protests suggests millions more feel left behind by growth so far , and resentful .
There is simmering popular anger about official corruption and environmental damage .
Yet the biggest challenge will be political .
Can China 's authoritarian leaders , who have risen to the pinnacle of a one - party state , be prevailed upon to accept competing visions of how the country should be governed , and even share power ?
And can they do so before the tensions being stoked by such unprecedented social and economic upheaval become overwhelming ?
Prof Spence does not ignore the risks , but sees more grounds for optimism .
He points to the ballooning number of university graduates , the emergence of grassroots civil groups , and the vast improvement in the education levels of top leaders as evidence that change will have to come .
" The whole idea of representation is being explored .
Remember China had a hard time with representative government , which fell apart under the warlord era [ in 1915 ] .
" China is backtracking into the past , looking for ways of making changes .
We could wish they changed much faster , but we should be glad they are changing at the speed they are , " he says .

Guillermo del Toro 's comic - book fantasy sequel won the weekend with $ 35.9 mil , while '' Journey to the Center of the Earth ' ' thrived at No. 3 and '' Meet Dave ' ' crashed and burned
Hellboy II : The Golden Army type Movie
Moviegoers went to Hellboy II : The Golden Army in big numbers this weekend , propelling the film to a remarkably easy No. 1 finish during one of the busier stretches of the summer .
Meanwhile , Journey to the Center of the Earth was a solid third - place contender , and Meet Dave evaporated in a blaze of fire and brimstone .
As expected , Hellboy II opened strongly , with $ 35.9 million , according to Sunday ’s estimates .
That total far exceeds the $ 23.2 mil that director Guillermo del Toro ‘s first Hellboy movie banked in its 2004 debut .
It ’s also the biggest premiere of del Toro ’s relatively brief career ( Blade II bowed with $ 32.5 mil in 2002 ) .
Universal in particular deserves props for having seen a franchise where many others did n’t , when it got the rights to the Dark Horse comic from Revolution and Sony , which put out Hellboy II ‘s predecessor .
This result almost certainly guarantees the continuation of the adventures of Ron Perlman ’s big red guy .
For now , however , the film must hold on to its audience , especially while competing against The Dark Knight next weekend , a task that could prove challenging considering Hellboy II ‘s merely okay CinemaScore grade of B from a crowd that was 69 percent male and 58 percent older people ( i.e. the kind of folks who also populate Batman ’s fan base ) .
In other words , the sweet smell of success and sulfur may not last for long .
Will Smith ’s Hancock was a solid second - place finisher , earning $ 33 mil on a decent 47 percent decline from its big July 4th opening weekend .
In just 10 days , the movie has $ 165 mil in the domestic bank .
The 3 - D family adventure Journey to the Center of the Earth was next at No. 3 , with an impressive $ 20.6 mil , substantially better than most pundits had predicted … especially me ( mea culpa , with a smile ) .
Brendan Fraser ’s effects - filled update of the Jules Verne classic got a boost from all those 3 - D screenings ( many of which have higher ticket prices ) , and it garnered a stellar A- CinemaScore mark from an audience that skewed slightly older but was evenly divided between men and women .
An interesting side note :
As the last release from the old incarnation of New Line Cinema , Journey to the Center of the Earth is the studio’s third straight successful release , following Harold and Kumar Go to Guantanamo Bay and Sex and the City .
Which , you ’ve gotta admit , is a pretty nice way to go out .
WALL -E finished at No. 4 with $ 18.5 mil on a fine 43 percent decline , and Wanted rounded out the top five with $ 11.6 mil .
In the past week , Angelina Jolie ’s shoot - ’em - up has crossed the $ 100 mil mark along with Steve Carell ’s Get Smart ( No. 6 ) , while Kung Fu Panda ( No. 8 ) now ranks as the year ’s — and Paramount ’s — third $ 200 mil release , following Iron Man and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull .
And , no , I ’m not ignoring Eddie Murphy ’s spaceship comedy Meet Dave , which crashed with just $ 5.3 mil at No. 7 .
But since you ignored it at the multiplex , I ’m not going to waste time writing about this soon - to - be - forgotten film — well , except to say that it will at least earn more than Murphy ’s biggest career embarrassment , the $ 4.4 mil grossing Adventures of Pluto Nash .
Bravo .
Overall , the box office was down a steep 15 percent from the post - Independence Day weekend a year ago .
Although that stands to reason , because at this time in 2007 the country was swept up in Harry Potter mania .
Anyway , now it ’s time for me to fly away on my broomstick .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Slave labor in developing countries such as Brazil , China and India is fueling part of their huge economic growth , according to a State Department report released Wednesday .
Amnesty International activists protest human trafficking during an event in Greece in March .
The department 's annual " Trafficking in Persons Report " found increased allegations of forced labor made in connection with a variety of agricultural products and manufactured goods in developing countries .
In Brazil , the report found a " trafficking phenomenon . "
It said thousands of trafficked and forced laborers had been found on plantations growing sugar cane for Brazil 's booming production and export of the biofuel ethanol .
The report cites shrimp processed in Thailand and Bangladesh ; clothing from Bangladesh , India , Jordan and Malaysia ; and bricks made in India , China and Pakistan as being among the products of booming industries in which workers are subjected to forced labor , debt bondage and hazardous working conditions .
Laws are not adequate to punish those responsible , it adds .
China was found to have a " significant " problem with forced labor , including forced child labor .
Children as young as 12 are reportedly subject to forced labor under the guise of " work and study programs " and subject to excessively long hours , dangerous conditions , low pay and physical abuse .
The report found China 's growing brick industry is fraught with cover-ups of the problem .
For the fourth year in a row , China was put on a " watch list " of countries that could face sanctions if they do n't improve their efforts to combat trafficking .

India was also placed on the watch list for not doing enough to solve its trafficking problem , according to the report .
While commercial sexual exploitation remained a problem in India , the State Department found internal forced labor " may constitute India 's largest trafficking problem . "
It said men , women and children are forced to work in brick kilns , rice mills , agricultural businesses and embroidery factories .
Once again , the report found U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf to have dismal records on trafficking .
Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Kuwait and Oman were listed as destination countries with widespread trafficking abuses .
The report cites forced laborers trafficked from Asia and Africa who are subject to restrictions on movement , withholding of passports , threats , and physical and sexual abuse .
The report found those countries made weak efforts to rescue the workers and prosecute the traffickers .
The other countries on the blacklist are Algeria , Myanmar , Cuba , Fiji , Iran , Moldova , North Korea , Papua New Guinea , Sudan and Syria .
All About Human Trafficking • U.S. Department of State

I recently discovered a self evaluation form that allows you to determine which entrepreneurial skills or aptitudes you have or need to improve upon .
If you are interested in trying it , you can find it here .
In the self - evaluation , there is a category called “ commitment to work contract ” , which basically evaluates your commitment to completing a job , with questions such as : “ I will do almost anything to finish a task on time ” and “ I treat my family , my friends and my own convenience as less important than getting a job done . ” .
I can see what they ’re getting at : you need to be prepared to work A LOT .
But to me , it ’s about working smarter , not harder .
To me , this category should be about project management and time management skills , not how much family time we are willing to sacrifice to get the job done .
Is n’t that why many are shifting to self - employment in the first place ?
To have some flexibility to do other things ?
Anyway , the whole topic got me thinking about being more effective when I am working at home so that the 14 hour days are kept to a minimum .
This is about how YOU work most effectively and efficiently to get the job done and do all the other things you want time for in your life .
Here are a four strategies I use to get the most out of my time at home :
When is your peak efficiency ?
At what time during the day are you most alert , focused and ready to go ?
How long does it last ?
Maybe you work best from 8 am to noon .
But , are so brain dead in the afternoon , you might as well be doing something else .
Then perhaps you get a second wind after dinner for 3 or 4 hours , and voila , there ’s your 8 hour day .
Not quite your typical day at the office , but you ’ve gotten twice as much done as you would otherwise .
For some people it ’s starting a 5 am , others like to work through the night .
The trick here is to pay attention to your internal clock and figure out when your energy is highest .
Do other things during your down time : Exercise , groceries , oil changes .
If you are not the 9 to 5 type , then this works perfectly because you avoid the crowds at stores , the gym , and the garage filled with the people who only have time on weekends and after 5 pm on weekdays .
No line ups , no waiting around = more efficient .
Create a work friendly atmosphere .
Not only have dedicated workspace that is tidy and organized , but make it inspiring and inviting .
Hang art on the wall , have potted plants in the room , play music that helps you concentrate , buy comfortable furniture .
Feeling good in your environment results in improved productivity .
Stir things up once in a while .
If you are uninspired in your normal space , set yourself up with a laptop and work in the dining room or living room , or add a cell phone and go to your favorite coffee shop once in a while .
Sometimes completely new surroundings will help you work better and faster .
Plus , it ’s more fun !
Being flexible and incorporating interesting strategies into your work habits are some of the best advantages of working at home .
Do you have any unconventional ways of improving your efficiency and effectiveness ?

Vanity Fair writer Alex Shoumatoff got himself arrested for crashing Bohemian Grove , a private men's club in northern California for the upper echelon of the rich and powerful .
He was there to spy on the three - week camp they hold every July , where said rich and powerful relax while living in tents in their private woods .
( Nixon was a member , but called it " most faggy goddamn thing that you would ever imagine . " )
The backstory on the weird club , plus the reason for the trespassing and arrest ?
Bohemian Grove has been arguing amongst themselves for the last few years about a plan to cut down and harvest some of the trees in their forest , ostensibly to prevent forest fires .
Member John Hooper resigned in 2004 because of the plan ( even though he owns his own forest , which also harvests trees . )
Hooper asked Vanity Fair's Shoumatoff ( they are former Harvard classmates ) to write about the tree- cutting for Vanity Fair , according to the San Francisco Chronicle .
The connection between Hooper and Shoumatoff pissed off the pro-harvesting club members .
They sent a letter to VF editor - in - chief Graydon Carter , but Shoumatoff did n't quit the story .
In fact , he told the club 's PR flacks to talk and quit hiding information .
( Spy magazine infiltrated Bohemian Grove in 1989 , when Carter was editor there . )
An excerpt from that article , written by Philip Weiss :
" At this point some hamadryads ( tree spirits ) and another priest or two appeared at the base of the main owl shrine , a 40 - foot - tall , moss - covered statue of stone and steel at the south end of the lake , and sang songs about Care .
They told of how a man 's heart is divided between " reality " and " fantasy , " how it is necessary to escape to another world of fellowship among men .
Vaguely homosexual undertones suffused this spectacle , as they do much of ritualized life in the Grove .
The main priest wore a pink - and - green satin costume , while a hamadryad appeared before a redwood in a gold spangled bodysuit dripping with rhinestones .
They spoke of " fairy unguents " that would free men to pursue warm fellowship , and I was reminded of something Herman Wouk wrote about the Grove : ' Men can decently love each other ; they always have , bur women never quite understand . ' "
Anyway , Shoumatoff was captured in the woods by a plumber moonlighting as a security guard on the night of July 13th .
Update !
We hear that he got into the club briefly before being thrown out , contrary to the SF Chroncle reports that he was caught while sneaking in .
US Auto Industry in Meltdown as Ford Loses Record $ 8.7 Billion
The Ford motor companies stock price fell sharply by more than 10 % following news of a worse than expected second quarter record loss of $ 8.7 billion , this follows a first quarter profit of $ 100 million .
Ford has been witnessing a near meltdown in sales from a year earlier with auto sales down 28 % , and truck sales down 36 % , as following the surge in gas prices the once profitable SUV's have now become a liability by clogging up dealer forecourts with unsold inventory and thus contributing to the sales meltdown .
The stock price seems destined towards a break of 23 year lows seen at the start of this month ..
The company also saw revenues plummet from $ 44.2 billion to 38.6 billion .
Ford announced a series of initiatives in an attempt at revive the auto companies fortunes including :
• Developing new fuel efficient small cars and crossovers to North American product lineup .
This includes six European small vehicles that are coming to the North American market .
• Converting three large truck and SUV plants to small car factories with retooling to begin this December .
• Upgrading of the Ford , Lincoln and Mercury models by end of 2010 .
• Doubling hybrid vehicle production and models during 2009 .
• Doubling the capacity for North American four - cylinder engines by 2011 .
• Ford also aims to improve fuel economy on every new model .

Pasties , Pasties Everywhere
Last week , I learned two important things .
They both happened as the result of a post I wrote about various errors , typographical and otherwise .
I noted that the excellent Economist magazine dropped an “ r ” from the word “ pastries , ” inadvertently rendering it “ pasties . ”
Well , The Economist was not wrong but I sure was .
Many readers informed me that a pasty ( pl. : pasties ) is a small Cornish pie often filled with meat and vegetables .
The other thing I learned is perhaps even more valuable .
In the comments section of the pasties post , a reader named Petréa Mitchell informed me that “ You ’ve just encountered Muphry ’s Law ( no , not Murphy ’s ) . ”
According to this site , Muphry ’s law states that “ if you write anything criticizing editing or proofreading , there will be a fault of some kind in what you have written . ”
Now I know .
In other pasty news :
On a long family drive this weekend , we listened to most of the first Harry Potter book on tape .
( Yes , Jim Dale is fantastic ; I truly would listen to him read the phone book , at least the A’s . )
And sure enough , as Harry takes the train to Hogwarts for the first time there is mention of a pumpkin pasty .
Unless I had made my pasty snafu earlier , I doubt the word would have caught my ear .
As it was , my wife and I laughed aloud , hard .
Yet another case of confirmation bias , sort of .
Upon our return , we found that a mysterious box had arrived by Federal Express .
It was the size of a hardcover book but not quite as heavy .
Under the FedEx wrapping , here ’s what the box looked like :
Hmm .
I recently resubscribed to The Economist ; perhaps they were sending me a little gift ?
Well , yes and no .
There was no note but inside lay a pasty :
I have to say , it did n’t look very tasty .
Maybe it had spent too long in transit .
Inside , it looked like this :
The meat was , I believe , chicken .
As you can see , there was also evidence of pea , carrot , and potato .
I assumed that if The Economist was good - natured enough to laugh off my wayward criticism , they were n’t going to poison the pasty .
So I took a bite .
Yum !
While it ’s probably not so smart to eat food that arrives quasi- anonymously in the mail , I took another bite and then a third .
I look forward to my next U.K. trip so I can eat a native pasty .
My sincere apologies to pasty eaters everywhere .
Apologies also to The Economist , and thanks .

The 1970s gave us thousands of hours of music performed by gifted wonderful musicians .
But music journalists from all persuasions , from NME and Rolling Stone to mog.com bloggers are each and all determined to retrospectively eject the contribution of innovators like Herbie Hancock and Joni Mitchell , Frank Zappa and Todd Rundgren and supplant them in the collective consciousness of those of us who were n’t yet born or were n’t paying attention at the time , with an ill conceived C.S.E. grade art project that got exceedingly lucky .
A bunch of lads from London , who just as surely paved the way for Britney Spears and Paris Hilton as they did Simon Cowell and the so - called MTV generation , the Sex Pistols were specifically designed by Malcolm McLaren to produce as much return on as little investment as possible .
The total year on year profits of Boy - Zone , Blue and Take That combined are dwarfed by those of the band which gave us such innovative concepts as spitting on the audience , on - stage substance abuse , slam “ dancing ” and the wearing of Nazi Swastikas as fashion .
The social hangover of punk should be familiar to anyone today living on a housing estate with rising youth knife crime , that to engage in the illusion of control over their own destiny , youths must first rid themselves of any cultural or historical awareness , and fight to protect their ignorance by celebrating the illiteracy of their peers .
Previous to punk the recording industry had laboured under the illusion that for something to sell , it had to be melodic and played by musicians .
Punk , headed by The Sex Pistols , set out to prove that this was bollocks ; that if you marketed it right , if you managed to convince enough people that they were part of ‘ something ’ , even if that amorphous something was substantively ‘ nothing ’ , they would nevertheless rush out in their droves to buy whatever clothes and music they ’d been told to buy , and rejoice in their bought and paid for canned identity , as if it were uniquely their own .
As legions of wannabes line the streets of your home town to audition for the next series of ( insert name of premium rate phone - in freak show “ talent ” TV here ) , desperate for their 15 megabytes of fame , consider the lineage of the manufactured pop act .
Its similarities to the way in which punk was devised can hardly be lost on even the least cynical among you , who continue to buy into the bottle - fed notion that although you did n’t personally “ get it ” at the time , punk nevertheless undid decades of pomp and elitism which needed undoing for not just the British music industry to survive , but youth culture itself .
This lofty ambition , inserted after the fact into the story of punk , once its profiteers blended into the establishment they pantomimed such an unconvincing struggle against , betrays the real world devastating effects which punk had on the music business and how quickly the industry learned from it , that to mistreat the ears of the audience is even more profitable than mistreating actual musicians ; who for decades before Vivian Westward had begrudgingly accommodated each other in a simian act of mutual grooming for the juicy fleas of commercial chart success , fame and fortune .
Punk tilted this fragile ecosystem on its side , rolling the most heavily bug infested chimps onto their backs , exposing their genitals to the yawning wide open mouths of every A&R department in Christendom , each more desperate than the last to suck down every last morsel of mass - produced smegma which squirted from punk ’s white middle class brand of boil in the bag teenage angst , until it was drained and the next money chimp to come along was ready for the milking .
The dawning realisation that while you ca n’t polish a turd , you can nevertheless put it in a pretty box and tie a ribbon around it , came at exactly the right time for a music industry which desperately needed to rid itself of the escalating costs involved in paying people with talent to write , record and promote creative melodic music .
The shitter it is the better it is “ style ” of punk saved many a struggling independent record label , who quickly found themselves swallowed up by the major publishers , savvy to the fashion trend .
The victims of the cull were acts who did n’t comply .
Look through the back catalogue of any artist who ’d been around for a while circa 1978 .
That difficult third album which did n’t sell as well as it should , will contain somewhere on side two , just after the American FM radio rock ballad , a “ punk sounding ” cut , hurriedly mixed to give it “ that raw edge all the kids are going for ” , as the cooking - pot pressure mounted on artists with any degree of substance and taste to “ get with the times ” .
And now here we are , the year 2008 .
The music business has so catastrophically failed to develop an on - line strategy , the UK has become the first place in the world to afford new legal powers to ISPs , to criminalise people who the British Phonographic Industry have deemed unworthy of an internet connection ; who ’s effrontery to show their disdain for the way talent has become nothing more than a genre of TV game show , by turning their backs on what “ the man ” considers to entertainment and instead seek out the sound we love in the collective consciousness of our brothers and sisters in music around the world .
Search Google for live music venues in your area .
Go see a band .
If they can play their own instruments and you like their music , buy a CD directly from them .
Upload it to the internet and tell people who also like it to go see the band live too .
No record companies involved , no Feargal fucking Sharkey making you feel bad about loving music , no obligatory fashion accessories to “ enhance the image ” – you listen to music with your ears and your good taste .
Just maybe , given enough time ( although you ’d be right to say they ’ve had long enough already ) the music industry will wake up to it ’s real failings , which are not based so much in how to more effectively sell shit to deaf cattle ( Cold Play fans ) , but more constructively , how it might rectify decades of greed and London - centric art - house stupidity , by investing in music made by musicians , the development of artist with something to say worth listening to and a way for their fans to be confident , when they pay an artist directly for a copy of their music , that most of the profits will go towards recording and touring , instead of glorified Pepsi ad promo videos and drug rehabilitaion programs .
How about that for a modest proposal ?
Constructing a fair 3 sided coin
For a 2 sided coin , the kind we are all familiar with , being " fair " means that P ( Heads ) = P( Tails ) = .5 . What would a 3 sided coin look like ?
Can a 3 sided coin be made " fair " so P( Heads ) = P( Tails ) = P( Sides ) = 1/3 ?
And how do we know fairness can even be obtained ?
This informal paper explores these questions .
A 3 sided " coin " can take several shapes .
I put " coin " in quotes because it wo n't be a coin as we commonly use the term .
Here are several possible ways a 3 sided coin look , with their outcomes , Heads , Tails , and Sides , labeled .
The first 3 sided coin I thought of was a long triangular prism .
In the first version , each long face is an outcome , and the triangular edges could be rounded to prevent the coin from landing on the ends .
In the second version , each triangular end is an outcome , and the long faces collectively count as one outcome .
Some real life examples of this are the delicious Toblerone chocolate bars , and a ruler ( which is not delicious ) .
Or , for example , these D3 dice
One could also make a 3 sided dreidel ( please forgive my Paint skills ! ) .
In other words , D6 dice with sides 1 through 3 twice are D3 dice .
For example , these .
As interesting as these shapes are , I was more interested in maintaining the coin shape as much as possible , so I chose to focus on a right circular cylinder .
Here is a diagram of a right circular cylinder , our 3 sided coin
David Boll made some postings on this topic on internet newsgroups , and I contacted him around 1998 , saying that I 'd be interested in flipping the coins he made .
( Note , this link apparently is no longer working .
See the last time David 's page was updated on Archive.org here - Justin )
Here are the coins , or varying heights , that he made , with a quarter for reference
The coins , going from left to right , not including the quarter : h = .5r , h = .75r , h = r , and h = 1.334r .
David sent me the coins , and I ended up flipping three of these coins over 10,000 times total !
( Note , this link apparently is no longer working .
See the last time David 's page on the 3 sided coins was updated on Archive.org here - Justin )
From the data , it was determined that the coin where h = r was the most fair , with P( Sides ) = 1240/3800 = .326 .
In David 's own experiments , he obtained P( Sides ) = 319/1000 = .319 .
Intuitively this makes sense , because having h = r makes the coin more die - like .
However , the results could have been flukes .
It is important to note that it is not too clear how to fairly flip such a coin because we now have more than one axis of rotation to think about .
When I flipped them , I tossed them , one at a time , as haphazardly as I could into a wall , and then the coin would fall on to a short carpet , sort of like rolling dice in a game of craps .
I set out to explore the mathematics behind these 3 sided coins .
But first , what reason do we have in thinking fairness , that is , P( Heads ) = P( Tails ) = P( Sides ) = 1/3 , can be obtained ?
For a 2 sided coin , h is small ( see the quarter above ) , and therefore P( Sides ) is very small .
Conversely , think of a Pringles can , where h is very large , thus making P( Sides ) very large .
Therefore , it stands to reason that there is high probability that some h exists between the extremes where P( Sides ) is " just right " .
In Frederick Mosteller 's Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability , Problem 38 reads ( paraphrasing using my terminology of " height " for " thick " and " Sides " for " edge " )
What height should a coin be to have a 1/3 chance of landing on Sides ?
The story goes , the great mathematician John von Neumann solved this problem in his head and provided an answer to three decimal places , all in less than half a minute !
Going by von Neumann 's remarkable work , I tend to believe that story .
The solution : put the coin in a sphere , with the center of the coin being the center of the sphere , then select a random point on the surface of the sphere .
Draw a straight line from this point to the center , and if that line hits the side of the coin , the coin can be considered to have landed on Sides .
Mosteller writes that a theorem from solid geometry simplifies this problem .
Apparently when parallel planes cut a sphere , they produce an " orange - peel - like band " between the planes .
This band is called a " zone " .
The surface area of a zone is proportional to the distance between the planes , and therefore our coin should have a height 1/3 of the sphere 's height .
Let R be the radius of the sphere and r the radius of the coin .
The Pythagorean Theorem gives
R2 = r2+( 1/9)
R2
Solving for ( 2/3 ) R , which is h , gives
( 2/3 ) R = ( sqrt ( 2 ) / 2 ) r
or h ~ .707r
Therefore , to obtain P( Heads ) = P( Tails ) = P( Sides ) = 1/3 , construct the coin so h = .707r .
This theoretical result is surprising because it does not coincide with the experimental result of the best performing coin being where h = r .
In fact , when I originally flipped the coins I obtained P( Sides ) = 138/3800 = .046 using a coin where h = .75r , and David obtained P( Sides ) = 88/800 = .11 .
The discrepancies could be due to statistical flukes , the material of the coin , the material of where the coin was landing , the flipping method , the mathematical theory being too simple , or some combination of these .
For further detailed discussion of 3 - sided coins , I strongly recommend the article Teaching Bayesian Model Comparison With the Three - Sided Coin by Scott Kuindersma and Brian Blais in The American Statistician , August 2007 , Vol. 61 , No . 3 .

I Survived a GOP Convention
by Ryan McMaken by Ryan McMaken
DIGG THIS
Back in the days when I was politically active , I attended a GOP election party with my wife .
Someone at the party had rented out a hotel ballroom , and after the polls closed a couple hundred of us milled about and watched as the returns came in .
Big television screens were tuned to various news channels .
People cheered when Republicans did well and booed when Democrats did well .
The primary function of this event , however , seemed to be to offer a chance for Republican true believers to feel safe among their own kind .
My wife said " this is the largest support group I have ever attended . "
And that is what it was .
I was reminded of this little episode repeatedly when I attended the Colorado GOP convention as a delegate in late May .
I prepared for the event the same way one might prepare for a sentencing following a murder conviction .
I told myself repeatedly it might not be that bad , and at the very least , I would leave with some information , probably unpleasant , that I did n’t have before .
I certainly had not campaigned to be a delegate .
It turns out , much to my surprise , that my GOP membership had never lapsed , and the Ron Paul voting bloc was just so well organized that they managed to elect me as one of many Ron Paul delegates to both the local congressional district convention and the statewide convention .
They did this with precious little help from me .
This is why I forced myself to attend both conventions and to vote with the Paul bloc .
I ’d rather submit to enhanced interrogation than attend a rally or wave a sign or hoot and holler in favor of a political candidate , but the Ron Paul people were so committed to offering an alternative to McCain , the worst GOP nominee in decades , that I had to go and do their bidding .
Unfortunately , the experience would turn out to be what will no doubt prove to be an excellent preview of what awaits all Ron Paul delegates who managed to win seats at the national convention .
Make no mistake about it .
The national convention will be nothing other than a coronation of the nominee approved by the party leadership .
Floor fights or platform debates or dissent of any kind have not been seen at national conventions since the days of yore , and no one in the party with power has any desire to bring such things back .
Locally , things are no different .
The convention for the congressional district here was certainly a lesson in authoritarianism .
The meeting was chaired with an iron fist by some wizened old lawyer who shouted down anyone who dared say anything in favor of Paul .
The other members of the central committee dutifully took dictation .
The 1st CD always votes for Democrats , so the matter of who runs for the seat is of no global importance .
As it happened , however , a person named George Lilly , a Ron Paul supporter , had managed to position himself as the presumptive nominee for the race .
Yet , the McCain supporters were so vexed by this , that they recruited a homeless man to run against Lilly .
I ’m not exaggerating .
The guy ’s address is a homeless shelter .
In spite of the fact that the homeless guy swore that " I understand the global economy completely , " I remained unconvinced and voted for the guy with a house .
The rest of the meeting was cliché as far as Ron Paul stories go .
One of the Paul supporters was thrown out based solely on the chairman ’s whims , and many others were harangued from the podium .
As you can imagine , dear reader , my enthusiasm for attending the state convention was much diminished by the district convention .
Yet I pressed on , getting up early on a Saturday to eat six dollar scones and drink bad coffee at the local suburban convention center .
As I arrived , it became clear that both the Ron Paul supporters and the McCain supporters had done their homework and organized themselves into slates of delegates for the national convention .
The Ron Paul supporters had managed to garner quite a bit of success early on by employing more sophisticated tactics than the McCain people .
At county and district conventions , the Paul supporters had run as slates of delegates in order to concentrate their votes .
At some of the later district conventions and at the state convention , the McCain people had caught on to this , and had organized themselves into ominously titled " Unity " slates .
The party had also recently taken steps to require delegates to disclose their preferred presidential candidate , so by the state convention , the old Paulist tactic of simply stating one ’s position ( " I ’m pro-life , anti-tax , pro-gun , " for example ) while running for delegate slots no longer worked .
So , by the state convention , which delegates supported whom had all become quite obvious , and it had all come down to the Ron Paul slate and the Unity slate .
At this point , defeat of the Ron Paul slate was pretty much a fait accompli .
While the Ron Paul delegates made up perhaps a third of the delegation at the state convention , they certainly lacked the votes to elect their slates or overturn the meeting agenda which had been carefully planned and rushed through by the state ’s central committee .
Indeed , according to his more active supporters , Ron Paul had offered to speak at the convention , but was curtly denied by the state chairman .
Paul supporters were also denied any opportunity to say even one word from the podium in favor of Paul ’s candidacy .
The convention was undoubtedly a valuable education for those who still navely think that political parties are run like democracies .
The struggle within the Democratic Party between Obama and Clinton this year should make that obvious , as should the treatment Paul received at the hands of GOP party leadership regardless of his substantial support among the rank and file .
In modern America , party conventions exist far more as political rallies for the candidate the party leadership has approved , rather than as mechanisms for choosing candidates .
The state convention here was no different as within minutes the event quickly degenerated into a series of doctrinaire short films espousing the unmitigated greatness of the GOP candidates and various other personages who had won the favor of the party ’s central committees .
There were also lots of videos of waving American flags , and people driving pickup trucks on dusty country roads , and gray old men chatting in barber shops , and young men wearing military uniforms .
As the warm fuzzies came to an end , the potential delegates lined up to deliver their little 10 second speeches .
Most notable here were two veterans : a disabled Iraq veteran and an Afghanistan veteran who were both booed by the crowd for supporting Paul .
The sheer amount of venom spewed by the old woman in front of me against the Afghanistan veteran was quite memorable .
And naturally , the crowd cheered loudest after someone held up a " Stop the War " sign .
They did n’t cheer for the sign or the sign holder .
They cheered when a police officer threw her out of the building .
By the end , the Paul supporters were outvoted and everything returned to normal in the party .
No Ron Paul delegates were elected , Mitt Romney gave the keynote address to wild applause , and by the end of the day , the meeting had become what the party had always intended it to be : a support group for fans of John McCain .
We can expect to see much of the same at the convention in September .

We were cleaning out more of the log cabin , and when we started poking through desk drawers , dan and i both laughed when out popped Steve Jobs on the cover of the August 5 , 1985 issue of Fortune Magazine - and the headline read “ The Fall Of Steve Jobs ” … funny article in retrospect too ( see images on the next page ) … filled with great pop cultural references of the time “ John Sculley , 46 , president and chief executive , ruefully remarked that Apple ’s moves were attracting as much attention as an episode of Dynasty . ”
There were also statements like “ No players in the drama have explained publicly why Jobs came to grief .
But several of them , promised anonymity , have revealed the essential details to Fortune . ” ~ can you imagine if any apple insiders were so bold today ?
Ah , how times have changed since 1985 …
Equally worthwhile , the ATT ad that runs next to the article … and the “ Picture Phones : New Spin On An Old Idea ” article that sits next to “ Droids For Sale : Star Wars ’ George Lucas if pushing new technology ” … suffice to say , this is a quality issue of Fortune , and a nice way to get some perspective on exactly how far we ’ve come in the last 23 years …

The Forgotten Genocide
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
Toronto — Canada will soon make an important contribution to the cause of historical accuracy , human rights , and justice .
To coincide with last week ’s visit to Ottawa of Ukraine ’s president , Viktor Yushchenko , the Canadian government announced it planned to recognize the mostly forgotten 1932 — 1933 genocide in Ukraine .
Ottawa ’s decision was motivated as much by ethnic politics as historic justice : there are 1.1 million Canadians of Ukrainian descent .
But Ottawa still deserves kudos for doing the right thing .
For eight decades , the greatest mass murder in modern history has been shamefully covered up or ignored .
I have been repeatedly shocked to receive letters from young Americans and Canadians of Ukrainian descent saying they had known nothing about the 1930 ’s genocide , or " Holdomor , " until reading about it in my columns .
Hopefully , more will now know .
From 1932 — 33 , Stalin and henchmen , Lazar Kaganovitch and Vyacheslav Molotov , conducted a merciless campaign to crush resistance by Ukrainian farmers to communism and collectivization .
They isolated Ukraine , then cut off all food supplies and seeds .
Six to nine million Ukrainians died from the ensuing man-made famine and mass shootings of " anti-State elements " by secret police execution squads .
Cannibalism became common .
Large numbers of Ukrainians were also murdered during the Great Terror of 1936 - 38 in which an estimated 2 million Soviet citizens were shot and the same number died in Stalin ’s concentration camps .
In the late 1940 ’s and early 1950 ’s , the Soviet penal system reached its zenith : 5.4 million people were prisoners in the gulag .
Some 300,000 more Ukrainians were sent to concentration camps under the supervision of Commissar Nikita Khrushchev , and 21,259 were killed in Soviet " pacification " campaigns and against independence fighters .
Other Ukrainian nationalist leaders were assassinated in Western Europe by special Soviet hit teams .
During the same period , Moscow unleashed terror on the tiny Baltic states .
From March to May , 1949 , 95,000 Lithuanians , 27,000 of them children , were sent to concentration camps .
In total , 120,000 Lithuanians , 50,000 Latvians and 30,000 Estonians went to the gulag where the death rate was 51 % per annum .
While the Western world rightly commemorates genocide inflicted on Armenians , Europe ’s Jews , Cambodians , Rwandans , and Bosnians , it shamefully shut its eyes to the Ukrainian Holdomor because it was conducted by a key wartime ally whom President Franklin Roosevelt hailed as " Uncle Joe . "
Nor has the West ever acknowledged genocide against other peoples of the Soviet Union .
In the Caucasus , Stalin sent most of the Chechen and Ingush peoples to the gulag , where 500,000 died .
Yet when the children of the survivors fought for independence from Russia , the West branded them " Islamic terrorists . "
Up to three million Muslims of the Soviet Union died at Stalin ’s hands , including 1.5 million Kazakhs and Crimean Tatars .
Yet no holocaust memorials exist for them .
Nearly 100,000 Moldovans were murdered in a purge conducted by then Commissar Leonid Brezhnev , who would later lead the Soviet Union and be feted by Western leaders .
Add to this butcher ’s bill Volga Germans , Greeks , Cossacks , Armenians and Poles .
If we keep demanding that Germany and Japan atone for their wartime crimes , is it not time for our governments to finally recognize and atone their alliance with the biggest mass murderer in history , Josef Stalin , a man whose crimes exceeded those of Adolf Hitler by a factor of at least three or four times ?
Particularly so in the United States , where World War II has become something of a state religion and is endlessly invoked by conservatives and neocons to justify foreign military adventures .
Neither Roosevelt nor Churchill cared to admit they had allied themselves with a greater criminal than Hitler to wage their " Crusade for Freedom , " nor that the price of this compact with the devil was giving Eastern Europe to the Soviets .
In the end , the Allies destroyed a lesser threat , Germany , and in doing so , created a greater one , the nuclear - armed Soviet Union .
Roosevelt ’s and Churchill ’s alliance with Stalin , whom they knew to be a mass murderer and tyrant , in my view denies the Allies any claim to have been waging a " just " or " good war . "
When the lingering clouds of wartime propaganda finally dissipate , future historians will likely look back on the western Allies as not much morally superior to Germany or the USSR , though certainly less murderous .
Communists and leftists everywhere joined in covering up Stalin ’s crimes .
For example , to the end of his life , Jean Paul Sartre kept insisting Stalin ’s gulag was a fiction created by western propaganda .
The official Communist Party line was that the deaths of millions of Ukrainians was simply an unfortunate natural disaster that also affected other parts of the USSR .
In North America , intense attention to the Jewish Holocaust tended to push all other national historic tragedies into the background or completely eclipse them .
The fact that during the 1930 ’s , many senior officers of Stalin ’s Cheka , or secret police , were Jewish , including Kaganovitch , led to ferocious reprisals against Ukraine ’s Jews in the following decade .
As a result , Ukrainians were permanently branded " anti-Semites " ; their suffering received scant sympathy .
Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky demanded a Nuremburg trial for all the Soviet crimes , but unfortunately this will never happen .
Most of the criminals are dead .
The Soviet Eichmann , Lazar Kaganovitch , died peacefully in Moscow in 1991 ; Molotov died in 1986 .
In fact , not a single Soviet official was ever indicted for the crime committed by the state from the 1920 ’s to 1953 , though many Cheskisti were liquidated during Stalin ’s purges .
Canada ’s recognition of this historic crime is important for two reasons .
First , Canada is one of the world ’s most respected nations .
Its acknowledgment of the Holdomor will be heard around the globe .
Second , nostalgia for Stalin is on the rise in today ’s Russia .
His memory and politics are being rehabilitated .
Russians must to be reminded of his crimes and reign of terror .
In " les abuses de la mémoire , " the Bulgarian - born French philosopher Tzvetan Todorov , who studied the Jewish Holocaust , wrote : " Life can not withstand death , but memory is gaining in its struggle against nothingness . "

No future for PC - exclusive games , says Nvidia Exec , Roy Taylor , believes there will be no more PC - only titles but is optimistic about the " exciting future " of co-existence

Nvidia 's VP of content business development , Roy Taylor , has said he believes the value of consoles means " no - one is going to make PC - exclusive games in the future " .
Speaking exclusively to Eurogamer , he said he was n't threatened by the machines from Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo ; instead he sees an " exciting future " of co-existence .
" I think we have to face the facts - the value of consoles is such that no - one is going to make a PC - exclusive game in the future .
Why would they ?
Why would they ignore consoles ? " said Taylor .
" That said , PC gaming is changing - and consoles do n't threaten PC gaming .
They 're just different .
Adapting to that and understanding that is what I think is really , really important .
" Most PC gamers also own consoles - not all of them , but a lot of them .
What we 're seeing happen is that , yes , people are developing for Xbox 360 , for PS3 - but they 're also developing for PC , " he added .
The reason Taylor is excited is that PC versions of games , which he says are generally " better " , use console code as a baseline , and the better the baseline then the better the desktop conversion .
" The console is now a baseline .
If you look at Gears of War or Assassin 's Creed , they came out on console and they were great experiences - but the PC versions had additional aspects to them that also made them attractive , whether you owned the console version or not , " continued Taylor .
" The PC version was better .
That 's something that people need to get their heads around - the console is a baseline , the PC is going to be an improved version .
That 's an exciting future , and that 's why I do n't see anything threatening about console at all .
Read Eurogamer 's interview with Nvidia 's VP of content business development , Roy Taylor to see what he has to say about the future of graphics , why integrated solutions are ruining everything , and how the PC installed - base means it will never disappear as a gaming platform .
Thupten Samphel , vocero del autoproclamado gobierno tibetano en el exilio , señaló que el líder espiritual se someterá a exámenes médicos ya que ha padecido agotamiento 
El jefe espiritual tibetano , el Dalai Lama , canceló viajes próximos a México y la República Dominicana por padecer de agotamiento y para someterse a exámenes médicos , dijo su oficina el miércoles .
'' Su Santidad el Dalai Lama ha experimentado cierto malestar en los últimos días ' ' , dijo su oficina en un comunicado .
'' Sus médicos personales lo atribuyeron al agotamiento ' ' .

With the increasing amount of WiFi hot spots everywhere , the FBI is warning people to be careful when connecting to unknown wireless networks .
Without the proper protection , it is fairly easy for a villain to capture information broadcasted from your system while being connected to a rogue or compromised access point .
Since most laptops are configured to automatically connect to the strongest signal they can find by default , users are often unaware of the owner of the network they connect to , turning their “ free ” public internet connection into a very costly experience .
Here ’s something else to consider : there are 68,000 Wi -Fi “ hot spots ” in the U.S. ( see the graphic below for the top Wi - Fi countries ) , at airports , coffee shops , hotels , bookstores , schools , and other locations where hundreds or thousands of people pass through every day .
While many of these hot spots have secure networks , some do not , according to Supervisory Special Agent Donna Peterson of our Cyber Division .
And connecting to an unsecure network can leave you vulnerable to attacks from hackers .
( Source : FBI )
To protect yourself against these attacks , there is one simple solution : Disable the automatic connection feature of your wireless client software .
Here ’s how to do it in Windows XP :
Open your control panel and double click “ network connections ” Right click on your “ Wireless Network Connection ” entry , and click properties Select the Wireless Networks tab If “ Use Windows to configure my wireless network settings ” is n’t selected , it probably means you are using a third - party wireless client .
If this is the case , you ’ll have to consult the product ’s documentation to learn about how to disable the feature .
Under Preferred networks , select the top choice and click advanced Select “ Access point ( Infrastructure ) networks only ” Uncheck the “ Automatically connect to non-preferred networks ” box Click on the “ close ” button .
Click on “ OK ”
Voilà !
From now on , you ’ll have to manually connect to any network that has not been added to the “ preferred networks ” list in your wireless connection properties window .
For some , this will look to be more of a hassle than anything , but hey , you know what they say , better be safe than sorry !

Thanks to decreased demand and falling oil prices , the national average price of gasoline has fallen each of the last 13 days , and is now at levels not seen since the end of May .
Since hitting its record high of $ 4.12 per gallon on July 15 , the price of gasoline has fallen 19 cents – over 4 % – and now stands at $ 3.93 , a price not seen since May 29 .
According to Gasbuddy.com , Hawaii is reporting the highest state - wide average price at $ 4.55 per gallon , while Oklahoma is reporting the lowest state - wide average price at $ 3.62 per gallon .
Eleven states and Washington , D.C. are reporting an average price above $ 4 per gallon .
Much of the decline in gasoline prices can be directly attributed to the fact that Americans have started adjusting their driving habits in order to compensate for having to pay more at the pump .
For example , according to Federal Highway Administration , Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles in May 2008 than in May 2007 .
According to an article written by Kenneth Musante and Aaron Smith published on CNN.com ( see the above link ) , Americans have traveled nearly 41 billion less miles in 2008 than at the same point in 2007 .
Assuming the average vehicle gets about 20 miles per gallon , Americans have used over two billion less gallons of gasoline so far this year .
Additionally , the reduction in miles and corresponding decrease in gasoline consumption does n’t take into account the fact that many Americans are still driving the same amount , but have traded in less fuel efficient vehiclese such as trucks and SUVs for cars with better fuel economy such as compact cars and hybrids .
Hopefully even if gas prices continue to fall , we ’ll continue to be mindful of the amount of miles we drive and continue to move towards more fuel efficient vehicles .
Incandescent light bulbs are on the way out by 2012 , thanks to Congress , meaning for now at least that compact fluorescent lamps are on the rise .
The spiral - shaped tubes last longer and use much less electricity than conventional bulbs , both good things .
But they contain small amounts of the neurotoxin mercury , a bad thing .
Compact fluorescents are supposed to be recycled so that the mercury ( which is in vapor form ) can be dealt with properly .
But the tubes do occasionally crack or break , and the recycling rate is currently low , so mercury could be released in homes or elsewhere , posing a small risk to children .

Robert H. Hurt , an engineering professor at Brown University , along with a student , Natalie C. Johnson , and others , set out to see what could be done to reduce the risk .
They report in Environmental Science and Technology that they have developed a material that can capture the mercury released from a broken tube .
Within a July 18 , 2008 Freedom of Information
Act response from the National Transportation Safety Board , the NTSB indicates that it possesses no records indicating how wreckage recovered from the 4 aircraft used during the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 was positively identified as belonging to the 4 planes reportedly hijacked that day or even if such wreckage was positively identified at all .
Within a similar March 18 , 2008 FOIA response from the Federal Bureau of Investigation , the FBI states the following :
" The identity of the three hijacked aircraft has never been in question by the FBI , NTSB or FAA "
http://www.infowars.com/?p=886&cp=1
However , NTSB factual reports pertaining to the Flight Data Recorders allegedly belonging to American Airlines flight 77 ( N644AA ) and United Airlines flight 93 ( N591UA ) , do not cite a " Flight Data Recorder Group " , that would normally consist of Federal Aviation Administration and airline officials , in possession of records pertaining to a given aircraft and unique serial numbers pertaining to each FDR .
The absence of published FDR part and serial numbers within each NTSB FDR report suggests that the NTSB were not provided access to such records that would allow them to confirm the identities of the FDRs studied by them .
Many FDRs possess unique memory configurations that are identified by serial numbers contained within a given aircraft 's records .
Such serial numbers are required to facilitate FDR data readouts .
Presumably , if the recovered AA 77 and UA 93 FDR's did not possess the memory configurations indicated within FAA and airline aircraft records , a mismatch could become apparent to NTSB investigators .
http://www.911blogger.com/node/16089
The FDRs in question were apparently recovered by NTSB personnel .
Carol Carmody , Vice - Chairman , National Transportation Safety Board , referring to the NTSB :
" I ... assured FBI Director Mueller that we would assist in any way we could ... he called and said , " Could you send us some people to help find the black boxes and help identify aircraft parts . "
http://www.ntsb.gov/speeches/carmody/cc020227.htm
Marion Blakey , Chairman , National Transportation Safety Board , referring to the NTSB :
" Over 60 Safety Board employees worked around the clock in Virginia , Pennsylvania , New York , and at our headquarters in Washington , D. C. , assisting with aircraft parts identification "
http://www.ntsb.gov/Speeches/blakey/mcb020625.htm
The text of the July 11 , 2008 NTSB FOIA request :
" I respectfully request copies of records revealing the process by which wreckage recovered from the aircraft used during the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , was positively identified as belonging to : American Airlines flight 11 ( N334AA ) , United Airlines flight 175 ( N612UA ) , American Airlines flight 77 ( N644AA ) and United Airlines flight 93 ( N591UA ) .
The afore mentioned aircraft are identified within numerous public NTSB records .
Positive wreckage identification was presumably obtained through the use of unique serial number identifying information contained by the said aircraft 's wreckage .
Within U.S. Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) , Title 14 , Part 45 , it is indicated that all U.S. commercial civil aircraft are required to contain numerous components bearing unique serial number data " secured in such a manner that it will not likely be ... lost or destroyed in an accident " .

The BPS Research Digest covers a recent study finding that volunteers are actually more committed than paid staff in an organisation , in line with studies showing that payment tends to reduce people ’s productivity and enjoyment for the same work compared to when it ’s done for free .
A recent study published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics tested this by asking students to complete ‘ IQ test ’ style questions for varying amounts of money , or by ‘ incentivising ’ some students on a charity collection day while others collected for free .
In this paper we have provided quantitatively precise evidence , in a controlled environment , of the effect of the introduction of monetary compensation on performance , which includes a precise comparison of the cases in which the reward was given in different quantities or not given at all .
The result has been that the usual prediction of higher performance with higher compensation , when one is offered , has been confirmed : but the performance may be lower because of the introduction of the compensation .
In other words , those who were paid more worked harder than those who were paid less , but the hardest work was done by those not paid anything at all .

For online retailers cranky about a controversial new law in New York requiring them to collect sales tax on purchases shipped to that state , Newegg has an solution : do n't do it .
Newegg , a Web - only merchant that sells computers , accessories and consumer electronics products , has reversed its policy of collecting sales tax on New York purchases , the company confirmed .
When the law took effect June 1 , Newegg began collecting the tax like other retailers .
It was not immediately clear what prompted the change , and company spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment .
The tax provision sits in a murky legal area that online retailers and some tax - policy analysts say places an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce .
Amazon , which is collecting the tax , has filed a lawsuit against New York , charging that the measure is " invalid , illegal and unconstitutional . "
The most relevant precedent is a 1992 Supreme Court ruling involving a mail - order company that concluded that a business must have a physical presence in a state in order to be responsible for collecting sales tax on purchases shipped there .
Under the new law , New York is requiring online retailers that derive sales through referrals from affiliates who live in the state to collect the tax , even if they have no employees or operations there .
Like many online retailers , Newegg maintains an affiliate program .
Web site owners who post banner ads and links promoting Newegg earn commissions of 1 percent to 2 percent of the sales they refer .
The new law led one store , Overstock.com , to drop its affiliate program in New York .
Overstock has joined Amazon in its legal dispute against the state .
New York estimates that the provision will generate $ 50 million in revenue for the state in the fiscal year .
Tax experts look to other cash - strapped states to adopt similar measures if the New York law holds up in court .
Newegg collects sales tax on purchases shipped to California , where it is headquartered , and New Jersey and Tennessee , where it maintains operations .
On the policy page of its Web site , Newegg states that , " Sales tax is only required for orders shipping into states where we have or may have nexus for state tax purposes under applicable laws . "
When companies do n't collect sales taxes on out - of - state purchases , the consumer is still responsible for paying it in the form of a use tax that is reported on the state income tax return .
Most people either do n't know about that rule or ignore it .

ここで重要なのが， 線で考えずに箱で考えなければいけないということです。夏休みという線は40日と長いのですが，
1日を箱として考えると40個の箱が積み重なっているだけです。
夏休みの半分が過ぎた段階で20個の箱が消えているのです。
「 これって， かなりヤバくないですか？ 」
1日の仕事でも考えは同じです。1時間を箱として考えると1日は8箱しか与えられていません。
1時間経過する毎に箱が失われていけば， あっという間に時間が過ぎていることに気付くでしょう。
もう一度繰り返しますが ，
「 1日は長いようで短いのです！ 」
天使の習 慣
「 仕事をタイムボックスで区切って時間割を作りましょう」
タイムボックスで区切って時間割を作ることで， やるべき仕事が明確になり， 仕事の進み具合を計りやすくなります。
小学校時代を思い出してみてください。小学校の時間割では，
1時限目は国語の授業， 2時限目は体育の授業など， 1日の勉強する科目がタイムボックスで区切られていたと思います。
時間割を見れば， 何時から何の勉強をするのかが一目瞭然です。授業の開始と終了にはチャイムが鳴るので区切りがはっきりしています。
もし時間割がなければ， 毎日何時から何の勉強をすればよいのか毎回考えなければいけません。前日に予習しておくことも難しいでしょう。
時間割は ，
「 日々の勉強をリズミカルに進めていくためのレール」
のようなものです 。
仕事をする上でもこのレールを引いてリズミカルに仕事を進めることで，
時間に対する意識も高まり， 余計なことを考えることなく 「 やるべき仕事 」 に集中することができるのです。
しかし， 集中して仕事をしていると知力・ 体力ともに消耗してしまいます。小学校の授業後に休み時間があったように， 集中して仕事をした後には， 頭と身体をクールダウンさせるための休憩時間を用意しておかなければいけません。
そこで， 「 ⁠集中時間 （ 45 分 ⁠）⁠ 」 と 「 休憩時 間 （15分⁠）⁠」を1セットとした1時間のタイムボックスを作ります。このタイムボックスを８回
（合 計８時間） 繰り返すことで， 集中する時と休憩する時のメリハリをつけながら，
1日の仕事を効率よく進めることができるのです。
下記が， 筆者が使っている時間割のサンプルです 。
時間 月 火 水 木 金 朝のあいさ つ

18:45 - 19:30 予習・ 復習 ※ カッコで書いている枠 はGoogle20 % ルール （後述） を適用している枠で す
ポイントは， 時間軸を決めているということです。毎時0分から45分までが集中時間 （仕事中⁠）⁠， 毎 時45分から15 分までが休憩時間 （休憩中） という軸を作っています。
こうすれば時計をチラっと見ただけで， やっている仕事と時間配分を瞬時に判断できます。
も う1つのポイントは， 小学校の授業に見習って， 朝のあいさつとしてサインアップする時間，
お昼休みとその後の掃除の時間， 放課後の予習･復習時間をとっていることです。
サインアップの時間では， 時間割を見て今日のやるべき仕事の再確認を行います。掃除の時間では，
机の掃除や身の回りの資料整理などを行います。最後に， 放課後の時間で， 積み残しの仕事や明日の仕事の準備を行います。
人によってベストな時間割は異なると思いますが，
1日の時間の使い方を工夫することで集中して効率よく仕事をこなすことができるようになります。

Petrofraud and the New Depression Michael Fox
email :
June 30 , 2008
Petrofraud is a word I coined to describe the the great con job that is the Bush administration ’s policy – that policy is the only policy they have or have ever had , with respect to energy , foreign affairs , war and our economy .
All of it has been about oil .
And the present speculative bubble is the crowning achievement of the scheme .
They are laughing all the way to their banks in Dubai , Switzerland , and , no doubt , Paraguay .
A superb assessment of the pathology of this sociopathic bunch can be found in Charley Reese ’s chilling column , America is the Rogue Nation , which details the lengths to which they are going – in our name – to achieve their nefarious goals .
We are being robbed into bankruptcy to enrich a relatively small oligarchy , within which an even smaller group are retaining unimaginable wealth .
Once these statements would have sounded outlandish ; the ravings of an extremist .
Now , however , we all know it to be true .
Even those who still fancy themselves “ conservative ” know what ’s happening , though many of them retain their allegiance to the Republicans as a form of faith .
What is it about faith that makes it so devastatingly ruinous ?
It is simply this : it is the belief in something or someone just because …
Because one wants to believe it , or because one was raised to believe it ( even if further education proved it wrong ) , or because one voted one way and does n’t want or ca n’t process the idea that it was so dreadfully wrong .
So they become more fiercely adamant in their wrong - headed convictions .
But heads are coming out of the sand .
As the zeitgeist has shifted , thanks to the indefatigable efforts of Al Gore and countless others , the public has awakened to the need to reduce our energy usage and shift to renewable , non-polluting resources .
Auto manufacturers have slammed shut whole plants and discontinued models of large trucks and SUVs as gasoline flirts with $ 5 / gallon .
The interesting part about $ 5 / gallon gasoline is that it is the point at which people significantly change their habits ; for some , it becomes their only non-sustaining expenditure ( outside food , home , and utilities ) .
The person who had only $ 200 / month after basics can no longer buy clothes .
Hell , they can barely afford to dry clean the ones they have .
That extra $ 200 / month is going to fuel tank and increased home utilities bill .
The oilmen in the West Wing are squeezing the last dime out of the public for their cronies in Houston .
In a Depression , there ’s no spare change .
Ironically , Bush ’s legacy may well be that it was through his ill - gotten and mismanaged stewardship that the American public became serious about conservation and self - sustenance .
The same could have been achieved by a president who understood the good that government can do ( rather than how much he could steal from it ) by placing high taxes on gasoline when it was still $ 1 / gallon as Bush took office .
Had a $ 4 / gallon tax been levied at that time , the oil companies would have still been profitable , but the hundreds of billions of dollars they have raked in over the past 7 years would have been going to maintain a domestic infrastructure that is now the disgrace of the developed world .
Had we been paying high prices for gasoline due to a tax , the change in the public mindset would have occurred just the same .
That infrastructure improvement would have , included electric - charging , biofuel , and hydrogen stations , as well as modern rail service .
The oil bubble could never have occurred , because by this time usage would be flat or reduced , and the meme about shortages would n’t have been applicable .
Either way , the change in mindset has been achieved .
Every day , more gas - guzzling vehicles are retired and replaced by cars that get twice the mileage , airlines are cutting flights and cramming more passengers into fewer planes , and people are using their air - conditioners more judiciously .
In the end , changing the driving habits of Americans will be spun as Bush ’s greatest achievement .
Of course it came as a way to benefit his cronies from Riyadh to Houston , but it there it is .
The major difference is in who ’s angry .
If a large tax had driven up the price , and in return for it the United States had initiated a massive infrastructure project – adding modern train lines , additional subway lines , and substitute fuels – the conservative anti-tax crowd would be furious .
As it is , the only people who are happy are those getting larger dividend checks from their oils stocks , and those who have speculated successfully in oil futures , although I suspect most of them grouse at the pump just the same anyone else .
My guess is that both of those investments have rather worn out their welcome .
Meanwhile , the infrastructure that was n’t maintained with those same hundreds of billions of dollars has decayed .
The other achievement from these policies will be losing the entire Mississippi River basin and all its tributaries for the Republicans : from the levees in New Orleans , to the Bridge in Minnesota , through the levees and farmland in Iowa , Missouri and Illinois , the breadbasket knows where the blame lays .
What to do Now
So it is incumbent upon all of us to further cut our consumption now , as one should during wartime anyway .
The sacrifice of this war should be against those who are really waging it at our expense ( the oil companies and crude speculators ) .
Petrofraud has brought us here , and minimizing our use of what has become as basic as food will be our out .
Ride share ; plan your trip to minimize your mileage ; retire your car and replace it with a more efficient model as soon as possible ( and if you can select an American car with high mileage , you will be sending a vote to Detroit saying you want more of these models , and saving a domestic manufacturing job ) ; and buy locally grown produce ( this is a step that will improve your diet and save thousands of gallons of diesel ) .
As there ’s no doubt that gasoline prices will plummet after Labor Day ( banking on short memories in November ) :
Do n’t be fooled .
It ’s the end of the con .
Author ’s note :
This week I would like to given a special shout - out to Martha and Sylvia , who , while having been married for years in the eyes of our family and everyone they know , are now married in the eyes of the law .
Brava , ladies !
At last .

Michael Foxemail : TheCulturedEconomist@yahoo.com June 30 , 2008
Here ’s another mind - boggling example of CNN ’s bias , as they show a horrific video of the indoctrination of 5 - year old Palestinian children into terrorism — and clip out the worst part .
Here ’s the CNN report , and here ’s the full video of this depraved event :
Youtube Video
Second Draft has the full story behind the video , and CNN ’s selective editing : CNN Cannot be Trusted - Here ’s Why .
One of the best things about war is that it ’s a huge IQ booster .
The only people who use their brains in peacetime are the suits : salesmen , real - estate agents .
The rest of us just slog along for the paycheck , get home and get on the computer so we can have a virtual war .
But once real war comes to town , every guy turns into MacGyver , thinking up ways to convert harmless civilian items like alarm clocks and remotes into killing devices .
The Shia militias in Iraq have just demonstrated this kind of killer ingenuity by finding a new way to say “ thank you ” to their American friends using nothing but a few unguided 107 mm rockets , propane tanks , and a used truck .
It ’s like the kind of problem they give you in those online intelligence tests : how can you use a crummy unguided rocket , a lowly propane tank , and a junker of a truck to blast a heavily - defended US base in Baghdad ?
Let ’s start with the most important ingredient , the rocket .
The Shia have been using Type 63 107 mm rockets , an old design that was sold all over the world in huge numbers .
They ’re usually called “ Soviet ” but most of the sales were by the Red Chinese , who back in the good old days of the Cold War sold Warsaw - Pact weapons at a fraction of what the lazy Russians wanted .
Yup , even back then they were beating the white folks on price .
The 107 mm model weighs about 41 pounds , about a fifth of that is the HE warhead and the rest rocket propellant .
If you have n’t seen many unguided , barrage - type rockets you ’ll be surprised how short they are .
They look almost like stretched artillery shells .
And that ’s what they were meant to be : artillery substitutes .
They ’re the direct descendants of the famous Katyushas that were fired in huge numbers on the Eastern Front .
The Katyushas could be fired from simple multi-barreled two - wheel towed launchers or trucks with firing rails welded to the bed .
They had long range and tremendous firepower .
Their defects were accuracy , as in they had n’t got none , and re-supply , because barrage rockets basically trade off the weight of an artillery piece for added weight in the shell — the weight of the propellant .
If you think about that tradeoff you can see why rockets have gotten so important for irregular warfare , and why artillery , with the exception of mortars , does n’t play much of a role in irregular arsenals .
In a traditional artillery piece , the investment is in the heavy tube and the carriage to move it .
The projectile is relatively small ; the tube and carriage are huge and heavy .
That ’s fatal for insurgent forces .
They never have air superiority or even try for it , so the first time they try to push an artillery piece into position , they get zapped .
And even if they get lucky and fire a few shots with it , how do they hide it , with enemy choppers heading at full speed for what their computers have identified as the point of origin for that incoming shell ?
Nope , if you ’re an insurgent artilleryman , what you want is a light tube , as in an RPG or , for longer range , a barrage rocket like these Type 63 .
The downside is that you ’re going to be damn lucky to hit anything with those rockets .
I ’m not talking about the RPG here , because that ’s a simple , line - of - sight weapon , the original point - and - shoot .
A barrage rocket has a much more complicated trajectory ; firing one is a geometry problem , not simple aiming .
And in Iraq , most of them are fired into urban areas , so if your local math whiz forgot to carry the one or dropped a decimal point somewhere , your rocket salvo is going to wipe out half a tenement block instead of the US base you wanted to hit .
To get an idea how casual the traditional insurgents were with their barrages , have a look at this video of 107 mm unguided rockets on simple rail launchers being fired by Iraqi insurgents .
This video has two parts : the first shows insurgents setting up a salvo of 107 mm rockets , an then they go on to the main event , the launch of a half - dozen huge 240 mm rockets .
What ’s scary , or funny depending on your mood , about the first part of the video is how casual they are about the 107 mm salvo .
They use what look like fixed rail launchers that somebody just unscrewed from a truck bed or — God knows — welded in a basement .
First you see all the pretty little rockets and launchers in a room , then you see them set up on a typical Iraqi dust - field .
( It looks way too much like Kern County , that field .
That ’s one of the first things that bummed me out about Iraq , the way it looked like Bakersfield . )
The insurgents run in their shirts , tinkering with them for all the world like geeky model - rocket hobbyists you remember from kid-hood .
You know , the guys later known as “ One - Eye , ” or “ Doug with the Artificial Hand . ”
The insurgents do n’t seem too worried about air attack , because they set up a whole chorus line of the 107 , walk around checking the angle , and then , just when you ’re waiting for the launch , damn it , they cut to another attack .
But just from the set - up , you can tell they ’re not going for accuracy .
A carpenter ’s level would give you better accuracy than a bunch of unguided rockets fired from bumpy ground on fixed - angle rail launchers .
That ’s probably why they ’re firing about 40 rockets at once — in the hope that maybe one or two will hit the target .
The rest are going to make life very exciting for civilians anywhere within miles of the intended target .
If there was a pebble under the 17th launcher in that row , then rocket # 17 is going to fly over the target and land in a street , or somebody ’s house , or empty land .
No wonder those people say “ It is the will of Allah ” so much .
I hear that up in Afghanistan , where they really believe in Allah , they leave it up to him so much that the Talibs just lean a few 107 mm rockets against the rocks , pointing in the general direction of an ISAF base , hook ’em up to a battery - powered alarm clock for a detonator ( so they have an alibi when the rockets launch ) , and leave the aiming to Allah .
Iraqis are a little more advanced than Talibs , but they ’re pretty damn casual about their 107s .
They do n’t seem to value the weapon much .
You can see the difference in the second half of the video , when the insurgents switch from little 107 mm ’s to their pride and joy , big 240 mm rockets .
It ’s clear the bastards love these things .
The guy who made the video first shows the 240 mm rockets , a half dozen of them , sitting on little prayer rugs in some Hajji ’s house .
You soon see they are n’t going to waste their 240 mm ’s on sloppy fixed - rail launchers .
Instead they crank up these relatively sophisticated adjustable launchers , out in some other dust - bowl field .
They actually seem to worry about getting the angle right , not so much because they care about civilian casualties but because these big rockets are a lot harder to come by .
For one thing , it looks like the field ’s been artificially leveled — you can see piles of dirt off to the side .
Of course maybe they ’re just using a construction site , I do n’t know .
Unlike the 107s , the video actually shows the 240 mm ’s launching .
The launch is so fast and so intense it almost looks like a detonation .
When you realize it ’s nothing compared to what ’s going to happen at the other end of this short flight , you realize what crazy shit these people are playing .
Supposedly the Shia “ special groups ” are getting these 240 mm rockets from Iran , and that ’s the angle we ’re playing up in our propaganda .
I do n’t know if they ’re from Iran or not , but to be honest these Iran stories want to make me go , “ No shit , Sherlock ! ”
Did n’t anybody in Cheney ’s office look at a map before they planned this invasion ?
Nobody noticed that Iran is right next door to Iraq , and hates America like poison ?
Suppose our worst enemy in the world was dumb enough to invade Canada or Mexico ; I sure hope we ’d have the guts to start shipping the insurgents there everything we had .
What kind of idiot did n’t plan for Iran doing the same ?
You might as well get mad at a rattlesnake for biting you when you tease it .
The only real surprise for me is that Iran is playing it so cautious , instead of pushing the Shia insurgency pedal to the floor .
But then that ’s the Persians ’ rep : crazy but smart , and cautious , playing for the long term .
These 240 mm rockets have a 40 - pound HE warhead .
That ’s a serious blast .
To see what the smaller 107 mm rocket does when it hits , here ’s another video from the “ Incoming ! ” angle : a video from a US base in Iraq .
The guys in the sentry post do n’t seem very worried ; they ’re sandbagged in , and bored .
They see the launch , and then talk about how long it ’s taking the rocket to hit .
Finally somebody off to the side yells “ incoming ! ” just like in the movies , and the camera pans to a long shack with one ended blasted open and smoking .
One of the guys at the sentry - post sums it up for you : “ Fuckin ’ Hajji motherfuckers ! ”
My all time favorite fun video of an Iraqi rocket attack is this one :
These bored GIs are killing time on - base by test - flying their little model helicopter .
It ’s the dorkiest thing I ’ve ever seen , and I used to play D&D. Remember I said the Iraqi insurgents setting up their rockets reminded me of model - rocket hobbyist kids ?
Well , this video is where model - airplane hobby meets real - life rocket attack , because after a few seconds of watching this lame model chopper with pingpong balls for landing gear fly around a parking lot , a cheerful animated voice pipes up from the base PA system , “ Incoming , incoming , incoming ! ”
The guy working the model helicopter says one of the funniest things I ’ve ever heard : “ I hope it was n’t my helicopter ! ”
Well , he can relax , sort of , because it ’s a salvo of insurgents ’ rockets , being fired by those rocket nerds just like the ones in that other video .
Nobody gets hit , the model flyers hide and laugh , but I dunno — this clip makes me feel like Butthead says about an arty video : “ This MEANS something . ” I do n’t know what , except that we ’re all a bunch of nerds .
Maybe they should just call off the war and stage a big comic con instead .
After a few hundred attacks like that , where a few sheds got blown up at best , the Shia insurgents came up with their MacGyver solution , the new IRAM .
“ IRAM ” is one of those Iraq - war names you ca n’t say with a straight face .
Like VBIED , which means “ car bomb ” to us civvies .
But “ IRAM ” — it ’s like some porn thing : “ IRAM U , Yankee dog ! ”
What it stands for is “ Improvised Rocket Assisted Munition . ”
What it actually means is that these smart little nerds have figured out a way to use the crummy unguided 107 mm rocket effectively in urban combat .
They basically turn it from a long - range barrage weapon with a small warhead to a short - range lob - bomb .
It ’s basically a remake of the old siege mortars that European armies used once they were close enough to an enemy city ’s walls .
The siege mortars , which look like extra - thick , tilted cauldrons , had no range , but they coughed up huge shells at a very high angle , so they could sail right over any fortification to make life more interesting for people huddling in town .
The IRAM does the same thing , lobbing a big explosive load over sandbagged walls into US and Iraqi Army bases .
The extra punch is provided by a simple propane tank .
If you ever went trailer - camping like we did , you know and love these things , big steel cider bottles you can get refilled at country gas stations .
What I remember most is they ’re the only things on earth that do n’t hold to the “ righty tighty , lefty loosey ” rule , which made my dad furious every time I forgot it and stripped the screws , which was every single time .
Here ’s a shot of an Iraqi propane tank , from a GI ’s blog .
Wonder if he knew what these guys were going to use it for :
The Shi’ites just fill these tanks with explosive and strap them to 107 mm rocket .
That gives the IRAM a huge warhead , dozens of times more powerful than the charge in the original 107 mm warhead .
When US bomb experts checked out the IRAMs in a failed attack on June 24 , they found that each one had 200 pounds of HE .
Of course all that lopsided explosive is going to weaken the rocket , lessen its range and screw up its trajectory , but this is supposed to be a short - range weapon .
The insurgents weld it onto a truck bed , on one of those rail launchers .
I ’d guess , from the little I can remember from Sophomore - year Geometry , that they want a very high angle , almost a vertical launch , to shorten the range and clear all barriers .
Next they have to get the truck into position .
And here ’s where that old Arab imagination , or “ lying , ” gets to work .
And when it comes to serious , professional lying , the Shia who are using these IRAMs just seem to be a cut above those hysterical , impatient Sunni .
Last April , a guy in Sadr City managed to use our own civilian - compensation system to launch a successful IRAM attack on a US “ Joint Security Station . ”
He came in whining that his truck had been hit in a firefight between US troops and Insurgents and claimed compensation .
The Civil Affairs unit told him to park his truck across from the base and they ’d check it out later .
He parked it right where they said , and in a few minutes eight IRAMs blasted out of the truck trailer and landed in the middle of the base , wounding 15 soldiers .
That ’s the kind of operation that makes an urban guerrilla very happy , not so much because it breaches a heavily - defended outpost but because it means the foreign troops are going to be very , very cautious about listening to any more civilian complainers .
And that ’s the strategic goal for the guerrilla , breaking down any link between the people and the occupying army .
Of course all this MacGyver -ing has its own hazards , as in premature detonation destroying an entire neighborhood .
That happened this June in Baghdad , when a truck full of IRAMs blew up on a street near a US base , killing 18 civilians .
But one of the grimmest lessons of guerrilla warfare is that that ’s not necessarily so bad either ; the locals ca n’t persuade the guerrillas to go away , so they usually react to this kind of disaster by blaming the foreign occupier , hoping they ’ll go away so the whole mess will stop .
As far as I ’ve been able to tell , there ’s only been one really successful IRAM attack .
It was at Fort Loyalty in eastern Baghdad — Shia territory , Sadr country .
That makes the name “ Fort Loyalty ” kind of painful .
“ Fort Do n’t Count on It ” might be better .
In April 2008 , “ special groups ” who you can bet were operating with Sadr ’s and Iran ’s blessing fired 14 IRAMs into the base from a truck , killing three GIs .
Of course , war is an IQ booster for both sides , so we ’re going to develop countermeasures for the IRAM .
Most likely , though , the countermeasure will involve limiting contact with the locals .
No more letting them park their dinged - up trucks next to the base to collect damages .
US / Iraqi Army bases will definitely become a “ No Parking ” zone .
That ’ll limit the damage these IRAMs can do .
But that ’s assuming the point of the IRAMs is to blow up US bases .
That ’s not really the point , strategically .
The point , like I said , is to push the occupying army and the local people as far apart as possible , make them hate and fear each other .
Those are the conditions an urban - guerrilla movement needs to operate successfully .

Low birth weight has been linked to later problems
Blood vessel changes linked to poor health later in life can be spotted within a few years in boys born small , say scientists .
Eight - year - olds who were smaller at birth were more likely to have " vascular resistance " , reported the European Heart Journal .
The Southampton University team said this could contribute to high blood pressure decades later .
However , no such problem was seen in low birth weight girls .
Previous work has linked birth size to later heart disease and diabetes .
Future studies will focus more on childhood in an effort to better understand the processes that lead to disease and to seek to reverse them before it is too late to do anything about it
Dr Alexander Jones
Southampton University
None of the 140 eight or nine year olds tested in this study would showed any actual signs of heart disease , a condition which normally emerges far later in life .
However , scientists believe that even at this age , the arteries of these children may show differences which might raise the risk of problems decades on .
In particular , they tested for how a child 's response to stress might affect vascular resistance , a property of blood vessels which makes it harder for the blood to be pumped through , While vascular resistance does not cause an immediate problem for a child , there is some suggestion that higher levels , particularly if sustained after a stressful event , might increase the chance of blood pressure problems in adulthood .
All the children underwent a public speaking and mental arithmetic test designed to make them nervous , and increase their heart - rate .
Although all the children were in the " normal " range of birth weights , boys at the lower end of the scale were more likely to have higher vascular resistance than those born bigger .
The difference in resistance levels between bigger and smaller birth weight boys was particularly strong half an hour after the test , suggesting some additional difference in the boys ' ability to restore normal levels .
Different mechanisms
Girls did not show this effect , but instead had showed different levels of response in the part of their nervous systems linked to the " fight or flight " response .
Dr Alexander Jones , who led the project , said : " The sex differences in these relationships were striking and may eventually lead to a better understanding of why men and women tend to develop high blood pressure and heart or vascular disease at different times in their lives .
" It suggests that different underlying mechanisms for developing the same disorder may exist in the two sexes but have the same eventual result .
" My studies and future studies will focus more on childhood in an effort to better understand the processes that lead to disease and to seek to reverse them before it is too late to do anything about it . "
Professor Marjo - Riitta Jarvelin , from Imperial College London , said the findings supported large - scale studies , including one carried out by her own team , which had established the link between birth size and later disease .
" That is beyond doubt now , in my view .
There is plenty of evidence that chronic diseases start to develop pre-natally , or at least have their roots in pre-natal life .
" We have supplied the proof that the association exists , now studies such as this one are beginning to look for the mechanism . "

The default network in the brain may be responsible for daydreaming Researchers may have found a way to predict whether severely brain - damaged patients will regain consciousness .
A part of the brain which can stay active even in severely brain - damaged patients could offer a clue about the chances of recovery , they claim .
The Belgian team told a conference that activity within a " default network " in the brain appears to match the level of consciousness of the patient .
Some believe the default network is associated with daydreaming .
The findings were reported in New Scientist magazine .
We could just scan someone for 10 minutes and get an easily quantifiable readout
Dr Steven Laureys
University of Liege
The default network in the brain 's cortex appears to be more active when the brain is not actively working on a goal - hence the proposed link with daydreaming .
Some evidence suggests that it helps get the brain ready for the next task , although this remains a controversial theory .
A number of techniques are used to assess the level of consciousness in people following head injury , and while some are diagnosed as " brain dead " , with no sign of any activity in the brain , it can be difficult to make an exact diagnosis when the patient has a higher level of activity , but is still unconscious .
Dr Steven Laureys , from the University of Liege in Belgium , believes that activity within the network could help confirm the level of consciousness , and help doctors decide on whether or not to treat them .
He measured activity in 13 brain - injured patients with a variety of different levels of consciousness .
Some were " minimally conscious " , while others were in a coma , or a persistent vegetative state ( PVS ) .
A final group were " brain dead " .
He found that minimally conscious patients had only a 10 % fall in normal activity in this area , while in coma and PVS patients , it fell by approximately 35 % .
There was no activity at all in the brain - dead patients .
Clinical test Dr Laureys told New Scientist this could be more reliable method of assessing patients : " We could just scan someone for 10 minutes and get an easily quantifiable readout . "
Dr Jon Simons , a neuroscientist from Cambridge University , said that the study , although preliminary , was " very interesting " .
" It suggests that connectivity in the default network might correlate with level of consciousness as measured by a coma-recovery scale .
" Although the functional significance of the default network is still being hotly debated , this study does suggest that scans of the default network might perhaps have clinical utility as a diagnostic tool . "

In his speech , he encourages others to follow his lead , rejecting the focus on what he calls “ parsimonious modeling ” inspired by Friedman .
Everyday experience and observation must be returned to a prominent place in the profession , he argues .
“ The early Keynesians got a great deal of the workings of the economic system right in ways that are now denied , ” Mr. Akerlof said in a study newly posted on the Internet that closely tracks the text of his speech .
“ They based their models , as Keynes put it , on ‘ our knowledge of human nature and from the detailed facts of experience . ’ ”
A lot of what Mr. Akerlof advocates in his speech is already under way , with Mr. Akerlof himself a major contributor .
He shared a Nobel in economics in 2001 for his work on imperfect information , concluding , for example , that economic outcomes are altered when a used - car salesman knows more about the condition of a vehicle he is selling than the buyer .
It was an imbalance that helped to produce state “ lemon laws ” that protect buyers .
He was an early participant in behavioral economics , another assault on the rational , fully - informed behavior that Mr. Friedman counted on to make markets work efficiently without regulation or intervention .
People often do not behave rationally , the behaviorists found in their experiments .
Most do not bother to sign up for a voluntary 401 ( k ) plan , for example , but do not pull out of such a plan if an employer signs them up automatically .
Now Mr. Akerlof is taking a big step on his own .
His speech is based on more than a year of research , much of it done with Rachel Kranton , a University of Maryland economist .
They are trying to incorporate into theory , as Keynes once did , the great variety of “ norms ” that determine human behavior .
What Mr. Akerlof is trying to do , with Ms. Kranton ’s help , is to reflect the variety of motivations that come from the sense people have of “ what they are and how they should behave , ” as Ms. Kranton put it .

Ain't they cute ?
From www.healthinspections.com:
The most dangerous states for eating out are Florida , California , Minnesota , Ohio , and New York according to the most recent federal data .
Restaurants in these five states spread bacteria such as E.coli and salmonella , making nearly 3,000 customers sick and putting 65 in the hospital .
For restaurants in Florida and California , this is not good news .
It 's the third straight year they 've topped the list for having the most dangerous restaurants .
Healthinspections.com analyzed data from the Centers For Disease Control to obtain the rankings .
Here 's how the states stack up for outbreaks of restaurant food poisoning in 2006 , the most recent year available .
1. Florida 74 outbreaks
2. California 69 outbreaks
3. Minnesota 55 outbreaks
4. Ohio 54 outbreaks
5. New York 50 outbreaks
The federal numbers also raise questions about food safety practices in restaurants because more and more people are getting sick from eating out .
Across the country , restaurants were responsible for at least 605 outbreaks of food poisoning in 2006 , compared to 532 outbreaks in 2005 .
After the jump : Florida Restaurants # 1 For Making Customers Sick
Healthinspections.com has found that many Florida restaurants – from fast food to fine dining facilities – have long records of serious health code violations .
For example , consider a food poisoning outbreak at a Florida hotel earlier this year .
83 people got sick at the upscale Hilton resort on Singer Island near West Palm Beach .
They were hit with Norovirus , a highly contagious stomach bug that causes vomiting and diarrhea .

Over the past three days , the price of a credit default swap ( or CDS , a form of " insurance " on creditworthiness ) on 10 - year U.S. government debt has risen by 8.3 basis points ( one - hundreths of a percentage point ) , or 61 percent , to 21.8 basis points , and is now almost 80 % higher than the median value of this CDS since it was first quoted on April 2 .
There is no doubt that talk of a bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has spurred what could be a short - lived spike .
Still , it makes you wonder if the market is starting to price in what many say is inevitable after years of profligacy and failed policies : a credit downgrade for the United States .

Bangladeshi workers in clothing sweatshop in Athens , Greece , were attacked by company thugs for refusing to work on Sunday .
When their co-workers walked out in solidarity , the company fired 120 out of 180 of the working force .
In response the workers have sealed the factory off forcing the company to withdraw the lay - offs and negotiate .
On Monday 23 of June 2008 Bangladeshi foremen and thugs in the pay of the “ LADY FASHION ” clothing sweatshop in Votanikos , Athens , attacked Bangladeshi immigrant workers who had refused to work in the previous day ( Sunday being an official day - off in Greece ) , using iron bars and wooden clubs .
In response to the violence , 100 out of 180 workers walked out , with the consequence of them being declared laid - off by the company .
Workers claim that on the 20th of June , The Union of Bangladeshi Workers ( which has close links with PAME , the rather authoritarian Communist - Party controlled union umbrella ) had managed to secure unpaid salaries of 1,5 month , a fact that infuriated the direction of the company which has persistently refused to pay the immigrant workers on time .
Working conditions in the sweatshop have been known to be appalling : up to 12 hours of daily work , 10 hour work on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday , without the company paying the workers social security ( IKA ) monthly dues as is obliged by the law .
As further response to the bosses ’ violence and lay - offs , on following day , Tuesday the 24th , the workers gathered early in the morning and sealed the factory gate , inhibiting all production in the company ’s premises .
As a result , all 120 lay - offs have been recalled with the direction promising to pay all worked hours and social security debts so far , and refrain from further violence .

Extension Overview
The authors of this tutorial were in your shoes just a few weeks ago : knowing absolutely nothing about developing Firefox extensions .
Through hours of research , however , we have developed our own extension that will be used throughout this tutorial to provide you with examples .
The demonstration extension is named ‘ Home Page Scheduler ’ and provides the user with the ability to easily schedule specific websites to be their Home Page depending on the current time and day .
For example , you may prefer for your home page to be weather .com between 8 am - 10 am , cnn.com between 10 am - 2 pm , slashdot.org between 2 pm - 5 pm , and google.com in the evening .
The extension has been developed with many features so that we are able to use it as a full example in this tutorial ( some of these features are not necessary for this specific extension , but that is ok ) .
Please click here to install the Home Page Scheduler Extension .
Or , for the source , click here for the zip file containing the extension files .

( CNN ) --
The transgendered woman on the other end of the line was threatening to kill herself by jumping off of a parking structure .
The Trevor Helpline counselor who answered the phone worked to get the 24 - year - old calm and immediately called police for help .
The Trevor Project online provides resources for educators and a list of suicide warning signs .
Exactly one month later , that same woman called the helpline back -- to thank them for saving her life .
Stories like these are the reason The Trevor Project operates its helpline , the only nationwide , around - the - clock crisis and suicide prevention number for gay and questioning youth .
More than 500 volunteers are trained for 40 hours to run the bicoastal call centers .
" There 's a high level of stress that youth face in the transition from youth to adulthood , " Charles Robbins , executive director of The Trevor Project , said .
" Add on top of that the challenges of sexual orientation or gender identity and we get 15,000 calls a year . "
A 2005 Massachusetts Department of Education survey of 3,500 high school students , in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , found almost 11 percent have seriously considered suicide .
And that percentage is almost four times as high for 10 to 24 - year - olds who identify themselves as gay , lesbian or bisexual .
" Because of the unfortunate stigma that still exists in the United States around homosexuality ... youth tend to hold back their feelings , do n't disclose , live in denial or shame , " Robbins said .
Every year The Trevor Project honors one individual who publicly works to reject that stigma and helps in the group 's overall goal : to promote the acceptance of gay and questioning youth in society .
This year 's honoree , actor Alan Cumming , has been " unapologetic , and true to himself , " Robbins said .
" Anything that helps those people have a voice and have someone to talk to and have somewhere to turn is really important , " Cumming said .
" Suicide is in the top three causes of death for teens .
That 's a shocking statistic . "
Watch Cumming talk about The Trevor Project »
The Trevor Project began in 1998 , named after the short film " Trevor " that won an Academy Award in 1994 .
To encourage open discussions about suicide , personal identity and sexual orientation , the organization created The Trevor Survival Kit .
The kit includes the DVD of " Trevor " and a classroom teaching guide .
" All of these resources are helpful and necessary for gay and questioning youth because it 's important for them to understand that they are not alone , that there is a safe place for them to find someone to listen , and most importantly , that their lives are valuable , " Jacqueline Wing , communications manager for The Trevor Project , wrote in an email .
For more information on The Trevor Project , or to see a list of suicide warning signs , visit www.thetrevorproject.org.
To contact the helpline , call 1-866-488-7386 or ( 866 ) 4.U.TREVOR .

I agree with Jack Emmert , if they do it right this has more portential to work out nicely than a MMO based on a comic universe or one based on Star Wars .
In those things the story is always based around a core cast of very important persons ( the super heros / villains / the jedi / the leaders of the dark side ) so its difficult to do a mmo cause everyone wants to be or work with one of those few important and known guys which yeah , can´t work out .
In Star Trek they have so many different crews on different ships / stations / worlds know to the masses that i imagine one could way easier position the player in one of the many sub plot areas and still make him feel important .
Hope they don´t screw it up .

Click here to listen to Palfrey clearly state that she would not commit suicide .
DC Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey predicted she would be " suicided " on several occasions both recently and as far back as 17 years ago – comments that now appear ominous in light of the announcement that the former head of a Washington escort service allegedly killed herself today .
" If taken into custody , my physical safety and most probably my very life would be jeopardized , " she wrote in August 1991 following an attempt to bring her to trial , " Rape , beating , maiming , disfigurement and more than likely murder disguised in the form of just another jailhouse accident or suicide would await me , " said Palfrey in a handwritten letter to the judge accusing the San Diego police vice squad of having a vendetta against her .
During several recent appearances on The Alex Jones Show , Palfrey also said that she was at risk of being killed and that authorities would make it look like suicide .
She made it clear that she was not suicidal and if she was found dead it would be murder .
Palfrey had threatened to release the names of well - known clients of her upscale call girl ring in the nation ’s capitol , and had indicated that Dick Cheney may be one of them .
" We now know it goes at least as high as a United States Senator , " Palfrey told The Alex Jones Show , " I ’m hearing rumors now from other people that there are other possibilities in that stratosphere so to speak , on that level . "
" No I ’m not planning to commit suicide , " Palfrey told The Alex Jones Show on her last appearance in July , " I ’m planning on going into court and defending myself vigorously and exposing the government , " she said .
" Blanche Palfrey had no sign that her daughter was suicidal , and there was no immediate indication that alcohol or drugs were involved , police Capt .
Jeffrey Young said , " according to an AP report .

UPDATE : In an almost uncanny development , as soon as this article started to go viral on the Internet , Time Magazine released a story claiming that Palfrey told author Dan Moldea that she would rather commit suicide than go to jail .

Do you want to be the commander or the engineer ?
It 's exactly the kind of question you 'd expect to hear from Richard Garriott , the 47 - year - old father of massively multiplayer online gaming .
His titles , which have sold more than 100 million copies , let gamers assume the role of magician , warrior , or sci - fi super - soldier .
In real life , Garriott goes by the nickname Lord British and dresses up in Elizabethan garb .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
But on this May afternoon in a cramped classroom northeast of Moscow , Garriott is not playing a game .
He 's fiddling with a joystick , but he 's training for a real - life mission as a cosmonaut .
In front of him is a simulation of the control panel of the Soyuz spaceship .
" I know you are great computer gamer , so here you go , " his instructor jokes in a thick Russian accent as he fires up the videoscreen so Garriott can practice a descent .

For more , visit wired.com / video Welcome to Star City , Russia , the tiny town where cosmonauts have trained since the 1960s .
Today , clients of Space Adventures should expect to spend about eight months here ( after forking over millions of dollars ) to learn the ropes before blastoff .
When the Soyuz TMA - 13 spacecraft blasts off from Kazakhstan on October 12 and travels to the International Space Station , Garriott will be on board .
The Soyuz can accommodate three people .
US astronaut Mike Fincke will sit in the left seat , and mission commander Yuri Lonchakov will occupy the center seat .
Garriott did n't have the right stuff , but he did buy the right seat .
Garriott will become the sixth private citizen to join the most exclusive , most high - octane clique on the planet : Call it the 240 - mile - high club .
Membership includes Greg Olsen , who made his fortune developing infrared cameras ; Mark Shuttleworth , the software engineer who spearheaded Ubuntu ; and Charles Simonyi , former chief architect of Microsoft .
What they have in common , other than tremendous success in the tech industry , is a willingness to pay tens of millions of dollars for a week and a half in space .
But here 's the fine print :
That ticket to the ISS comes with a stopover .
Before they blast off , the wealthy adventurers must spend as many as eight months at Russia 's cosmonaut training ground , Zvyozdny Gorodok , aka Star City .
They live in cramped dormitories in the Prophylactory Building , or Prophy , which looks more YMCA than Star Trek .
They slip and slide down frozen walkways past dilapidated Soviet structures .
They subsist on cafeteria food slathered in mayo .
They bury themselves in textbooks or ride " vomit comets " and centrifuges .
" Everybody knows you can go to space if you are a perfect physical specimen and incredibly smart , " Simonyi says .
" But what if you are kind of normal ? "
Then you have to fork over $ 30 million to Space Adventures , a company that serves as go - between with the Russian space program .
Just do n't call its clients space tourists .
" That term implies you are there to take photos and hang out , " Garriott says .
" I 'm trying to prove you can actually be a valuable contributor to the activities on board the space station . "
He notes that he 'll be conducting research on protein crystal growth on behalf of a biotech firm .
But he does n't deny that he 's really going up because it will be a friggin ' blast .
" I 'd be misleading you if I did n't admit that it 's a very selfish activity , " he says .

Wired contributing editor David Kushner describes the grueling training regimen that all cosmonauts ( and millionaire clients of Space Adventures ) must undergo .
Selfish , and potentially risky for the rest of the crew .
" There are a million ways I can screw up and kill everyone , " Garriott says .
That 's why he 's getting remedial cosmonaut training .
Today 's descent simulation is uneventful at first .
But then the instructor ups the ante with a malfunction , and Garriott 's capsule veers off target .
" I do n't want to kill us ! "
Garriott yelps , flicking his mouse .
" No way , dude ! " Too late .
The descent simulation ends .
The instructor checks the results .
" Your landing is very bad , " he says gravely .
Luckily , here in Star City they can restart and try again .
Zvyozdny Gorodok is the birthplace of spaceflight .
Ever since the Soviets built the cosmonaut training center in 1960 , this city of 8,000 has been shrouded in mystery , even left off maps .
After Yuri Gagarin trained here and became the first person to travel into space , Star City became a sort of Bolshevik Oz in the minds of the Russian people , with highly evolved star men living in gleaming silver towers .
The reality , Garriott discovers as he checks in at the security booth on his first day of training in January , is a bit different .
Nearby , an old woman sells chocolate and cigarettes from a tiny kiosk .
Garriott makes his way past the solemn armed guards at the gate and follows a trail through the towering pines .
Grim cement buildings covered in peeling paint rise from the cracked pavement .
An enormous babushka trudges past , lugging a grocery sack .
A statue of Gagarin flying through a ring that represents earthly limitations .
Photo : Benedict Redgrove Tributes to Gagarin are everywhere .
There are paintings of him , like religious icons , in all the buildings .
There are statues and busts of him outside the Yuri A. Gagarin Russian State Science Research Cosmonaut Training Center .
There 's a bizarre futurist sculpture of him flying through a symbolic ring in front of the so - called Cosmonaut 's House .
The building houses a museum , but it's also the site of a flea market , where locals haggle over G - strings and furry hats .
Garriott arrives at his new quarters , a drafty little apartment on the third floor of the Prophy .
He tacks up inspirational pictures of Gagarin , as well as posters of some of his videogames .
On the door , he has put up a picture of himself and penciled Richard Garriott lives here underneath it .
" It 's like going to a monastery , " says Simonyi , who stayed here from September 2006 to March 2007 .
" You have a small bag and a toilet kit and move into a dorm .
You have to live very simply . "
" The whole lifestyle of Star City was very different from what I was used to , " says Space Adventures ' fourth orbital client , Anousheh Ansari , a 42 - year - old US - based Iranian woman and a sponsor of the Ansari X Prize ( a $ 10 million competition to develop a reusable manned spaceship ) .
" You can't count on hot water .
A lot of time , the water that comes out is dark brown and starts lightening up only after 20 minutes .
I 'm lactose intolerant and need a special diet .
But over there , I had to learn to live with what was available . "
Garriott thought ahead and packed a stockpile of gamer meals : candy bars and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese .
He lined up his rations on a shelf when he arrived , then sat on the edge of his bed .
Gone were his personal assistant , his 6,000 - square - foot mansion , his sprawling 13 - acre lawn , and his private observatory .
But he was as giddy as a kid on his first day of college .
" I grew up in a place like this , where everyone I knew went to space , " Garriott tells me over a lunch of veal and cabbage at a dreary Star City cafeteria .
The place he 's talking about is Nassau Bay , a Houston suburb favored by NASA employees because of its proximity to the Johnson Space Center .
His father , Owen Garriott , rocketed to Skylab in 1973 and to Spacelab - 1 in 1983 .
" I always assumed that my future would include going into space , " he says .
But there was a problem :
His vision sucked .
When Garriott was a preteen , his family doctor at NASA showed him the results of his eye test .
" I 'm so sorry , Richard , " he said .
" You 'll never be accepted as an astronaut . "
" It was just kind of a shock , " Garriott says , sawing away at his glistening pile of meat .
" But I went from shock to dismay to ' Who is he to tell me what I can't do ? ' "
Young Garriott spent his days monkeying around with electronics and his nights playing Dungeons & Dragons .
He turned his love of role - playing games into a career , coding the Ultima franchise and cofounding the development studio Origin Systems .
In 1992 , Electronic Arts bought Origin for $ 35 million in stock , making Garriott a very wealthy geek .
He spent some of that on a mansion he dubbed Britannia Manor , outfitted with secret passageways .
Garriott may have made his riches designing adventures for others , but he has also orchestrated plenty of adventure for himself .
A symbol representing his motto , " Ethical hedonism , " is tattooed on one of his ankles along with a ring of additional tattoos , each marking a memorable experience — like diving to the Titanic or hunting for meteorites in Antarctica .
But those terrestrial exploits were n't enough for Lord British .
So in the late '90s , Garriott became a donor to and board member of the X Prize Foundation , the organization created by Peter Diamandis to foster private space initiatives .
He also invested in Diamandis ' parabolic flight company , Zero - G , and became an investor and board member of Space Adventures , a company that had just been founded as a kind of space travel agency .
In 1998 , Eric Anderson , president and cofounder of Space Adventures , pitched NASA and the Russians on the idea of selling a seat aboard a spacecraft .
NASA balked , but the cash - starved Russians were game .
Though Star City had been top secret until the end of the Cold War , it was now opening up in a bid for tourism money .
The Russians told Anderson they needed funding for a study on the feasibility of selling a ride on the Soyuz .
Garriott , flush with wealth from the sale of Origin , says he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to finance the research .
Around the year 2000 , the Russians came back with an answer : Space Adventures could purchase a seat in the capsule … for $ 20 million .
Garriott did n't flinch .
He signed up , figuring he was first in line .
His trip was set for April 2001 .
Then the dotcom bubble burst , taking most of Garriott 's cash with it .
In his place went US investor Dennis Tito , who would go down in history as the first citizen space explorer .
" It was devastating , " Garriott says .
Four more multimillionaire cosmonauts and six years later , Garriott finally scraped together the dough for the trip , which now costs $ 30 million .
" I 'm spending the majority of my money to do this , " he says .
When he arrived at Star City on January 20 , 2008 , Garriott found a comrade : Aussie - born playboy Nik Halik , a 39 - year - old fellow millionaire who made his money in real estate and stocks .
Halik now travels the world as a motivational speaker and self - described " thrillionaire . "
Halik told Garriott of his childhood spent indoors with chronic asthma .
While other kids played outside , he would sit in bed thumbing through Encyclopaedia Britannica and compiling a list of the 10 things he wanted to do before he died .
By the time he got to Star City , he had crossed off the bulk of his list : mansions in Mykonos and Morocco — check .
Chasing tornadoes — check .
Lunch in a submersible on the Titanic — check .
A night in the sarcophagus of the King 's Chamber in the Great Pyramid of Giza — not on his list , but bloody wicked .
" I 've got three more to go : the space station , Everest , and the lunar surface , " he says .
" After that , I 'm done . "
Technically , Halik is n't signed up to fly until at least April 2009 , but he coughed up an extra $ 3 million to come here early … just in case .
Garriott points at Halik and jokes , " I 'm the one going to space , unless this guy breaks my legs . "
Halik grins broadly .
Though Space Adventure clients pay a fortune for their trip , there 's no guarantee they 'll actually make it .
The slightest ailment could scuttle their plans .
In 2004 , an x-ray turned up a spot on Olsen 's lung , and the infrared - camera developer had to wait a year for clearance to fly .
The 37 - year - old Japanese dotcom millionaire Daisuke Enomoto suffered a worse fate .
Just a month before his 2006 liftoff , he was diagnosed with a kidney stone .
Ansari took his place .
Enomoto has yet to make his flight .
Garriott had a close call of his own .
Just before departing for Russia , doctors found a hemangioma on his liver .
Though the small , benign lesion could have been with him his whole life and never caused a problem , there was a slim chance it could rupture and bleed in space .
Garriott underwent surgery to have it removed .
He shows me the 6 - inch scar on his belly .
All winter , the two wealthy adventurers carefully navigate the icy sidewalks , knowing that a minor injury could ground them .
In the cafeteria , they usually eat alone .
When they pass cosmonauts , all they get is a grunt and nod of acknowledgment .
It 's not hard to imagine why they 're having trouble fitting in :
Though the months of preparation seem daunting to Garriott and Halik , a cosmonaut spends several years training for a flight .
And the outsiders ' eccentricities have n't exactly endeared them to the locals .
Garriott wears two rattails , which he 's been cultivating for more than 20 years .
He has them rebraided occasionally and is working up the nerve to ask someone at the Star City barbershop for help .
But that 's nothing : Before Enomoto was grounded , he talked about dressing up as an anime character during his flight and trying to assemble a toy robot in space .
The chores assigned to the travelers are rather unglamorous .
During his 2002 space trip , Shuttleworth drained the sewage .
Garriott will be tasked with similar grunt work , like pumping out condensation .
And while he is trained to perform all roles in case of an emergency , he will have no mission - critical responsibilities .
" There is nothing the right - seat person is doing that could n't be done by one of the other crew members , " he says .
" Even if the person in the right seat faints , the crew is perfectly capable of flying the vehicle .
The minimum training for us is ' Do n't mess with things . ' "
Marina Driga , a military captain and press liaison , confides what some around Star City think of its high - profile trainees : " People say it is better to send monkey . "
Garriott and fellow trainee Nik Halik ( right and center ) are running simulations on the Soyuz control panels — even though they wo n't have any mission - critical responsibilities .
Photo : Benedict Redgrove " Ya doomayoo , ya mogoo , ya boodoo , " says a hulking old Russian with a blue V - neck sweater , a gray comb-over , and two gold teeth .
" Now you repeat , " his translator tells Garriott and Halik : " I think !
I can ! I vill ! "
" I think , I can , I will , " the two trainees respond lifelessly .
It 's early afternoon in a Khrushchev - era building in Star City .
We 're gathered in a wood - paneled classroom .
Nearby , there 's an anatomical model with an exposed brain .
A chart hanging from a cabinet shows a man in what looks at first glance like an electrode - studded diaper .
Halik and Garriott sit opposite their instructor , Rostislav Bogdashevsky , a psychologist who has been training cosmonauts for more than 45 years .
Behind him , there 's a large black - and - white photo of his star pupil , Gagarin , smiling down .
The mere mention of that Soviet hero elicits a hearty grin from Bogdashevsky .
" There vas no one like him , " the psychologist says through the heavily accented translator .
" He vas good at adapting to everything .
He vas himself all the time . "
And now , Bogdashevsky is training the psyches of a couple of wealthy foreigners .
Problem is , his nuggets of wisdom do n't always survive the journey into English .
As the translator says things like " Stress is yourself , " an assistant cycles through a slide show that rarely syncs with the lecture .
" Can you tell me how many psychic states we can have ? "
Bogdashevsky asks .
Garriott shrugs .
" Seven ? "
Bogdashevsky smiles and shakes his head .
" You make mistake .
There are 63 . "
It 's one thing to adjust to life in Star City — but quite another to endure the confounding , confining , and sometimes just plain goofy training regimen .
The first challenge is the language .
Garriott is an autodidact wunderkind who persuaded his high school teachers that learning Basic code counted as fulfilling his foreign - language requirement .
He wo n't be as fortunate at Star City .
All of the instructions , instrumentation , and communications in space will be in Russian .
So , for four hours a day , Garriott and Halik slave over fat , dusty language books in class , then tote them back to the Prophy to study more at night .
The grueling physical training is a relief from all the Cyrillic lettering .
Some of it is standard conditioning in the drab smelly gym .
No Tae
Bo or aerobics — just medicine balls , a pool , and weight machines .
( The most interesting thing in the gym is Gagarin 's old locker , the contents sealed behind glass . )
Other training sessions involve what 's called a vestibular chair .
All trainees routinely get strapped into this torture device .
The black chair sits on a round wooden platform in a small , dank room .
Once someone is buckled in , the chair spins like a midway ride , clockwise and counterclockwise for as long as 10 minutes at a stretch .
As Garriott gyrates , he 's instructed to tilt his head forward and back — the better to create disorientation .
" You can feel this kind of … sloshing in your inner ear , " he says .
" NASA stopped using it , but the Russians still believe it helps desensitize you so you do n't get motion sickness . "
Sometimes the lab coats pepper the cosmonauts with math questions while they 're strapped in , just to see how their brains are functioning .
Nausea is also a problem during the dozens of trips they take on the vomit comet , a plane that follows a parabolic trajectory , letting you experience weightlessness in 10 - second increments during the drop .
Trainees are advised to pack several plastic bags for the trip , since they 're likely to fill more than one with the contents of their stomach .
As a veteran of 150 parabolas on Diamandis ' Zero - G flights , Garriott passed without losing a beet .
All this is nothing compared with the TsF - 18 centrifuge .
Weighing 300 tons and measuring 59 feet long , it looks like a giant blue phallus .
It spins at 170 miles per hour , and riders are instructed not to open their mouth while in motion because the pressure will break their jaw , according to Driga .
" It is like nightmare , " she adds .
" Imagine being buried deep in sand and wanting to move but cannot . "
This ordeal is preparation for the inevitable physical challenges of the mission .
During launch of the Soyuz craft , cosmonauts experience four times the force of gravity .
As if that were n't harrowing enough , the past two reentries were " ballistic , " meaning that instead of controlled descent , the capsules were essentially in free fall — hitting up to 9 gs .
( NASA shuttle descents typically hit only 3 gs. )
" I 'm not a worrier , " Garriott says .
But the fact that no one is sure what caused those ballistic descents can't be a comfort .
When he 's enduring 9 gs in the centrifuge , he can at least clutch the " dead man 's stick , " a controller with a button he can release if the savage gravitational force becomes unbearable ( or if he passes out ) .
There are no dead man 's sticks in space .
And no matter how stressed anyone gets , they can't even enjoy a little release by manipulating their own joystick :
One of the effects of weightlessness is reduced blood flow to the lower half of your body .
The rumor in Star City is that many have tried in vain to get it up out there .
" There vas top - secret program of this , " Driga says .
" But the man could not perform .
Viagra vill not help . "
Going to the bathroom in space may be the trickiest docking maneuver of all .
In a Star City museum that includes replicas of the MIR space station and Gagarin 's capsule , the first thing everyone wants to see is the space toilet .
It 's a small plastic bucket with a crotch cup and a vacuum .
To use it , Garriott will have to position himself over the bucket , and a suction tube will Hoover up his crap .
During tours , the guide paints a pristine picture of the process , involving a seamless deposit of waste into a bag that 's sealed for storage until landing .
" This vay , " he says , " everything is clean and nice in space ! "
Not quite .
After Olsen took his spaceflight , he phoned Enomoto with urgent advice .
" Always have napkins with you , " Olsen said .
" There 's an old saying that no matter how you shake and dance , the last few drops go down your pants .
That happens in space , too . "
One space tourist ( whose identity is closely guarded ) forgot to switch on the vacuum in the ISS toilet before off - loading .
The results were disastrous , and the chamber was splattered with feces .
Even worse , the unlucky traveler had to float over and tell the other cosmonauts in halting Russian about the urgent — and potentially life - threatening — spill .
As the psychology training winds down for the day , the good Bogdashevsky leans over the table and passionately gestures at his two students .
For the past two hours , they 've discussed how to resolve any negative emotion in space .
The lecture closes with a series of physical exercises they can do while strapped into their space chair .
" Throw away negative emotion , " the translator says as Bogdashevsky rubs his ears .
" Warm up your ears ! " the translator says as Bogdashevsky rubs his stomach .
" Massage your internal organs !
Three or four times a day for five minutes ! "
Garriott and Halik nod dutifully .
" Now you not have problems , " Bogdashevsky concludes .
" You understand positive thinking .
He who manages to do this is immortal soul . "
By April 12 , after four months of isolation , stress , and discomfort , our civilian spaceniks are finally starting to settle in .
It 's Cosmonauts Day , a holiday honoring Gagarin 's first flight into space , and in Star City the celebration lasts late into the night .
The thrillionaire wannabe - cosmonauts have n't been invited .
But they show up anyway .
It 's held in a giant yurt covered with camel hair ; inside are famous cosmonauts and their families .
Many of the men are wearing traditional Uzbek robes and are seated around an enormous table overflowing with food .
But everyone is staring at Garriott and Halik as they walk in , and the two feel like they 've been caught trespassing .
After an awkward pause , they are welcomed in broken English , and a long , alcohol - filled night ensues .
" That was when we first got to know all these cosmonauts really well , " Garriott says .
He and Halik may have been perceived as effete space tourists ( or monkeys ) at first , but they learned enough Russian to make themselves understood , and they stuck it out long enough to prove their commitment .
Garriott and Halik can now joke around with the residents of Star City .
Halik chums it up with the bosomy , middle - aged woman who runs the cantina .
Garriott later finds the unlikely pair in the kitchen , where they 're seeing who can down more vodka shots .
After that night , the American and the Aussie increasingly felt accepted as members of the Star City family .
Before one cosmonaut came back from space , Garriott and Halik talked the Prophy housemothers into giving them the key to her room so they could wrap every bit of her place in toilet paper , all the way down to the grapes in her fridge .
The older Russian cosmonauts even showed the pair a secret way into the building in order to dodge the standard postflight quarantine .
But no amount of camaraderie and training can prepare Halik and Garriott for the worst part of the journey , worse than the grueling training , worse than the punishing gs of takeoff , worse than the indignities of space bathrooms .
" The hardest part of the trip was coming back , " Ansari says .
" You realize that you may never experience this again . "
It 's difficult to readjust to life on Earth , to go from being a temporary cosmonaut to being a normal civilian .
Olsen is known to wear his old Star City jumpsuit to schools and youth groups , happy for the opportunity to recount the story of the greatest moments of his life .
Garriott has a simple solution for post - orbital ennui : another ticket to space , which could now be as much as $ 45 million .
" I 'm already strategizing how I can earn the required funds , " he says .
White House wo n't disclose which telcos it advised on wiretap lobbying Nick Juliano
Published : Friday May 2 , 2008

Print This Email This Congress still deadlocked over FISA Newly disclosed court papers confirm for the first time that the representatives of the nation 's largest telecommunications companies reached out to the White House for advice on how to lobby Congress over a Bush administration proposal to give them retroactive immunity .
The Bush administration is refusing to disclose the contents of those communications , which include e-mails , letters and notes showing lobbying strategy .
Administration officials claim their refusal is based on national security concerns , but if they were to comply with the Freedom of Information
Act request seeking those internal records , it would almost certainly show a deep and unseemly level of coordination between President Bush 's advisers and the telecommunications companies they contracted to carry out his warrantless wiretapping program , critics say .
Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball reported this week :
The Bush administration is refusing to disclose internal e-mails , letters and notes showing contacts with major telecommunications companies over how to persuade Congress to back a controversial surveillance bill , according to recently disclosed court documents .
The existence of these documents surfaced only in recent days as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by a privacy group called the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The foundation ( alerted to the issue in part by a NEWSWEEK story last fall ) is seeking information about communications among administration officials , Congress and a battery of politically well - connected lawyers and lobbyists hired by such big telecom carriers as AT&T and Verizon .
Court papers recently filed by government lawyers in the case confirm for the first time that since last fall unnamed representatives of the telecoms phoned and e-mailed administration officials to talk about ways to block more than 40 civil suits accusing the companies of privacy violations because of their participation in a secret post - 9/11 surveillance program ordered by the White House .
At the time , the White House was proposing a surveillance bill strongly backed by the telecoms that included a sweeping provision that would grant them retroactive immunity from any lawsuits accusing the companies of wrongdoing related to the surveillance program .
Congress has been wrangling over how to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act since soon after the president 's warrantless wiretapping of Americans was revealed in December 2005 .
The fight has intensified since last summer , when Congress passed a stopgap measure under intense pressure from the Bush administration .
That measure expired in February and the House and Senate since then have been at odds over a long - term FISA fix .
The Senate approved an administration - backed FISA update that includes immunity for the telecommunications companies that facilitated the program , while House Democrats have balked at the immunity proposal .
A House bill to update FISA excluded an immunity provision and called for more oversight over the administration 's domestic surveillance measures carried out by the National Security Agency .
Daily Kos commenter McJoan says the revelation that the telecoms have sought advice from the Bush administration demonstrates their attempts to avoid court rulings on the legality of their actions .
" The telcos that participated knew at the time that they were breaking the law - - that 's why Qwest did n't participate , and why AT&T and Verizon and the others should n't have either , " she writes .
" They knew it then and they particularly know it now .
Thus their effort to pull all the levers possible to continuing covering up their actions -- and the administrations ' . "

What are integrals ?
Integration is an important tool in calculus that can give an antiderivative or represent area under a curve .
The indefinite integral of , denoted , is defined to be the antiderivative of .
In other words , the derivative of is .
Since the derivative of a constant is 0 , indefinite integrals are defined only up to an arbitrary constant .
For example , , since the derivative of is .
The definite integral of from to , denoted , is defined to be the signed area between and the axis , from to .
Both types of integrals are tied together by the fundamental theorem of calculus .
This states that if is continuous on and is its continuous indefinite integral , then .
This means .
Sometimes an approximation to a definite integral is desired .
A common way to do so is to place thin rectangles under the curve and add the signed areas together .
Wolfram| Alpha can solve a broad range of integrals .
Our health care system is in critical condition .
It can be difficult to impossible for Americans in poor health , and even many healthy ones , to find affordable , individual - market coverage .
Health - related costs are the leading cause for personal bankruptcy in the United States .
Health care reform is an issue that will demand the attention of a new administration and Congress .
Yet true reform efforts — those that will bring affordable coverage to every American — face roadblocks in the form of deceptive conservative myths and faulty policy proposals .
We ’ve fact - checked six of the most pervasive proposals below , and it ’s clear we wo n’t reach solutions with flat tax credits and caps on malpractice lawsuit payouts , as the fact check illustrates .
Myth : Health care reform is best left to individual states .
Truth :
An effective and efficient U.S. health system cannot be constructed one state at a time .
The sum of state reform does not equal reform on a national level
It is true that state - level health care reform can show the framework and feasibility of solutions and act as a testing ground for new approaches .
But it is no substitute for sorely needed national reform .
States alone cannot achieve comprehensive reform .
Fiscal concerns , already seen in California to Massachusetts , will make state reform unworkable because of the lack of annual balanced budgets and a high price tag .
Without federal support and redistribution , health care will become less equitable from state to state .
What ’s more , states with a higher percentage of their population living below the poverty line tend to have higher rates of uninsurance .
Without national will and leadership , state - level lessons tend to stay within the single state .
Fifty separate reform efforts only complicate the health care system and inhibit attempts to simplify it .
Myth :
The federal government should provide a flat tax credit for all Americans who buy insurance , with no qualifying restrictions .
Truth : A badly designed tax credit plan could actually cause costs to rise for most families and increase the number of uninsured by ignoring low - income and high - risk individuals .
The fixed - dollar flat tax credits that conservatives have proposed do not take into account cost variation between insurance plans .
Flat credits are also not adjusted for a person ’s level of need or income , and so low - income people and people with chronic health problems will end up spending a much higher percentage of their overall incomes on health insurance .
Credits will cover the cost of insurance for the young and healthy , but they will not offset the high cost for the older and sicker .
Models and experience show that the effect of a credit on the uninsured is uncertain at best ; one analysis suggested that voluntary enrollment in individual - market plans would not reduce the number of uninsured Americans due to a loss of employer coverage or a rise in employer premiums .
Tax credits can be used as part of a broader strategy to reduce the rate of uninsured , but used alone they will not drive down the price of health insurance .
The purported benefits of competition among private insurance companies that credits encourage must be weighed against the higher administrative cost of individual - market insurance and a decline in employer involvement .
Encouraging tax equity over these other important considerations will do little more than create a larger uninsured population .
Myth : Consumer - driven health plans will reduce costs by giving people more control over their health care choices and encouraging high quality and appropriate use of care .
Fact : Consumer - driver health plans will not control costs .
In fact , they will expose people to high deductibles and cost - sharing payments and discourage consumers from seeking important services , like prevention .
Roughly 70 percent of health costs and deaths are attributable to smoking , obesity , and health problems that could be prevented .
Conservatives hold up consumer - driven health plans as the answer to encouraging individuals to use preventive services .
Yet enrollees in these plans have inadequate information to make good decisions — and the plans provide no help .
Consumers are unlikely to obtain adequate and reliable information on cost and quality and differentiate necessary from unnecessary care .
Some studies show that consumers will even choose to underinvest in prevention as they try to be more “ cost- conscious . ”
The truth is that cost - sharing can discourage people from using preventive care .
One study showed that $ 10 co-pays caused a significant reduction in the use of mammograms among seniors .
Other studies suggest that cost sharing , especially for low - income families , people with chronic disease , or families with children with special needs , could deter patients from seeking preventive services .
Myth : Americans have adequate access to health care — everyone has access to emergency care .
Truth : Safety net providers , like emergency rooms , are not a substitute for comprehensive , coordinated , and timely health care services .
Coverage makes a difference .
Research indicates that the uninsured population receives less care for necessary medical services compared to the insured population .
Uninsured individuals experience delayed diagnoses , are less likely to receive recommended care for chronic conditions , and are less likely to be admitted to a hospital when they experience trauma .
Plus , emergency care for the uninsured means longer wait times for everyone .
Other factors restrict and delay access to basic health care services .
In rural areas , there are fewer health care professionals , specialists , and less high - tech equipment ; in the inner cities , lack of safe transportation is a limiting factor .
The socio - demographic studies show that there are growing inequities in life expectancy between the wealthy and the poor .
Hispanics and African Americans get more medical services in emergency rooms and are less likely to have a regular primary care provider , further contributing to devastating health disparities .
Myth :
Any health reform plan in which the government is involved is “ socialized medicine , ” which will result in bureaucratic , big - government programs that contradict the American ideals of free market and choice .
Truth : Affordable coverage for all does not equal “ socialized medicine . ”
In fact , public - private hybrid health care plans can be used to achieve a higher degree of universal , high - quality health coverage .
Progressive plans vary in their degree of proposed health care reforms , and government - provided health care is merely one strategy to achieve coverage for everybody .
Many health care systems around the world are hybrids that combine public and private insurance elements — and many proposals for health care reform in the United States build upon our current system of shared financing between public insurance programs and private plans .
Critics worry about long lines and “ rationing , ” but people are already dying and waiting in overcrowded emergency rooms .
Americans even wait longer for same - day access to care than most nations with universal coverage .
The United States has the highest rate of preventable deaths among 19 industrialized nations due to a lack of timely and effective care — evidence that we already ration care , partly on ability to pay .
“ Socialized medicine ” is a term that has been embraced , demonized , and misunderstood since the early 20th century in the United States .
In fact , two models of government - funded health care in the United States — the Veterans Affairs Health Care system and the Medicare program — represent different and successful public insurance models within our own system .
Myth : Medical malpractice lawsuits are little more than predatory lawyers destroying honest doctors ; caps should be set on the amount awarded to accusers .
Truth :
Although the malpractice system is deeply flawed , setting caps deflects attention from patient safety and would likely not reduce frivolous lawsuits or costly premiums .
Medical malpractice liability is in need of reform , but claims of a nationwide crisis are overblown .
Malpractice claims and insurance premiums vary by specialty and geographic area — doctors in obstetrics or surgery tend to pay higher premiums , for example .
What increases occur in malpractice premiums can be linked primarily to a sluggish economy .
In fact , malpractice costs represent less than 2 percent of total health care spending .
There is little correlation between malpractice claim increases and premium increases .
Enacting caps on awards threatens individual rights to compensation for harm resulting from preventable medical error , mostly because so - called frivolous lawsuits represent only a small portion of claims and awards by juries .
Focusing on tort reform deflects attention from patient safety in a system where victims are not fairly compensated and errors are not properly prevented .
The solution to rising costs should instead consist of more emphasis on evidence - based medicine , independent screening , immediate disclosure of errors , and even a no - fault system of compensation .

Looking for something that could serve the purpose is at the heart of the article , yes ?
And the first post , a song , goes right at the challenge .
And bravo !
Even so , there is something under the surface I wonder about .
( This could be a long - ish post . )
First of all that number , 350 ppm of CO2 , might not be so magical .
Returning to that level only gets us part way back to geologically historical levels .
Why not 320 ?
292 ?
Anyone interested can search a bit and find the basis for the lower figures in various articles , published over many years .
Second , there is ample controversy over what the consequences of the present levels , above 350 , will bring .
And about what the mitigations of cap - and - trade or other emissions restructuring will actually accomplish .
One estimate , by the same UN crew that got the Nobel along with Gore last year for its findings , is that the reductions under cap - and - trade as proposed by McCain and Obama would only delay arrival at a certain INCREASE in global temperature by a couple of years , and would cause a global rise of 0.4 degrees celsius by the end of this century .
( I ’ll give a link to an article in the next paragraph . )
I ’m not certain that a 0.4 degree rise is NOT still quite serious but , without wanting to spark a shouting match , I do wish to encourage informed consideration of these aspects .
Today there is an article in the Guardian by Bjorn Lomborg – if it ’s permissable here is the url : http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/03/climatechange.usa?gusrc=rss&feed=worldnews – titled McCain , Obama , and Hot Air – that I recommend .
Lomborg is new to me and I ’m not quite sure how to take what he has to say , but in detail he makes thoughtful points .
One is that cap - and - trade only addresses the emissions side of the problem , and he thinks the benefits wo n’t repay the costs .
If he ’s right , we should be looking elsewhere .
He would instead invest heavily in technologies for zero carbon energy PRODUCTION – wind , solar , wave , and so on .
But more interesting still is his placement of the CO2 problem in context with other priorities which include reduction of poverty , AIDS , and more .
The article says it very well and if you look around a bit there are other places where Lomborg states his case .
Maybe the ‘ WHAT ’ that we face ( high CO2 levels ) is only AS IMPORTANT as the ‘ WHY ’ ( historical factors that got us here ) and – even more to the point – the ‘ HOW ’ to go on from here .
If , as one poster wrote , agreement on what is a dangerous cholesterol count is hard to come by , and the specifics of what CO2 at 350 will mean are also debatable ( but only in detail , please note I consider the situation IS grave ) , then it should be worthwhile to work out a strategy based on something else .
Too .
In addition .
That could be to find an image or catch - phrase that ignites the imagination by showing ‘ sexy ’ the kinds of win - win solutions that put us in a better place , and above all at the point of origin : by HOW we produce the energy we use , rather than by what we do about it AFTER the waste we produce becomes WHAT we have to worry about .
Doing so , for the US especially , would go a long ways to restore faith in American leadership and moral strength , too .
More and better systems for zero - carbon energy production are in development .
Many are , to me , surprising to see , especially in their esthetics .
There are wind turbines , and not all the huge , horizontal propellers , that are – wow – quite beautiful to look at !
There are strong improvements in protecting birds and animals at the same time , and in efficiency at many levels .
Same for solar , where some of the new hardware , besides promising to become competitive with coal and other old - wave sources , look and feel sexy .
Approaches to wave energy and – who knows ?
– are very intriguing , deserve to be pushed hard .
So this post is running long , and there is something else of importance I wish to add , even though I ’ve pushed it clear down here in hopes that will signal my sense of its importance , but of its rank as secondary to the argument of this forum .
‘ Argument ’ that is , in the sense of the Italian word ‘ argomento ’ or main subject .
I encourage anyone to keep looking around , be informed , armed , and bring that added context into this discussion , which is an important one , and difficult enough .
.
A word on civility and acceptable content .
A series of posts , here , which began with one of my own , have turned into a shouting match and become uncomfortably personal .
I accept my role in that downturn of spirit .
I ’m not certain where the the confines of manners might be in a forum such as this ; is it not acceptable to voice disagreement ?
To indicate what appear , from the writer ’s perspective , to be errors or inconsistencies , in the reasoning or argument of another poster ?
And what to do , when the content or the tenor of postings crosses some line of acceptability of a moral or spiritual character ?
If someone posted a call , literally stated , to pick up guns and kill people who had names beginning with letters in the second half of the alphabet , it would be obligatory , I hope , to object , if not to call the police .
What prompted me to intervene has not , I want to stress , of that explicit nature , but it was and is a matter of seriously loaded and objectionable content .
I used the word ‘ obscene ’ early on .
I do n’t call the police over obscenity ( unless it accompanies physical threat ) but I do note it , at least , and object , when appropriate .
My post , I think it was 33 , was in response to what were ambiguous but loaded declarations in a preceding post .
I thought at the time that the poster may have been joking , or even ‘ trolling ’ but no matter , the way it came across , on reflection , was that the matter was serious enough to deserve my response .
If the poster had been joking , then I , too , was joking in the manner of my framing of my reply .
But I do n’t think this is a matter of a joke , and that , as I have written before now , disturbs me .
It would disturb me to hear anyone speaking , in a public place , in such phrases ; surely in a written discourse in a public forum such as this one , the effect , and the gravity , are of like kind .
I ca n’t just walk away from it , although I have no stomach to ‘ confront ’ ( do note the quotes ) the individual who wrote the lines that bother me .
And , if the silence from others here on the same matter is an expression of better judgment , that is , if you all see what I see and choose the path of letting it go in the nonce , then I salute you and say , you are right , and why am I caught up in this way ?
But just in case there is more to the story , I will point back to the same poster ’s most recent message .
It contained lines to the effect that the writer would celebrate the deaths of – not quoting but recalling from memory here – masses of humanity in natural catastrophes following human - caused climate change .
What that says to me is that we have a person who would throw a party on the graves of those who died during Katrina , or the Indonesian Tsunami , the Chinese earthquake ( not sure either of those can directly be tied to global warming , but where there ’s a will there ’s a way … ) .
It ’s easy to induce and infer that the writer of that post would cheer the deaths , on all sides , in Iraq , since they devolve from our thirst for oil .
And , retrospectively , the Holocaust , which resulted in part from geopolitical and economic disruptions as the Post - WWI order shifted .
In fact , that writer , it seems safe to say , would go back and smile at the Armenian Genocide during WWI , too .
Those were events that arguably took place in the context of post Industrial Revolution changes , political and environmental .
I may be accused of putting hard words in someone else ’s mouth , so let me be clear .
I follow a trail here , based on what the poster has written in this forum .
Not once but several times , tightening the focus of what he has had to say each time .
I ’m not amused .
If the point was to draw in someone like me and have the occasion to gloat at this successful button - pushing , I yield !
You know who you are , you have succeeded !
I sleep well .
I ’m not losing lunch over this , but , to repeat , it is important .
I would not accept having these statements read out within my community , my church , my university , my atelier d’arte .
Of course there is one more facet of this , at least .
I ca n’t guage very well the poster ’s motive .
In that , I must cut some slack , as they say , and leave allowances for what I do n’t know to be the case .
But do take notice , one and all : while I stand up and reject the notions proposed , as I denounce their substance with all of my strength , I allow them to be expressed .
Forever .
As I am doing now .
Greetings from San Diego !
It is good to be on the Left Coast once again .
Today 's lovely guest strip is brought to you by Chris Daily .
Is so good .
Is so funny .
So Comic Con !
I 'll be at the Dayfree Press table , booth # 1233 -1235 , along with a whole bunch people .
You should come say hi !
Okay time to go eat some food and drink some drinks .
Dutch coffee shops , long considered as synonymous with the Netherlands as tulips or attacking football , face a new challenge from today when a ban on smoking tobacco in restaurants and cafes comes into effect .
The owners claim the law , which will allow customers to light up potent tobacco - free pure cannabis joints but ban milder spliffs in which tobacco is mixed with cannabis , threatens to put hundreds of them out of business .
" It 's a bit like saying to someone you can go into a cafe and you can buy a beer , but you can't drink it there - you 'll have to stick to whisky , rum and vodka , " said Paul Wilhelm , owner of De Tweede Kamer , a popular Amsterdam coffee shop .
As most patrons prefer milder joints in which cannabis is mixed with tobacco , and only 18 % favour much stronger , pure cannabis spliffs , the fear is that the days of the coffee shops could be numbered .
The catering industry said 1,600 coffee shops across the country were up for sale because their owners were convinced their businesses were doomed .
Wilhelm , who has run his cafe since 1985 , said the law was in danger of " tearing the heart out " of Amsterdam 's social life .
" The focus of the De Tweede Kamer has always been social contact , " he added .
" They 'll destroy that with what I see as a ridiculous law . "
Mark Jacobsen , chairman of the BCD , a nationwide association of coffee shop owners , said proper implementation of the law would require inspectors to check each cannabis joint for tobacco content .
" It 's absurd .
In other countries they look to see whether you have marijuana in your cigarette , here they 'll look to see if you 've got cigarette in your marijuana . "
The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority , which is responsible for enforcing the ban , said it had trained around 200 inspectors .
" They can tell the difference between a mix or a pure joint from its smell and appearance , " said a spokesman .
Some coffee shop owners have sought alternative ways to deal with the conundrum and allow their clientele to still enjoy a tobacco - free cannabis spliff without it being too strong .
One inventor , who calls himself Evert , is doing a roaring trade in £ 400 vapourisers - in which hashish or cannabis is heated to 180C and the resulting steam is directed into a balloon from which smokers inhale .
The vapouriser is claimed to be the mildest way to consume pure cannabis .
While some cafes have said they will simply lay on more pure cannabis brownies or " space cakes " , others have built smoking chambers within their premises which are off - limits to staff .
Some are also providing alternatives to tobacco , such as the herb coltsfoot .
Martial von Beenkom , owner of Boerejongens ( Young Farmers ) on the outskirts of Amsterdam , has turned his cafe into a smoke - free tea salon where he will sell cannabis on a takeaway basis .
" Most people come here to buy their grass which they then smoke elsewhere , " he said .
The health minister , Ab Klink , said the law would stay , arguing that as well as helping to improve people 's health it might help to stamp out idleness .
" Consumers who spend the whole day hanging out in coffee shops will find other things to do , " he said .
Back story
The tradition of the Dutch coffee shop goes back to the 1970s , following the pragmatic policy of non-enforcement of laws on the consumption and possession of cannabis that was introduced in 1976 .
Under the policy licensed coffee shops are allowed to sell five grams of cannabis to customers over 18 .
Last year , the country 's 750 coffee shops , half of which are in Amsterdam , were forced to choose between serving alcohol or cannabis .
Most chose cannabis .
Possibly The World ’s Dumbest Criminal
Typically criminals are either very smart or very stupid .
Zhou , a burglar from HuBei Province , China , proves through his recent crime that he has to be the dumbest criminal ever .
Zhou decided to break into a house in a nice neighborhood in HuBei .
He was successful in taking about $ 65,000 in random jewels and cash .
He also found two extremely large diamond rings in the house .
Zhou was sure that because of the size of the diamonds on the ring , they must be fake .
He immediately flushed them down the toilet and left with his freshly stolen goods .
It was n’t until after he was caught and police began questioning him about the real diamond jewelry that he realized the diamonds were real and he had thrown them away .
It took the police a little while to figure out what the burglars repeated “ I ’m so stupid ” statement was all about .
No mention was made as to whether the two diamond rings where ever recovered .

MINNEAPOLIS --
A computer simulation of rapidly oscillating wings and the complex motions of fluids has proved that insect flight conforms to the physical principles of aerodynamics .
The computer - modeling accomplishment - which is expected to aid the future design of tiny insect - like flying machines and should dispel the longstanding myth that " bumblebees cannot fly , according to conventional aerodynamics " - was announced by Cornell University physicist Z. Jane Wang today ( March 20 ) at the Minneapolis meeting of the American Physical Society ( APS ) .
" The old bumblebee myth simply reflected our poor understanding of unsteady viscous fluid dynamics , " explained Wang , an assistant professor of theoretical and applied mechanics in Cornell 's College of Engineering , in an interview before the APS meeting .
" Unlike fixed - wing aircraft with their steady , almost inviscid ( without viscosity ) flow dynamics , insects fly in a sea of vortices , surrounded by tiny eddies and whirlwinds that are created when they move their wings . "
A vortex created by an airplane usually is a minor nuisance that is left behind in the slipstream .
But insects depend on vortices to keep them aloft , especially when they are hovering .
An important key to solving the mystery of insect flight , Wang said , is the understanding of the vortex " shedding " and how the vortices behave when they separate from the moving surface that created them .
Any theory of insect flight has to account for both viscous and inertial effects , Wang said , noting that in a fluid environment like air , inertia is a force due to the motion of the fluid itself as fluid particles are carried along by their own velocity .
And viscous force has to do with the differences in velocity , or shear , within the fluid .
" In the earliest studies of insect flight , it was hoped that unsteady effects might be relatively unimportant , " Wang noted .
" Later , several investigators suggested that unsteady effects might play a significant role .
But there was no quantitative theory available because of the difficulties inherent in dealing with unsteady flows coupled to moving boundaries . "
Insects are n't the only things affected by the interaction between dynamic boundaries and highly unsteady viscous flows , the engineering professor said .
The erratic motion of a falling piece of paper or the wobble of bubbles rising through a glass of soda pop result from vortex wakes , and so did one of civil engineering 's greatest design catastrophes - the collapse in 1940 of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in the state of Washington .
Wind blowing across the surface of that newly built structure set up severe vibrations and undulating motions that tore the suspension bridge apart .
" Rapid oscillations pose one of the most difficult questions for fluid dynamics , " Wang said .
" Things become very messy . "
Biologists with high - speed video cameras have been able to document the oscillating motions of insect wings as they move up and down and change pitch by tilting the edges , and the complex motions are beginning to be incorporated in the design of robotic " insect " wings .
However , the aerodynamics of hovering insects , such as dragonflies , is still not fully understood .
Wang chose the dragonfly as " the worst case for quasi - steady state theory " as the first test of her computer simulation .
The simulation required the development by Wang of some new computational tools - " tricks , " she modestly calls them , to resolve unsteady flows and forces , which are governed by a mathematical calculation called the Navier - Stokes Equation - and hundreds of hours of number - crunching by a supercomputer .
The result was the first ever proof that dragonflies produce sufficient lift to stay above the ground - at least in a two - dimensional simulation .
The same simulation in three dimensions will require more computational " tricks " and computer time , and Wang currently is working on that .
By substituting wing - motion data from other kinds of insects , she says , the simulation will reveal the fluid dynamics of flight by those species - including bumblebees .
The insect aerodynamics studies were funded by the National Science Foundation .
Before joining faculty in 1999 at Cornell , where she teaches applied mathematics and mathematical modeling , Wang conducted postdoctoral research at New York University 's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences ( where she first became interested in insect flight ) as well as the University of Oxford .
Before that she earned a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Chicago and a bachelor 's degree at Fudan University in the People 's Republic of China .
Looking ahead to the construction of tiny flying machines for aerial surveillance and other purposes , Wang says the designs need not resemble fixed - wing airplanes or helicopters .
Now that the rules for insect flight are quantified , designs for buglike devices of almost any size can be tested in the computer .
Various designs can virtually hover , fly backward and perform acrobatic maneuvers in full accordance with the principles of unsteady viscous fluid dynamics .
Or crash - virtually - if they do n't .
Ever since she heard it , the bumblebee myth has bothered Wang the way yellowjackets pester picnickers , and she has tried to trace its historical source .
" The rumor probably started in the 1930s with students of the noted aerodynamicist Ludwig Prandtl at Gottingen , " she said .
" That was a time when we were just beginning to think we understood aerodynamic principles , as applied to fixed - wing aircraft , but scientists recognized their limitations in applying the principles to the birds and insects and other creatures in the natural world .
" I 'm sure no one , including the bees , seriously doubted that insects can fly , " she said .
" Now we 're beginning to understand why . "
Seriously I have had this comic for over ten days and I still cannot stop laughing when I read it .
Thank you , John Campbell , thank you .
Regular QC will attempt to resume tomorrow - it may be a tad late because of plane flights etc . but I will do my best .
See you then .
Posted by Big Gav in apache energy , gas , lng , varanus island , western australia
An explosion at Apache 's Varanus Island gas plant in Western Australia on June 3 cut off 30 per cent of the state 's domestic gas supply .
Supplies to mines and industry in the Pilbara region ( the heartland of Australian iron ore mining ) fell by 45 per cent .
The supply disruption was exacerbated by an inability to start alternative forms of power generation - the coal fired Collie power station , for example , had damaged turbine blades and could not immediately return to service .
This has had a large impact on the local economy ( the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimates the crisis will have cost the state $ 6.7 billion , assuming energy supplies are fully restored by December ) and makes an interesting case study of the effects of a sudden reduction in energy supplies .
The cause of the explosion is rumoured to be a corroded pipe that ruptured , though Apache is remaining coy about responding to this theory for the time being .
The National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority , which is investigating the incident , said it would be " inappropriate to pre-empt the findings by releasing any investigation material beforehand " .
The WA opposition is calling for a Royal Commission to investigate the incident , similar to the one that examined the 1998 Longford plant explosion and fire , which cut household gas supplies in Victoria for two weeks .
The situation has been exacerbated by the lack of any contingency plans for a disaster , in spite of police warnings that these were needed and highlighting potential weaknesses at the facility .
The company reportedly responded to one of the issues raised - the need to have spare parts available - by asking " How can we justify having a $ 8 million component sitting on the shelf ? " .
A few years ago there was a minor bout of hysteria about the hospital in the nearby ( by WA standards ) town of Port Hedland serving halal meals to patients , so I 've been ( pleasantly ) surprised that no one has tried to gain any political mileage by trying to wield the " power of nightmares " and invoke the terrorism bogeyman as a possible cause .
This might be because the whole issue has disappeared from the Australian political scene since the unceremonious departure of unloved ex -Prime Minister John Howard , but it could also be because there has been a long standing military operation protecting vital infrastructure in the area , thus making the possibility remote .
WA holds the majority of Australia 's natural gas reserves and is a fairly large producer of gas by global standards ( much of the gas produced being exported to North Asia in the form of LNG from the North West Shelf gas project on the Burrup peninsula ) .
WA is much more reliant on gas for its energy needs than other states - the most recent figures from the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics ( ABARE ) show WA uses 385,000 terajoules of natural gas a year , compared to Victoria 's 258,000 terajoules and NSW 's 140,000 terajoules .
The gas is mostly used to generate electricity - 60 % of WA 's power supply comes from gas .
Varanus Island produces 380 terajoules of gas , sourced from the Harriet and John Brookes joint ventures , with most of it distributed to the south west of the state via the 1600 km Dampier to Bunbury pipeline .
Up to 60 terajoules of gas is transported to the Kalgoorlie region via the Goldfields gas pipeline , which services big mining customers .
Gas supplies to mines and industry in the Pilbara region have fallen 45 per cent , those to the Goldfields have fallen by 20 per cent and the state 's southwest , where most of the population lives , has seen a 20 per cent reduction for large industries and commerce , and a further 25 per cent drop for mid-sized businesses .
As a large swathe of business has been affected , almost every industry sector has been vocally complaining about how much suffering it is enduring and how much special assistance or priority access to energy supplies it needs . *
The WA Food Industry Association has called for government support , claiming it will " lose market share " and businesses may have to stop production . *
The mining industry has decreased production .
Examples of companies flagging decreased output include nickel producer Minara Resources , goldminer Newcrest Mining and mineral sands miner Iluka Resources .
Alcoa ( Australia ) notified customers it was declaring force majeure on its supply contracts for alumina . *
BHP Billiton brought forward a four - month shutdown of its Kalgoorlie nickel smelter , freeing up gas supplies for its Worsley aluminium refinery ( which caused a rise in global nickel prices due to the tight supply situation ) .*
Fertiliser manufacturer Burrup Holdings delayed its float on the stockmarket , after its gas suppliers issued it with a " force majeure " notice .
Wesfarmers has also reported disruption to its fertiliser and LPG businesses .
Midland Brick , the world 's largest brickworks , has had to shut down its kilns on a number of occasions .
Laundry services have shut down , with the hotel industry struggling to find supplies of clean linen .
The Varanus Island incident has rekindled the security of energy supply debate first sparked by the January shutdown of the North - West Shelf project , which put two - thirds of the state 's gas supply offline for a shorter period of time .
At one point WA premier Alan Carpenter was warning he might he might need to invoke emergency powers to seize control over all gas and electricity supplies in the state , though he seems to have calmed down since then - although he has announced that energy security will be a key issue in future .
The major supply side response for many larger gas customers has been to switch to diesel generation instead .
This comes at a fairly large price , as diesel costs around 10 times as much as gas , according to the WA Office of Energy .
The cost of switching from gas to diesel to gas had meant that some large gas - fired power generation units with secure gas supply contracts with the ( still online ) north west shelf project have remained on gas instead of switching to diesel where possible , causing some controversy .
The other major supply response has been to restart 2 mothballed coal fired power stations - the 110 megawatt Kwinana Unit One ( which Premier Carpenter says should free up about five terajoules of gas a day ) and the 340 megawatt Muja AB power station at Collie ( prompting some protests about reopening the dirtiest generation facility in the state ) .
The state government has also asked local utility Verve Energy to consider building a new coal fired generator in Collie .
While the WA state government was happy to revive the local coal industry , it has remained firmly opposed to nuclear power , with Carpenter stating “ There will be no nuclear power , no nuclear waste and uranium mining in WA while I am the Premier ” .
Carpenter has also announced a ( tiny ) investment of $ 6 million into low carbon emissions technology , with the money being used for the construction of a 2 MW solar power station in Kalgoorlie and the development of an oil mallee harvesting machine .
More usefully , he has also announced an expanded public transport network , including a link from the Perth city centre to the airport , light rail and tram routes , and the extension of existing railway lines .
Robert Amin , Curtin University 's chair of Petroleum Engineering , criticised the state government 's lack of contingency plans , recommending WA should have at least a month 's worth of gas stored in underground reservoirs for use in such situations , noting that depleted gas reservoirs in Dongara were ideal .
The WA Liberal opposition proposed an assortment of measures to respond to the crisis , including :* accelerating development of natural gas reserves * duplication of the pipeline network from the north west to southern WA * using LNG tankers to ship gas from the north * interconnection the pipeline network to the eastern statesSome of these seem a bit random , given that duplicating the pipeline , for example , would have made no difference at all to the current situation .
A gas interconnection to the east coast would be an interesting ( albeit expensive ) project - it would have the benefit of increasing supply options for the east ( mitigating the depletion of Cooper Basin and Bass Strait fields ) , but would also likely rapidly increase east coast gas prices to be in line with those of the international LNG market .
Overall , the reaction to the incident has been less than inspiring , with the response largely being to switch back to the dirty and depleting alternatives of coal and diesel .
No real thought seems to have been given to ways of making the state 's energy supplies more resilient in future , or to the fact that diesel is getting increasingly expensive and will likely to be much harder to obtain in future years .
A better response would have been to instead begin planning to embed more distributed generation , along with smarter demand management , into the grid from a variety of sources .
Given that WA has high quality solar resources , particularly in the north west where they are world class , and a vast amount of space for wind and wave power generation , I would hope that efforts are undertaken to start substituting ( or at least supplementing ) both coal and gas fired generators with alternatives that do n't depend on the continued extraction of finite resources .
The most useful action taking during the crisis I 've seen so far was Alcoa ( the largest single user of gas ) deciding to push ahead with WA 's first " tight gas " development - the Warro gas field in the state 's mid-west .
Managing Director Alan Cransberg said that if it proves to be commercially viable it could supply up to 10 per cent of domestic gas demand - but denied the Varanus Island prompted the decision , instead pointing to the tight gas supply situation that already existed beforehand .

From animated children ’s shows like “ The Jetsons ’’ to classics like the original “ Star Trek ’’ series ( pictured ) , there have been plenty of mind bending science fiction shows that have graced television sets over the years .
The sci fi genre just never seems to get old .
Based on years of sci fi viewing experience and a variety of online sources .
we ’ve come up with our picks for the Top 50 science fiction shows of all time .
50 . ‘ Earth – Final Conflict ’
Starting the list at Number 50 : “ Earth – Final Conflict , ’’ which aired from 1997 to 2002 .
It followed a basic , but popular , storyline about aliens who come to Earth and solve the planet ’s problems .
But is there more ?
Are there any other intentions ?
Of course .
The story focuses on a double agent , William Boone ( played by Kevin Kilner ) , who is in search of the truth .
49 . ‘ The Wild Wild West ’ Two Secret Service agents – James West ( Robert Conrad ) and Artemus Gordon ( Ross Martin ) – fight the forces of evil in the Wild West ( thus the title ) .
However , these two good guys ’ gadgets rival those of James Bond .
A great show for its time .
48 . ‘ 3rd Rock From The Sun ’ A group of aliens move to Earth to study humans while at the same time taking on human form so they can blend in .
But with human characteristics also come human frailties – complete with emotional issues and basic physical needs .
John Lithgow leads the “ family ’’ in this entertaining sci - fi comedy .
The series ran from 1996 to 2001 .
47 . ‘ Buck Rogers in the 25th Century ’ A 20th century astronaut , Buck Rogers ( played by Gil Gerard ) , is on a space mission when his shuttle runs into a cosmic anomaly .
Buck ’s frozen in suspended animation until he ’s revived 500 years later .
From 1979 to 1981 , we watched as Buck helped solve future Earth ’s dilemmas .
And , of couse , we could n’t leave out the lovely Erin Gray as Colonel Wilma Deering .
The show also taught us that spandex is in ample supply in the 25th century .
46 . ‘ That Was Then ’
If you blinked , you may have missed this short - lived gem of a sci - fi show on ABC .
As Travis Glass ( played by James Bulliard ) turned 30 years old , he realized his life since high school was pretty much wasted .
He envies his jerk brother Gregg ( played by Brad Raider ) who married Travis ’ dream girl , Claudia ( played by Kiele Sanchez ) .
Thanks to a wish , an electrical problem and an old Kink ’s song , Travis returns to 1988 to change the past .
But everytime he hears the Kink ’s song again , he ’s catapulted back to the future to see how his changes affected the outcome of his life at 30 .
The show was canceled long before it had a chance to reach its prime .
It ran in the fall of 2002 .
45 . ‘ The Greatest American Hero ’
An average school teacher , Ralph Hinkley ( played by William Katt ) , and an aging FBI agent , William “ Bill ’’ Maxwell ( Robert Culp ) , are approached by aliens who give Hinkley a super suit .
When worn , the suit will allow Hinkley to have super human powers and help mankind .
The one problem , Hinkley loses the directions .
This classic ran from 1981 to 1983 and also featured a young and lovely Connie Selleca , who played Hinkley ’s girlfriend then wife , Pam Davidson Hinkley .
44 . ‘ Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman ’
We ’ve seen Superman played by many actors but “ Lois & Clark : The New Adventures of Superman ’’ was a new spin on one of the world ’s best superheroes .
In this version , Superman , aka Clark Kent ( played by Dean Cain ) , is in his early 20s working at the Daily Planet with love interest Lois Lane ( played by Teri Hatcher ) .
A refreshing interpretation of the man of steel .
43 . ‘ Nowhere Man ’ “ Nowhere Man ’ ’ was yet another show ahead of its time – and canceled way too early .
Thomas Veil , played by Bruce Greenwood , is a documentary photographer who ’s identity and memory are altered .
His wife and friends no longer know him ( or at least act like they do n’t ) and he finds his existence has been erased .
He embarks on a search for the truth .
Toward the final episodes of this brilliant series were hints that the whole thing could be tied into a government conspiracy .
But , alas , the show was canceled before we could find out the truth .
The series ran all too briefly in 1995 .
42 . ‘ Science Fiction Theatre ’

39 . ( The New ) ‘ V’ ABC ’s new remake of the Visitors – or “ V ’’ – showed lots of promise .
While the show has had many twists and turns , the pace of the story progression has been somewhat slow compared to its 1980s predecessor .
Many wonder whether the show will return after its recent season finale .
Still , despite its short comings , it moves up on the list to No. 39 .
38 . ‘ Batman ’ Before Michael Keaton , Val Kilmer , George Clooney , and Christian Bale , there was Adam West playing Batman on TV .
This was West at his best playing a somewhat hip , yet straightlaced , hero with sidekick Robin ( played by Burt Ward ) .

Austin is mutilated after a crash and a secret government agency replaces his now departed parts with super powerful mechanical limbs .
Austin uses his new superhuman like powers to solve crimes and catch bad guys .
Look for the classic episode when he battled Sasquatch , or Big Foot .

28 . Adventures of Superman ’
This is the original Superman , at least the television version .

After the war , she returned to her island of women .
However , during the last season , she re-emerges 30 years later when Major Steve Trevor ’s son , Steve Trevor Jr. , enlists her to battle evil once again .
OK , the writers did a poor job in trying to transport her into the modern day , but the show was good enough to cut them some slack .
23 . ‘ Tales from the Crypt ’
This great HBO show lasted from 1989 to 1996 and featured scary stories , mostly based on comics from the 1950s .
The show was hosted by the gruesome , and funny , Crypt Keeper ( pictured here ) .
22 . ‘ Andromeda ’ “ Andromeda ’ ’ was the brainchild of “ Star Trek ’’ creator Gene Roddenberry .
It ’s the story of Captain Dylan Hunt ( played by Kevin Sorbo ) who is on a mission to rebuild the All - Systems Commonwealth 300 years after it fell apart .

This miniseries was nearly 20 years ahead of “ Independence Day . ’’
In 1983 , sci -fi loving Americans were glued to their sets to watch the Visitors in the miniseries “ V. ’’
It followed the classic aliens plot — aliens come to Earth to help mankind , but actually want to steal the planet ’s natural resources .
A regular show followed this miniseries , but never quite lived up to the original .
17 . ‘ Firefly ’ “ Firefly ’ ’ was an intriguing show about a crew trying to survive in a small spaceship 500 years in the future .
Alas , the show ended after its first season though it showed great promise .
16 . ‘ Flash Gordon ’
One critic of the 1950s “ Flash Gordon ’ ’ television series described the show as “ so bad it ’s good . ’’
This classic brought Flash , Dale Arden , Dr. Hans Zarkov , and other characters into the homes of countless Americans .
15 . ‘ Logan ’s Run ’ “ Logan ’s Run ’ ’ only ran a season or two but makes our list nonetheless .

Until you realize that they ’re going to waste you once you reach your 30th birthday .
That ’s one way to solve the a Social Security crisis ( though we hope not ) .
The show followed Logan ( Gregory Harrison , right ) and his companions as they search for a mythical placed called The Sanctuary , which holds the promise of freedom .
14 . ‘ Star Trek Voyager ’ “ Star Trek Voyager ’ ’ started off slow but ended as one of the better “ Star Trek ’’ spinoffs .
In 1995 , we watched as the crew of the star ship Voyager was catapulted across the galaxy .
The story revolved around their trip back to Earth , which at full speed would have taken 75 years to complete .
Led by Captain Catherine Janeway ( played by Kate Mulgrew ) , the ship and its crew finally did make it home – but not before several great run-ins with Borg and other creatures .
13 . ‘ The Outer Limits ’ “ There is nothing wrong with your television .
Do not attempt to adjust the picture ’’ is the famous line that marked the start of each episode .
This science fiction show featured a different cast each week that focused on space travel , time travel , and more .
12 . ‘ Xena : Warrior Princess ’ Lucy Lawless ( left ) starred as Xena in this top - notch show about a warrior princess who once ravaged ancient Greece and its people .
After realizing her mistakes , she vows to use her warrior and healing abilities to help others .
Together , she and her companion , Gabrielle ( played by Renee O’Connor , right ) travel the ancient world looking for adventure .
Another series that ended too soon .
11 . ‘ Lost ’ “ Lost ’’ promises another exciting season full of mystery and suspense .
Just in case you ’ve been living in a hole , here ’s the plot : Dozens of people survive a plane crash and land on a mysterious island , which is full of secrets and supernatural things , including a huge creature who meanders in the woods .
The future ranking of this hit ABC show on our list depends on whether the network is able to keep the mystery tasty enough for its viewers .
10 . ‘ Sliders ’ Sliders ’’ should have been a widespread hit , but it was ahead of its time .
The show was about a whiz - kid genius Quinn Mallory , played by Jerry O’Connell ( left ) , and his band of three companions who slide among Earth ’s alternate realities .
Toward the end of the series , the show quickly slid in quality as three of its stars – O’Connell , Sabrina Lloyd and John Rhys - Davies ( right ) – departed and were replaced by others .
A tragic demise to a fine show .
9. ‘ Mystery Science Theater 3000 ’
A man finds himself trapped on an orbiting space station with wacky robots and a sadistic woman , who forces him to watch the worst B horror flicks ever made .
The show revolves around the man and his robots watching the movie , at the same time offering hilarious commentary .
The show had a couple of different hosts ( including Michael J. Nelson , center ) during its run from 1988 through 1999 .
8. ‘ Dr. Who ’
No sci - fi show list is complete without “ Dr. Who . ’’
The series started in 1963 and featured several men as the doctor – a time traveling , eccentric alien – and his comrades .
Sure , many of the monsters were terribly cheesy , but it is a classic nonetheless .
The show was canceled in 1989 , made a brief return in a TV movie in 1996 and then was fully resurrected and came back into production in 2003 .
It continues today .
7. ‘ The Twilight Zone ’
Not only is “ The Twilight Zone ’ ’ one of the greatest sci - fi shows ever , it ’s one of the best shows of all time .
Rod Serling hosted the show from 1959 to 1964 .
Each week , he featured a usually creepy , sometime witty , show that ranged from alien invaders to time travel .
Pictured : James Daly as Gart Williams from the “ The Twilight Zone ’ ’ episode “ This is Willoughby . ’’
6. ‘ Stargate SG - 1 ’ “ Stargate SG - 1 ’’ follows a secret military unit that travels across the universe via a stargate , a device created by ancients .
A great show with a solid cast .
Pictured from left : Beau Bridges as General Hank Landry and Ben Browder as Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell .
5. ‘ Babylon 5 ’ “ Babylon 5 ’’ is arguably one of the best sci - fi shows ever made .
Some may compare it to “ Star Trek DS - 9 ’ ’ but with a better plot and cast – you be the judge .
In the meantime , we ’ll give “ Babylon 5 ’’ a thumbs up showing in the No. 5 spot .
4. ‘ The X - Files ’ “ The X - Files ’’ helped inspire a new generation of Americans to fall in love with conspiracy theories .
David Duchovny ( left ) played FBI agent Fox Mulder who , along with his partner , Dana Scully ( played by Gillian Anderson ) , uncovered extraterrestrial mysteries and tried to use science to explain the unexplainable .
The show survived from 1993 to 2002 but quickly faltered when Duchovny went on to pursue a movie career .
3. ‘ Star Trek : The Next Generation ’ “ Star Trek : The Next Generation ’’ is on many people ’s list as the best sci - fi show of all time .
It nearly made our number one spot , too .
The show featured a great cast that evolved throughout its seven seasons , from 1987 through 1994 .
Pictured : Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean - Luc Picard .
2. ‘ Star Trek’ ( Original )
Recently , the original “ Star Trek , ’’ which aired just three seasons from 1966 - 69 , fell from the number 1 spot on the list to number 2 .
Yes , perhaps it did n’t feature the best acting , or most compelling story plots , but it was a show that set the standard for future space epics since .
The show is also more popular today than it was when it first ran .
The show went on to inspire several movies , several spinoffs , and hordes of fans .
BERLIN , Germany ( CNN ) --
Thank you to the citizens of Berlin and to the people of Germany .
Let me thank Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today .
Thank you Mayor Wowereit , the Berlin Senate , the police , and most of all thank you for this welcome .
U.S. presidential hopeful Barack Obama delivers his speech to a large crowd in Berlin .
I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before .
Tonight , I speak to you not as a candidate for President , but as a citizen - a proud citizen of the United States , and a fellow citizen of the world .
I know that I do n't look like the Americans who 've previously spoken in this great city .
The journey that led me here is improbable .
My mother was born in the heartland of America , but my father grew up herding goats in Kenya .
His father - my grandfather - was a cook , a domestic servant to the British .
At the height of the Cold War , my father decided , like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world , that his yearning - his dream - required the freedom and opportunity promised by the West .
And so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across America until somebody , somewhere answered his prayer for a better life .
That is why I 'm here .
And you are here because you too know that yearning .
This city , of all cities , knows the dream of freedom .
And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work , and struggle , and sacrifice for that better life .
Ours is a partnership that truly began sixty years ago this summer , on the day when the first American plane touched down at Templehof .
On that day , much of this continent still lay in ruin .
The rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall .
The Soviet shadow had swept across Eastern Europe , while in the West , America , Britain , and France took stock of their losses , and pondered how the world might be remade .
This is where the two sides met .
And on the twenty - fourth of June , 1948 , the Communists chose to blockade the western part of the city .
They cut off food and supplies to more than two million Germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin .
The size of our forces was no match for the much larger Soviet Army .
And yet retreat would have allowed Communism to march across Europe .
Where the last war had ended , another World War could have easily begun .
All that stood in the way was Berlin .
And that 's when the airlift began - when the largest and most unlikely rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city .
The odds were stacked against success .
In the winter , a heavy fog filled the sky above , and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the needed supplies .
The streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold .
But in the darkest hours , the people of Berlin kept the flame of hope burning .
The people of Berlin refused to give up .
And on one fall day , hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here , to the Tiergarten , and heard the city 's mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom .
" There is only one possibility , " he said .
" For us to stand together united until this battle is won ... The people of Berlin have spoken .
We have done our duty , and we will keep on doing our duty .
People of the world : now do your duty ... People of the world , look at Berlin ! "
People of the world - look at Berlin !
Look at Berlin , where Germans and Americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle .
Look at Berlin , where the determination of a people met the generosity of the Marshall Plan and created a German miracle ; where a victory over tyranny gave rise to NATO , the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security .
Look at Berlin , where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars near the Brandenburg Gate insist that we never forget our common humanity .
People of the world - look at Berlin , where a wall came down , a continent came together , and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one .
Sixty years after the airlift , we are called upon again .
History has led us to a new crossroad , with new promise and new peril .
When you , the German people , tore down that wall - a wall that divided East and West ; freedom and tyranny ; fear and hope - walls came tumbling down around the world .
From Kiev to Cape Town , prison camps were closed , and the doors of democracy were opened .
Markets opened too , and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity .
While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny , the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history .
The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope .
But that very closeness has given rise to new dangers - dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean .
The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on American soil .
As we speak , cars in Boston and factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps in the Arctic , shrinking coastlines in the Atlantic , and bringing drought to farms from Kansas to Kenya .
Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union , or secrets from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in Paris .
The poppies in Afghanistan become the heroin in Berlin .
The poverty and violence in Somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow .
The genocide in Darfur shames the conscience of us all .
In this new world , such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them .
That is why we cannot afford to be divided .
No one nation , no matter how large or powerful , can defeat such challenges alone .
None of us can deny these threats , or escape responsibility in meeting them .
Yet , in the absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall , it has become easy to forget this truth .
And if we 're honest with each other , we know that sometimes , on both sides of the Atlantic , we have drifted apart , and forgotten our shared destiny .
In Europe , the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world , rather than a force to help make it right , has become all too common .
In America , there are voices that deride and deny the importance of Europe 's role in our security and our future .
Both views miss the truth - that Europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world ; and that just as American bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent , so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe .
Yes , there have been differences between America and Europe .
No doubt , there will be differences in the future .
But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together .
A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden .
In this new century , Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less .
Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice ; it is the one way , the only way , to protect our common security and advance our common humanity .
That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another .
The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand .
The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand .
The walls between races and tribes ; natives and immigrants ; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand .
These now are the walls we must tear down .
We know they have fallen before .
After centuries of strife , the people of Europe have formed a Union of promise and prosperity .
Here , at the base of a column built to mark victory in war , we meet in the center of a Europe at peace .
Not only have walls come down in Berlin , but they have come down in Belfast , where Protestant and Catholic found a way to live together ; in the Balkans , where our Atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice ; and in South Africa , where the struggle of a courageous people defeated apartheid .
So history reminds us that walls can be torn down .
But the task is never easy .
True partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice .
They require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy ; of progress and peace .
They require allies who will listen to each other , learn from each other and , most of all , trust each other .
That is why America cannot turn inward .
That is why Europe cannot turn inward .
America has no better partner than Europe .
Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that bound us across the Atlantic .
Now is the time to join together , through constant cooperation , strong institutions , shared sacrifice , and a global commitment to progress , to meet the challenges of the 21st century .
It was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads , and people to assemble where we stand today .
And this is the moment when our nations - and all nations - must summon that spirit anew .
This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it .
This threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it .
If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union , we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Amman ; in London and Bali ; in Washington and New York .
If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists , we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope .
This is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in Afghanistan , and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets .
No one welcomes war .
I recognize the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan .
But my country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO 's first mission beyond Europe 's borders is a success .
For the people of Afghanistan , and for our shared security , the work must be done .
America cannot do this alone .
The Afghan people need our troops and your troops ; our support and your support to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda , to develop their economy , and to help them rebuild their nation .
We have too much at stake to turn back now .
This is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons .
The two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love .
With that wall gone , we need not stand idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom .
It is time to secure all loose nuclear materials ; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons ; and to reduce the arsenals from another era .
This is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons .
This is the moment when every nation in Europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday .
In this century , we need a strong European Union that deepens the security and prosperity of this continent , while extending a hand abroad .
In this century - in this city of all cities - we must reject the Cold War mind - set of the past , and resolve to work with Russia when we can , to stand up for our values when we must , and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent .
This is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open markets have created , and share its benefits more equitably .
Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development .
But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few , and not the many .
Together , we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth , with meaningful protections for our people and our planet .
This is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all .
This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East .
My country must stand with yours and with Europe in sending a direct message to Iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions .
We must support the Lebanese who have marched and bled for democracy , and the Israelis and Palestinians who seek a secure and lasting peace .
And despite past differences , this is the moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives , even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close .
This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet .
Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands .
Let us resolve that all nations - including my own - will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation , and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere .
This is the moment to give our children back their future .
This is the moment to stand as one .
And this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world .
We must remember that the Cold War born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure .
Sixty years ago , the planes that flew over Berlin did not drop bombs ; instead they delivered food , and coal , and candy to grateful children .
And in that show of solidarity , those pilots won more than a military victory .
They won hearts and minds ; love and loyalty and trust - not just from the people in this city , but from all those who heard the story of what they did here .
Now the world will watch and remember what we do here - what we do with this moment .
Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity ; by security and justice ?
Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from poverty , shelter the refugee in Chad , and banish the scourge of AIDS in our time ?
Will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in Burma , the blogger in Iran , or the voter in Zimbabwe ?
Will we give meaning to the words " never again " in Darfur ?
Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world ?
Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law ?
Will we welcome immigrants from different lands , and shun discrimination against those who do n't look like us or worship like we do , and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people ?
People of Berlin - people of the world - this is our moment .
This is our time .
I know my country has not perfected itself .
At times , we 've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people .
We 've made our share of mistakes , and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions .
But I also know how much I love America .
I know that for more than two centuries , we have strived - at great cost and great sacrifice - to form a more perfect union ; to seek , with other nations , a more hopeful world .
Our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom - indeed , every language is spoken in our country ; every culture has left its imprint on ours ; every point of view is expressed in our public squares .
What has always united us - what has always driven our people ; what drew my father to America 's shores - is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people : that we can live free from fear and free from want ; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please .
Those are the aspirations that joined the fates of all nations in this city .
Those aspirations are bigger than anything that drives us apart .
It is because of those aspirations that the airlift began .
It is because of those aspirations that all free people - everywhere - became citizens of Berlin .
It is in pursuit of those aspirations that a new generation - our generation - must make our mark on history .
People of Berlin - and people of the world - the scale of our challenge is great .
The road ahead will be long .
But I come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom .
We are a people of improbable hope .
Let us build on our common history , and seize our common destiny , and once again engage in that noble struggle to bring justice and peace to our world .
Great security story from an obituary of former OSS agent Roger Hall :
One of his favorite OSS stories involved a colleague sent to occupied France to destroy a seemingly impenetrable German tank at a key crossroads .
The French resistance found that grenades were no use .
The OSS man , fluent in German and dressed like a French peasant , walked up to the tank and yelled , “ Mail ! ”
The lid opened , and in went two grenades .
Among the conditions extracted by regulators before approving the Sirius XM satellite radio merger earlier this month was the company 's promise to set aside a share of channels for minority programmers .
Now we 're finding out what these racial preferences mean in practice .
In a commitment letter last month , Sirius XM informed the Federal Communications Commission that while it agreed to reserve the channels , the company does n't want to choose the actual programmers .
No doubt Sirius XM realizes that this is one giant political ...
Age - old money matters : Positivity in older adults leads to balanced investments
The economic and psychological term known as " sunk - cost fallacy " is a bias that leads someone to make a decision based solely on a previous financial investment .
For example , a baseball fan might attend every game of the season only because he already purchased the tickets .
But not everyone would force themselves to brave the pouring rain for a single game in one season simply because they previously paid for the seats .
So who is more likely to commit or avoid the sunk - cost fallacy and why ?
In a recent study , psychologists JoNell Strough , Clare Mehta , Joseph McFall and Kelly Schuller from West Virginia University found that younger adults were more likely to commit to a situation if they had already invested money into it , and that older adults showed a more balanced fiscal perspective of the same situation .
To get to this conclusion , the researchers presented college students and senior citizens with two vignettes to test how likely each age group would be to watch a boring , paid - for movie versus a boring , free movie .
The first vignette specifically read , " You paid $ 10.95 to see a movie on pay TV .
After five minutes , you are bored and the movie seems pretty bad " ; the other vignette did not include a cost .
Participants then selected from five options regarding their projected time commitment — stop watching entirely , watch for ten more minutes , watch for twenty more minutes , watch for thirty more minutes or watch until the end .
The results , which appear in the July issue of Psychological Science , a publication of the Association for Psychological Science , show the older adults spent the same amount of time watching the movie regardless of monetary investment .
In contrast , the young adults chose to invest more time in the paid - for movie than the free movie in order to avoid wasting $ 10.95 .
The psychologists attribute the distinction between younger and older peoples ' decisions to differences in the way each group thinks about gains versus losses .
" Younger adults show a negativity bias , " Strough explained .
" They weigh negative information , such as the lost investment , more heavily than positive information and so they try to ' recover ' the lost investment by investing more time . "
On the other hand , older adults are more likely to view the positive side of situations ; therefore , their decisions reflect a more balanced view of gains and losses .
According to the psychologists , older adults ' more balanced view may help them recognize that , once made , this type of investment cannot be recovered simply by committing more time to the activity .

WASHINGTON , Aug 19 ( Reuters ) - The United States warned Georgia against a fight with Russia , a senior U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday as Washington demanded Moscow withdraw its forces more quickly from the former Soviet republic .
“ Our message was consistent to our Georgian colleagues ... ‘ Avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia at all costs .
You can not prevail .
It simply is not possible , ’ ” said Matt Bryza , the State Department diplomat who was sent to Georgia after the crisis erupted .
In some of the most explicit criticism from Washington of Georgia ’s actions , Bryza said the United States told Tbilisi that the Georgian military would be no match for Russia .
“ Russia is 30 times as big as Georgia , its military is several times as large , ” he told reporters .
“ It can almost instantaneously roll tanks in .
And then even if you succeed miraculously in stopping the tanks , and the infantry , and the mechanized infantry , which move very quickly , it ’s the air power that ’s finally going to get you .
And that is what happened . ”
Conflict between Georgia and Russia erupted when Georgia tried to reimpose control over the breakaway , pro-Russian South Ossetia region on Aug. 7 - 8 .
Russia responded with a massive counter - attack that overwhelmed Georgian forces .
Russia then moved troops beyond South Ossetia and a second separatist region , Abkhazia , and into Georgian territory .
The United States has condemned Russia ’s response , saying Moscow went too far .
U.S. officials also voiced frustration for several days that the Russians promised to remove troops under a French - brokered ceasefire deal , but have not done so .
On Tuesday , U.S. officials said they had not seen any serious pullout of Russian forces from Georgia .
“ We still do n’t see any significant withdrawal of Russian forces out of Georgia , ” a senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday evening .
Moscow said it would pull its forces back by Aug. 22 to positions held before the conflict began .
A column of Russian tanks and armored vehicles left the Georgian city of Gori on Tuesday .
But Washington demanded faster action .
“ We call on them to leave immediately , ” State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
U.S. EQUIPMENT
The senior defense official said it appeared that Russian forces had taken five Humvee U.S. military vehicles that were awaiting shipment out of the Georgian port of Poti after a recent military exercise with Georgian troops .
“ Indications are that they have been moved by the Russians , ” he said .
But the official played down the significance of the incident , saying he was not aware that it was prompting major interest among senior officials .
The White House said if Russia has seized any U.S. military equipment in Georgia , Moscow must return it at once .
“ If the Russians have it , it needs to be returned immediately , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
Meanwhile the Treasury Department ’s Deputy Secretary Robert Kimmitt said Russia was “ not playing by the rules of the 21st century ” and causing foreign investors to seek opportunities elsewhere .
The conflict spooked investors and sent Russian stocks tumbling to their lowest levels in nearly two years .
It also rattled oil markets because a key pipeline runs through Georgia .
“ Their near - term actions ... have done significant damage to Russia ’s reputation , both politically and also economically , ” Kimmitt told CNBC Television .

Oh , what a hoot .
I ’ve been taking a break from blogging just to relax and invest my time in other places .
Like FriendFeed .
Or downloading iPhone apps .
Anyway , I ’ve been thinking a lot about Tech blogging and my role in it .
I ’ve increasingly become saddened .
Why ?
Because we ’ve increasingly started focusing on the business side of things .
Look at all the stories on TechMeme or Google News ’ tech section .
It ’s all business , almost all the time .
Rewriting ( or competing with ) the Wall Street Journal is n’t why I started blogging back in 2000 .
I started blogging because I wanted to share my life with you ( back then I was planning conferences with programmers and I was seeing them build remarkable things ) .
I wanted to help other people discover these new things and understand how to use them best .
I really got back to those early days when I visited Dan Meis .
He ’s an architect .
No , dummy , not a software architect , but an architect that designs REAL buildings !
( He designed Seattle ’s baseball stadium , for instance ) .
After the interview he pulled out his new iPhone and we were comparing apps .
I showed him a few , and life was , for a few seconds , just two geeks sharing what we loved .
That feeling came back yesterday during lunch .
I was sitting with Stanley Williams , Senior HP Fellow , and listened to him talk about all sorts of Quantum Science Research that HP was doing with Steve Jurvetson , managing director of Draper Fisher Jurvetson , a famous VC firm in the valley .
These two instantly started talking about stuff that made me realize ( and everyone sitting next to me ) that I know absolutely nothing about anything .
They were using a language I did n’t understand talking about how HP was going to shrink processors to many times smaller than they are today .
Later in the evening I felt that feeling once again when I met Jim Robinson who was American Express ’s CEO for many years ( and is still on the board at CocaCola ) .
I had no idea who he was , but I instantly saw in his eyes that he was someone who , even at more than 70 years old , still loved to learn new things .
I , of course , pulled out my iPhone and took a picture of his badge with Evernote ( and one of his business card ) which I then showed him that Evernote uploaded it to the cloud and made it searchable on the text on both of those things .
Standing next to him was Brad Smith , CEO of Intuit .
He immediately wrote down the name of the app I was using .
The joy of tech blogging returned to my face ( albeit it was a conversation that did n’t have an audience ) .
I realized this was what early blogging was all about .
It ’s why I was the first one to link to TechCrunch ( ask Mike Arrington about that ) .
It ’s why I loved hanging out with Dave Winer — he showed me all sorts of weird ways to use RSS and blogging software and , later , how to do cool things with home audio gear .
Later I was on a panel where the talk turned to Yahoo and the business deals it may or may not find itself in .
I thought to myself ( and probably said out loud ) that we had wasted 10 minutes of our lives talking about such things .
I realized that I ’m at fault for some of why tech blogging has failed you and was thinking that I ’d done too much of the “ business talk ” and not enough of the “ let ’s discover something that ’ll improve our lives together ” talk .
But there ’s other things too , that have been bugging me .
Tech blogging has become way too controlled by PR agents .
You might not realize it , but the top blogs are contacted by PR folks dozens of times per day .
This is why you ’ll see 15 stories all appear on Techmeme at the same time .
All with the same news .
Only a few of whom slow down to ask “ is this really useful . ”
See , we ’ve all learned that getting out in the first two minutes is worth a lot of traffic .
Particularly if you are writing about an Apple news release .
Watch on Wednesday afternoon as the press , er bloggers , all file the same news story , albeit each with a different sensationalized headline .
I ’ve played that game and done it as well as anyone .
If you decide not to play that game then you stop getting invited to the coolest events .
It ’s how the game is played and it ensures that the bloggers all turn into a bunch of news junkies who love talking about the latest Yahoo rumors .
Tonight during the panel Adam Lashinsky of Fortune Magazine made fun of the bloggers saying that in the old school they slow down to make sure they get it right .
Whether or not that was a correct statement , it did sit true with me .
Few people in the tech blogs call me to get my side of the story when my name is involved .
And my phone number is on the blog .
If they do n’t call me , I seriously doubt they call to check facts or do real reporting with anyone else .
And I ’m definitely looking in the mirror there , buddy .
So , off I go to FriendFeed and Twitter where there are real people who do n’t care about the business but who are just looking to use technology to have more fun , be more productive , or do something more interesting with their lives .
More ways we ’ve failed you ?
Our commenting systems really suck .
I did n’t realize just how badly they sucked until I started using FriendFeed .
My comments here are gummed up with moderation , with spam filters that only sorta work , that do n’t have threading , and have many other problems ranging from needing to be signed into , to not working on mobile devices very well , to requiring you to enter weird numbers or do math just to be able to post a comment .
What does this mean ?
Only the most motivated will leave comments .
That ’s usually someone with an axe to grind .
I ’m so tired of those kinds of conversations “ Scoble , you ’re an idiot . ”
Hey , I already know that , remember my conversation with Jurvetson and Williams ?
Why ca n’t commenters be nice , the way they probably would be if they were face to face ?
That ’s cause we ’ve failed you .
We have n’t moderated jerks out of our commenting system so now no normal person would go close to anything resembling a modern commenting system .
Worse , go over to Digg , which used to be one of my favorite places to find new and interesting stories .
The comments over there are simply disgusting cesspools of 14 - year - olds who are testing their boundaries when mommy and daddy are n’t looking .
Even my 14 - year - old son avoids that .
Ahh , Jeff Jarvis has a cure for these curmudgeons .
Me ?
I ’ve just been deleting and blocking jerks out of my life .
I do n’t need them and they do n’t need me .
How else do we fail you ?
We focus on the latest , shiny object and do n’t follow up .
I see a few signs that ’s changing , but it ’s really hard to stay interested in stuff .
I was talking with someone tonight who said Facebook seems to be fading from interest .
I say they should go to Israel , like I did , or ask my wife .
She ’s thrilled with Facebook and keeps checking her wall .
Me ?
Meh , off to the newest shiny thing .
Oh , wait , Facebook is announcing something new on Wednesday ?
Oh , wait , Facebook has a new UI ?
Heck yeah , we ’ll check that out for a few minutes tonight and write a bunch about it .
Then we ’ll forget it in two more weeks and , probably worse , bitterly deride it for all its many flaws ( there are always flaws that you find a few weeks after the press releases are gone and the PR teams have moved on ) .
How else do we fail you ?
We used to link to each other all the time , telling you when all the other cool bloggers have done something new and useful .
Now ?
The top tier of bloggers that you are probably following are too busy to respond to their own inbound email ( I ’m not alone in that one ) not to mention have time to read feeds from , gasp , other people ’s blogs .
If you ’re lucky we ’ll check Techmeme once in a while and might whip up a post based on that , which leads to even more groupthink .
Yet another way we fail you ?
There ’s simply too much content to read and watch .
So , many of you just avoid us all together .
Actually , this is why I like FriendFeed , but why it ’s a flawed product right now .
On FriendFeed we can vote on which stories are interesting .
That ’s what the “ Like ” link is for .
But the problem is we ca n’t display all FriendFeed items that only have a certain number of likes .
Until the database lets us do that , this is a problem that remains .
I do n’t know how to solve it .
Digg is one answer , but is flawed due to group bias and horrid comments .
Having a set of professional editors , is another way , but really , is n’t that the same thing as looking at all the items I ’ve “ liked ” on FriendFeed ?
That ’s pretty cool , but has its own bias .
And , anyway , on a slow news day , like today , you wo n’t see much meat there .
Heck , looking at that page I “ like ” way too many items , many of which look pretty stupid once you look back on them .
Some other ways we fail you ?
Ethics ?
I have seen some bloggers not disclose conflicts of interest .
I always will , but not everyone you see on TechMeme lives by the highest of rules .
Design ?
Sphinn , for instance , does n’t give you full text feeds in its RSS feed .
For many that ’s not good .
Others use too - small fonts to read in a normal browser .
Others do n’t work on mobile phones very well .
Many of us can seem out of touch with the real world .
Do we write about all the forclosures going on ?
No , and while we ’re waiting in line for iPhones and buying the latest games , that can seem pretty out of place right now while people are losing their homes or their life savings .
Also , many of us are very pro Apple , yet when I travel around the world I see far fewer Macs than I see when I go to , say , Gnomedex or other technology conferences that have lots of early adopters .
So , we start talking about cool stuff that many of our readers do n’t have access to .
Or , even worse , when I fly I look at what kind of systems people are using .
I still see a ton of Windows 2000 out there .
I do n’t know a single tech blogger who still uses Windows 2000 .
So , we ca n’t even relate to what that experience is like anymore , which is why we like writing about Vista vs. OSX .
Finally , I see a lot of blogs that tear down companies , people , or ideas .
I remember when the blogs always just were trying to uplift each other and put interesting ideas forward .
Anyway , I ’m rambling .
It ’s clear to me that I have n’t been serving you well over the past few months and I ’m going to be changing my approach to being one that ’s more practical and useful and I ’ll start trying to bring those kinds of things into your view more often .
Lifehacker kind of stuff , for instance .
Do you agree or disagree ?
I would love your help , by the way .
What blogs are doing the best tech blogging ?
Let ’s clean out my Google Reader subscription list and make sure I ’m following the best tech bloggers .
Another way you can help ?
Drop me a line if you see someone doing something really edifying .
Adam Buckman at the NYPost blew the whistle last week on a moral equivalence - marinated PBS documentary that airs tonight .
Melanie Morgan and I chatted about the smearing of the Greatest Generation with Rush Limbaugh during the “ From the Frontlines ” web - a - thon on Friday .
I ’ve heard from many upset WWII vets .
Read Adam ’s column here .
Excerpt :
Members of the Greatest Generation – especially those with weak hearts – might want to steer clear of an upcoming PBS documentary that suggests the Allied victory in World War II was “ tainted ” and questions whether it can even be called a victory .
Moreover , the documentary , titled “ The War of the World : A New History of the 20th Century , ” asserts that the war could only be won by forming an unholy alliance with a dictator – Joseph Stalin , who was as brutal as the one they were fighting , Adolf Hitler – and by adopting the same “ pitiless ” and “ remorseless ” tactics practiced by the enemy .
The three - part documentary is a companion to the best - selling book , “ The War of the World : Twentieth Century Conflict and the Descent of the West ” by Harvard and Oxford historian Niall Ferguson .
The one - hour Part One of the documentary premieres Monday night at 10 on Ch. 13 [ in NYC ; check your local listings ] .
The other two parts air the following two Mondays .
World War II is the focus of Part Two .
… it is Ferguson ’s revisionist view of the tactics applied by the Allies in World War II that is likely to raise the hackles of those who have always believed in the “ necessity ” of bombing German and Japanese civilians , culminating in the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , to end a war we did not start .
“ I think it ’s very hard for those who have imbibed the idea of a ‘ great generation ’ that what the Allies did to defeat the Axis was in some measure to adopt totalitarian tactics , ” Ferguson says in a Q&A on PBS ’s Web site .
Was Bush Involved in U.S. Attorney Scandal ?
Depends on Whom You Ask President Bush still dogged by questions over what he knew and when .
August 19 , 2008  --
Was he or was n't he ?
It may be the Bush - era version of " What did he know , and when did he know it ? " , the famous question that dogged Nixon through the Watergate break - in scandal .
Before the court of public opinion , White House spokespeople have long maintained President Bush had no involvement in the firing of nine U.S. Attorneys , the central decision that mushroomed into one of the biggest scandals in eight years of the Bush administration .
" [ T ] here is no indication that the President knew about any of the ongoing discussions [ about firing U.S. attorneys ] over the two years , nor did he see a list or a plan before it was carried out , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters in March 2007 .
In federal court , however , the administration 's lawyers have been more ambiguous .
" The record does reflect at this stage that the president was not involved in decisions about who would be asked to resign from the department , " Justice Department lawyer Carl Nichols carefully argued before a federal judge in June .
But " the record does not reflect that the President had no future involvement " in the scandal , he noted .
Just how much of a role the president played in the firings and its aftermath remains unclear .
But in trying to prevent top
White House officials from testifying or turning over documents to Congress , the Bush administration " is very consciously trying to walk a very fine tightrope , " explained Stephen Vladeck , a law professor at American University in Washington , D.C .
On the one hand , experts say , the White House finds it politically necessary to make clear statements insulating Bush from the scandal .
But in court , " If they said [ Bush ] was n't involved at all they would undermine their case for executive privilege , " Vladeck said .
The resulting argument , he said , is " a lawyer who 's trying to be very obtuse . "
Still , the administration lawyers ' fancy footwork hints that the president 's involvement could be broader than widely known .
" They are not expressly saying it but it is an implicaton because you can't mislead the court , " said Charles Tiefer , former House general counsel now a law professor at the University of Baltimore .
Lawyer Stanley Brand , former counsel to the House of Representatives and one of the capital 's leading ethics experts , put it more bluntly .
" The White House press people lie , but the lawyers have to tell the truth because they 're officers of the court . "
The administration is fighting a congressional effort to force former White House counsel Harriet Miers and former chief of staff Joshua Bolten to provide documents and testimony about the firings and their aftermath .
The administration argues that the ex-aides should enjoy so - called " executive privilege " by virtue of their service to Bush and be protected from congressional subpoenas .
Judge John Bates from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled last month that the two did not have blanket immunity from congressional inquiries , although they could invoke executive privilege in reponse to specific questions or requests .
The administration has appealed the ruling and is urging the judge to stay the subpoenas until a higher court can review the decision .
Congress filed papers Friday urging Bates not to stay the rulings .
The White House has acknowledged a minor role for Bush in the affair .
Last year , it confirmed that Bush had one conversation with then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , prior to the now - infamous purge , about complaints from senators that their home - state U.S. attorneys were not aggressively pursuing perceived voter fraud cases .
In addition , the Albequerque ( N.M. ) Journal reported in April 2007 that sometime after the 2006 midterm elections , Bush had a phone conversation with Sen. Pete Domenici , R - N.M. , about then - New Mexico U.S. attorney David Iglesias .
Iglesias was one of the nine prosecutors fired in the scandal .
The White House last Friday declined to confirm the story .
During oral arguments in June , Judge Bates made it clear he did not understand the adminisration 's position on Bush 's involvement in the scandal .
" Let me explore that just a little bit , " Judge Bates asked administration lawyer Nichols during oral arguments in June .
" [ W ] hat you 're saying is that some of the documents " subpoenaed by Congress " may well be documents that involved advice to the President or even presidential decisions . "
" They may well .
They may well , " Nichols replied .
" But some may not , " the judge said .
" That is correct , " replied Nichols .
Bates tried to sum up the White House 's stance : " If you divide out . . . the issues , into the removal [ of the U.S. attorneys ] versus who was to be appointed to replace people , versus handling the whole matter , the sort of after - the - removal problems with Congress , then those may have different degrees of presidential involvement . "
" I think that 's fair , Your Honor , " Nichols replied .
Fair , perhaps , but none too clear : in his ruling , Bates noted there was " some ambiguity " in the White House 's position .
The White House declined to comment on the president 's role in the scandal .
" We do n't have anything new to add to this exhaustively covered issue at this time , " wrote spokesman Scott Stanzel in an email to ABC News .

The photo below captures everything that Americans wanted to believe about the Iraq war in the earliest days of the invasion in 2003 .
Pfc. Joseph Dwyer , an Army medic whose unit was fighting its way up the Euphrates to Baghdad , cradles a wounded boy .
The child is half - naked and helpless , but trusting .
Private Dwyer ’s face is strained but calm .
If there are better images of the strength and selflessness of the American soldier , I ca n’t think of any .
It is easy to understand why newspapers and magazines around the country ran the photo big , making Private Dwyer an instant hero , back when the war was a triumphal tale of Iraqi liberation .
That story turned bitter years ago , of course .
And the mountain of sorrows keeps growing : Mr. Dwyer died last month in North Carolina .
He was 31 and very sick .
For years he had been in and out of treatment for post - traumatic stress disorder and addiction .
He was seized by fearful delusions and fits of violence and rage .
His wife left him to save herself and their young daughter .
When the police were called to Mr. Dwyer ’s apartment on June 28 , he was alone .
They broke down the door and found him dying among pill bottles and cans of cleaning solvent that friends said he sniffed to deaden his pain .
He had been heading for a disastrous end ever since he came home .
Two of his best friends were Angela Minor and Dionne Knapp , fellow medics at Fort Bliss , near El Paso , Tex .
For a while , they were part of a small , inseparable group that worked together , ate out , went to movies and called one another by their first names , which is not the military habit .
Summing Up A since deceased , highly - regarded fellow faculty member , Anthony ( Tony ) Athos , occasionally sat on a bench on a nice day at the Harvard Business School , apparently staring off into space .
When asked what he was doing , ever the iconoclast , he would say , " Nothing . "
His colleagues , trained to admire and teach action , would walk away shaking their heads and asking each other , " Is he alright ? "
It is perhaps no coincidence that Tony often came up with some of the most profound insights at faculty meetings and informal gatherings .
This story captures much of the sense of the responses to this month 's question about why managers do n't think deeply .
The list of causes was much longer than the list of proposed responses .
But in the process , some other questions were posed .
Ben Kirk kicked off the list of reasons for the phenomenon when he commented , " … what rises to the top levels are very productive and very diligent individuals who tend not to … reflect and are extremely efficient at deploying other people 's ideas , " implying that this type of leader is not likely to understand , encourage , or recognize deep thinking in others .
Adnan Younis added the possibility that " … managers are not trained for it . "
Dianne Jacobs cited the possibility that persisting assumptions borne out of success serve as " roadblocks to act on needed change " ( proposed by those who engage in deep thinking ? ) .
Ulysses U. Pardey , whose comment triggered my recollection of Tony Athos , wrote that " Time - for - thinking is a special moment which can be resource consuming and an unsafe activity … " ( Fortunately , Athos held a tenured position in an academic organization . )
A number of comments alluded to the triumph of bureaucracies and large organizations over deep thinking .
As Lorre Zuppan said , " I think Jeff Immelt 's efforts to protect deep thinking reflect a nice sentiment but …
If his team could carry the ball , would he need to announce that he 's protecting it ? "
Tom Henkel was more succinct : " There 's a name for managers who think deeply — entrepreneurs … Big companies are no place for big thinkers . "
Providing time to reflect , particularly in an era of multi-tasking and the tyranny of technology , was most frequently suggested as an antidote to the dearth of deep thinking .
As Chris Shannon put it , " I think creatively better out of the office , say while out in the boat or at a conference , so that looks very much like not working ! ! "
Among other things , Krishna Sripad suggested fostering " an environment where transformation is ' truly ' valued " by institutionalizing it and " setting aside a percentage of employee time " for it .
Edward
Hare proposes that organizations might " understand who their deep thinkers are and then make absolutely certain that they 're in a position to take advantage of their rather unique capabilities . "
Rob Smorfitt states that for many managers , " it ( deep thinking ) needs to be learned . "
This raises the question of whether it can be taught .
Frances Pratt comments , " To get deep we must be deep . "
The issue is complicated by uncertainties about just what " deep thinking " is — pursuing " all possible threads , options " ( Ganesh Ram ) , " adopting another 's point of view " ( E. Forrest Christian ) , something " hard and painful " ( Phil Clark ) ?
Just what is it that should be taught ?
Does this have any place in a business school curriculum ?
If so , how should it be approached ?
What do you think ?
Original Article
Jeffrey Immelt , GE's CEO , has received a lot of publicity recently for fostering " imagination breakthroughs " by encouraging managers to think deeply about innovations that will ensure GE 's longer - term success .
He has vowed that he will protect those working on the breakthroughs from the " budget slashers " focused on short - term success .
Questions that this effort raises include : ( 1 ) Why so much publicity ?
( 2 ) Is n't " deep thinking " what leaders are paid to do ?
and ( 3 ) Why do these kinds of effort require so much protection ?
In their new book , Marketing Metaphoria , Gerald and Lindsay Zaltman suggest some answers to the questions .
In decrying the lack of what they call " deep thinking " among managers and especially those responsible for marketing , they suggest some things that get in its way .
Among them are : ( 1 ) reluctance to take risk , especially when short - term performance is at stake , ( 2 ) the fear of disruption resulting from " thinking differently and deeply , " ( 3 ) the potential psychological cost of changing one 's mind resulting from deep thinking , and ( 4 ) the lack of information providing deep insights on which to base deep thinking .
According to the Zaltmans , while nearly all research techniques commonly used today probe humans only at their conscious level , the subconscious ( offering deep insights ) really determines behavior , and that explains why humans do n't behave as they say they will , whether in buying or other behaviors .
As a result , for example , four in five product introductions perform below expectations .
The Zaltmans expand on ideas they have been studying for some years , namely that strategies of all kinds can be based on insights gained from listening in a disciplined way for metaphors that relatively small numbers of people ( consumers , managers , public servants , etc. ) use in the course of extended , probing interviews .
In these interviews , the object is to use " surface metaphors , " like " I am drowning in debt , " to identify " metaphor themes , " like " Money is like liquid , " and the associated " deep metaphor , " in this case " resource . "
They claim that just seven deep metaphors — balance ( equilibrium ) , transformation ( changing states or status ) , journey ( as in life ) , container ( keeping things in and keeping things out ) , connection ( feelings of belonging or exclusion ) , resource ( providing survival ) , and control — describe 70 percent of our inner feelings .
The objective is to find deep metaphors that individuals share in common ( a true market segment or a basis for resolving a confIict ) rather than differences .
If we would just take the time to explore them we would be able to realize such things as more substantial , farsighted , successful new product introductions ( such as the hybrid auto ten years ago at Toyota ) ; more successful conflict resolution ; and more significant innovation , à la GE , in general .
This raises several questions :
Have the Zaltmans hit on a basic problem of leadership and management today ?
Are there appropriate responses other than the one that GE is pursuing ?
What is your organization doing to combat the absence of deep thinking in decision - making ?
What are you doing to combat it in thinking about your own life inside and outside the organization ?
What do you think ?

On my cycle commute across central London each morning there used to be a tricky little stretch where I passed under Admiralty Arch , the imposing structure that marks one 's arrival at Trafalgar Square .
The wide boulevard that is the Mall narrowed to a point where two lanes of traffic , by now stationary , left cyclists a sliver of space to squeeze through on the left - hand side of the road .
Often there was n't even room for that .
Then , a few weeks ago , someone at Transport for London had the bright idea of creating a short stretch of cycle lane at that point .
A thick white line appeared on the tarmac , freeing up vital extra inches for cyclists but still leaving room for the two lanes of motorised traffic .
That was the idea , anyway .
In reality , all that happened was the cars ignored the cycle lane and formed up exactly as they always had done , blocking off the cyclists ' space .
The other day I was pleased to see the arrival of two traffic cones at the start of the lane , offering somewhat firmer encouragement to vehicles to move over to the right .
But the day after that the cones had been knocked over – presumably by the wheels of a car – and we were all , drivers and cyclists , pretty much back to where we had started .
What used to be a tricky little stretch remains just that .
Only in a way it 's worse now because an element of antagonism has been introduced into the situation .
Motorists do n't like having to give up space to cyclists .
Cyclists resent their lanes being intruded upon by cars .

The example of the Admiralty Arch attempt to manage traffic , and make life a bit easier for the hundreds of cyclists who pass under it each day , illustrates a wider point about the challenge facing urban transport policy - planners .
It also highlights a relationship between motorists and cyclists that might be described as at best uneasy .
Those of us on two wheels are characterised as elastane louts who routinely ride on pavements and run red lights .
In cyclists ' eyes the four - wheel brigade show not the slightest regard for the fact that they are sharing road space with much more vulnerable users .
So against this background , last week 's announcement by London mayor Ken Livingstone of plans for a £ 500 m investment in improving cycle routes in the capital goes to the heart of a question that is surely in the mind of every user of urban roads : can bikes and cars ever satisfactorily co-exist ?
The extent to which cycling has taken off in London in recent years is staggering .
The congestion charge , environmental awareness , a desire to keep fit , a fear of terrorism , the freedom and sheer convenience are all reasons why numbers are reckoned to have doubled since 2000 .
Even on these cold winter mornings we cyclists are creating our own unique brand of congestion at key hubs around the city .
In the summer , the streets of London at rush hour will teem with cyclists .
But cycle journeys still represent only 1 per cent of all daily journeys in London , and the mayor 's aim is to increase that figure to 5 per cent by 2025 .
In pursuit of that he plans 12 " superhighways " that will provide fast , safe routes in and out of central London .
He will also be introducing a free bike - hire scheme along the lines of the very successful Vélib scheme in Paris .
" We 're having a real cycling renaissance , " says Mark Watts , who as the mayor 's adviser on climate change has helped devise the new policy .
" When you think of the pressures of managing a transport system in a successful modern city , cycling is becoming a vital tool . "
Mr Watts makes clear that the superhighways will not be created where no thoroughfare existed before .
They will involve adaptations of existing roads , and cyclists will not , as some feared , find that they are banned from any public highway .
" Cycle lanes will be wider and we 'll make more use of bus lanes , with the emphasis very much on them being equally cycle lanes and bus lanes , not bus lanes that cycles can also use . "
The key , Mr Watts says , is " critical mass " – the point at which cycling is so ubiquitous that , as in Amsterdam or Copenhagen ( examples that Transport for London studied ) , assumptions about whom the road belongs to are turned on their head .
" It should work both ways , " Mr Watts says .
" There will be a greater acceptance of cyclists on the part of motorists , and cyclists will be encouraged by the knowledge that they are not alone .
When cyclists were a tiny minority it was easy for drivers to think they did n't belong on the road .
But not any more . "
As someone who both cycles and drives in London , I remain sceptical , especially when measures such as advance stop boxes – spaces at traffic lights designed for the exclusive occupation of cyclists – seem to have no effect on motorists ' conduct .
According to Mr Watts , a bill is going through Parliament that will extend to traffic wardens the power to book drivers who encroach , and on - the - spot fines are looming .
That should help – along with the proposed 20 mph residential speed limits , which Mr Watts hopes will make cycling seem a much safer option than it does to many people at the moment .
Of course , the tide of history is running in cyclists ' favour .
It 's the ultimate in sustainable transport , and the way that Paris has woken up to it , thinks Mr Watts , has done wonders for its " brand image " , such an important consideration for the modern city .
Personally , I quite like cycling in traffic .
Wide - open roads are great , but the requirement to keep my wits about me on my work commute is all part of the pleasure of the ride and the sense of fulfilment you derive at journey 's end .
City living is a communal experience .
Is n't that why we do it ?

WHERE THE ELECTION COULD BE WON OR LOST WHERE THE ELECTION COULD BE WON OR LOST SWING COUNTIES SWING COUNTIES
The most closely contested county in each of a dozen battleground states is in the suburbs : State County Metro area Colo .
Arapahoe Denver Fla. Orange Orlando Mich .
Oakland Detroit Minn . Anoka Mpls. -St. Paul Mo. Jefferson St. Louis Nev. Clark Las Vegas N.H. Rockingham Boston Ohio Hamilton Cincinnati Ore. Clackamas Portland Pa. Westmoreland Pittsburgh Va. Caroline Richmond Wis. St. Croix Mpls. -St. Paul Source : Analysis by Thomas Sanchez , University of Utah , and Robert Lang , Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech WASHINGTON 
The presidential contest between John McCain and Barack Obama this fall is likely to be settled in places such as Clackamas , Arapahoe and Geauga .
Suburban counties including these — outside Portland , Denver and Cleveland , respectively — have become the hardest fought and most closely won battlegrounds of national elections .
" Suburbs are where the battle line is drawn , " says Robert Lang , co-director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech .
He says suburban voters tend to be " pragmatists and non-ideological , and they want problems fixed . "
BE A STRATEGIST : Build your general election scenario A generation ago , cities were considered predominantly Democratic and suburbs safely Republican , but the political leanings of suburbs shifted as they became more racially diverse and densely populated .
Most Americans now live in suburbs .
Lang and demographer Thomas Sanchez of the University of Utah analyzed presidential , gubernatorial and Senate elections since 2000 and identified the 94 most competitive counties in a dozen battleground states .
Their study will be released next month .
The closest contests were in " inner suburbs , " those most closely tied to cities .
The biggest swing from election to election was in " mature suburbs , " communities that grew up in the mid- to late 20th century and are relatively stable in population .
In Northern Virginia , for instance , Fairfax County moved into the Democratic column in the 2004 presidential election for the first time in 40 years .
The next ring of faster - growing communities are called " emerging suburbs , " and the farthest from cities are " exurbs . "
The denser the population , the more Democratic the vote .
Still , even in Republican - leaning " exurbs " there has been significant movement between the two major parties .
Democratic candidates increased their vote by nearly 9 percentage points in those more sparsely populated communities from 2002 to 2006 , one reason for their gains in Congress and statehouses that year .
The rise of suburbs as the nation 's key battleground has affected what issues candidates emphasize — rising gas prices are particularly important to the many suburbanites who commute by car — and which states the candidates target .
" Around Philadelphia , the movement away from solid Republican … in the so - called collar counties … means Pennsylvania has gotten to be very even , and likewise in Virginia , " says McCain adviser Frank Donatelli , deputy chairman of the Republican National Convention .
" It 's put Virginia in play . "

LOS ANGELES -- Greg Maddux is back with the Los Angeles Dodgers for another stretch drive following a 120 - mile trip up the California coast .
The Dodgers reacquired Maddux from the San Diego Padres on Tuesday , getting the future Hall of Famer and cash for two minor leaguers to be named or cash .
" It 's nice to be back , " Maddux said with a smile .
" Last to first .
It 's pretty cool .
One off day and I make up 16 games , so I 'm excited . "
The 42 - year - old right - hander first joined the Dodgers on July 31 , 2006 , and went 6 - 3 with a 3.30 ERA in 12 starts to help them win an NL wild - card berth .
The Dodgers entered Tuesday night 's action tied for the Arizona Diamondbacks atop the NL West , while San Diego languished in last place , 16 games off the pace .
" You never really want to leave your team and your teammates and all that , but it 's nice to be back in a pennant race , " Maddux said .
" It was fun playing in San Diego and I loved it there .
But I 'm looking forward to the last month and a half here .
It was great last time I was here , it was fun and it was exciting .
I had a lot of good memories then , and I look forward to making some new ones .
" For me , it 's kind of like the first day of spring training all over again .
I just want to learn my teammates and do what I can to be accepted , get in a routine as quick as possible and hopefully throw some good games for them .
Hopefully , we 'll get to the postseason and find out if it's a better team than two years ago .
It 's how you do in October that determines how good the team is . "
Manager Joe Torre said Maddux will start Friday night in Philadelphia to begin a 10 - game trip that finishes with three games in Arizona .
Maddux , ninth in baseball history with 353 victories , is 6 - 9 with a 3.99 ERA in 26 starts this season .
" I 'm sure their rotation was already set , " Maddux said .
" I mean , the last thing you want to do is accommodate one guy and screw up four .
I do n't know what their reasons are .
I did n't ask , and I did n't care .
I 'm just glad to be here and I 'm glad they gave me a day to pitch , which is Friday . "
In his last outing as a member of the Padres , Maddux allowed five hits and one run in seven innings in a 1 - 0 loss to the Phillies on Friday .
" We 'll put him in Friday .
He 'll be pitching every five days from there , " Torre said .
" His experience is his hole card .
You 're going to have to find a way to beat him because he wo n't beat himself .
He has the ability to keep you in a game .
He knows what he 's doing .
To me , he adds more than just taking the ball every five or six days . "
Maddux replaces Opening Day starter Brad Penny in the rotation .
Penny was sidelined nearly two months with tendinitis in his right shoulder before returning Aug .
9 . He went back on the DL after just two starts with more shoulder problems .
" Great .
The guy 's got a lot to offer , a Hall of Famer , " Penny said of Maddux .
" He 's a lot smarter than a lot of people -- smarter than anyone I 've ever played with as far as setting up hitters is concerned . "
There 's no timetable on Penny 's return , but he said he hopes to be back sometime next month .
A four - time Cy Young Award winner who won at least 13 games in each of the past 20 seasons , Maddux signed $ 10 million , one - year contracts with the Padres before each of the last two seasons .
Maddux , who has a home south of Los Angeles in Orange County , agreed to waive the no-trade clause in his contract for the deal to be completed .
" I love Greg Maddux , " said Dodgers catcher Russell Martin , a rookie on the 2006 team .
" The thing about Greg , he keeps everything so simple .
People like to make things more complicated than they need to be .
You learn a lot the way he approaches the game . "
Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said the injury to Penny played a role in the Dodgers ' thinking , although he had spoken with Padres general manager Kevin Towers previously about Maddux .
" We 've had people in the ballpark his last three starts , " Colletti said .
" He 's pitched very well .
He 's got a chance to give us quality every time he goes out there .
He know how to pitch , he knows how to attack a hitter . "
Colletti said the Dodgers will pay a portion of Maddux 's remaining salary of about $ 2.2 million , and the Padres would either choose two minor leaguers or cash as compensation by Oct. 15 .
To make room for Maddux on their roster , the Dodgers optioned left - hander Eric Stults to Triple - A Las Vegas and moved right - hander Scott Proctor from the 15 - day disabled list to the 60 - day DL .
Maddux became the latest addition in the last month to the much - improved Dodgers , joining outfielder Manny Ramirez and third baseman Casey Blake .
They have had a losing record much of the season , but were 10 - 6 in August with six wins in their most recent seven games before Tuesday .
Claim : E-mail reports the truth about the environmental impact of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR )
MIXTURE OF TRUE AND FALSE INFORMATION
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , June 2008 ]
First , do you know what ANWR is ?
ANWR = Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
Now , a comparison :
And some perspective …
NOTE WHERE THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT AREA IS …
( it ’s in the “ ANWR Coastal Plain ” )
THIS IS WHAT THE TV People and others “ GREENS ” SHOW YOU WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT ANWR
… and they are right … these ARE photographs of ANWR
Is n’t ANWR beautiful ?
Why should we drill here ( and destroy ) this beautiful place ?
Well , that ’s not exactly the truth .
Do you remember the map ?
The map showed that the proposed drilling area is in the ANWR Coastal Plain .
Do those photographs look like a coastal plain to you ?
What ’s going on here ?
The answer is simple .
That is NOT where they are wanting to drill !
This is what the proposed exploration area ACTUALLY looks like in the winter :
And this is what it ACTUALLY looks like in the summer :
HERE ARE A COUPLE SCREEN SHOTS FROM GOOGLE EARTH
As you can see , the area where they are talking about drilling is a barren wasteland .
Oh , and they say that they are concerned about the effect on the local wildlife .
Here is a photo ( shot during the summer ) of the ‘ depleted wildlife ’ situation created by drilling around Prudhoe Bay .
Do n’t you think that the Caribou really hate that drilling ?
Here ’s that same spot during the winter :
Hey , this bear seems to really hate the pipeline near Prudhoe Bay , which accounts for 17 % of U.S. domestic oil production .
Now , why do you think that the Democrats are LYING about ANWR ?
Remember when Al Gore said that the government should work to ARTIFICIALLY raise gas prices to $ 5 a gallon ?
Well , Al Gore and his fellow Democrats have almost reached their goal !
Now that you know that the Democrats have been lying , what are you going to do about it ?
You can start by forwarding this to everyone you know , so that they will know the truth .
Canonical , the company behind the highly popular Ubuntu Linux distribution , unveiled its Ubuntu Netbook Remix yesterday at the Computex show in Taiwan .
The Remix is based on Ubuntu Mobile Edition and is designed specifically for mobile computers with a subnotebook form factor .
The Asus Eee PC completely changed the game for budget mobile computing .
Following in the wake of the Eee 's success , a number of competing products have emerged with similar features and pricing models .
Many of these are offered with some version of the open - source Linux operating system .
A customizable Ubuntu - based platform that is designed specifically for such systems could attract considerable interest from hardware makers .
Although the Remix has n't been released yet in its entirety , the source code is already available for several core components of the unique user interface .
We managed to put the pieces together and get a working Netbook Remix desktop environment running on a regular Ubuntu 8.04 system .
Unlike the Maemo interface , which uses the lightweight Matchbox window manager , the Remix interface is designed to overlay seamlessly on top of Ubuntu 's conventional GNOME desktop environment .
The implementation is , overall , quite ingenious in many ways , but there are still places where it feels a bit clunky .
The project is clearly early in its development and we will likely see the rough spots even out as it evolves .
Ready to launch
The heart of the Remix user interface is its customized Ubuntu Mobile Edition ( UME ) Launcher which replaces the desktop and provides access to applications and other important system functionality .
A series of application categories are displayed on the left side of the launcher and each category provides access to a set of application icons .
Conceptually , it is very similar to the Eee 's basic mode interface .
The contents of the launcher , like the categories and the applications they contain , are taken directly from GNOME 's main menu .
The layout and design of the launcher is effective and it is very easy to use .
The large size of the buttons makes it finger - friendly , so it will work well on touch - screen devices .
Aesthetically , the launcher has a lot of nice visual flourishes like gradients , translucency , and subtle animations , but those are drowned out by the fecal brown that is typical of Ubuntu artwork .
Although the launcher is strong conceptually , the implementation still needs some work .
The icons look blurry , the text is too small , and the whole thing is a bit too sluggish and processor - hungry .
These mostly seem like kinks that can be worked out , so there are no intractable problems .
A glance at the source code reveals that the launcher is programmed in C and uses Clutter , a highly promising rich graphical interface library designed by OpenedHand that is built with OpenGL and provides a GObject - based API .
Clutter is still fairly new but is generating considerable excitement in the GNOME development community because it supplies a lot of much - needed graphics functionality that simply is n't supported natively by GTK +.
Several prominent GNOME developers have advocated making Clutter a central piece in the next - generation GTK + toolkit .
Clutter is already being used on the desktop by Ubuntu eye - candy expert Mirco Muller to create Ubuntu 's experimental new GDM face browser .
The version control system commit logs indicate that a lot of the programming on the launcher is being done by Neil Patel , a software developer who is well - respected in the Ubuntu community and was recently hired by Canonical .
Patel is known for his work on the Avant Window Navigator , a very nice Mac OS X panel clone for Linux that takes advantage of cutting - edge compositing functionality and is currently in vogue among GNOME users .
Switching windows
The other major component of the Remix user interface is its unusual window switcher , which is designed to mimic the look and feel of tabs .
Program windows are all permanently maximized .
Each window places an icon in the window switcher bar and the active window is highlighted as though it is a selected tab .
To the right of the icons , the rest of the space is taken up by a single tab that displays the title of the active window and a close button .
This is a lot like the way that the Matchbox window manager works in the Maemo environment , except that the window icons are at the top instead of along the side .
The window switcher implementation in the Remix interface is particularly clever .
The black bar at the top of the window is a regular GNOME panel and the window switcher tab bar is a panel applet .
The permanently - maximized window state is handled by a program called Maximus that runs silently in the background .
The Remix environment is still using the regular old Metacity window manager .
Users access the launcher by clicking the Home panel applet , which is the Ubuntu logo in the top left - hand corner .
The developers were able to create a completely different windowing experience by repurposing standard GNOME components .
It 's a good approach , because it gives the user a lot of flexibility and makes it possible to keep the regular GNOME panel system .
Although the windowing model is good for devices with small screens and the implementation is clever , the Maximus program is still a bit of a hack and does n't really work well in certain corner cases .
The most visible place where it breaks down is when testing The GIMP , which uses floating palettes .
These get maximized and overlap each other , obscuring the main program content and making it impossible to use .
Those kinds of bugs will have to be worked out before the software is ready for widespread adoption .
It 's Atomic
The Netbook Remix is more than just a pretty face .
The Remix will also provide extensive support for hardware components typically found in subnotebook computers .
Canonical has worked closely with Intel through the Moblin initiative to ensure strong support for the Atom processor .
Intel hopes that Atom will be used with Linux in a wide variety of contexts including Mobile Internet Devices and even vehicle " infotainment " systems .
" At Intel , we see netbooks as an opportunity to expand basic Internet usage throughout the world through simple and affordable devices for consumers , " said Intel software and solutions group vice president Doug Fisher in a statement .
" The combination of Ubuntu Netbook Remix with Moblin technologies optimized for the Intel Atom processor will deliver a good Internet and media experience on Intel - based netbooks . "
Canonical 's mobile strategy
The Netbook Remix is part of Canonical 's broader strategy for Ubuntu mobility .
The company has also partnered with Nokia to work on an experimental Ubuntu ARM port that will bring the distribution to Nokia 's Internet Tablet devices and similar products .
According to Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth , portable computing is a high priority for Ubuntu 8.10 — codenamed Intrepid Ibex — which is scheduled for release in October .
" Our goal is to deliver a superb user experience while making it simple and cost - effective for device manufacturers to be able to bring their devices to the consumer marketplace , " Shuttleworth said in a statement .
" Ubuntu has in a very short period transformed the perception of the Linux desktop experience .
Many more people will experience Linux for the first time through these devices so working with Canonical , using our UI and leveraging software from the Moblin project is the best way to ensure the netbook experience is a success . "
Canonical is positioning itself to take the lead on software in the subnotebook market , but a big piece of the puzzle is still absent : customers .
Although Canonical is working closely with Intel on reference designs , there is no word yet about potential commercial adopters for the Netbook Remix .
No major OEMs have revealed plans to use it yet and Canonical is still actively looking for new partners in the hardware space .
Regardless of whether it gets picked up by hardware makers like Asus , it is sure to be a big hit with Ubuntu 's fans .
The fact that so many users are installing the regular desktop version of Ubuntu on their Eee laptops is strong indication that there is demand for Ubuntu on subnotebooks .
For additional discussion about Linux - based mobile computing , I invite you to join me and Intel open source technologist Derek Speed in the Directions Symposium .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev looked east on Thursday for support for Moscow ’s tough line over Georgia , which has inflamed relations with the West and prompted talk of a new Cold War .
The Kremlin leader flew to Tajikistan for a summit of a regional security forum with China and four Central Asian states at which the crisis in Georgia was likely to be discussed .
Moscow ’s allies in the former Soviet Union , Asia and elsewhere usually side with the Kremlin against the West on contentious issues , but have been notable for their silence since Russia fought a brief war with Georgia this month .
Citing the need to avert a “ genocide ” against civilians , Moscow sent troops and tanks into Georgia ’s breakaway South Ossetia and a second pro-Moscow region , Abkhazia , this month .
On Tuesday the Kremlin recognized them as independent states , prompting Georgia to withdraw all but two of its diplomats from Moscow .
The Georgian parliament was to debate the future of ties with its giant northern neighbor on Thursday .
Georgia ’s close ally , the United States , and European powers have demanded Russia respect a French - brokered ceasefire and withdraw all its troops from Georgia , including a Moscow - imposed buffer zone whose legitimacy is disputed .
The Group of Seven rich nations , in a joint statement on Wednesday , also condemned Russia ’s recognition of Georgia ’s rebel regions and what it described as its excessive use of military force in Georgia .
Analysts see Moscow ’s actions as a bid to halt expanding Western influence in the Caucasus , a major oil and gas transit route from the Caspian Sea to the West that bypasses Russia .

The biggest prize for Russia would be to win the support of China when Medvedev meets President Hu Jintao at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization ( SCO ) in the Tajik capital Dushanbe .
SEPARATIST FEARS
The SCO is dominated by Russia and China and comprises Tajikistan , Uzbekistan , Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan .
It claims the role of a security guarantor in Central Asia , earning the sobriquet “ NATO of the East ” by some observers .
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing that South Ossetia would likely be discussed .
But with most SCO members facing separatist rebellions of their own , outright support for Moscow ’s actions is seen as unlikely .
“ China , which has own separatists , will be the biggest problem , ” said Alexei Mukhin , head of the Centre of Political Information think - tank .
“ The recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia is unacceptable for Beijing . ”
Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province and bristles at talk of anyone opening diplomatic relations with Taipei .
The other four SCO members have their own reasons to adopt a “ wait - and - see ” position .
The four , all in ex-Soviet Central Asia , have built their foreign policy strategies on trying to maintain a balance between loyalty to Moscow and building ties with the West .
Analysts say the most Medvedev can hope for is that SCO leaders will say they understand Russia ’s motives , without going any further .

Moscow said it did not fear being isolated over recognizing Georgia ’s rebel provinces , saying drumming up support for its position was not its primary goal .
“ We ’re not going to twist anyone ’s hands to make them support ( recognition ) , ” said Dmitry Peskov , spokesman for Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
WORRIED NEIGHBOURS
Russia ’s continued military presence in Georgia has angered the West -- European leaders are to discuss their response at an emergency summit on Monday .
Moscow says the troops are needed to protect civilians from Georgian aggression and that their presence is provided for under a French - brokered ceasefire , a view disputed by Paris .
The Georgia crisis has alarmed other former Soviet republics with sizeable Russian minorities , particularly Ukraine and the Baltic states .
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Wednesday that Russia might have its eye on neighboring countries such as Ukraine and Moldova .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband , on a visit to NATO aspirant Ukraine , said Medvedev had a big responsibility not to start a new Cold War .
But in reality , the West has little leverage over a newly confident Russia rolling in cash from high oil and gas prices .
Many Europeans states rely heavily on Russia for its hydrocarbons , transit routes to resupply Western forces in Afghanistan and diplomatic support for international pressure over Iran ’s nuclear program .
Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko , who like Saakashvili has irked Moscow by seeking to join NATO and move out of Moscow ’s orbit , has condemned Russia ’s war with Georgia .
Yushchenko told Reuters he wanted to raise the question of increasing Russia ’s rent on its Sevastopol base in Ukraine ’s Crimea region , the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet .
Moscow says any renegotiation would break a 1997 deal under which Moscow leases the base for $ 98 million a year until 2017 .
TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
The Japanese are true hands - on parents , helping their children with everything from university entrance exams to finding a job .
Now , they ’re playing matchmakers , and on a nationwide level .

Japanese traditionally house and support their children until marriage , which has usually occurred at a younger age than now .
But as the kids stay at home longer due to job uncertainty and an unwillingness to compromise , panicked parents are flocking to mass matchmaking events at hotels and conference centers .
“ Many parents are very worried about their children who are well past the marrying age .
Many singles are feeling pressured by their parents , ” said a spokesman for O - Net , a company that helps singles network with possible marriage partners .
Matchmaking is a Japanese tradition which is almost unheard of among the younger generation , where love matches are the unions most sought after .
But parents ’ worries are founded in a society where more men and women are choosing to tie the knot later in life , or sometimes not at all .
A government report from 2005 showed 71.5 percent of men aged 25 to 29 were unmarried compared with 47.1 percent in 1990 .
For women , 32 percent from 30 to 34 years of age were single , compared with half that number in 1990 .
Marriage counselor Michiko Saito , who runs “ Office Anne ” in Hokkaido , has hosted matchmaking parties for parents since 2000 .
Japanese newspapers have dubbed the nationwide phenomenon “ parent representative matchmaking parties ” and so far , events have been held in 13 cities with around 6,500 participants .
“ I had so many parents coming in asking for advice that I started a little party for them to get together and discuss their problems , ” said Saito .
“ People who can marry for love are lucky , for others , it ’s more difficult .
Matchmaking is not about passionately falling in love , it ’s about slowly growing to love someone . ”
DADDY’S GIRLS , MUMMY ’S BOYS
Professor Masahiro Yamada , a family studies specialist at Chuo University , cited the uncertain economy and extended parental support as the main reasons for the decline in marriage .
“ If you are pushed out of your home and forced to take care of yourself as young people are in Europe and the United States , it is natural to think of doing so with another person to make your load easier , ” he said .
Experts also say the expectations of these dependent singles and their parents were decidedly unrealistic .
“ Baby - boomer era parents in their 50s and 60s grew up and worked in the bubble economy and they do not fully understand that young people are less likely to be hired as a full - time worker nowadays , ” Yamada explained .
“ Parents with single daughters keep on looking for high - earning husbands . ”
Saito said women were especially picky , with those in their 40s often expecting their husbands to provide the same luxurious lifestyle that they enjoyed out of their father ’s paycheck .
“ They want someone who is handsome and with a very good income .
There are mothers who come to meetings looking for a man who earns up to 10 million yen ( $ 92,650 ) annually , ” she added .
Marriage has never been more important for young Japanese , who are struggling to find stable jobs in a slowing economy .
But , for the time being , it seems that parents are the only ones excited about the matchmaking parties .
“ I come to these parties to find someone for my daughter but she is difficult to please , ” said one mother , who like many parents at matchmaking events , did not wish to be named .
“ I am a little embarrassed that I have to do this , but it ’s this or she will be unmarried forever . ”

British soldiers forced a boy of 14 to carry out an act of oral sex on a fellow male prisoner in Iraq , according to shocking new allegations made about the behaviour of British troops .
The Ministry of Defence confirmed yesterday that the Royal Military Police ( RMP ) have launched an investigation .
If the allegations are proved , it would mark a sordid low in the behaviour of British troops in Iraq , and damage further the reputation of Britain in the Middle East .
The victim , now 19 , whom The Independent on Sunday has agreed to identify only as Hassan , says he was rounded up with a friend while trying to steal milk cartons from a food distribution centre .
He was whipped , beaten and forced to strip naked .

" They made us sit on each other 's laps , " he said .
" They were enjoying humiliating and abusing us , I wished I was dead at this moment .
Then they made me sit with Tariq ... where I was forced to put Tariq 's penis in my mouth .
The other two were made to do the same . "
Court action is ongoing over a series of allegations surrounding the British base Camp Breadbasket and incidents that took place there in May 2003 .
There have been allegations of simulated sexual abuse of Iraqis by British troops , but this , if true , would be the first example of actual sexual abuse .
Soldiers rounding up looters as part of an operation codenamed Ali Baba took photographs of prisoners suspended in nets from forklift trucks and others forced to strip naked and adopt simulated sex positions .
The photographs caused outrage around the world when they were published , after a British soldier took them to be developed at a high - street shop .
An RMP investigation led to just four soldiers being jailed for up to two years in 2005 .
A number of the alleged victims , including Hassan , are suing the MoD for damages .
The MoD last Thursday reiterated its official line that abuse was isolated to just a few rogue soldiers , after agreeing to pay nearly £ 3 m compensation to the father of Baha Mousa , 26 , a hotel receptionist beaten to death by British soldiers while in custody in a separate incident in September 2003 , and nine other Iraqis beaten at the same time .
Mazin Younis , of the Iraqi League , who has travelled in Basra collecting witness statements of allegations of abuse , says he now has " more than 80 " cases involving allegations against British troops .
" Every single time I uncover a personal story of torture and humiliation in Iraq , I think to myself that I have seen the worst there is , " Mr Younis added .
" Then I hear the next story .

" Hassan shook with emotion and humiliation as he described to me the treatment he suffered at the hands of British soldiers five years ago .
It had taken constant prompting and repeated reminders about the importance of detail before Hassan felt brave enough to describe how he was forced to engage in oral sex with his friend Tariq while their British captors laughed raucously and took photographs . "
Such is the culture in Iraq that Hassan fears for his life if identified .
It has taken him four years to find the courage to talk about the incident , Mr Younis said .
He fled Basra after the incident , giving up his education and staying indoors for fear that someone may recognise him .
Mr Younis added : " There is , of course , no case as bad as a killing or murder .
But the fact that this is sexual ...
It can lead to suicide because it is so humiliating .
Hassan fled Basra because he could n't face his friends , the people who had seen this .
" He left education and is now unemployed .
He has been very , very traumatised .
It is the kind of thing that is very difficult to admit to or talk about .
No one expected the British to be worse than Saddam Hussein . "
Mr Younis said the more than 80 allegations of abuse will form the basis of a series of actions at the European Court of Human Rights , as many of them took place outside British bases and are therefore outside British jurisdiction .
Phil Shiner , of Public Interest Lawyers , has represented many of the Iraqis who allege abuse at the hands of British troops , including Baha Mousa 's family and Hassan .
" It should be a national scandal that representatives of the British state could have engaged in such appalling behaviour , " he said .
" I call on the British government to immediately set up an inquiry into this incident . "
The Labour MP Harry Cohen also joined calls for an investigation .
" We need to have a full inquiry into how we keep prisoners .
It obviously needs a complete overhaul , " he said .
An MoD spokesman said yesterday : " We can confirm that a new allegation has been received in relation to the alleged abuse of a 14 - year - old boy by British soldiers at Camp Breadbasket in May 2003 .
" The allegation has been referred to the Royal Military Police , and efforts are in the process of being made to contact the alleged victim as soon as possible .
" All but a handful of the more than 120,000 British troops who have served in Iraq have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour , displaying integrity and selfless commitment .
All allegations of abuse are investigated thoroughly and – where proven – those responsible are punished and the abused are compensated .
" The Army has done a great deal since the cases of abuse related to the death of Baha Mousa in 2003 .
Procedures and training have been improved .
But we are not complacent and continue to demand the very highest standards of conduct from all our troops . "
A case to answer

Teenagers forced to swim a canal , resulting in the drowning of Kareem , 15 .
Kareem 's father and Hanoon are pursuing a claim for damages .
Hassan 's statement : ' They enjoyed abusing us '
At 7 am my friends convinced me to head towards Camp Breadbasket in order to steal dried milk cartons in order to sell them on the black market .
The hangars were surrounded by a high fence , though there was an opening in the fence .
Next to the fence there was a road , then a river .
When we tried to leave the hangars via the opening in the fence British soldiers chased us .
We tried to run away but were caught .
Some Iraqis managed to escape arrest .
I believe some may have drowned as they were trying to escape the British .
British soldiers caught me and started beating me and others using their vehicle 's aerials .
They were beating us very harshly .
We were led inside the hangars while still being beaten all the way .
The beating became stronger when we were inside the camp .
I was kept in a hangar along with four other Iraqis .
They ordered us to take off our clothes by gesturing to us to do so .
When we refused they continued beating us , so we had to follow their orders .
They made us sit on each other 's laps .
I was with one of the detainees , while another two detainees were made to do the same thing , as in the photos .
They were enjoying humiliating and abusing us .
I wished I was dead at this moment .
Then they made me sit with Tariq as in the other photo , where I was forced to put Tariq 's penis in my mouth .
The other two were made to do the same .
They locked the hangar while we were inside and left us there with no food or drink till the afternoon of the day after , when they opened the hangar and let us go .
Since then I fled Basra altogether as I cannot see Tariq again after what had happened , despite the fact that we were close friends .
In terms of accomplishing what it needed to accomplish , sure , Hillary Clinton 's speech was a home run , a grand slam , a tape - measure shot across Waveland Avenue ( look that up , and without a link ! ) .
But I can't help but feel the same feeling I 've felt watching lots of her speeches , and believe me , I have .
It could have been a lot more .
I strove to watch this thing from the point of view of one of her supporters – the one in five of her primary - season voters – who not only did not vote for but actively does not like Barack Obama .
Who are these people ?
They may be immature politically .
And they are .
I have made my views on that clear .
But they are n't stupid .
They know John McCain has pledged to put anti-abortion judges on the bench .
They know John McCain has moved to the right on taxes and drilling and loads of things .
They are well aware of all the logical and rational reasons that they should n't be flirting with voting for John McCain , but they 're thinking about it anyway .
Did this speech persuade them ?
I 'm honestly not sure .
For all her general avowals in Obama 's behalf , there were a few specific things she did not do in the speech .
First , she did n't vouch at all for Obama 's character .
She did n't say anything like , " I have served in the Senate with this man , and I competed with him on the campaign trail for nearly two years .
And as heated as things got sometimes , I can tell you that he is a person of profound judgment and decency and heft who will be a great leader , " or something along those lines .
Establishing that she had some degree of personal affinity for the nominee would have hit the Pumas in the breadbasket .
She chose not to do it .
Second , she did n't say anything about Obama 's ability as commander - in - chief .
I 'd argue she was under a special obligation to do this , at the very moment when McCain is running an ad using her famous quote from February in which she said that she and McCain brought a lifetime of experience to the job of leading America in the world , while Obama had a speech he gave in 2002 .
I honestly thought that she would reference that ad specifically and say something like , " Well , I 'm Hillary Clinton , and I do not approve that message . "
Imagine the applause .
But she left all that hanging .
And indeed the statement the McCain campaign issued immediately after the speech drove this point home , pointing out that Clinton had said nothing about Obama 's ability to be the commander - in - chief .
And I have to think the omission was conscious .
Third , it was interesting to me how she articulated the stakes of people opposing Obama .
" I want you to ask yourselves , " she said .
" Were you in this campaign just for me ?
Or were you in it for " various unfortunate citizens she 'd discussed previously .
That was the traditional " invisible people " trope she used often during the primaries .
Well , that was her trope , but it was n't Obama's , and it just struck me as an odd way to make the argument for why any Democrat just has to vote Democratic instead of voting Republican .
You have to vote Democratic because you do n't believe in starting hideous wars of choice ; because you care what the rest of the world thinks of us ; because you do n't want to let one of America 's great cities die from incompetence and neglect ; because you honor and cherish the constitution ; because you believe that government agencies should do what they are professionally assigned to do , and not conduct ideological witch hunts ; because you want a government that answers to the people and does n't manipulate them and strike fear into them .
Clinton instead cited : jobs going overseas , oil company profits and the need to build a green economy .
Look , these are important things .
But they are focused - grouped things , and they are at this point practically throw - away lines .
She did not , to my thinking , drill down to the kinds of specifics that would punch liberal women ( and some men ) – the people who are here in Denver and were raptly watching – in the stomach and make them understand , " Wow , maybe I really am being kinda stupid here . "
She also did n't really attack McCain very hard .
George Bush 's name was mentioned just once .
About one - eighth of the speech was devoted to McCain .
And she just did n't say that Obama is ready for the Oval Office , which is a big part of her backers ' opposition to him .
She 's getting great reviews tonight , as I 'm writing , and I can understand why .
Cable television will probably quiet down on the disunity meme for a while .
There were plenty of positive sound bites .
But I will bet anyone my mortgage : in one or two weeks , some polls will come out , and the TV pundits will marvel , " So that barn - burning Hillary Clinton speech did n't create party unity after all . "
She left too much unsaid tonight .
And the unity , I still think , will come , but it will come in October .
And it will come more because of him than her .
But in the short term , she did at least manage to change a negative narrative – at least for 24 hours , until her husband speaks , which is the next drama .
Flip - flops can cause serious damage to the feet , and going barefoot is n't necessarily better .
Flip - flops are named for the sound they make when you walk — flip , flop , flip , flop — but they could have been called ouch - umphs , the sound you 'll make after wearing them all the time .
Researchers at Auburn University have found that wearing flip - flops alters the way one walks , changing the gait in subtle ways that can lead to serious sole , heel and ankle problems .
They presented these findings earlier this month at the annual meeting of the American College of Sports Medicine in Indianapolis .
Casual flip - flop use is fine , they said .
But driven by a trend that less is better when it comes to healthy footwear , flip - flops have moved beyond the domain of beach bums to take their place among sturdier sandals as proper summer fashion day and night .
Flip - flops might feel good because they keep your feet cool .
At issue , though , is their utter lack of foot support .
Walk this way
The Auburn team videotaped 39 flip - flop - wearing volunteers and noticed how they scrunched their toes to keep the flip - flip on the foot while the heel lifted in the air .
This motion stretches the plantar fascia , the connective tissue that runs from heel to toe , causing inflammation , pain along the sole , heel spurs and tired feet in general .
These symptoms were actually what flip - flop wearers at Auburn University had reported upon returning to classes in the fall .
An entire summer of flip - flop wearing had taken its toll .
The researchers also found that the volunteers altered their gait , taking shorter strides and turning their ankles inward , likely to keep the flip - flop from falling off .
This , the researchers worry , can cause long - term ankle and hip problems .
Sandals with heel straps are the healthier choice because your foot does n't need to clench to keep the footwear secure .
These kinds of shoes offer better arch and heel support , too .
Better barefoot ?
Barefooters , or those who shall remain shoeless , believe that walking barefoot is healthier than walking in any kind of shoe .
They use the " natural " argument to explain how humans were never meant to wear shoes and that they take joy in what they call walking as nature intended .
No one can deny that joy , aside from podiatrists making a fist - load of money on their bruised feet .
But as stated before in this column , nature has no intent .
Nature is merely a framework in which humans evolved to live about 20 years , mate and die .
There 's a reason why humans created shoes tens of thousands of years ago .
Nature sucks .
Aside from cold snow , blistering hot sand or jagged rocks , there was disease - ridden muck to negotiate .
Not wearing clothes is natural , but clothes become a necessity in the 90 percent of the world that gets too cold to stay naked .
Groups such as the Society for Barefoot Living have captivating reasons for going barefoot most of the time , even for tromps through the city .
Walking barefoot on clean pavement does n't seem to hurt your feet , ankles or knees if you ease yourself into this routine .
In this respect , walking barefoot is healthier than walking in ill - fitting or flimsy shoes , such as flip - flops or high - heals .
This works , however , only because we live in an industrialized country that has created numerous unnatural things , such as sewage systems and smoothly paved public areas .
A stroll through the doo
Reality is better relayed by groups such as Shoes for Humanity , cognizant of the fact that worms and myriad other parasites can gain access into the body through the foot .
In most parts of the world , going barefoot is stubborn sign of impoverishment , not a natural , healthy alternative to footwear .
The risk of contracting hookworm is low for American barefooters because the chance of stepping in human feces containing the hookworm larvae is low .
Not so for the estimated one billion humans worldwide infected with hookworm .
Not so for dogs , either , who for the most part do n't wear shoes , aside from atrocities committed backstage at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show .
Dogs get canine hookworm from walking in doggie doo .
All land animals are susceptible to infections through their feet .
America barefooters still face real risks , such as glass and other sharp objects that can carry the tetanus neurotoxin .
Barefooters also run the risk of never being invited to an Asian home , because they can't take off their feet .

Copyright � 2008 by A.E. Fekete Gold Standard University Live : R.I.P. Antal E. Fekete aefekete@hotmail.com
The Inaugural Session of GSUL took place in February , 2007 , at the Martineum Academy in Hungary .
Subsequent sessions , including one in Dallas , Texas , showed a healthy increase in attendance , on average by fifty percent .
Still , I am now forced to announce that Session Four in Hungary in July , and Session Five in Canberra , Australia in November will be the last .
GSUL will fold tent as its sponsor , Sprott Asset Management , Inc. , has withdrawn its financial support .
Mr. Eric Sprott said in his letter that �we weren�t attracting enough interest to justify that ongoing expenditure� .
To give you an idea of the odds I am facing let me quote from the article in Wikipedia ( June 9 , 2008 ) captioned under my name :
� It should be noted that mainstream economic theorists criticize gold standard - oriented monetary economists and monetary reformers such as Professor Fekete as �fringe� or �amateur� economists , not worthy of serious study .
Professor Fekete has never held a teaching position in the economics department of any prominent university � .
A deep , searing corruption Pre-1936 theorists of the gold standard are likewise dismissed by the mainstream as �not worthy of serious study� .
I am proud that I have tried to continue that tradition in the footsteps of giants like Adam Smith , Carl Menger , B�hm - Bawerk , Ludwig von Mises , Frank Fetter , Benjamin Anderson , among others .
Monetary scientist Walter E. Spahr , who served as Chairman of the Department of Economics at New York University from 1927 to 1956 , wrote in The Commercial and Financial Chronicle on March 20 , 1947 : � A deep , searing corruption has afflicted monetary science .
It may require many years of painful effort to overcome this disease if , indeed , it can be combated successfully .
The well - being of our nation has been undermined by this affliction �
When gold payments were suspended in 1933 and we embarked upon a sea of managed currency , a very large number of professors and organizations [ list appended ] urged a prompt return to a gold standard .
The question arises what has become of those voices .
Were they in error then ?
Did those 710 economists know so little about monetary principles in 1933 that they could not , a short time later , defend their earlier position ?
Or were they simply corrupted by a political movement which they found it inexpedient to oppose ?
There appears to be no valid defense that can be offered for men who pretend to be scientists but who adjust their so - called principles in accordance with changing political tides .
A very great number of those who pass themselves off as monetary economists either have not understood the lessons of the past or have been willing to junk them , in the interest of expediency , for such personal gains as they may have supposed they might realize� �
Perpetuation of an immoral and dysfunctional monetary regime
One representative of the mainstream , Professor Jeff Frieden of Harvard , says that � the topic of the gold standard has received massive attention from scholars since the 1980�s ― from Barry Eichengreen to Ben Bernanke with hundreds in between ― and a serious analysis of its implications requires a serious engagement with the existing scholarly literature . �
I have studied most of that literature and I have not been able to find one iota connecting our crisis - ridden monetary system to the forcible removal of gold from it .
Rather , the gold standard is portrayed as an anachronistic monetary regime , the removal of which was due to popular demand .
Moral considerations , sanctity of contracts , the honor of the government , the opprobrium of declaring bankruptcy fraudulently , the question of tormenting widows and orphans did not enter into it .
Nor did long term economic considerations such as the ticking time - bomb of capital destruction .
The question is never raised how well the gold standard succeeded as the protector of savings , as the instrument of capital accumulation and , above all , as the stabilizer of the interest rate structure .
A fa�ade that the mainstream has provided a reasonably complete and balanced view of the gold standard , past and future , is maintained but is outright mendacious .
The existing literature is in fact a stumbling block in the way of impartial inquiry .
It is dedicated to the maintenance of the status - quo , the perpetuation of an immoral and dysfunctional monetary regime : that of irredeemable currency .
This has led me to found Gold Standard University Live that is free to challenge the Keynesian and Friedmanite orthodoxy .
Let me mention just two broad areas of inquiry which have been overlooked by others , but which we have planned to tackle : ( 1 ) Gold and the theory of interest .
The latter cannot be understood without the former .
We have to incorporate the theory of hoarding into the theory of interest .
We have to study the problem of capital destruction in the wake of gyrating interest rates , the main consequence of ousting gold from the monetary system .
( 2 ) Gold and the theory of speculation .
To understand the causes of the Great Depression we must understand speculation .
The theory of speculation covers such topics as arbitrage , futures trading , basis ( especially gold and silver basis ) , contango , backwardation , short squeeze , corner .
Speculation is virtually ignored by conventional economic theory .
The hurly - burly on the floor of the exchanges apparently does not reach the ears of inhabitants of the ivory tower .
The economic consequences of Mr. Keynes
Once these two gaps are filled , it becomes clear that the gold standard is naturally ordained as the only system that can stabilize interest and foreign exchange rates .
By contrast , the regime of irredeemable currency has been inflicted upon the people through fraud and chicanery .
Its foundation is no firmer than the gullibility of people who are , for the time being , willing to exchange real goods and real services for irredeemable promises to pay .
But as the prices of crude oil and various foodstuffs convincingly show , there are definite limits to gullibility .
The claim of Keynes parroted by most mainstream economists , that the Great Depression was due to the �contractionist tendencies of the gold standard� , is untenable .
Just the opposite is true .
Here is what happened .
In 1933 the forcible removal of gold signaled to bond speculators that the one and only competition to government bonds has been knocked out .
They were quick to realize that their chance to bid bond prices sky high has come .
The result was continually falling interest rates causing widespread capital destruction , as well as falling prices .
Producers were bankrupted en masse .
Economists have never bothered to study the untoward consequences of the forcible removal of gold , even though common sense would suggest that it can not be done with impunity .
A careful and impartial examination of the record shows that the scuttling of the gold standard , as advocated by Keynes , was the main cause of the Great Depression and , unless it is rehabilitated with all deliberate speed , a new depression may be waiting in the wings .
Theory of speculation Speculation is man�s main tool to deal with risks and future uncertainties .
Mainstream economics fails to make a distinction between risks created by nature and risks created by man .
This distinction is fundamental .
Speculation can effectively confront the former , while it will only aggravate the latter .
Risks created by man include risks involved in foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations .
They are certainly not created by nature witness the fact that such risks are non-existent under a gold standard .
Clearly , they were created by governments while abandoning the gold standard .
It is untenable to assume that under the regime of irredeemable currency speculation will tame the fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates .
Just the opposite is true .
Futures markets make them even less stable and more volatile .
It is not possible to predict whether bond prices go to zero as they would under hyper- inflation , or whether they go sky high as they would under hyper - deflation .
This problem is crucial and it can be approached only through understanding bond speculation , especially as it is helped by tail - winds provided by the central bank .
The following facts are either not widely known or not well - understood .
Open market operations of the Federal Reserve ( Fed ) were introduced in the 1920�s in violation of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 .
They were legalized retroactively in the 1930�s .
There was hardly any public discussion of the wisdom of the move or the stakes involved .
Pre -1936 economics was categorical in its condemnation of the monetization of government debt .
Introducing the catchy name �open market operations � has made it possible to monetize government debt through the back door .
Economists failed to predict the disastrous consequences of this ex post facto legislation .
Bond speculators were given a risk - free opportunity to profit .
In pre-empting the Fed they would buy the bonds beforehand , dumping them after the Fed has completed the purchase of its quota .
Risk - free speculation imparted a bias to the market favoring rising bond prices or , what is the same to say , falling interest rates .
It speaks volumes about the degradation of economics in the wake of the Keynesian revolution that an illegal trick could be elevated to the holiest of gestures whereby high - powered money is created , and nobody points to the downside of the prestidigitation .
Revisionist theory of the Great Depression
Most importantly , economists have also failed to identify falling interest rates as the main cause of the Great Depression .
They have concentrated on falling prices , not realizing that in doing so they are confusing cause and effect .
The true chain of causation is as follows .
Persistently falling interest rates result in the erosion ( ultimately , destruction ) of capital deployed by the producing sector .
In effect , bond speculators siphon off money stealthily from the capital accounts of the producers .
The latter are unaware of being victimized by this vampirism of the financial sector .
But they are , whether they recognize it or not .
Profits of the bond speculators do not come out of nowhere .
They are the flipside of the opportunity loss suffered by the producers who have to continue financing their capital at the higher rate .
Unable to escape from the clutches of debt , the producers are squeezed .
They scramble to sell more of their product at fire - sale prices in order to fend off bankruptcy .
In this way a downward spiral of prices is created .
The prevailing optical illusion suggests that money is scarce .
Everybody cries out for the Fed to create more money .
The Fed complies and enters the open market to purchase more bonds .
In doing so it provides bond speculators with another opportunity to make risk - free profits .
Interest rates fall further and producers are squeezed more .
A vicious circle is activated .
At the end of the spiral producers go bankrupt in droves .
According to my revisionist theory the Great Depression , far from being caused by overproduction as suggested by Keynes , was caused by wholesale destruction of capital .
The ultimate cause was risk - free profits granted to bond speculators through the Fed�s open market operations .
This is a serious challenge with which the prevailing orthodoxy is confronted .
The weakness of its position is shown by the unwillingness to take it up and have an open debate .
It is with regret that Gold Standard University Live has to suspend its operation to let Keynesian orthodoxy win by default .
Witch - hunt in Washington
High energy and food prices have given occasion for a witch hunt in Washington .
Politicians are trying to push the blame on speculators , calling for legislation to limit long positions in the futures markets .
These laws , if enacted , would be counter - productive .
All this goes to show that economics is a complete ignoramus when it comes to speculation .
Speculating in crude oil and in grains is not risk - free .
Profits are the incentive for speculators to lend liquidity to the markets and to temper price swings .
Indeed , speculation stimulates production or retrenchment according as the threat is scarcity or overproduction .
It is a blunder to regulate speculators out of the commodity markets .
The result is predictable : illiquidity , more volatility , more scarcity .
Consumers would end up paying even more for energy and food .
So much for commodity speculation .
Bond speculation is another matter .
As explained , bond trading does not address risks that exist in nature .
It addresses risks created artificially by the government .
Worse still , instead of promoting stability , it destabilizes the interest rate structure further .
Worst of all , bond speculation is made risk - free by the open market operations of the Fed .
The cap on bond prices has been removed , and continually falling interest rates may push the world into another Great Depression , possibly worse than the last one in the 1930�s .
Farewell message
These are just some of the questions GSUL has set out to investigate in depth .
Mainstream economics avoids these topics like the devil avoids holy water .
Other schools such as the Austrian , for example , appear to be more interested in cultism and in regurgitating old tenets than in new research of new problems to which mainstream economics turns a blind eye .
It is with regret that GSUL gives up its plans to discuss these burning issues in public just at a time when the need for such debate appears to be the greatest .
I take this opportunity to thank everybody , participants as well as sponsors , for their support of our cause .
I wish everybody a prosperous journey through what promises to be truly hard times .

A New York Times book review yesterday snidely commented that libertarianism was past its time – and that “ libertarian paternalism ” is the wave of the future .
Cass Sunstein was one of the proponents of “ libertarian paternalism ” invoked by the reviewer .
The notion of “ libertarian paternalism ” evokes sentiments not fit for a family - friendly blog like this one .
Sunstein has come a long ways .
Following is a piece I did for Playboy in 1999 on a book co-written by Sunstein and Stephen Holmes .
An angry letter to the editor from Holmes follows , as does my reply to Holmes .
( My article was based in part on Freedom in Chains , though the Philadephia analogy was not included in the final version of that book ) .

When You Put A Price Tag On Freedom , Guess Who Pays .
BY JAMES BOVARD
The Declaration of Independence proclaims that all men are “ endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights . ”
And to secure these rights , Thomas Jefferson wrote , “ governments are instituted among men . ”
The founding fathers constructed one such government , limiting its powers to certain well - defined functions .
Two years after the Constitution was ratified in 1788 , James Madison drafted the Bill of Rights to create a bulwark between the individual and the state .
As Syracuse University political science professor Stephen Macedo described it , the founding fathers saw government as an island in a sea of rights .
The rights enumerated were those grounded in the American experience : the right to assemble , the right to free speech , the right to worship God in your own way , the right to keep and bear arms , the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury , the right to be let alone by the state ( freedom from unwarranted search and seizure ) , freedom from self - incrimination ( coerced confessions ) , freedom from cruel and unusual punishment .
The Ninth Amendment states simply that “ certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people . ”
The Tenth Amendment underscores the point that the true repository of rights is the individual .
The founding fathers sought to curtail government .
Their notion of freedom was described this way : “ Society whose laws least restrain the words and actions of its members is most free . ”
For 150 years , that formula worked fine .
As recently as 1923 , the Supreme Court celebrated the breadth of personal freedom : “ The term [ liberty ] has received much consideration .
Without doubt , it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract , to engage in any of the common occupations of life , to acquire useful knowledge , to marry , to establish a home and bring up children , to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men . ”
Being left alone , uncoerced , is the true meaning of freedom - being able to take to the open road without being stopped and searched .
People value freedom so highly because freedom symbolizes life without a master - a life of minimal subjugation and shackles .
Freedom means being able to make choices and contracts .
Freedom means not having one ’s place in life assigned to by one ’s superiors .
Freedom means being able to take risks and suffer the consequences .
FDR’S LEGACY
Unfortunately , the notion of the citizen ’s inviolable right to liberty is vanishing from the American political landscape .
Indeed , the government scorns the individual and treats as suspect the exercise of such rights .
Some trace the shift to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
In 1933 FDR announced , “ We have all suffered in the past from individualism run wild . ”
Naturally , the corrective was to let government run wild .
On January 6 , 1941 Roosevelt cavalierly edited the Bill of Rights , replacing Madison ’s vision with his “ four freedoms . ”
He kept freedom of speech and freedom of worship , then added “ freedom from want , everywhere in the world , ” and “ freedom from fear , anywhere in the world . ”
In 1944 he declared that the Bill of Rights had “ proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness . ”
He called for a second Bill of Rights that created , among others , “ the right to a useful and remunerative job ; the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation ; the right of every family to a decent home ; the right to adequate medical care ; the right to adequate protection against the economic fears of old age , sickness , accident and unemployment ; the right to a good education . ”
The taxpayer would pay for these new rights , and the government would control the reallocation of resources .
Roosevelt talked of using the power of government to crush “ the few slackers or troublemakers in our midst , ” the “ small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American eagle in order to feather their own nests . ”
FDR pitted individual liberty against the interests of all ( as fathomed by government ) .
He would not be the last .
Presidents to follow seemed perfectly willing to reconsider the nation ’s original concept of freedom .
In 1994 Bill Clinton offered this idea : “ When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights , giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans , it was assumed that the Americans who had that freedom would use it responsibly . . . that they would work for the common good , as well as for
the individual welfare .
. . .
A lot of people say there ’s too much personal freedom .
When personal freedom is being abused , you have to move to limit it . ”
THE BIRTH OF GOVERNMENT
The shifting definition of rights - of freedom itself - raises the question of whether people will benefit more from being left to build their own lives or from somebody ’s confiscating much of their building material and imposing the structure he or she thinks is best .
The debate has shifted from the ideal to the monetary .
Roosevelt ’s redefinition of freedom was expensive .
Total government spending increased from $ 61 billion in 1950 ( about $ 2770 per person in current dollars ) to $ 4.4 trillion in 1994 ( or $ 9550 per person in current dollars ) .
Federal , state and local governments collected an average of $ 26,434 in taxes for every household in the country , or an average of $ 9881 for every U.S. resident in 1998 .
Indeed , the Tax Foundation calculates that an American works the equivalent of five months before any money he earns goes into his own pocket .
The cost of our new rights has become a political hot button : Conservatives complain about the cost of welfare and blame a permissive society that overindulges sexual rights .
Law - and - order types gripe about the cost
of the appeals process and blame the ACLU for mollycoddling criminals ( even those who are innocent ) .
Interest groups invent new rights ( the right to a safe workplace , the right to clean air and water , the right to streets free of dog nuisances , the right to workplaces free of dirty jokes and sexual innuendo , the right to a smoke - free environment ) , and the government responds with costly regulations .
The intellectual attack on the Bill of Rights has been spearheaded by Cass Sunstein , a law professor at the University of Chicago .
In The Cost of Rights : Why Liberty Depends on Taxation , Sunstein and Princeton political science professor Stephen Holmes offer this definition of the old ( negative ) and new ( positive ) rights , or , as they put it , the difference between liberties and subsidies : “ Those Americans who wish to be left alone prize their immunities from public interference , it is said , while those who wish to be taken care of seek entitlements to public aid .
Negative rights ban and exclude government ; positive ones invite and demand government .
Negative rights typically protect liberty ; positive rights typically promote equality .
The former shield a private realm , whereas the latter reallocate tax dollars .
If negative rights shelter us from the government , then positive rights grant us service by the government .
Positive rights include the rights of property and contract and , of course , freedom from being tortured by the police ; negative rights encompass rights to food stamps , subsidized housing and minimal welfare . ”
A STORYBOOK DISTINCTION
Sunstein and Holmes claim this is a storybook distinction .
Both positive and negative rights , they argue , depend on the existence of government .
Rights cost money .
Rights cannot be protected or enforced without public funding and support .
All rights make claims on the public treasury .
Rights without remedy are no rights at all .
The individual has no preexisting rights ; his sole responsibility is to contribute his share ( or what the government dictates is his share ) to the public coffers to protect his government - given rights .
So , the wealthier the bureaucracy , the freer the individual .
Government beneficence hides the erosion of the old order of freedom .
The fact that the government imprisons more people now than ever before is irrelevant , because government is bestowing more benefits than ever before .
It is as if the benefit automatically outweighs the shackle and therefore nullifies the existence of the shackle .
In perhaps their most creative passage , Sunstein and Holmes reveal : “ Our freedom from government interference is no less budget - dependent than our entitlement to public assistance .
Both freedoms must be interpreted .
Both are implemented by public officials who , drawing on the public purse , have a good deal of discretion in construing and protecting them . ”
MONEY TALKS
In a stroke , basic freedoms are reduced to line items in a budget - something as essential as religious freedom is put on a par with some congressman ’s pork project .
Like moral accountants , Sunstein and Holmes try to calculate the cost of essential rights .
In 1992 , they claim , the administration of justice in the U.S. - including enforcement , litigation , adjudication and correction - cost taxpayers around $ 94 billion .
An average jury trial costs approximately $ 13,000 .
The authors assure us that “ included in this allocation were funds earmarked for the protection of the basic rights of suspects and detainees . ”
Clearly , we consider the rights of suspects less important than national defense ( which runs some $ 265 billion per year ) .
Under this theory every failure of government is the citizens ’ fault .
Sunstein notes : “ The Fourth Amendment right [ against unreasonable government searches and seizures ] cannot be absolute unless the public is willing to invest the enormous amounts necessary to ensure that it is seldom violated in practice .
The fact that the Fourth Amendment is violated so regularly shows that the public is not willing to make that investment . ”
In other words , police routinely carry out unconstitutional searches with impunity because taxes are not high enough to prevent them .
Taxation , not moral outrage , shields citizens from abuse .
“ To take the cost of rights into account is therefore to think something like a government procurement officer , asking how to allocate limited resources intelligently while keeping a wide array of public goods in mind . ”
Despite the founding fathers , today ’s rights have become an island in a sea of government .
The Bill of Rights is a theme park , and we buy tickets from Uncle Sam .
That ’s not how the men who formed this country conceived it , and that ’s not how it should be .

HEADLINE : READER RESPONSE ; Letter to the Editor
THE COST OF RIGHTS
STEPHEN HOLMES : James Bovard ’s outburst at a book written by me and University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein ( ” The Cost of Rights , ” The Playboy Forum , October ) leaves me feeling like a mosquito in a nudist colony : I do n’t know where to begin .
The theme of our book , The Cost of Rights : Why Liberty Depends on Taxes , is the budgetary cost of nonwelfare rights .
Property rights , freedom of contract , the right to vote , freedom from unreasonable search and seizure and so forth all make important claims on the public fisc .
Bovard may not have noticed that the money to light , heat and repair courthouses comes from taxpayers .
This dependency of nonwelfare rights on budgetary outlays implies something that those of Bovard ’s persuasion are loath to admit : Individual liberty , as Americans understand it , can be protected only on the basis of public resources gathered and managed by the government .
The freedom that right - wingers purport to love presupposes the government ’s capacity to tax and spend , an activity right - wingers purport to hate .
The debate between those favoring large government and those favoring small government is a reasonable one .
What introduces an element of irrationality is the assumption that there are two kinds of rights - one that makes us independent of government while requiring no government spending , and one that promotes dependency while draining the budget .
The for - mer is American and should be preserved , we frequently hear , while the latter is un-American and should be abolished .
But this flimsy distinction is a poor basis for public policy , as demonstrated by someone asking who is more dependent on taxpayer - funded government support : the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or the invalid who sleeps on a heating grate ?
The purpose of our book is not to decide which government programs should be expanded or cut , but to puncture some pervasive illusions that continue to cloud the thinking of those who enjoy posing as embattled heroes of private liberty .
The notion that any right is deeply un-American if it makes the individual dependent on government is one of those all - too - common fallacies .
If Bovard feels perfectly “ free ” when he rides in an elevator that has never been inspected by a taxpayer - salaried government official , then he has an odd conception of freedom .
Stephen Holmes

Bovard responds :
Because the government spends a minuscule percentage of tax revenues on the administration of court systems , citizens are supposed to pretend that government is their liberator .
And regardless of how heavy taxes become , they are still a badge of freedom , because not all the revenue is pissed away or used to buy new shackles for citizens .
This is the Sunstein - Holmes philosophy of government in a nutshell .
Holmes and Sunstein work overtime to attribute every freedom to government intervention , asserting : “ Religious liberty is certainly no more costless than other legal rights .
American citizens are more or less free to worship or not , as they wish , but their freedom in this respect makes a claim upon the public fisc , even when it is not subsidized out of public budgets ( through , for example , police and fire protection of churches and other religious institutions ) . ”
By that reasoning , people have sexual freedom only because government - funded rescue squads might retrieve the wounded after a couple injure themselves attempting a Flying Philadelphia Fuck .
If a single cent of government money could conceivably be involved in some activity , the entire activity becomes the equivalent of a government handout .
And regardless of how much tax a person pays , if a person receives any benefit from any government activity , that person becomes the moral equivalent of a public housing resident who never worked a day in his or her life .
They call them the " walking clubs " , and Grace Sibanda is an involuntary member .
Each working day , the 36 - year - old shop assistant rises before dawn in Dzivaresekwa township to the west of Harare , slips out of her tiny home without waking the three children who share her bed , and makes her way to the clusters of people gathered at the roadside .
When there are enough of them - a few dozen usually - they set off on the three - hour walk to work in the city centre .
" We are lucky to have jobs but the bus fare in one day is more than I earn in a week .
So we walk , " she says .
" We walk together because it 's not safe .
They wait in the bushes by the road and attack you if you are alone .
They do n't want money .
We do n't have any .
They want my food . "
Sibanda holds up a plastic bag with her lunch of fruit and vegetables .
Bread long ago became an unaffordable luxury .
" No one believes what has happened to our country .
Now we talk of prices in billions of [ Zimbabwe ] dollars and people are asking what comes after trillions .
They laugh about it but we know it 's not funny .
People are dying .
I wonder how long I will be able to feed my children . "
Around Harare , in the dark of the cold winter mornings , the walking clubs can be found setting off .
But the numbers have been falling as jobs disappear under the barrage of hyperinflation - currently estimated to be about 9 m % but predicted to hit 100 m % within three months - and a currency devaluing so fast that banknotes issued just a few months ago are now not worth enough to buy a single sheet of toilet paper .
That is , if toilet paper could even be found in the empty supermarkets .
Zimbabwe 's economic and political crisis has wormed its way in to almost every aspect of everyday life as people spend their days struggling with intermittent power supplies and water shortages , or waiting hours in queues for bread or cash .
Many schools and hospitals barely function as teachers and nurses flee to South Africa in search of a salary that can feed their families back home .
And deep in some rural areas , Zimbabweans are saying that starvation is taking hold for the first time in living memory .
Zimbabweans used to feel sorry for their war - blighted neighbours in Mozambique , who were forced to cross the border to buy the most basic goods .
Now queues of Zimbabweans , black and white , line up at the checkout tills in Chomoio , across the Mozambican frontier , loaded down with bread , flour and tinned foods because the supermarkets at home are all but empty .
Zimbabweans also used to laugh at Zambia 's currency , the kwacha , as Monopoly money .
Nowadays , in Victoria Falls on their own side of the border , Zimbabweans are using kwacha as a hard currency , while the Zimbabwean dollar loses half its value every few days .
In August 2006 , Zimbabwe 's central bank issued a one cent note .
In May this year , it issued a $ 50 bn note .
At the time it was worth about £ 2 ; now it is just 17 p , and that wo n't be for long .
Meanwhile , an advert in yesterday 's Harare Herald newspaper trumpeted that this week 's Lotto bonanza is " $ 1.2 quadrillion " in prizes ( £ 2,100 , and not for long either ) .
Inflation means hourly price rises while wages - for those lucky enough to have a job in a country with more than 80 % unemployment and industry virtually at a standstill - lag far behind .
Sibanda earned $ 150 bn last month .
Police officers and teachers made about the same .
At the time , it was enough to buy 20 eggs or about 10kg of maize on the black market .
Increasingly people are getting by on one meal a day and praying that they do n't get sick .
Few can afford to go to hospital .
In any case , they rarely have drugs or staff , as so many of the doctors and nurses have fled abroad in search of a living .
In one of Harare 's upmarket suburbs , Ishmael Dube is having to sell off the trappings of his life , despite a long history of close association with President Robert Mugabe 's government .
Testament to this are the two government - issued identity cards carried by the warm , if pensive , 60 - year - old .
One says he is a " Liberation War Hero " .
Dube took up arms against white rule in 1966 at the age of 18 .
He was captured by the Rhodesian army a year later and served 15 years in jail as a " terrorist " .
The other says he is a former staff member of Mugabe 's presidential office .
After independence in 1980 , Dube became an intelligence officer on Mugabe 's staff and then went on to a diplomatic career , serving in Europe and Washington .
He retired a decade ago and lived comfortably enough on two pensions .
No more .
This month his war veteran 's pension brought him $ 109bn ( currently worth about 37 p ) and the other , for his government service , $ 130bn ( 46 p ) .
With that he is expected to feed his wife and seven daughters .
He also has to pay for four of his daughters to go to university , two to go to primary school and the seventh to board at a secondary school .
" I can buy a bucket of maize with my pensions .
That keeps us going for about five days .
So how can we survive ? " he asks .
Dube is doing what so many Zimbabweans - from the once well - off to the poor - have to do these days : hawking his possessions piecemeal .
Dube retired as a diplomat owning two cars .
He brought three television sets back from Washington .
In the 90s , like many in Zimbabwe 's rising black middle class , he accumulated the goods and chattels that flow from a comfortable income .
Now most of them are gone .
" I 've sold the two cars to pay for the girls to go to university .
First one car two years ago , then the other .
I do n't have a vehicle any more .
Then I 've been selecting certain household items to sell .
I used to have three TV sets .
I sold two .
I sold the washing machine .
Last month I sold my radio stereo to another parent at my daughter 's school , Queen Elizabeth , for $ 1trn , " he said .
" I owe the school $ 1.2 trn in fees but I had to use some of the money to buy food so I 'm trying to negotiate with them to pay $ 500 bn monthly . "
But the school wants the money now because at 9 m % inflation it is virtually worthless in a month .
Dube at least has something to sell .
Retired people across Zimbabwe have seen their pensions wiped out by inflation and increasing numbers live on handouts from organisations such as Save Our Ageing Pensioners .
Sometimes the elderly looked after by local women paid a comparative fortune - £ 75 a month - by relatives abroad .
Mugabe calls them BBCs : British Bum Cleaners .
Dube wants to meet in the Wimpy at what had been one of Harare 's most upmarket shopping malls , the Westgate complex .
It was built with South African money a decade ago and attracted boutiques and bookshops .
Most are closed now .
Dube wants to order chips but the waitress says there are n't any .
No hamburgers , either , despite the luridly coloured menu on the table offering the usual meat - filled buns .
Instead she lays down a worn photocopy of typed offerings .
The list includes pig 's trotters and knuckle bones at $ 90bn a dish .
" A lot of us have been diagnosed with high blood pressure , " says Dube .
" It 's not surprising .
We 've been relying on beer for stress management - a drink or two a night .
But beer last week was $ 10 bn a quart .
This week it was $ 20bn on Monday ( July 7 ) .
On Wednesday it was $ 40bn and now it is $ 60 bn .
So this thing we have been using as stress management is beyond our reach .
That is very bad . "
By yesterday , beer was $ 150 bn a quart .
Many people , Dube says , have found themselves forced to become black market traders .
" More or less every family finds it imperative to have a vendor , " he says .
Walking long distances into the countryside to buy food to resell in the towns is one way of trading .
People used to be too scared to disobey the law requiring maize growers to sell their crops to the state - run Grain Marketing Board at a predetermined price , but these days hunger often overcomes fear .
" The maize is coming in to the city direct from the few farms able to harvest , " says Dube .
" You see people on the roads .
They walk 30 km carrying 50kg of maize .
They buy it at $ 30bn and sell it at $ 250 bn .
A lot of people are doing that .
Not only maize but beans and vegetables . "
Sibanda 's mother is among them .
The shop assistant cannot survive on her pay alone so she gives it to her mother who travels back to her rural village to buy vegetables .
She brings them back to the city and sells them , along with cooking oil by the cup , on a stall she has set up on a few planks of wood and bricks in Dzivaresekwa .
" We make more money from selling the vegetables than I earn but I do n't want to give up my job - I may never get another one , " Sibanda says .
" My money used to be enough to pay for everything - food , clothes , school .
We could afford to take bus trips to places .
Now we do n't go anywhere we can't walk . "
Even for those with money , shopping is a logistical nightmare .
The first problem is to get hold of cash .
The central bank cannot print it fast enough to keep up with demand .
But neither does anyone want to hold on to it very long when prices are rising by the hour .
So there is a merry - go - round of cash in which people queue for hours to draw their allotted $ 100 bn ( 36 p ) limit from the bank each day but then spend it as fast as possible before it loses what little value it has .
It is still possible to write a cheque , but shops demand that they are made out for twice as much as the bill , because cheques lose half their value while clearing .
Zimbabwe has a fairly advanced electronic banking system so it is possible to bypass the cash shortage by using a debit card .
But the limits on individual transactions mean a basket full of groceries requires the card to be swiped dozens of times to pay the bill .
Some supermarkets have staff standing full - time at the card machines and queues of customers lining up to pay .
Other supermarkets have no such problem because they have nothing to sell .
Smaller shops with government connections , such as Spar , import many of their goods from South Africa and sell them well above the price - controlled rate .
But the larger chains - such as TM and OK - are closely watched by the authorities and can no longer afford to sell at official prices that are a fraction of the real cost .
Their shelves are bare except for locally produced vegetables and cleaning fluids .
Even the baked beans factory has closed down .
Last week , the government accused both chains of conspiring to make " regime change " by starving people , and ordered them to stock their shelves or face their businesses being seized .
When the owners protested that they could not afford to import goods that they were then only permitted to sell at prices substantially below cost , officials said that unless the shelves were filled within a week the state would take over .
Those with hard currency - South African rand or US dollars - are increasingly drawn to underground supermarkets set up in warehouses .
Shopping is by appointment , and customers are screened to ensure they wo n't blow the whistle .
It is a criminal offence to accept foreign currency in payment but in recent weeks some businesses have thrown caution to the wind .
Restaurants even price in what they call " units " , a euphemism for US dollars .
Petrol at garages can be bought only with US dollars after drastic fuel shortages forced the government to accept that was the only way Shell and BP would bring it into the country .
And increasingly , rents and salaries in private firms are pegged to the American dollar .
Much of the foreign currency comes from the 4 million Zimbabweans - one - third of the population - who have gone abroad for work .
Most are in South Africa but some estimates say there are 1 million in Britain .
The cash they send back to their families has now replaced tobacco as Zimbabwe 's single largest source of foreign earnings .
These foreign remittances mean there are enough people with money to buy what Dube has to sell .
" There are people who refurbish cars and sell them to people with relatives overseas who have money to send back .
They are in the UK or South Africa .
They get money from the sons and daughters .
They even buy houses , " he says .
Zimbabwe 's property market is buoyant because exiles are buying up houses in Harare from people desperate for foreign currency .
There is also a form of vulture capitalism , with foreign investors realising that industrial property can be snapped up for far below its real value .
The collapse of their country is all the more shocking for many Zimbabweans because it has been so sudden .
Nigeria , and what was then Zaire under the tutelage of Mobutu Sese Seko , slid into decay over three decades as their wealth was diverted to the pockets of an elite indifferent to the plight of those they ruled .
Infrastructure , education , health care and jobs crumbled away .
In parts of Zaire , the only people who had ever seen a car were the elderly .
Zimbabwe , by contrast , was on the up .
Its education system was arguably the best in Africa , a growing black middle class took root and aspirations flourished , sometimes being realised .
The remnants of those times are still here .
The ballet performs and Harare sports club continues with cricket on Saturday afternoon .
The horses at Borrowdale race course compete for $ 100 trn prize money ( value on the day , £ 500 ) in the Air Zimbabwe Handicap and Republic Cup .
At first glance , little seems to have changed : the jockeys parade in colours , a smartly turned out army band strikes up between races .
But the signs of erosion are everywhere .
The dress code in the owners ' bar has fallen away .
Entry is open to anyone with enough money for a beer , US dollars welcome .
The minimum bet is Z$ 20bn .
After the races , punters return to homes with no power and water .
Some Harare suburbs have n't had water in three months .
Swimming pools are now personal reservoirs .
There is every sign the situation will get worse .
Food has been in even shorter supply since the government banned foreign aid organisations from working in rural areas - a move that appeared to be an attempt to keep outside witnesses away from Zanu - PF 's campaign of terror against the voters in this year 's elections .
Now people are beginning to starve .
The UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that Zimbabwe will this year produce only about a quarter of the grain it needs to feed its people .
The numbers being treated for malnutrition in hospitals have doubled in recent months .
About 5 million people are expected to need food aid .
Yet so far , there has not been any of the popular protest - either against the economic crisis or the stolen election - that has hit other African countries at such times , most recently in Kenya .
" A lot of people regard Zimbabweans as docile , " says Dube .
" But there 's docility based on intelligence that says if there 's a chance to survive there is no point in risking your life .
But people have their backs against the wall and they are wondering if they can survive .
" It 's firefighting .
Us and them : ordinary people and the government .
No one has a plan .
We 're all just firefighting to get through each day " .
Athlete 's Village , Beijing
I am physically and mentally drained .
The main emotion this morning is less exhilaration and more a mix of relief and exhaustion .
For the first time in months and months I 'll be able to walk up a flight of stairs without worrying whether my legs feel tired .
To finally get it all finished is a wonderful feeling .
For five days I 've been battling to keep my head above water .
I can pinpoint times in the last four years when I 've gone through real suffering .
Certain sessions I 've done have been simply horrendous .
The only thing that gets you through is the thought of the Olympics and the gold medal .
Out here I would visualise those sessions and remind myself of everything I 've gone through .
If I 'd even missed one session , I would have lined up with doubt and fear in my mind .
What would happen if I lost the gold by one thousandth of a second , because there was a training session I skipped or did n't give my all to ?
Instead , I lined up here knowing no - one had trained harder than me , and that gave me enormous confidence .
It 's a really strange feeling today .
Every day for as long as I can remember I 've woken up thinking about nothing else but the Olympics .
It feels so weird telling myself that I do n't have to any more .
I should be able to switch off , now it 's all down , but of course I can't .
The habits are too ingrained .
I 've got the three gold medals next to me now .
They come in a presentation box , but I 'm still waiting for the ones from the keirin and sprint so they 're all together in one at the moment .
You also get a spare ribbon for each medal , which as it turns out is quite handy .
The top of the medals is quite a sharp edge , and the ribbon is getting frayed already , even though I 've barely started wearing them .
While the competition is underway , you do n't let yourself imagine how it would feel to win gold .
You 're so focused on each individual race , because otherwise there 's no way of getting through it .
Our team compare it to running the hurdles - you have to take one at a time .
It makes it all the sweeter when it finally comes together .
When I crossed the line for the final time in the sprint it just all came out .
In the velodrome , we battered the other teams into submission .
You could see their morale was completely dented by the first few days .
I was almost surprised at how badly some of them performed .
Some of them did n't even reach the levels they had at the World Championships in March .
That could n't be a physical thing , because you 'd aim to peak for the Olympics .
I think it was mental .
The lower your morale , the more you feel the pain .
And when they saw how our team was riding , everyone else just started to crack .
The emotional side of it is almost tougher than the physical part .
Before each race you think about what you 're going to do , your plan and execution .
Then you have the race itself , and afterwards the examination of what you did and how you might improve , and how you should plan for the next one .
That absolutely drains you .
To be honest what 's happened out here has n't really sunk in .
I think it 'll only be when I get back home and get the chance to relax and reflect that I 'll appreciate what we 've done .
Last night I went out with the team pursuit team , Vicky Pendleton and my girlfriend for a few beers , but it was n't a big night .
We were just too tired - Jason Kenny did n't even make it out - but tonight will be a bigger night , and the one after that bigger still .
I 'm so looking forward to going home and being able to do normal things - to be able to see friends , to have a beer without worrying about it .
I 'm going to take a big break now before I decide what to do next .
I 've got a holiday booked in November , and I wo n't start discussing the future until then .
For now , I 'm just going to enjoy what 's happened here in Beijing .
It 's an unbelievable feeling to achieve the absolute maximum you possibly can .
Chris Hoy was speaking to BBC Sport's Tom Fordyce
Months ago , Barack Obama posted on his website a detailed technology plan which he would support as president .
Now , finally , John McCain has responded with a technology plan of his own .
You can ( and should ) read them both .
Obama 's is here ; McCain 's here Since I 've already analyzed the Obama white paper , let 's turn our attention to McCain 's just - released plan .
McCain is clearly focused on avoiding any regulation of the internet , lowering corporate taxes , and providing incentives for Research & Development ( R&D ) .
The most notable characteristic of his plan is that it reveals a worldview where private businesses are considered the primary engine of internet growth , while everyone else is viewed simply as " consumers " .
And to that end , businesses would get quite a boon .
He specifically calls for a permanent tax credit equal to 10 percent of wages spent on R&D , and first - year expensing of new equipment and technology for businesses .
He also supports grants for educational instruction in digital and wireless technologies - which makes some academics I know very pleased , - and , going against some core elements of his Republican base , supports the hiring of skilled foreign workers to fill critical shortages .
McCain 's plan also focuses on reducing the Digital Divide and providing everyone with high - speed internet access .
He has already introduced the " Community Broadband Bill " which would allow local governments to build their own high - speed infrastructure , particularly when private industry fails to do so .
He would also establish a " People Connect Program " that rewards companies that offer high - speed access to low income customers by allowing these companies offset their tax liability for the cost of this service .
However , other proposals seem deeply misguided .
For example , he " does not believe in prescriptive regulation like ' net - neutrality , ' " but rather he believes in " an open marketplace with a variety of consumer choices " .
That sounds an awful lot like an apple - pie statement .
Of course he supports an open marketplace and consumer choice .
Who does n't ?
It 's like saying you support better education .
But net neutrality is a complex issue that many argue would actually protect consumer choice , rather than harm it .
That makes his statement contradict itself .
So either he is dumbing down the debate by grossly oversimplifying a highly complex issue , or he has no grasp of that complexity .
The same holds true with his expressed desire to " protect the creative industries from piracy " .
Again , of course everyone wants to protect artists from outright piracy of their works .
However , the issue is about a whole lot more than enforcement and " cracking down " .
Copyright law itself is badly in need of reform , as all of us , by doing everyday activities on the internet , are considered " pirates " under existing legislation .
There is no mention in McCain 's plan of how to fix that .
Likewise , what does McCain propose doing about encryption technologies like DRM ( Digital Rights Management ) software that protect copyrighted works by completely disregarding other rights people have , like Fair Use And for that matter , where is a single mention of protecting people 's privacy rights online ?
Taken as a whole , McCain 's plan includes some very worthy proposals , and others that are either misleading or misguided .
That 's not really a surprise .
What should be more of a concern are two things : 1 ) the level of real interest McCain has in internet policy issues ( he has seemed very uninterested in the past ) , and 2 ) his perception that we are all little more than consumers , and that the internet itself is essentially just a commercial marketplace .
For those not paying attention , it 's actually a whole lot more than that :-)

Sad news out of Russia this week .
The AP reports that The eXile , the English - language biweekly for Moscow ’s expatriate community , is going out of business following an unannounced inspection by officials from Russia ’s media bureau that scared off the paper ’s financial backers .
The temptation in eulogizing
The eXile is to string together lengthy excerpts of the paper ’s best work .
But I ’ll keep it to a few quick hits :
It ’s where Matt Taibbi got his start ; it published a military affairs column by “ War Nerd ” Gary Brecher , a data enterer who , according to his Wikipedia entry , describes “ himself as a fat slob who spends approximately 8 hours a day on the internet searching for war news ” ; in 2001 the editors famously “ stormed into the Moscow bureau of The New York Times and threw a pie filled with equine sperm into the face of the bureau chief after accusing him of soft coverage of Russia ’s political elite . ”
And even with their Larry Flynt - like standards of taste and decency — even while describing their most malicious pranks in vile detail — the editors managed to come off as the good guys .
Really , it ’s a measure of the paper ’s brilliance that it managed to be consistently interesting and readable while covering a country that plenty of readers , like me , had never even laid eyes on .
Over at Radar , Mark Ames , who founded The eXile 11 years ago , has been providing some hilarious coverage of the slow death of the paper .
Here ’s a sample passage , in which officials from the Federal Service for Mass Media , Telecommunications , and the Protection of Cultural Heritage quiz Ames on eccentric opposition leader / eXile columnist Eduard Limonov ( slightly censored because The Riff is a family blog ) :
The officials asked us why Limonov was in our paper .

They asked to see an example of a recent Limonov column — the first one I pulled out was titled “ Mr. Limonov on Mr. Medvedev ” — I quickly shoved it under a pile and grabbed the next column I could find .
They took that issue , and two others , with them , and told us that they ’d have experts translate and check to see if we ’d violated laws on printing “ extremism , ” “ inciting national hatred , ” “ pornography , ” and “ pro-drugs propaganda . ”
Here are a few of the Limonov lines from the article I gave to the officials , written in his trademark broken English : “ Russian Government is bloody beast eating human flesh .
It is deeply medieval in its principle conceptions … Russian women are very , very bad .
The worst of all .
Russian women is like the Russian Government . …
I am absolutely and positively on the side of Muslim strict code of behavior for women .
Their system of separation of sexes if effective and healthy . ”

It ’s an obvious fact that circles should have 360 degrees .
Right ?
Wrong .
Most of us have no idea why there ’s 360 degrees in a circle .
We memorize a magic number as the “ size of a circle ” and set ourselves up for confusion when studying advanced math or physics , with their so called “ radians ” .
“ Radians make math easier ! ” the experts say , without a simple reason why ( discussions involving Taylor series are not simple ) .
Today we ’ll uncover what radians really are , and the intuitive reason they make math easier .
Where Do Degrees Come From ?
Before numbers and language we had the stars .
Ancient civilizations used astronomy to mark the seasons , predict the future , and appease the gods ( when making human sacrifices , they ’d better be on time ) .
How is this relevant to angles ?
Well , bub , riddle me this : is n’t it strange that a circle has 360 degrees and a year has 365 days ?
And is n’t it weird that constellations just happen to circle the sky during the course of a year ?
Unlike a pirate , I bet you landlubbers can’t determine the seasons by the night sky .
Here ’s the Big Dipper ( Great Bear ) as seen from New York City in 2008 ( try any city ) :
Constellations make a circle every day ( video ) .
If you look at the same time every day ( midnight ) , they will also make a circle throughout the year .
Here ’s a theory about how degrees came to pass :
Humans noticed that constellations moved in a full circle every year
Every day , they were off by a tiny bit ( “ a degree ” )
Since a year has about 360 days , a circle had 360 degrees
But , but … why not 365 degrees in a circle ?
Cut ‘em some slack : they had sundials and did n’t know a year should have a convenient 365.242199 degrees like you do .
360 is close enough for government work .
It fits nicely into the Babylonian base - 60 number system , and divides well ( by 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 30 , 45 , 90 … you get the idea ) .
Basing Mathematics on the Sun Seems Perfectly Reasonable
Earth lucked out : ~360 is a great number of days to have in a year .
But it does seem arbitrary : on Mars we ’d have roughly ~680 degrees in a circle , for the longer Martian year .
And in parts of Europe they ’ve used gradians , where you divide a circle into 400 pieces .
Many explanations stop here saying , “ Well , the degree is arbitrary but we need to pick some number . ”
Not here : we ’ll see that the entire premise of the degree is backwards .
Radians Rule , Degrees Drool
A degree is the amount I , an observer , need to tilt my head to see you , the mover .
It ’s a tad self - centered , do n’t you think ?
Suppose you saw a friend go running on a large track :
“ Hey Bill , how far did you go ? ” “ Well , I had a really good pace , I think I went 6 or 7 mile – ” “ Shuddup .
How far did I turn my head to see you move ? ”
“ What ? ” “ I ’ll use small words for you .
Me in middle of track .
You ran around .
How…much…did… I…turn …my…head ? ” “ Jerk . ”
Selfish , right ?
That ’s how we do math !
We write equations in terms of “ Hey , how far did I turn my head see that planet / pendulum / wheel move ? ” .
I bet you ’ve never bothered to think about the pendulum ’s feelings , hopes and dreams .
Do you think the equations of physics should be made simple for the mover or observer ?
Radians : The Unselfish Choice
Much of physics ( and life ! ) involves leaving your reference frame and seeing things from another ’s viewpoint .
Instead of wondering how far we tilted our heads , consider how far the other person moved .
Degrees measure angles by how far we tilted our heads .
Radians measure angles by distance traveled .
But absolute distance is n’t that useful , since going 10 miles is a different number of laps depending on the track .
So we divide by radius to get a normalized angle :
You ’ll often see this as
or angle in radians ( theta ) is arc length ( s ) divided by radius ( r ) .
A circle has 360 degrees or 2 pi radians — going all the way around is 2 * pi * r / r .
So a radian is about 360 / ( 2 * pi ) or 57.3 degrees .
Now do n’t be like me , memorizing this thinking “ Great , another unit.
57.3 degrees is so weird . ”
Because it is weird when you ’re still thinking about you !
Moving 1 radian ( unit ) is a perfectly normal distance to travel .
Put another way , our idea of a “ clean , 90 degree angle ” means the mover goes a very unclean pi/2 units .
Think about it —
“ Hey Bill , can you run 90 degrees for me ?
What ’s that ?
Oh , yeah , that ’d be pi/2 miles from your point of view . ”
The strangeness goes both ways .
Radians are the empathetic way to do math — a shift from away from head tilting and towards the mover ’s perspective .
What ’s in a name ?
Radians are a count of distance in terms of “ radius units ” , and I think of “ radian ” as shorthand for that concept .
Strictly speaking , radians are just a number like 1.5 or 73 , and do n’t have any units ( in the calculation “ radians = distance traveled / radius ” , we see length is divided by length , so any units would cancel ) .
But practically speaking , we ’re not math robots , and it helps to think of radians as “ distance ” traveled on a unit circle .
Using Radians
I ’m still getting used to thinking in radians .
But we encounter the concept of “ mover ’s distance ” quite a bit :
We use “ rotations per minute ” not “ degrees per second ” when measuring certain rotational speeds .
This is a shift towards the mover ’s reference point ( “ How many laps has it gone ? ” ) and away from an arbitrary degree measure .
When a satellite orbits the Earth , we understand its speed in “ miles per hour ” , not “ degrees per hour ” .
Now divide by the distance to the satellite and you get the orbital speed in radians per hour .
Sine , that wonderful function , is defined in terms of radians as
This formula only works when x is in radians !
Why ?
Well , sine is fundamentally related to distance moved , not head - tilting .
But we ’ll save that discussion for another day .
Radian Example 1 : Wheels of the Bus
Let ’s try a real example : you have a bus with wheels of radius 2 meters ( it ’s a monster truck bus ) .
I ’ll say how fast the wheels are turning and you say how fast the bus is moving .
Ready ?
“ The wheels are turning 2000 degrees per second ” .
You ’d think :
Ok , the wheels are going 2000 degrees per second .
That means it ’s turning 2000 / 360 or 5 and 5/9ths rotations per second .
Circumference = 2 * pi * r , so it ’s moving , um , 2 * 3.14 * 5 and 5/9ths … where ’s my calculator …
Ok .
Now imagine a car with wheels of radius 2 meters ( also a monster ) .
“ The car wheels are turning 6 radians per second ” .
You ’d think :
Radians are distance along a unit circle — we just scale by the real radius to see how far we ’ve gone .
6 * 2 = 12 meters per second .
Next question .
Wow -- the car was easier to figure out than the bus !
No crazy formulas , no pi floating around — just multiply to convert rotational speed to linear speed .
All because radians speak in terms of the mover .
The reverse is easy too .
Suppose you ’re cruising 90 feet per second on the highway ( 60 miles per hour ) on your 24 ″ inch rims ( radius 1 foot ) .
How fast are the wheels turning ?
Well , 90 feet per second / 1 foot radius = 90 radians per second .
That was easy .
I suspect rappers sing about 24 ″ rims for this very reason .
Radian Example 2 : sin(x )
Time for a beefier example .
Calculus is about many things , and one is what happens when numbers get really big or really small .
Choose a number of degrees ( x ) , and put sin( x ) into your calculator :
When you make x small , like .01 , sin(x ) gets small as well .
And the ratio of sin(x ) / x seems to be about .017 — what does that mean ?
Even stranger , what does it mean to multiply or divide by a degree ?
Can you have square or cubic degrees ?
Radians to the rescue !
Knowing they refer to distance traveled ( they ’re not just a ratio ! ) , we can interpret the equation this way :
x is how far you traveled along a circle
sin(x ) is how high on the circle you are
So sin(x ) / x is the ratio of how high you are to how far you ’ve gone : the amount of energy that went in an “ upward ” direction .
If you move vertically , that ratio is 100 % .
If you move horizontally , that ratio is 0 % .
When something moves a tiny amount , such as 0 to 1 degree from our perspective , it ’s basically going straight up .
If you go an even smaller amount , from 0 to .00001 degrees , it ’s really going straight up .
The distance traveled ( x ) is very close to the height ( sin( x ) ) .
As x shrinks , the ratio gets closer to 100 % — more motion is straight up .
Radians help us see , intuitively , why sin(x ) / x approaches 1 as x gets tiny .
We ’re just nudging along a tiny amount in a vertical direction .
By the way , this also explains why sin( x ) ~ x for small numbers .
Sure , you can rigorously prove this using calculus , but the radian intuition helps you understand it .
Remember , these relationships only work when measuring angles with radians .
With degrees , you ’re comparing your height on a circle ( sin(x ) ) with how far some observer tilted their head ( x degrees ) , and it gets ugly fast .
So What ’s the Point ?
Degrees have their place : in our own lives , we ’re the focal point and want to see how things affect us .
How much do I tilt my telescope , spin my snowboard , or turn my steering wheel ?
With natural laws , we ’re an observer describing the motion of others .
Radians are about them , not us .
It took me many years to realize that :
Degrees are arbitrary because they ’re based on the sun ( 365 days ~ 360 degrees ) , but they are backwards because they are from the observer ’s perspective .
Because radians are in terms of the mover , equations “ click into place ” .
Converting rotational to linear speed is easy , and ideas like sin(x ) / x make sense .
Even angles can be seen from more than one viewpoint , and understanding radians makes math and physics equations more intuitive .
Happy math .

Red agencies / districts controlled by the Taliban ; purple is de facto control ; yellow is under threat .
The Pakistani Taliban continue military operations in the tribal agencies and the settled regions of the Northwest Frontier Province despite ongoing negotiations to sign a peace agreement with the government .
Forces loyal to Baitullah Mehsud overran a town previously run by pro-government tribal forces , and beheaded 22 Pakistanis .
In Peshawar , the provincial capital , police and government officials have said the Taliban is close to taking control of the city .
Baitullah Mehsud strikes in South Waziristan
As the Pakistani government continues negotiations with Baitullah Mehsud , the South Waziristan warlord and leader of the Pakistani Taliban launched an attack on rival tribal leaders in the town of Jandola .
On Sunday , forces loyal to Baitullah took over the town during heavy fighting after attacking the home of the leader of a local peace committee in the region .
The fighting resulted in seven members of the pro-government Bhittani tribe and two Taliban fighters killed .
The Taliban then kidnapped 30 members of the Bhittani tribe .
Twenty - two were executed in a brutal fashion .
“ Some of the dead were shot and some had their throats slit , ” a district official told AFP .
“ The men ’s hands were tied behind their backs and the corpses left in a drain by a roadside , ” AFP reported .
The tribesmen have also been described as “ pro-Karzai , ” referring to Afghanistan ’s president .

The Taliban claimed the men were criminals and were executed for their crimes .
“ The men we killed were involved in thefts and robbery and had unleashed a reign of terror on the people .
They were being patronized by the government , ” Mullah Omar , the spokesman for Baitullah Mehsud told AFP .
Omar said the fate of the other eight hostages will be determined later .
He also warned the government not to intervene , “ otherwise peace talks would be seriously undermined . ”
The Pakistani government claimed the Taliban have withdrawn from Jandola and a peace committee has been formed to address the recent fighting .
Jandola is a strategic town in the area that sits at the gateway to South Waziristan .
The Pakistani military claimed to have cleared the Taliban from the town during heavy fighting in late January .
About 4,000 Pakistani troops are based near Jandola , but did not interfere during the Taliban attacks on their erstwhile allies .
The government launched operations against Baitullah Mehsud in January after his force overran a series of military outposts and forts in South Waziristan and attacks government forces and institutions in neighboring settled districts of Tank and Dera Ismail Khan .
The fighting ended after a cease - fire agreement was signed between the military and the Taliban .
Peshawar under threat
As the Taliban march in South Waziristan , Peshawar is under siege .
The spread of Taliban influence was seen last weekend , when a Taliban force kidnapped 25 Christians from a home in the heart of Peshawar .
Several of the kidnapped Christians were later reported released , but the fate of those still in captivity is still unknown .
Peshawar has seen an uptick in activity over the past month .
Five policemen have been killed since June 9 , four of them in an ambush and another in an improvised explosive device attack .
Five civilians were killed in an IED attack on June 14 .
On June 3 , the Taliban issued a warning for theater owners to shut down .
On June 9 , an Internet cafe was bombed .
The city has been described as “ a city of walls and barriers ” as security forces block roads to prevent attacks .
Government officials have openly stated that the city is under threat of a Taliban takeover .
The Interior Secretary for the Northwest Frontier Province said the Taliban are moving on Peshawar .
Peshawar ’s police chief said the Taliban will soon be in control of the entire district if steps are not taken to halt the advance .
Perhaps the most damning indictment on the Taliban ’s presence in the provincial capital comes from Peshawar ’s business leaders .
An estimated 90 percent of the materials used to supply Peshawar ’s industry have not been shipped due to the security situation , and investors are “ worried about the prevailing situation , ” according to a report in the Daily Times .
“ Businessmen have warned of shifting their enterprises to other provinces if the government did not take steps to control the law and order situation , ” the paper reported .
Government leaders have said they will not allow a Taliban takeover of Peshawar , which contains a US Consulate and serves as the headquarters of Pakistan ’s 11th Corps .
Peshawar is also a waypoint for NATO supplies into Afghanistan .
But the government also said it would press forward with negotiations in the region despite the Taliban advance .
This year , the government signed peace deals in Swat , Bajaur , Malakand , and Mohmand .
Negotiations are under way in Kohat and Mardan .
The Taliban have violated the terms of these agreements in every region where accords have been inked .

The report calls for an analysis of US interrogation techniques
The British government should not rely on US assurances that it does not use torture , a report by MPs says .
The foreign affairs select committee said the UK and US differ on their definitions of what constitutes torture and it urged the UK to check US claims .
It recommended the government carry out an " exhaustive analysis of current US interrogation techniques . "
The MPs also said the government should check claims that Britain is not used by the US for " rendition " flights .
The committee highlighted the technique of " water - boarding " - a practice which simulates drowning .
The US describes it as " a legal technique used in a specific set of circumstances " and President Bush has refused to ban it .
Given the clear differences in definition , the UK can no longer rely on US assurances that it does not use torture
Foreign Affairs Select Committee However , the UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband said it is torture and " the UK unreservedly condemns the use of torture . "
In its report , the committee said : " Given the clear differences in definition , the UK can no longer rely on US assurances that it does not use torture , and we recommend that the government does not rely on such assurances in the future . "
The MPs also challenged the government to check more actively that Britain had not been used by the Americans for so called " rendition " flights - when detainees are taken to countries where bans on torture may not apply .
The UK had repeatedly accepted assurances that it had not , but it was discovered earlier this year that two rendition planes refuelled on the British territory of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean .
The MPs stressed the UK had a " legal and moral obligation " to ensure no more of these flights landed on British territory .
A change in approach would have implications for the extradition of prisoners to the US , particularly in terror cases , as a United Nations convention bars the return of individuals to states where they are at risk of being tortured .
Human rights groups have protested about water - boarding The MPs also urged the Foreign Office to investigate allegations that the UK " outsourced " interrogation of six terror suspects to Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency , where they were tortured and interrogated by British intelligence officers .
Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch - Brown told the committee : " We absolutely deny the charge that we have in any way outsourced torture to Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) as a way of extracting information , either for court use or for use in counter - terrorism . "
Human rights campaign group Amnesty International UK said the report justified its call for an investigation into terror techniques and rendition .
The group 's head of policy Jeremy Croft said : " While we have always stressed the need to combat terrorism , we share the committee 's concerns over the UK government and its current counter - terrorism policy . "
He added : " In particular , the UK government needs to take allegations of torture at Guantanamo and other US detention centres altogether more seriously .
The committee 's conclusions amount to saying we can no longer rely on assurances from a US administration that purports to uphold the civil and political standards of behaviour
Andrew Tyrie MP
" This must mean pressing harder for proper trial or safe release of Binyam Mohamed , Shaker Aamer and Ahmed Belbacha - three Guantanamo prisoners who are either formerly resident in the UK or with links to the UK . "
Andrew Tyrie MP , the chairman of the all - party parliamentary group on extraordinary rendition , said the government must demand answers from the US .
" The committee 's conclusions amount to saying that we can no longer rely on assurances from a US administration that purports to uphold the civil and political standards of behaviour , while in fact kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be maltreated .
" Only by practising what we preach will we be able to win back the support of Muslim communities at home and abroad and build the strongest coalition around the world against terrorism . "

ACLU , EFF will challenge FISA update in court Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008
Print This Email This
As the Senate voted to endorse a Bush - administration backed plan to expand its surveillance authority and grant retroactive legal immunity to telecommunications companies that facilitated warrantless wiretapping , the American Civil Liberties Union unveiled plans to challenge the new law in court .
" This fight is not over .
We intend to challenge this bill as soon as President Bush signs it into law , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project , in a statement provided to RAW STORY as the Senate was voting .
" The bill allows the warrantless and dragnet surveillance of Americans ' international telephone and email communications .
It plainly violates the Fourth Amendment . "
After defeating three attempts to improve the update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Senate was expected to send President Bush a FISA update Wednesday .
Senators approved the FISA update on a 69 - 28 vote .
After the vote , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which is representing plaintiffs in lawsuits against the phone companies , also vowed to fight the bill in court , confirming plans outlined last week .
" We thank those senators who courageously opposed telecom immunity and vow to them , and to the American people , that the fight for accountability over the president 's illegal surveillance is not over , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl .
" Even though Congress has failed to protect the privacy of Americans and uphold the rule of law , we will not abandon our defense of liberty .
We will fight this unconstitutional grant of immunity in the courtroom and in the Congress , requesting repeal of the immunity in the next session , while seeking justice from the Judiciary .
Nor can the lawless officials who approved this massive violation of Americans ' rights rest easy , for we will file a new suit against the government and challenge warrantless wiretapping , past , present and future . "
For two and a half years , Congress has been deliberating over how to update FISA , which became law in 1978 , to account for technological advances in the last three decades .
Critics say President Bush simply ignored the law in ordering the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans ' conversations with people abroad without first getting warrants from a secret FISA court .
The bill approved Wednesday , which has already passed the House , came despite the strenuous objection of civil liberties and privacy advocates .
It legalizes much of the warrantless data - mining and surveillance Bush initially authorized , while essentially guaranteeing legal immunity to telecommunications companies that illegally facilitated the program , critics say .
Sens. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) co-sponsored an amendment to the FISA bill that would have removed the retroactive immunity provision .
It failed , as did two separate attempts to modify the immunity provision .
House Democrats , including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , tried to present the bill as a " compromise , " but Feingold , who from his seats on the Judiciary , Intelligence and Foreign Relations committees has probably seen more about the program than anyone , called it a " capitulation . "
Nonetheless , once the House passed a FISA bill that came after negotiations with the Senate and White House , it 's eventual fate became clear .
Civil liberties advocates had succeeded in delaying Wednesday 's vote as long as possible , but preparations for the next stage in the fight for oversight have been in the works for some time .

According to the Lifesworth report by insurance firm More Than , which rates living standards by the value of the possessions in your home , people in their late 20s also have it pretty good because they generally make purchases purely for themselves and do not have dependants .
The average 28 - year - old has £ 33,166 worth of high - tech gadgets , clothes and other belongings .
A group of boffins from Nottingham Uni is about to launch an entertaining short video guide to the periodic table - apparently designed to give them the chance to chuck sodium into water with unrestrained glee :
The chap with the exemplary boffin's barnet is professor Martyn Poliakoff , who told El Reg that the site should be functioning fully within the next few days and subscribers will thereafter be able to receive alerts as new elements are added to the video roster .
Since we felt obliged to add a certain amount of gravitas to this popular science initiative , we pressed the good prof as to how the team would eventually tackle ununoctium - weighing in at 118 and , with a life of just 0.9 milliseconds , hardly an inspiring subject for a cinematic profile .
He provocatively replied : " You will have to wait for Uuo as a surprise ... "
We then asked : " If while you 're working your way towards number 118 , scientists manage to brew 119 or beyond , do you think this might be an opportunity to press the STFC for extra video production cash , provided it has n't shut down all UK science research by then ? "
Professor Poliakoff diplomatically dodged that poser , but was prepared to assure us that his team 's explosive reactions expert , Pete Licence , was n't planning to do anything silly when they eventually got around to plutonium . ®

Companies in this article Mythic Entertainment
EA Mythic boss Mark Jacobs has told MMORPG.com that the Warhammer Online developer is dropping the EA from its name , and becoming Mythic Entertainment once more .
That 's what the company was called before EA bought it , and the name under which it released its previous MMO , Dark Age of Camelot .
Jacobs explained that the name change did n't indicate any change in the company 's relationship with EA , beyond the more open attitude EA has recently taken to the development studios it owns .
" I 've always been a believer of separate branding , " said Jacobs .
" I think that this is a wonderful example of how things at EA are changing .
Both John [ Riccitiello ] and Frank [ Gibeau ] have spoken multiple times about city states , more freedom , that sort of thing , and I think this is an obvious example . "

Advertisement Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has cancelled controversial tax increases on agricultural exports , which sparked months of protests .
Export levies will return to the fixed rates that existed before March , said cabinet chief Alberto Fernandez .
The Senate had narrowly rejected the government 's proposals in a vote following more than 16 hours of debate .
Farmers said the taxes would be crippling , but the government said they were needed to fight poverty .
The tax on farm exports was intended to fund the building of schools , roads and hospitals but strikes by farmers led to food shortages in some parts of the country and a political crisis .
The issue has sparked nationwide protests and food shortages
The BBC's Daniel Schweimler in Buenos Aires says that the president had little choice but to scrap the tax increases following the dramatic Senate vote on Thursday .
Senators were tied 36 to 36 after more than 16 hours of debate , until the Vice - President , Julio Cobos , cast the deciding vote to reject his government 's proposals .
Our correspondent says it is the first sign of any weakness or backwards step shown by the government , which is often criticised for its intransigence .
Argentina 's farmers are delighted by the move , our correspondent adds .
' A hungry world ' Argentina is a major producer of soya , grains and beef , which fetch high prices on international markets .
The dispute between the government and farmers began in March , when President Fernandez 's government raised taxes on soya exports from 35 % to 45 % , and imposed new taxes on other farm exports .
The government argued that they needed to raise taxes on agricultural exports to help build a new Argentina .
It said farmers could afford to pay more , as they were benefiting from high prices .
The authorities also accused farmers and their supporters of undermining democracy by refusing to respect the wishes of the elected government .
However , farmers ' leaders said that any profits needed to be reinvested so that Argentina , one of the world 's leading agricultural producers , could help to feed a hungry world .

Django back on Dreamhost ?
I just received an email from Dreamhost regarding a suggestion I had voted on :
This is just a note to let you know that the suggestion : “ Add support for Django ( a python web - development framework ) . ” from the category “ New Features ” has been marked as completed .
…
Done !
We ’ve had FastCGI support available for some time , and we ’re working on supporting Python web apps through Passenger too .
While they ’ve had FastCGI support in the past , Dreamhost ’s servers repeatedly killed long - running Django instances .
I ’d like to receive some clarification about what has changed .
Passenger is also known as mod_rails so I ’m curious to see what they have planned .
If Django support really is implemented , Dreamhost could become a really low - cost way to get a Django site on the web .
Maybe Dreamhost ’s abysmal score on Djangofriendly will improve a bit .
Some more info courtesy of Dreamhost ’s customer support :
We ’ve recently ( last month or so ) been working on changes to the process watcher script that make it less prone to killing long - running processes .
As far as software support , there ’s currently an open internal bug for installing / updating certain Python modules such as MySQLdb - hopefully that ’ll address at least some of the issues people are having with us .
I know it ’s still not perfect .
But I ’m trying to make it better . :)
And a final update , after I asked if they would be listing Django on their hosting page as a supported programming environment :
Not quite yet .
But we ’re working on some improvements ( support for WSGI through Passenger , in particular ) that will hopefully bring it up to a level where we ’re proud enough about it to specifically mention it . :)
So , the email I received about support for Django does not mean that Django is officially supported , just that Django has a better chance of running now than it did before .
Hi everyone !
We know you ’re all patiently waiting for the next PS3 firmware update , v2.40 , which includes XMB access in - game and Trophy support .
The good news is that it ’s coming soon , and you can now see how accessing the XMB from in - game will work in this video demo .
Shortly , we ’ll be posting another video here on the PlayStation .
Blog that shows the Trophy feature in action for the first time .
At that time we ’ll provide even more details on how firmware v2.40 will enhance your PLAYSTATION 3 experience .
Presented with a model of a predator bird , the fiscal shrike , chameleons colour - matched their backgrounds much more closely than with a model of a snake , see below ( Image : Devi Stuart - Fox )
The venomous Boomslang has poorer colour vision than the shrike , and so produced less vivid changes in the chameleons ’ camouflage ( Image : Devi Stuart - Fox )
Chameleons ’ mastery of camouflage goes further than anyone expected – it seems they can fine - tune their colour changes to the visual systems of specific predators .

Devi Stuart - Fox at the University of Melbourne , Australia , and colleagues studied the Smith ’s dwarf chameleon ( Bradypodion taeniabronchum ) , which lives in South Africa .
This critically endangered chameleon can alter its colour palette in milliseconds , either for camouflage or for social signalling .
The team captured eight males and eight females of the species .
They placed them on a branch and presented them with realistic models of two of their biggest predators : the fiscal shrike ( a bird that impales chameleons on thorns before eating them ) and a venomous tree snake called the boomslang .

Bird threat
Using a spectrometer , the team took readings of the colour shades and brightness of the background and the chameleon .
Then , after the chameleon had spotted the model predator and changed colour , they took another set of readings .
The chameleons colour - matched their backgrounds much more closely when presented with a bird than a snake , the team found .
However , when the team modelled the visual systems of both predators , they found that the chameleon still appeared better camouflaged to the snake than the bird , thanks to the snake ’s relatively poor colour vision .
In the presence of a snake , it seems , the chameleons just do n’t have to try as hard .
Subtle changes
The researchers noticed that the chameleons were also consistently paler , compared with their background , when presented with the tree snake .
“ This is probably because while birds usually approach from above , putting the chameleon against a dark background , snakes usually approach from below , putting it against a background of a light , bright sky , ” says Stuart - Fox .
Other animals can adjust their defensive behaviour or appearance in response to different predators .
For instance , the ground squirrel pumps more hot , infrared emitting blood into its tail when it spots an infra-red sensing rattlesnake .
But this is the first time anyone has observed an animal modifying that change to best avoid being seen .

Liability for Mr Tariq 's injuries was admitted early in his 12 - month involvement as a client of the state 's largest firm specialising in personal injury cases .
He had claimed against NRMA , the insurer of a car driven by a P - plate driver that collided with him .
On February 21 this year , the day his case settled at a conference at Keddies 's Civic Tower office in Goulburn Street , the firm charged more than $ 8000 for work on the cases of Mr Tariq , and the separate claims for nervous shock of his wife and daughter - who declined to be named .
Included in that amount were separate billings of $ 490 for a pre-conference meeting at the firm 's Redfern Office , $ 98 each for Mr Scroope 's 1.9 - kilometre journey to the southern part of the CBD , $ 490 each for the conference at which all three cases were settled , another triple $ 98 charge for the trip back to Redfern and $ 245 charged to each for a post - conference meeting held with all three present .
Mr Tariq 's wife and daughter - who did not attend the settlement conference - were also billed $ 98 each for a call Mr Tariq made to them from his own mobile phone during which they agreed to offers of $ 45,000 and $ 75,000 respectively , in settlement of their nervous shock claims .
The Tariqs have complained to the Office of the Legal Services Commissioner about overcharging .
They are determined to claw back some of the more than $ 117,000 charged in total for their legal costs and other expenses .
Keddies has been the subject of allegations from former clients , some of whom have received reimbursements totalling more than $ 500,000 after complaining formally about alleged overcharging .
The firm has repeatedly denied allegations of overcharging , stating its confidence that all complaints before the legal regulator will be dismissed .
Since a Herald investigation into claims against the firm , published last month , revealed a group of more than 25 clients had made formal complaints over the past 18 months , some have been dismissed .
During the past two weeks it is understood that more complaints have been lodged with the commission .
Mr Tariq , who told the Herald he was stressed and confused when settling his compensation claim on February 21 , admits to outbursts of emotion , frequent anger and threats of violence as part of an ongoing accident - related psychiatric condition following his brain injury and his strong medication for mood stabilisation and pain relief .
He has written to his state parliamentarian , Diane Beamer , the Attorney - General , John Hatzistergos and the shadow attorney - general , Greg Smith , about his Keddies experience .
Letters of complaint were also sent last week to the NSW Police Commissioner , Andrew Scipione , and the Law Society of NSW .
Mr Tariq now intends to apply for a Supreme Court costs assessment of the three bills for which the Keddies professional costs alone totalled more than $ 100,000 .
When the Herald asked to put some of Mr Tariq 's claims about his family 's bills to Mr Scroope , a spokesman for the firm said it would leave them to the legal regulator and costs assessor " to examine and pass judgment on with the benefit of all of the material that will be before them " .
An " extremely angry and disappointed " Mr Tariq has known Mr Scroope for more than a decade and said he had a panic attack when , after compulsory payments were deducted from his $ 400,000 gross settlement , he found that legal costs and expenses were nearly $ 86,000 ( reduced from more than $ 100,000 ) .
He agreed that they were within the range estimated in his signed costs agreement with the firm .
Keddies organised for him to take out a loan to cover his initial medical costs .
He repaid the $ 13,445.22 owed on his loan from his settlement money , but Keddies deducted $ 1200 more for treatment expenses .
Unable to work since the accident , Mr Tariq was left with just over $ 250,000 for treatment for the rest of his life .
After protesting - shirtless - outside the Keddies Lawyers Redfern office in March , he received two refunds totalling $ 11,987.62 .
Half of this amount was described on his bill as a refund from the loan company .
His daughter , on whose behalf he had complained , was also reimbursed $ 4488.61 in addition to the $ 46,000 she received net after compulsory deductions , legal costs and medical and other expenses were taken out of her $ 75,000 settlement .
Mr Tariq 's wife paid more than $ 15,000 in legal costs and expenses from her $ 45,000 total settlement .
" I am not going to stop until justice is done , " Mr Tariq said yesterday , vowing to continue his protests outside Keddies 's offices in Redfern , Ashfield and Liverpool as well as their new Wollongong and Brisbane offices .
A spokesman for Keddies said : " We have tried on many occasions to reassure Mr Tariq about various aspects of his case .
It became clear the best way to satisfy his concerns was to urge him to go to the Legal Services Commissioner - the government watchdog in these matters - to independently examine his case .
" We are pleased he has now chosen to do that and hope that process will give him comfort that his case was appropriately handled , " the spokesman said .
" Our lawyers achieved a significant compensation payout for Mr Tariq 's back , neck and brain injuries and , at the time , he told us he was delighted with the result . "

It 's that John Darwin canoe moment – when you think the unthinkable and wonder if life would be better if you ended it all for the old you and started over with a shiny new one .
Not a real death , of course .
But a phoney – staging , perhaps , your own personal Mary Celeste , with canoe or dinghy abandoned on the briny , or , like ex-minister John Stonehouse and television 's immortal Reggie Perrin , a neat little pile of clothes left on the beach with their owner nowhere to be seen .
Many are tempted , and a good few , like Mr Darwin of Seaton Carew and Panama fame , succumb .
Faking death and having a second bite at life 's cherry is a difficult area in which to give guidance , since we never , by definition , get to hear of the successful , only the failures .
But their errors and weaknesses can be our instruction manual .
And so , as a reader service , we 've combed the record for dos and don'ts so we can present Disappearing for Dummies , or How to Do a Reggie Perrin – the 1970s sitcom character who staged a suicide in order to build a new life .
Your ' death '
It can be done .
An uplifting tale of success to buoy you all up at the outset .
In 1975 , New Zealander Ivan Manson , aged 44 , with a wife and four children , never returned from a fishing trip .
His boat was found , but he was n't .
Police were sceptical .
No inquest was held .
We might never have been any the wiser had not two cars collided in Queensland , Australia , 20 years later .
One of the bodies was identified from fingerprints as Ivan Manson .
He had lived as a pillar of the local bowls club in the town of Caboolture ever since his fishing trip .
Let his example be your lodestar .

Think twice about using another body :
The days when you could stick a corpse of the right gender and approximate height in a car , crash it , soak it with fuel , set it alight , and trust the charred remains will be mistaken for you are – for better or worse – gone .
Dental records , DNA and the high price of petrol have put paid to that .
No longer is anyone likely to imitate Captain Henry Cecil Dudgeon D'Arcy of the Frontier Light Horse , who , having been awarded the VC in the Zulu wars , turned to drink .
Later , a body wearing his clothes was found in a cave and , this being the pathology of a century ago , presumed to be his .
Only many decades later was it learnt that D'Arcy had found a dead man lying in the snow , changed clothes with him , and gone to Natal , and lived out the rest of his life under an assumed name .
He was once recognised in 1925 , but swore his discoverer to the secret , which the man kept until D'Arcy died .
Do n't hang around the neighbourhood
In the early 1990s , a dinghy was found washed up on a Suffolk beach .
It belonged to Peter Cusworth , a retired hotelier and stress - management counsellor , who , it turned out , was mired in nearly £ 350,000 - worth of debts .
His " widow " Valerie then claimed on life insurance policies worth £ 200,000 , but sceptical firms did not pay out .
They were wise .
Cusworth had not died , but had started a new life as a writer called Jonathan Miles Paget Goodwin .
What was surprising was that , having gone to all that trouble , he moved away no further than Norfolk .
Sure enough , when he had a rendezvous with Mrs Cusworth at Bury St Edmunds , a policeman recognised him and the game was up .
Minimise the number of people that will go looking for you
The last thing you want when on the run under a new and unfamiliar identity is to have police , insurance assessors , creditors , or all three , on your tail .
Two examples will suffice .
In 1995 , the day before he was to go on trial for sex offences , civil servant Thomas Osmond left a note saying that he had thrown himself off the Severn Bridge .
A detective was sceptical , and , three years later , found Osmond in Bristol , living as " Stephen Williams " and working in telesales .
He got seven years .
Creditors can be equally assiduous .
In 1999 , Owen Bruce Taylor disappeared off the face of Auckland , New Zealand , leaving a wife , children , suicide note , and NZ$ 3 m in debts .
Unbeknown to them all , he went to Queenstown , 950 miles away , called himself John Bowland , got a job at a timber yard , dated the boss 's niece , and , in time , became a director of the firm .
But four years later , an employee of the detective agency hired by Taylor 's old creditors saw him in a store , and police pulled him in .
A phone call saying you 're dead is unlikely to be enough
It is remarkable how many people in trouble think that merely phoning , faxing or emailing the authorities and reporting their own death will be enough to call off the wolves .
Newcastle solicitor 's secretary Julie Thompson , for instance , faced a fraud compensation claim , and other debts .
So she posed as her sister and faxed the court to say that Julie had " regrettably passed away " , and her bereaved relatives would be distressed if any arrest warrant was issued .
The court demanded a death certificate , and that she could n't fax .
Do it with conviction
Faking your own death is not an enterprise to be lightly undertaken – nor done just to see the extent of the ensuing bereavement .
In 1998 , Mike Cilgram , described as a poultry processor , wanted to see how much he meant to his estranged wife , Julie .
So he left his clothes on the beach at Gorleston , Norfolk , placed an anonymous call to police to say he'd just seen a naked man walk into the sea .
Not surprisingly , he was soon rumbled , and his " widow " was none too impressed .
She greeted the resurrected poultry man with a request for divorce .
" There 's no guarantee he wo n't do something like this again , " she said .
In 2007 , Bosnian Amir Vehabovic went further .
He staged his death , bribed a firm of undertakers to bury an empty coffin , and hid in the cemetery 's bushes to count how many of the 45 invitees showed up .
Sadly , only his old mum came , leaving Amir to give the other 44 a piece of his mind .
" It just goes to show , " said his letter to them , " who you can really count on . "
The moral : when it comes to your " death " , have a long - term motive .

Let preparation be your watchword
Steve O'Keefe , co-author of How to Disappear Completely and Never Be Found , showed how easy it is to build a new identity .
He started making mail - order purchases in his dog's name , and always paid cash , so the hound built up a debt - free history .
Mr O'Keefe said : " The records now indicate he has one of the best personal credit ratings in all of Washington state , and that at least once a month he gets a pre-approved application for a Visa or MasterCard . "
Create a new you , not the old one with a new name
Many death - fakers are caught because their old character can't help bubbling to the surface .
Take the case of the ever - thrusting David Friedland .
He was a New Jersey state senator given a jail sentence in 1980 for his part in a $ 20 m fraud , but kept out of prison in exchange for co-operating with investigators .
Five years later , and freshly indicted for graft , he staged his death in a scuba diving " accident " in the Bahamas .
He went to the Maldives , where he became a prominent businessman , running a chain of scuba - diving shops .
But he ruffled local feathers ; officials looked into his background , alerted US police , and he was duly arrested .
As one of those who tracked him down said : " If he were capable of becoming a low - profile kind of guy , we 'd still be looking for him . "
Be smart in choosing your new identity
Do not , for instance , try to pass your new self off as your own long - lost relative .
Remember the audacious Audrey Hilley .
In 1979 , this apparently blameless Alabama widow was charged with poisoning her daughter , then 18 .
The girl survived , arsenic was found , and investigators decided to exhume the body of the late Mr Hilley , who had died suddenly , in the prime of life , four years before .
Sure enough , arsenic was found in his body .
Mrs Hilley ( who had claimed his $ 30,000 life insurance payout ) was charged , and , mysteriously , allowed out on bail .
She absconded , married a Texan , and moved with him to New Hampshire .
One day she said she was off to visit her sister in Texas .
Once there , she faked her own death , even placing an obituary in the local newspaper .
Then she went to Florida , where – 20 lb lighter , with a new set of teeth , and blond hair – she met her abandoned husband , told him she was his wife 's hitherto unmentioned twin sister Terri , and moved into his home .
Astonishingly , he was completely fooled – but one old acquaintance was n't .
She went to police , and the long life on the run of Audrey Hilley ended .
Getting away with it
Resist the temptation to have a Facebook page
The internet is a dangerous place when forging a new identity , especially if your appearance has n't changed .
Facing fraud charges , Australian company director Robert Martin faked his death in 1996 and fled to Melbourne .
He managed to live there undetected for seven years , until he was unable to resist putting his photo on a personals site .
He was recognised and arrested .
Be lucky : Even if you have a flawless plan and carry it out to perfection , you still need luck .
Colin Whelan , a Dublin computer analyst who strangled his wife , and then , while out on bail , staged his death by the familiar ruse of a car abandoned by the sea , was spotted four years later by an Irish tourist in a Mallorca bar .
And Harry Gordon , another death - faker , had the misfortune while leading what he thought was a new life , to run into his brother in New Zealand .
Do not pose for publicity pictures with Panamanian estate agents
Self - evident , but this has been ignored .
Black widow
Audrey Hilley poisoned her husband , tried to do the same to her daughter , faked her death , remarried , left her husband , then turned up again as her own twin sister .
Brotherly love
Australian Harry Gordon faked his death in 2000 and moved to Spain , England , South Africa and then New Zealand – where he had the misfortune to run into his brother .
A model of the giant helicopter proposed by Hiller Aircraft to perform midair recovery of the first stage of the Saturn 5 . ( credit : D. Day ) Monster chopper Several years ago , Aviation Week published the kind of centerfold that makes aerospace historians feel all tingly inside .
It was a two - page flowchart showing mergers in the US defense industry over the years ( yeah , I know — we aerospace historians are geeks ) .
On the left of the table , representing the 1980s , were dozens of companies , not all of them aerospace , but all representing major players in the defense industry .
They had names like Hughes Aircraft , Fairchild , Ford Aerospace , Ryan Aeronautical , and Vought Aircraft .
They flowed out as lines that gradually started to merge in the 1980s , then merged even more by the 1990s , up thru 2001 where , instead of dozens of companies , we were left with only five : General Dynamics , Boeing , Raytheon , Lockheed Martin , and Northrop Grumman .
( Project this trend out another ten years and these last five will finally merge into one single supercompany : Skynet … or God .
Either way , it wo n’t be good . )
There are a lot of interesting things about this flowchart and its simple graphical representation of the consolidation of so many once - famous companies .
But there ’s a whole other part of this legacy left off the side of the chart , all the companies that got merged — or crushed — by all of the companies that actually made it into the 1980s .
There was a time when American aerospace consisted of a huge number of airframe manufacturers , and most of their stories have been lost to the ages , virtually forgotten today , reduced to little more than photographs of their aircraft in aviation porn books .
Back in 1965 the company made a proposal so bold that it bordered on insane : a giant helicopter with a rotor diameter bigger than the length of a football field , capable not merely of transporting a Saturn 5 first stage , but of actually catching it in midair as it fell on a parachute .
One of these companies was Hiller Aircraft , a helicopter company based in Palo Alto , California , that thrived in the middle of last century , but was denied a US Army helicopter contract as a result of shady — probably illegal — actions taken by Howard Hughes .
Hughes ’ OH - 6A Cayuse — better known as the Loach — became the Army ’s standard light scout helicopter of the Vietnam War , and although Hughes lost substantial money on the Army deal , the Loaches ’ descendents proved highly successful .
Hiller ’s proposal , the OH - 5A , lost the Army contract and never succeeded as a commercial helicopter .
Hiller was absorbed into Fairchild and eventually the company faded away .
Today very few of its products remain flying , and its primary legacy is a small but history - packed museum off Route 101 in Palo Alto .
But back in 1965 the company made a proposal so bold that it bordered on insane : a giant helicopter with a rotor diameter bigger than the length of a football field , capable not merely of transporting a Saturn 5 first stage , but of actually catching it in midair as it fell on a parachute .
Strike that — it did not border on insane , it was insane .
But those were heady days in the mid-1960s , a time when NASA was getting nearly five percent of the federal budget — ten times more than today — and when the agency was doling out study contracts for everything from nuclear rockets to ion engines to 100 - man space stations .
The United States was kicking the Soviets ’ asses in space .
There was nothing we could n’t do .
So why should a small helicopter company that had never gained a major contract , or built a helicopter capable of carrying more than six people , think small ?
Of course , they never built it .
They never even got money to study it .
Their proposal , even if it had not been totally off - the - wall bonkers , came at exactly the time that NASA ’s budget was cresting its peak and about to head down , both because the agency had made its initial capital investments like the launch pad facility at Cape Canaveral , and because Lyndon Johnson needed the money for other things and his budget chief recognized ( correctly ) that there was a lot of fat in the NASA budget .
All that is left of Hiller ’s proposal is a formerly working model in the company ’s museum and the original unsolicited proposal submitted to NASA .
But man , what big imaginations that little helicopter company had .
Hiller did not call their idea a “ helicopter , ” at least not on the title page .
Instead they referred to it as a “ Rotary Wing System for Booster Recovery . ”
In their proposal , Hiller noted that there were many concepts for Saturn first stage recovery , but that these all had drawbacks , including complexity , performance penalties , landing shock damage and / or seawater contamination .
Hiller ’s helicopter “ would recover the booster in its own element ” — i.e. in air .
The helicopter could also be used as a crane or aerial transport for booster segments .
Closeup of the model of the giant helicopter proposed by Hiller Aircraft .
( credit : D. Day )
It would be a monster .
The rotor diameter would be over 120 meters ( 400 feet ) .
Empty weight would be over 200,000 kilograms ( 450,000 pounds ) , with a useful load of nearly 250,000 kilograms ( 550,000 pounds ) — for a gross weight of a whopping 453,000 kilograms ( 1,000,000 pounds ) .
According to the proposal , the helicopter would depart from the missile launching area or another suitable base with internal and external fuel tanks ( imagine the drop tanks it could carry ! ) and depart for the booster reentry area .
The plan was for the helicopter to be capable of loitering in the recovery area for up to six hours , flying at an altitude of 4,500 – 6,000 meters ( 15,000 – 20,000 feet ) .
Upon sighting the booster , the helicopter would head for it and intercept it at approximately 3,000 meters ( 10,000 feet ) .
The S - 1C ’s parachute system would be descending along a glide path with more forward than downward velocity .
The helicopter would align with the glide path and approach from behind and above , descending to match trajectories with the booster .
It would snag the pickup chute with a grappling hook suspended from the helicopter ’s center of gravity and gradually assume the weight of the booster .
The parachutes would be deflated and the booster suspended about 215 meters ( 700 feet ) below the helicopter .
We do n’t know how NASA responded to this idea .
They certainly did n’t fund it .
The helicopter would then reel - in the booster , rotating it to a horizontal position and snugging it up underneath the helicopter — and then returning it to the launch area or some other destination on land .
Of course , the S - 1C stage would fall over 650 kilometers ( 350 nautical miles ) from the launch site .
How feasible was it for the world ’s largest helicopter , carrying the world ’s largest rocket , to fly this distance back home ?
What about wind ?
Although Hiller ’s proposal did not say so , a far better solution would have been for the helicopter to set the stage down on a ship near the recovery area .
Of course , it would have to be a big ship , like an aircraft carrier , or a barge .
But nothing would be small with this concept .
An illustration of how the helicopter would recover the booster stages in midair .
( credit : D. Day )
Oh , and did we mention that this would not be any old helicopter ?
No , it would utilize a concept that Hiller had worked on for years and tried unsuccessfully to sell to the Army : the rotor - tip - powered lifting system .
This involved putting a jet engine , or more likely two jet engines , on the tip of each of the three rotors — six jet engines in all , plus a seventh in the rear fuselage to power the tail rotor .
The rotors would not have to turn very fast by helicopter standards , only about once per second .
But even that would result in the advancing rotor tip approaching the speed of sound .
Not only would it be big , it would be noisy .
A mighty roar from a mighty monster chopper .
We do n’t know how NASA responded to this idea .
They certainly did n’t fund it .
They possibly laughed themselves silly and then went back to work , producing their own space geek porn that never got built .
Those were the days .
People knew how to dream big .

The next stage of the mortgage debacle is only starting to rear its ugly head and all early signs tell us that this is going to be even worse than the subprime mortgage collapse .
We need to remember that the subprime mortgage debacle was only one facet of a global debt boom that has taken a stranglehold over the industrialized world .
The United Kingdom is now starting to realize that even they are going to face a housing meltdown .
Yet there is still a perception out there from pundits and those in the media that this housing meltdown was caused purely by subprime loans , which could not be anything further from the truth .
Many understand that this is a debt bubble and not only a collapse fueled by the subprime market in which low - income people bought overpriced homes .
That in fact is a big player in this mess but many who once thought they were “ prime ” are going to be realizing there is nothing prime about them .
Welcome to the even uglier side of things which is only in stage one at the moment .
We now enter the Pay Option ARM debacle :
The most ominous sign of the above chart is the following :
-$ 500 Billion in total Pay Option ARMs outstanding in the U.S .
- 60 Percent of these issued to folks in California
The Pay Option ARM is one of the most poorly construed mortgage product ever to face this planet .
It was a pathetic attempt to allow a larger majority of Americans to have a piece of the great American credit ponzi scheme .
Many of these loans give you the following pay options on a mortgage :
– Fully Amortizing 30 - year payment – you pay both principal and interest on a 30 - year schedule
– Fully Amortizing 15 - Year Payment – you pay both principal and interest on a 15 - year schedule
– Interest - Only payment – covers only the interest portion of the mortgage and does not pay down principal
- Minimum Payment – the most widely picked option in which your payment is set for 12 months at an introductory rate ( remember those absurd intro rates ? ) .
After that , payment changes are made annually and a payment cap limits how much it can increase or decrease each year .
Just to show you how financially destructive these mortgage products will be let us look at a $ 500,000 loan with a teaser 1.25 % intro rate :
* Source : http://mortgage-x.com
The loan if it were to be paid in 30 - years carries a $ 3,010 monthly principal and interest payment while the intro teaser rate only required the owner to pay $ 1,666 per month deferring a large amount of the payment to a later date .
You may be wondering , “ well I ’m sure only a handful of people opted to pay the minimum payment right ? ”
Wrong .
“ ( Businessweek 2006 ) Now the signs of excess are crystal clear .
Up to 80 % of all option ARM borrowers make only the minimum payment each month , according to Fitch Ratings .
The rest of the money gets added to the balance of the mortgage , a situation known as negative amortization .
And once balances grow to a certain amount , the loans automatically reset at far higher payments .
Most of these borrowers are n’t paying down their loans ; they ’re underpaying them up .
Yet the banking system has insulated itself reasonably well from the thousands of personal catastrophes to come .
For one thing , banks can sell some of their option ARMs off to Wall Street , where they ’re packaged with other , better loans and re-sold in chunks to investors .
Some $ 182 billion of the option ARMs written in 2004 and 2005 and an additional $ 83 billion this year have been sold , repackaged , rated by debt - rating agencies , and marketed to investors as mortgage - backed securities , says Bear , Stearns & Co. ( BSC ) Banks also sell an unknown amount of them directly to hedge funds and other big investors with appetites for risk .
The rest of the option ARMs remain on lenders ’ books , where for now they ’re generating huge phantom profits for some lenders .
That ’s because , according to generally accepted accounting principles , or GAAP , banks can count as revenue the highest amount of an option ARM payment — the so - called fully amortized amount — even when borrowers make only the minimum payment .
In other words , banks can claim future revenue now , inflating earnings per share . ”
And for those of you who say we did n’t see this coming , that paragraph was pulled from a Businessweek article in 2006 title “ nightmare mortgages . ”
Of course , Wall Street is no longer buying this crap so that $ 500 billion is going to implode and no one is going to stop it .
Also , you need to remember that 60 percent of that mortgage portfolio of Pay Option ARMs is here in sunny California making us confront a $ 300 billion time bomb .
80 % only made the minimum payment on these toxic waste products .
I ’ll draw your attention once again to that new chart recently released by Businessweek .
What you ’ll notice is that the gray bars are a better indicator of how quickly we will face this implosion since only a small minority were actually paying either the interest only or the 30 - year options .
California as a state is now down 30 percent in one - year and many niche markets are going to face 40 or even 50 percent drops .
This will prove to be a bigger hit on the California housing market as we will see in the upcoming months .
Many of these mortgages now have larger balances !
That is the absurdity of these mortgage products .
If you really think about it , the minimum payment will actually increase the underlying amount you owe almost assuming your home will appreciate in the Wonderland reality of many homeowners and lenders .
Now we have a somewhat cruel fate in which California median prices are crashing while many of these option ARM products have been slowly growing in the past few years .
That is why lenders such as WaMu , Wachovia , and Countrywide who specialized in these toxic waste products are down by :
WM : down 84 % from 6/14/2007
CFC : down 87 % from 6/14/2007
WB : down 65 % from 6/14/2007
Why do you think these companies are down so much ?
Aside from the subprime collapse they have seen nothing in regards to the option ARM debacle that is squarely facing them .
$ 300 billion in mortgages alone in California that are worth so much less !
Let us assume that these products are now only worth half of that $ 300 billion .
That means California alone , not even counting the other $ 200 billion out there is going to hurt many direct lenders or Wall Street firms via writedowns by $ 150 billion with an almost guarantee given the 30 percent market decline .
Let us do a quick market cap calculation of these 3 sample companies :
Marketcap as of 6/14/2008 :
WM : $ 7.02 billion
CFC : $ 2.82 billion
WB : $ 38.89 billion
Total : $ 48.73 billion
Bwahaha !
There combined marketcap is only about a third of the losses of pay Option ARMs which one state ( California ) will be facing !
What if we factor that other $ 200 billion which undoubtedly will be facing losses as well given the nationwide scope of this housing debacle ?
Of course there are other lenders out there who dished out these toxic products but the above 3 were major players .
Now you know why these institutions are off by ridiculous amounts .
If you simply do the basic accounting and take the pulse of the market , you know that this has the potential of flooding lenders with a stream of losses for a few more years or until they go under .
Take a look at the distress numbers for California last month :
May 2008 :
NODs : 41,965
NTS : 9,728
REOs : 20,237
Total for California : 71,930
Nationwide total : 261,255
California makes up 27.5 % of all foreclosure filings in May of 2008 .
Just to give you an idea how bad things are getting in California let us look at the stats for May of 2006 :
May 2006 :
NODs : 7,794
NTS : 804
REOs : 138
Total for California : 8,736
Nationwide total : 92,746
* Source : Realtytrac
So only two years ago , California made up 9.4 % of all nationwide foreclosure filings and now we stand at 27.5 % .
This is how quickly things are coming apart at the seams and we have n’t even seen the first peak of option ARM recasts which should occur in October through December of this year .
If you do n’t think that $ 500 billion is a lot just wait until this summer selling season falls flat on its face for California .
Fall and winter are going to be brutal .
Many of these owners are going to be highly tempted to moonwalk away from their mortgages .
Does Bank of American really want to assume this option ARM time bomb ?
They are scheduled to close their deal with Countrywide sometime in the third quarter yet I simply do not see how they avoid astronomical losses on the current mortgage portfolios and REO properties .
Unless California suddenly goes into another bubble and prices start going up , we are in for a tough few years and the current California multi-billion dollar budget short fall is n’t pretty either .
Keep in mind the California budget which has now been revised to a $ 17 billion short fall is going to force us to make some hard decisions .
Either raise taxes to plug budget gaps or cut spending ( aka jobs ) and only increase the unemployment numbers and thus depress the economy further .
No matter how you slice it , California housing is going lower and pay Option ARMs will be the next crisis that will send the credit markets stumbling .
You can bank on that .

Disabled group members arrested at McCain 's office RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday April 30 , 2008

At least 20 disabled activists , most of them in wheelchairs , were arrested outside Sen .
John McCain 's offices Tuesday after being refused a meeting with the GOP presidential nominee - to - be over a bill to expand Medicaid coverage to more people who want in - home care .
" If he should be president , it would be ironic that he comes from a party that talks a lot about family values , " said Bob Kafka , national organizer for ADAPT , a group advocating for passage of the bill .
Without the legislation , many disabled and elderly people do n't have the choice to apply coverage to anything other than institutional care , he said .
" Families are devastated because they do n't have a choice to keep people at home , " Kafka said .
McCain was not in his office during the protest .
He was campaigning Tuesday in Florida on his health care plan .
The bill , stuck in committee since last year , would amend the Social Security
Act to allow people who are eligible for Medicaid coverage of nursing home costs to spend it instead on home - based , or community care .
Sponsored by Sens. Tom Harkin , D - Iowa , and Arlen Specter , R - Pa. , it also would grant extra money to states that participate in the program , according to a summary of the bill .
Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois , rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination , are co-sponsors of the bill , but McCain is not .
Capitol Police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider said about 20 people from the group were arrested outside McCain 's office in the Russell Senate Office Building on Tuesday and charged with unlawful assembly .
McCain 's Senate chief of staff said the protesters turned down an offer to meet immediately with McCain 's aides .
Mark Busey said he did n't know McCain 's position on the legislation but would ask .
The chances are slim , however , that the senator himself would be meeting with members of the group .
" We are more than happy to let them know when he will be back in the Washington area at public events , town halls and the like , " Busey said in a telephone interview .
" Right now we do not know when he 's going to be here for a meeting . "
According to blogger Disabled Politico , " U.S. Capitol Hill Police quickly arrived in mass , but seemed confused about what to do about the protest .
According to one officer on the scene , Congressional office takeovers are a rarity , and occur approximately once a year .
For close to an hour , the activists , the police , and Senator McCains staff attempted to broker a resolution that would satisfy all parties at hand . "
Excerpts from Roll Call article :
The protest is one in a series ADAPT has sponsored over the years in support of legislation that would shift federal money to community - based disability assistance and away from nursing homes and other institutions .
The group held a similar protest at the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday .
Medicaid currently pays for long - term care in nursing homes and other institutions but does not pay for the same services provided at an individuals home .
ADAPT and other disability activists argue that this institutional bias essentially forces people with disabilities to move into such facilities .
The Community Choice
Act would allow Medicaid dollars to flow to community - based care options , but the bill has yet to be considered on the floor in either chamber .
Variations of the legislation have been introduced since the late 1990s but have stalled over cost estimates suggesting the bill could cost tens of billions of dollars annually .
Disability advocates believe these estimates are wildly overstated , and supporters are working with the Congressional Budget Office to get a new , more realistic cost estimate for the bill before moving it to a vote in either chamber , according to Democratic staffers .
The following video posted at YouTube is said to show how " a deaf ADAPT protester was taken to the ground outside of John McCain 's office when she did n't respond to instructions for Capitol Hill Police . " ( with wire reports )

The TV rabbit preaching hatred and telling young Muslims to ' kill and eat Jews '
An Islamic TV station using a Bugs Bunny lookalike to preach hatred to children has been slammed by religious leaders in the UK who fear it could brainwash vulnerable British children .
Assud the rabbit , who vows to ' kill and eat Jews ' and glorifies the maiming of ' infidels ' appears on Palestinian children 's show , Tomorrow 's Pioneers .
The rabbit is a number of characters who is punished by viewer 's vote when he breaches Sharia law .
In one episode , Assud admits stealing money and is seen begging for mercy after young viewers and parents phone in demanding his hands are cut off as punishment .
Assud the rabbit is threatened with punishment for stealing on Palestinian children 's show Tomorrow 's Pioneers
At that point the 11 - year - old presenter intervenes - and rules that the bunny should only have his ears severed because he has repented .
The rabbit is played by an actor in fancy dress and is one of the main characters on the show broadcast in Gaza by the al - Aqsa channel - known as Hamas TV .
Religious leaders across the UK have today spoken out against the controversial show which can be viewed via satellite .
The programme is also easily viewed on internet sites such as YouTube , sparking fears that British children could be subjected to the radical Islamic message .
The Association of Muslim Schools , which represents the UK's 143 Muslim schools , said it was opposed to any shows that incite violence .
Spokesman Dr Mohamed Mukadam said : ' It goes without saying that any programme which promotes the killing or injuring of human beings is wrong .
Assud encourages children to ' eat and kill Jews ' and preaches hatred
' Regardless of religion , shows that incite or inspire others to inflict violence of any kind should be condemned .
' Such shows are against the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad , and we would urge people of all ages not to watch them . '
Set up as a regional station prior to the Palestinian elections in January 2006 , al - Aqsa TV now airs on a satellite slot .
It broadcasts what many call a mixture of news of Islamic propaganda , but has picked up a substantial following across the Arabic - speaking world .
Tomorrow 's Pioneers was first aired in April 2007 , and features young host Saraa Barhoum and her co-host , a large costumed animal .
The show originally featured a Mickey Mouse - style character called Farfur who urged children to fight against the Jewish community and form a world Islamic state .
Farfur was later replaced by a bumble bee called Nahoul , who told viewers to ' follow the path of Islam , of martyrdom and of the Mujahideen ' .
He was ' martyred ' earlier this year and replaced by Assud , who tells children in his first episode : 'I , Assud , will get rid of the jews , Allah willing , and I will eat them up . '
UK religious leaders fear young British children could be subjected to the rabbit's hate teachings
In a discussion with 11 - year - old host Saraa Barhoum , the young viewers are referred to as ' soldiers ' .
Assud asks Saraa : ' We are all martyrdom - seekers , are we not ? '.
To which she replies : ' Yes , we are all ready to sacrifice ourselves for the sake of our homeland . '
The phone - in show accepts calls from children as young as nine on topics about life in Palestine .
During one show broadcast in February , Assud vows to kill and eat all Danish people over the cartoon images of the Prophet Muhammad which appeared in a newspaper .
He also pledges to assassinate the illustrator and Saraa also agrees that she would martyr herself for the cause of Palestine .
Saraa , who has seven brothers and sisters , was invited to host the show after entering a singing competition .
But speaking last year , she defended the programme - and insisted it was not responsible for spreading extremism .
She said : ' We are not terrorists .
We do not support terrorism .
We are normal people , but we are defending our homeland .
' The Israelis hit next door to my house with a shell .
I was wounded on my feet and my little brother Youssef was wounded in the legs .
' We , as Muslims , are against suicide bombers .
We are against the death of civilians on all sides .
We are only the enemy of those who took our land and kill us every day . '
The show is regularly translated and posted online by The Middle East Media Research Institute , an independent media monitoring group based in the United States .
Al - Aqsa was today was unavailable for comment .
Judge in hot water over Web site sex photos SAN FRANCISCO
He 's presiding over L.A. obscenity case
** FILE ** Judge Alex Kozinski , of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , gestures as Chief Judge Mary Schroeder looks on , in this Sept. 22 , 2003 , file photo in San Francisco .
Kozinski , who is currently overseeing a trial in which Los Angeles businessman Ira Isaacs is accused of breaking U.S. obscenity laws , posted sexually explicit photos and videos on his own web site that he maintained is now blocked to the public , the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday June , 11 , 2008 , on its Web site .

The new chief judge of the federal appeals court in San Francisco dabbles as a paintball warrior , computer gamer and scuba diver .
A political conservative and free - speech libertarian , he led a successful campaign in 2001 to stop court officials in Washington , D.C. , from monitoring the Internet use of federal judges and court employees .
On Wednesday , Judge Alex Kozinski was on the hot seat after the Los Angeles Times disclosed that a Web site of his contained numerous sexual photos and videos - showing nudity and bestiality - while he was preparing to preside over an obscenity trial in Los Angeles .
Kozinski has now blocked public access to the site .
He told lawyers that he would consider any request they made to remove him from the case .
After the first day of trial Wednesday , the case was put on hold until next week while the U.S. Justice Department decides whether to ask him to step down .
Kozinski said in an interview with The Chronicle on Wednesday that he had n't paid much attention to the content of the Web site and had n't known its existence would be disclosed when he began questioning prospective jurors earlier in the week .
' Could have walked away '
" If I 'd known while we were selecting a jury , I could have walked away , " he said .
Kozinski , 57 , was appointed to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by President Ronald Reagan in 1985 .
At the time , he was the nation 's youngest federal appellate judge .
His first prominent opinion stamped him as a judicial maverick - a dissent arguing that a local athletic organization should have the right to call its contests the Gay Olympics .
He rose through seniority to the position of chief judge on Dec. 1 ; the term runs seven years .
Kozinski is known for an offbeat writing style , scattering the titles of more than 200 movies in a ruling on a cinema antitrust case , and ending one opinion with the advice that " the parties should chill . "
When the U.S. Judicial Conference proposed in 2001 to operate software that would detect " inappropriate " computer use by court employees , including judges , Kozinski was the most vocal opponent .
" To say - just because the computer is owned by your employer - that you have no private space in it is going in the wrong direction , " he said of the plan , which was soon abandoned .
" He is irreverent across the board , " said Vikram Amar , a UC Davis law professor .
" He does n't take anything , including himself , too seriously . "
Questionable images
In its article Wednesday , the Times said Kozinski's Web site contained material that included a video of a half - naked man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal and a photo of naked women on all fours painted to look like cows , along with images of masturbation and contortionist sex .
Kozinski said he would delete some of the material , including the photo of the women as cows , which he called degrading .
He told The Chronicle that he and his family have had the Web site since 2002 and used it to store a variety of material , including family photos , articles and other pictures .
Until recently , he said , he had believed it was a private site that outsiders could see only with his permission .
" I do n't pay much attention to what 's on there , " Kozinski said .
" There 's lots of stuff I see ( on the site ) and I do n't remember .
I have n't gone through and looked at it .
Some of it , I should have .
... I had no intention of making these files public . "
He said one of his sons called him after the newspaper article appeared and told him he had uploaded some of the sexually explicit images .
" Judges have a private life , " Kozinski said .
" We just need to be a little more careful to keep it private .
Sometimes it 's hard to know where to draw the line . "
Random assignment
In the Los Angeles trial , Ira Isaacs is charged with selling videos showing sexual fetishes , including bestiality , that violate obscenity laws .
Kozinski was randomly assigned to the case under a program that allows appeals court judges to preside over occasional trials .
Jean Rosenbluth , a law professor at the University of Southern California and a former federal prosecutor , said Kozinski should probably step down from the case if the prosecutor requests it .
" Justice is concerned not just with actual conflicts but with the appearance of impartiality , " Rosenbluth said .
Longtime court commentator Gerald Uelmen , a law professor at Santa Clara University , said the episode raises " a question of judgment " but does n't appear to be grounds for removal from the case .
Amar had a similar assessment .
" There 's lots of stuff that 's embarrassing to each of us , that we would n't want the public to know , " he said .
" Maybe this was an indiscretion in judgment ... but I do n't see how that bears on his fitness to handle cases that involve that kind of subject matter . "
He said it 's also likely to remind Kozinski that " as chief judge ... what he does is going to be more public . "

He says we have been visited , and that UFOs have been covered up by the government for a long time .
The host almost has a stroke during the interview he 's so shocked .
Edgar says it is a real phenomena .
He says he 's been inside military circles and they know we 've been visited and talk about it behind closed doors .
He says he 's been involved in certain research committees and knows people who know the real story .
There is quite a bit of contact going on .
The Roswell crash was real .
Does n't know if Disclosure will be this year or not ... Public acceptance is increasing .
Not all UFOs are of ET origin .
Some are home - grown .
But some are ET crafts .
He 's not concerned about his safety talking about it openly anymore .
Alien intent is not hostile .
Some others involved in the Moon landing also know the truth .
The host made the point that this is the first time Edgar has stated so clearly that ET life exists and UFOs are real .
He 's hinted at it , but this is the first time ever ... To me this is ground breaking .
I really respect Edgar .
PS - Nick Pope is on next !!![ edit on 22-7-2008 by ufo reality ]
ZURICH ( Reuters ) - Switzerland will hold a referendum on whether to ban building any more minarets in the Alpine country , the government said on Tuesday .
A group of politicians from the Swiss People ’s Party ( SVP ) and Federal Democratic Union gathered more than 100,000 signatures to support the initiative , saying the minarets threaten law and order .
Switzerland has two minarets , in Zurich and Geneva , which would be unaffected by the vote .
Neither issues a Moslem call to prayer .
“ The Federal Chancellery checks of the signature list showed that of the total 114,137 signatures turned in , 113,540 are valid , ” the government said in a statement .
The proposal has to be discussed by parliament before being put to a popular vote and the process could take several years .
The SVP previously ran an anti-immigration campaign featuring three white sheep kicking a black sheep off a Swiss flag .
The campaign was condemned as racist by rights groups and the United Nations .
Swiss voters recently rejected another SVP proposal which would have made it more difficult for foreigners to secure citizenship , a campaign which included posters of yellow and black hands grabbing at Swiss passports .
Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy - Rey has said a minaret ban would threaten security , and the country ’s seven - member ruling council said this month it would “ naturally be recommending that parliament and the electorate vote against the initiative . ”
The SVP ’s populist program focuses on tackling crime , forcing cuts in public spending and keeping Switzerland out of the European Union .
It has proven highly popular with Swiss voters in recent years and helped the party secure around 29 percent of the vote in last year ’s national election .
Despite warnings , and the potentially harmful effects of their actions , believers are allegedly still flocking to a hotelier 's house in Erumeli near where the divine image is said to have appeared .
Two settlers are suspected of having given a false report of their own kidnapping , resulting in the launching of a large - scale manhunt that included the participation of IDF , police and Shin Bet forces .
The two men began by entering the village of Ein Abus near Nablus .
At around 4:00 am they called in a report and alleged that they were bound and trapped inside a car .
IDF troops carrying out an arrest operating in Nablus were dispatched to the neighboring village and located the two settlers , though they were found to be unrestrained .
When confronted by the soldiers , the settlers fabricated yet another story – they reported that there had been a third member of their party and that he had been abducted by the Palestinians .
At this point reinforcement troops were summoned .
An hour and a half into the search , the two finally confessed to have made up the claims .
The IDF handed the two over to the Ariel police and filed a formal complaint against them .
The army views the incident with grave severity , particularly in light of the efforts and funds invested in the launching the search .
" This is a very serious incident , " military officials told Ynet .
" By entering a Palestinian village in such an irresponsible manner and falsifying that report – they not only risked their own lives but also put the troops in harm 's way , troopers that would otherwise have been operating against terrorists . "
TRAVERSE CITY , Mich .  General Motors said Thursday that it had “ essentially finished ” designing its first plug - in hybrid car , the Chevrolet Volt , and would have production - ready prototypes within 10 days .
The automaker still has considerable work to do on the car ’s lithium - ion battery and other technology in the two years before the Volt is scheduled to go on sale , but completing the design is a milestone for what is arguably the most crucial car in decades for G.M .
The Volt would be able to travel at least 40 miles on battery power alone , G.M. said .
The battery is recharged by plugging a cord into a household outlet .
Bob Boniface , the director of design for the Volt , showed sketches of the car and photos of its front and rear corners at an industry conference in northern Michigan .
He said G.M. had made the Volt more aerodynamic and attractive since displaying it as a concept car at the Detroit auto show in January 2007 .
The GM mosquitoes could be identified by their green fluorescent eyes
Enlarge Image
It gives new impetus to one strategy for controlling the disease : introduce the GM insects into wild populations in the hope that they will take over .
The insect carries a gene that prevents infection by the malaria parasite .
Details of the work by a US team appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
The researchers caution that their studies are still at an early stage , and that it could be 10 years or more before engineered insects are released into the environment .
" What we did was a laboratory , proof - of - principle experiment ; we 're not anywhere close to releasing them into the wild right now , " co-author Dr Jason Rasgon from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Maryland , told BBC News .
The approach exploits the fact that the health of infected mosquitoes is itself compromised by the parasite they spread .
Insects that cannot be invaded by the parasite are therefore likely to be fitter and out - compete their disease - carrying counterparts .
' Fitness advantage '
In the team 's experiments , equal numbers of genetically modified and ordinary " wild - type " mosquitoes were allowed to feed on malaria - infected mice .
As they reproduced , more of the GM , or transgenic , mosquitoes survived .
After nine generations , 70 % of the insects belonged to the malaria - resistant strain .
The scientists also inserted the gene for green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) into the transgenic mosquitoes which made their eyes glow green .
This helped the researchers to easily count the transgenic and non-transgenic insects .
Lead author Dr Mauro Marrelli and his colleagues wrote in PNAS : " To our knowledge , no - one has previously reported a demonstration that transgenic mosquitoes can exhibit a fitness advantage over non-transgenics . "
The modified mosquitoes had a higher survival rate and laid more eggs .
However , when both sets of insects were fed non-infected blood they competed equally well .
Global problem
For resistant mosquitoes to be useful in the wild , they must survive better than non-resistant mosquitoes even when not exposed to malaria .
Even so , the researchers concluded : " The results have important implications for implementation of malaria control by means of genetic modification of mosquitoes . "
GM mosquitoes that interfered with development of the malaria parasite would make it more difficult for the organism to become re-established after it had been eradicated from a target area , they said .
Malaria , spread by the single - celled parasite Plasmodium , is endemic in parts of Asia , Africa , and central and south America .
The organism is passed to humans through the bite of the Anopheles mosquito .
Each year it makes 300 million people ill and causes a million deaths worldwide .
Some 90 % of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa , where a child dies of malaria every 30 seconds .
Ethical issues
Dr Rasgon stressed that one area the team needed to look at further was the type of malaria used in the experiments .
The mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei , which is specific to rodents .
There was a big difference , he said , between this parasite and the species that blight humans ; and the technique would have to be demonstrated in those organisms as well .
" I think it will be 10 to 20 years before transgenic mosquitoes are released into nature .
It 's very difficult to predict what will happen when we release these things , " he added .
" There is quite a lot of research that needs to be done , both in terms of genetics and the ecology of the mosquitoes ; and also research to address all the social , ethical and legal issues associated with releasing transgenic organisms into the environment . "
Commenting on the study , Professor Chris Curtis from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , UK , said many strategies would be needed to combat malaria effectively .
Even if GM mosquitoes were shown to be effective in the first instance , it was always possible that the parasite would evolve to limit that success , he explained .
" There will obviously be strong selection pressure on the malaria parasite to do that ; and that 's a problem with anti-malaria drugs and insecticides .
We have to keep working to produce new tricks to try to keep ahead of what the parasite will try to do , " he told BBC News .
He said his work in Tanzania had shown bednets laced with insecticide were very effective in combating infections .

I n his new book , The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder ( Vanguard Press , 2008 ) , Vincent Bugliosi , the man who successfully prosecuted Charles Manson for murder , argues convincingly that President George W. Bush 's conduct in taking the U.S. military to war against Iraq under false pretenses in March of 2003 qualifies him to be prosecuted for murder in any state in the nation .
The victims in the case would be all the soldiers from that state that were killed in the war against Iraq .
He lays out his case in a devastatingly logical and methodical manner , weaving together all the relevant facts to paint the definitive portrait of just how reckless and criminal was the behavior of President Bush in his push for war against Saddam Hussein 's Iraq .
Famous for his true crime books , such as the book about Charles Manson that launched his literary career , Helter Skelter , Bugliosi shows us that he is still in fine form .
The legal definition of murder , as Bugliosi tells us , is " the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought . "
Under the law , for there to be a true crime committed the two elements of a prohibited act ( actus reus ) and criminal intent ( mens rea ) must coexist in time .
According to Bugliosi 's legal argument , Bush 's act in this case would be his sending U.S. troops to Iraq , resulting in the death of some 4,000 of them .
The criminal intent that would need to be shown , malice aforethought , could be proven by demonstrating that Bush took them to war with " reckless and wanton disregard for the consequences and indifference to human life . "
The only legal defense that could be mounted against charges like this would be that Bush acted in defense of the nation .
In order to prove that Bush did not act in defense of the nation in starting the war , knowing all too well that Saddam Hussein was no threat to this country , and had no role in the attacks of 9/11 , Bugliosi takes us on a painful walk down memory lane .
He points out that one of the first references to Iraq made by the Bush administration after 9/11 was made on October 15 , 2001 , by then Secretary of State Colin Powell when he told the press " Iraq is Iraq , a wasted society for 10 years .
They 're sad .
They 're contained ... "
If that were the case , how were they supposed to be a threat to the world 's strongest military power ?
Bugliosi calls our attention to the fact that after Bush had started talking about the possibility of war with Iraq he said that his decision will be based on the " latest intelligence . "
What he never said , of course , is that on October 1 , 2002 , the classified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate issued by the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies said that Saddam Hussein was NOT an imminent threat to the U.S.
Not long after that , on the afternoon of October 7 , 2002 , then CIA director George Tenet delivered a letter to Senator Bob Graham ( D - Florida ) , Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , saying " Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW ( chemical or biological weapons ) against the United States . "
That evening Bush delivers a speech to the nation at the Museum Center in Cincinnati , Ohio in which he called Saddam Hussein a " great danger to our nation . "
Then there is the infamous reference to Saddam Hussein 's supposed quest for uranium in Africa in the President 's 2003 State of the Union speech , which was based on documents which were believed to be forgeries by U. S. intelligence agencies .
In October of 2002 George Tenet told Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley that the president " should not be a fact witness on this issue " and the reporting on it was " weak . "
However , for many , the conclusive evidence that Bush knew Saddam Hussein was no threat to this country , therefore an attack on Iraq was unjustified , will be the memo which has come to be known simply as the " Downing Street Memo . "
This was written by Matthew Rycroft , a foreign policy aide to British Prime Minister Tony Blair , on July 23 , 2002 , about high - level meetings he had with Bush Administration officials .
This memo contained the statement that " Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD .
But the intelligence and the facts were being fixed around the policy . "
In addition to providing us with the legal rationale and possible jurisdiction for such a prosecution of the President , Bugliosi also provides examples of how monstrously callous Bush has been since the war began in March of 2003 .
He provides several pages of photographs of scenes of carnage from Iraq juxtaposed with pictures of a grinning , clowning President Bush , having the time of his life .
He also provides several quotes from President Bush made during a variety of stages in the war showing that the President was more concerned about going running , fishing or to a ball game than about the thousands killed in the war that he started .
As Bush said in a press conference on December 4 , 2007 he 's been feeling " pretty good about life . "
In the Acknowledgments section of the book Bugliosi provides a valuable insight into the world of book publishing when he claims that many people at the largest publishing houses in the country told him that although they agreed with the conclusions in the book , and thought that the book would make money , they wanted to have nothing to do with it out of fear .
It was , they said , " too hot to handle . "
In fact two liberal law professors of his acquaintance were scared to even look at the book !
Bugliosi claims that this is all due to the climate of fear created by the current right wing in America , which brands anyone who believes George Bush 's actions to be criminal as a " pro-terrorist , " " anti-American " sufferer of " Bush Derangement Syndrome . "
One is hard - pressed to disagree with him .
In a political environment where impeachment of President Bush is " off the table , " those who wish to bring the man to justice may have to look to the courts , but the question is , of course , who would step up and prosecute him ?
There are not too many prosecutors today who posses Vincent Bugliosi 's passion for justice rather than a passion for high conviction rates and career advancement .
Even if no charges are ever actually filed against Bush , at least The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder stands as an historical record of one more American President 's mendacity on the issues of war and peace .

DOE ’s Argonne National Laboratory will work with Test Site Sweden to demonstrate plug - in technologies , support research and development ( R&D ) , as well as share operational and consumer data and solutions to potential vehicle - to - grid .
Over the next year , the following activities will take place under the MOU :
The US Department of Energy ( DOE ) and the Swedish Energy Agency ( SEA ) signed a memorandum of understanding ( MOU ) to collaborate on accelerating consumer acceptance and commercialization of plug - in hybrid electric vehicles ( PHEVs ) .
The MOU outlines a one year , US $ 1 million cost - sharing arrangement that will be equally funded by DOE and the Swedish Energy Agency .
Proof of concepts to support PHEV development and introduction , e.g. , vehicle instrumentation , vehicle - to - grid / home hardware and smart charging systems ;
Tracking and evaluating customer behavior in field operational testing ;
Quantification of national , utility , and customer benefits ; and ,
Planning and deployment of convenient public charging stations .
Argonne , which is the US ’ lead lab for the simulation , validation and laboratory evaluation of PHEVs and PHEV technologies , has developed a new tool for the analysis and evaluation of plug - in hybrid vehicle performance : the Argonne Real - Time Data Acquisition ( ARDAQ ) system .
ARDAQ provides onboard data collection and diagnostics of PHEVs .
ARDAQ is based on Controller Area Network ( CAN ) information collected on two separate CANs .
CAN technology lets microcontrollers and other devices communicate without a host computer .
ARDAQ then uses the global positioning system and other sensors to simultaneously collect moment - by - moment data on a package of 25 vehicle - performance measures , including driving and engine speed ; fuel flow , use and economy ; hybrid battery current ; frequency of battery charge ; hybrid watt - hours per mile ; PHEV watt - hours per mile ; and length and distance of trip .
Additionally , the standards for every performance measure are derived from physics - based computations , meaning that a range of factors is taken into account to calculate a single performance measure .
ARDAQ ’s eight - ounce sensor module package can be quickly installed and can begin collecting information immediately .
A month ’s worth of data can be stored on a 1 - gigabyte USB thumb drive .
After a trip is completed , data from the thumb drive are uploaded to a personal computer and displayed using Google Earth .
Eventually , wireless data transmission will be added to ARDAQ .
ARDAQ was recently used by judges to determine the winner of the Challenge X student competition .
( Earlier post . )
The new MOU builds on a US - Sweden agreement signed in June 2007 that further expanded cooperation on renewable energy and vehicle technologies .
( Earlier post . )
The 2007 agreement focused cooperation on biomass production , transportation and automotive research , reducing the cost of renewable energy , and improving energy efficiency .
It also established a bilateral working group to explore prospective projects .
In June , the governments of Sweden and the US also extended their cooperation with the Volvo Group on R&D on alternative fuels and hybrid solutions with a combined US $ 18 million grant from the DOE and the SEA .
Volvo will provide a matching $ 18 million , for a combined $ 36 million investment .

Question :
We use the terms “ gal ” and “ guy ” to refer to females and males .
I can see where “ gal ” would be a slang contraction of “ girl ” , but where does “ guy ” come from ?
( Asked by a curious guy . )
Reply : I had to look to find this one .
We use “ guy ” to refer to the male species – this guy , that old guy ( like me ) .
However , the word originally meant someone that was grotesque or weird looking .
And , it is an eponym – a word formed from the name of a real person .
The person in this case was Guy Fawkes , the infamous leader of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot in Britain .
Guy and his buddies hid quite a few barrels of gun powder under the Parliament building , with the intent of blowing up King James I and Parliament members on November 5 .
The plot was discovered , and Guy and most of his co-conspirators were captured and executed .
The day of the planned big boom ( Nov. 5 ) became know as Guy Fawkes Day , and eventually became the equivalent of the American Halloween .
Grotesque effigies , know as “ guys ” , were carried through the streets .
There were bonfires and fireworks – masked children begged from door - to - door for pennies for “ guy ” ( fireworks ) .
By the 1800s , “ guy ” was used in Britain as slang for someone who exhibited weird dress or behavior .
In America , however , the term “ guy ” got cleaned up and came to mean simply “ a man ” .
This filtered back to Great Britain ( U.K. ) , and “ guy ” does n’t imply much of a “ weirdo ” anymore .
OK , how about you answering some questions .
Here ’s a couple I gleaned from The Learning Kingdom and a couple trivia type .
Everyone should know the answers .
1 . How many muscles are there in an elephant ’s trunk ?
2 . What fish travels 800 miles backwards ?
3 . The longest English words without the vowels a , e , i , o , and u , are “ rhythm ” and “ syzygy ” .
I ’ve got rhythm , do you have syzygy ?
4 . I was reading an opisthograph the other night .
Have you ever read one ?
Answers : 1 . The trunk of a full - grown elephant is about 7 feet in length and weighs 300 lb .
This extension of the nose and upper lip has more than 100,000 muscles and no bones .
2 . Chinook salmon fry ( young fish ) are hatched in high mountain streams .
When a year or two old , they return to the Pacific Ocean , being carried downstream .
But , their current - fighting instinct keeps them facing upstream .
For the most part , the 800 - mile journey is completed swimming upstream while moving downstream .
3 . You might have a syzygy if you ’re a heavenly body .
In astronomy , this is an alignment of three celestial objects , such as the Sun , Earth , and Moon or a planet ( as viewed from above ) .
Syzygy for the Sun-Earth - Moon system occurs at full moon and new moon .
4 . I ’m sure you have .
An opisthograph is a manuscript or book with writing on both sides of the pages .
Students sometimes turn in a report as an anopisthograph and waste paper .
And now you know .
Check out last week ’s Curiosity Corner here .
Economists -- and what few friends the Bush administration still has -- seem flabbergasted at how bleak Americans have grown about their economic prospects .
True , gasoline has shot past $ 4 a gallon .
And house prices keep dropping .
And unemployment is creeping higher and higher .
But is this really enough to send consumer confidence plunging to near - record lows ?
To convince more than 8 in 10 Americans that the country is headed in the wrong direction ?
Surely something else must be at work .
Republicans and some economic analysts think they know what that something is : Democratic doomsayers .
Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina recently distilled this view with Nixonian flourish , declaring : “ This is not a failed economy .
We are not in recession .
What a shame that Democrats want to talk down the economy . ”
But I think there ’s a better explanation for the public ’s dark mood , one that ’s closer at hand and deeper running than the talk - it - down theory .
Working Americans and their families arrived on the doorstep of the current economic crisis uniquely ill - equipped to cope with its consequences .
Rather than having gained a financial protective coating during the period of growth that preceded it , working families up and down the income spectrum were actually nudged further out on an economic limb and therefore were primed for being picked off once problems emerged .
It ’s not that the growth of the last generation was n’t real ; it was .
The U.S. economy doubled in size between 1980 and last year .
It ’s not that all of the benefits of the just - past era went to those at the top ( although a very substantial chunk did ) ; millions upon millions of Americans prospered right along with the super - rich .
But the prosperity we enjoyed was purchased at a price of diminished security for our families and ourselves .
Even as our incomes went up , economic risks -- the costs of being laid off , of suffering a work - stopping illness or of a catastrophe like a house fire -- that were once largely borne on the broad shoulders of business and government were being shifted onto the backs of ordinary families , from the working poor to the reasonably rich .
That means that even before the current crisis struck , families were primed to take steeper financial falls than in the past , ones from which they ’d have a harder time recovering .
And now that trouble is upon us , they are falling in greater and greater numbers .
The changes that have made Americans more vulnerable have occurred in the struts that hold up working families and that have held them up for generations .
Jobs , benefits , housing , health coverage , college and retirement savings , even bought - and - paid - for insurance all played crucial roles in maintaining families ’ economic stability during the second half of the 20th century .
But the protective value of each has been weakened over the last generation .
Take two examples : benefits and housing .
When Washington officials and the presidential candidates talk about benefits , they usually mean public benefits such as Social Security and Medicare .
But the benefits that really count for the vast majority of working - age Americans are their employer - provided benefits -- the health insurance and disability coverage and the 401 ( k ) they ’ve been building -- that taken together form a crucial safety net for themselves and their families .
However , although most Americans are not aware of it , their grasp on these benefits -- their assurance of receiving them , their remedy if they do not -- is governed by a single federal law , the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 , or ERISA .
ERISA ’s congressional authors intended the law to protect employee benefits .
We know this because they said so right in the law ’s preamble .
But over the last generation , the Supreme Court and increasingly conservative federal appeals courts have rendered a series of decisions involving ERISA that have made it easier for employers and their agents to deny benefits to workers and their families .
Diane Andrews - Clarke learned exactly what these decisions meant when her husband ( and father of the couple ’s three daughters ) , Richard Clarke , began drinking heavily .
Under Andrews - Clarke ’s employer - provided family health insurance policy , and under Massachusetts law , anyone covered by the policy who needed alcohol treatment was due 30 days of inpatient care paid for by insurance .
However , when Andrews - Clarke tried to collect , the insurer refused to cover more than a handful of days .
When she tried a second time , the insurer refused again .
Richard Clarke eventually died , and Andrews - Clarke sued .
But because the Supreme Court and appeals courts have limited employees ’ rights under employer - provided health policies such as hers to essentially getting the benefits that were originally denied , and because Clarke , being dead , was n’t available to receive any benefits , Andrews - Clarke got nothing .
“ People who try to claim their employer - sponsored benefits are worse off than they were two or three decades ago , ” said Judge William Acker Jr. , who was appointed by President Reagan to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama in Birmingham and who has written extensively about ERISA .
“ The law that was supposed to protect them has been turned on its head . ”
Now consider housing .
On average , 60 % of the value of American homeowners ’ possessions -- 60 % of everything we own -- is accounted for by the value of our homes , according to my analysis of the Federal Reserve ’s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances .
That means houses are a big deal for families ’ finances .
And so therefore is what protects them -- homeowners insurance .
Homeowners insurance is a classic case in which people go out and try to buy their own private safety nets rather than turning to government or to their employers for security .
But homeowners have not had very good luck with this do - it - yourself approach in recent years .
That ’s because over the last two decades -- with relatively little notice and almost no awareness on the part of the buying public -- the insurance industry has changed the nature of its policies in ways that leave homeowners on the hook for vastly more than they used to be on the hook for .
As recently as the early 1990s , the most widely sold type of policy , especially in the nation ’s most populous areas , was a “ guaranteed replacement cost ” policy .
Under it , your insurer promised to replace your home if it burned or was destroyed by a hurricane , essentially no matter what the cost .
It was up to the insurer to get the price right and keep the coverage current .
However , following a rash of disasters that included the Northridge earthquake in Los Angeles , insurers phased out guaranteed replacement cost policies in favor of “ extended replacement cost ” policies .
Under these , the insurer provides you with up to a certain fixed dollar amount of coverage , plus typically 10 % to 20 % .
It is up to you to decide what the amount should be .
It is up to you to figure out what it would cost to rebuild your home .
And it is up to you to keep your policy current .
Theoretically , you could do this job .
But the industry ’s own estimates show that more than half of American homeowners simply have too much else going on in their lives to keep tabs on changing building codes , the fluctuating price of plywood or what carpenters and plumbers are making in their neighborhoods .
Similar changes -- with similar shifts of economic risk from business and government to families -- have occurred in retirement , where the switch from traditional pensions to 401 ( k ) s has left individuals largely on their own to provide for old age .
Essentially , the numbers have flipped .
The fraction of private - sector workers relying on traditional pensions has dropped from 62 % a generation ago to a mere 10 % today , while the fraction depending solely on 401 ( k ) s has jumped to 63 % .
Similar changes have occurred in the way people pay for college education , where rocketing costs and the declining availability of federal grants have meant that most families can no longer pay as they go to send their kids to school , but must borrow .
That ’s left parents more financially exposed .
And it ’s meant that after they graduate , most young people are saddled with debt and , in many cases , must make a beeline to the best - paying jobs to help defray the costs of college .
Twenty years ago , loans were used to pay about 15 % of the tuition , room and board and fees that parents and students paid for college .
Today , they account for fully one - third , according to the College Board .
And similar changes have occurred in health coverage , which costs more today and covers less .
In just the last eight years , employees ’ average annual premium costs have more than doubled , from $ 1,600 to almost $ 3,300 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Indeed , similar changes have occurred in just about every corner of Americans ’ financial lives .
Some argue that in the new , globally competitive economy , U.S. business and government simply cannot afford to provide the kinds of protections against financial peril that they used to .
Perhaps not .
But that does n’t mean that we should automatically shunt the job of bearing these dangers to families alone .
And it most assuredly does n’t mean that we should pass along the task without letting people know they ’ve just been assigned the job of bearing a big new load of risk .
But that ’s essentially what has happened .
As a result , working Americans and their families are operating on an economic high wire -- only one or two missteps from a steep financial fall .
Little wonder people are so bleak about their prospects now that times are tough .
Peter Gosselin is the national economics correspondent for The Times and the author of “ High Wire : The Precarious Financial Lives of American Families , ” released last month by Basic Books .
" We have come into real contention [ for mindshare ] in the enterprise , " said Tim O'Reilly , CEO at O'Reilly Media , in his keynote address at OSCON , this week 's Open Source convention in Portland , Ore .
" So we should be patting ourselves on the back , right ?
I 'm not so sure . "
While celebrating the many accomplishments of free software , O'Reilly put most of his attention on the new challenges where open source could — and in his opinion should — make a difference .
And he brought several people on stage to back up his points .
" We have to pay attention to the real consequences to the wave we 've unleashed , " he said .

Leadership Lessons
Open -Source CRM Delivers More Control , Less Cost
Open -Source Software a Security Risk
The big challenges and opportunities he identified , where open - source communities can make a difference and where it 's keeping up , are cloud computing , the open programmable Web and open mobile .
O'Reilly pointed out that cloud computing means we 're looking at " immense centralization , " where peer - to - peer computing ( a traditional strength of the open - source community ) is a big part .
" How do we redefine and restructure the world so that it matches our values instead of the other way around ? " he asked the audience , citing Jesse Vincent 's premise : " Web 2.0 is digital sharecropping . "
Great minds and cool startups ( such as reasonablysmart.com ) are working on these issues , O'Reilly said , such as trying to figure out if we can build the next generation Web services with the XMPP protocol .
How 's the community doing on this ?
Fairly well .
During another session at the conference , Brian Aker , director of technology for MySQL , cited the influence the open source community has had on Amazon.com , which he described as an innovator and leader in cloud computing services .
" Amazon is an interesting position .
They 're always been a fairly secretive company and they 've been pushed into an open position . "
( For more on Amazon 's strategy , see Amazon.com 's IT Leader Leaving Huge Customer Service Infrastructure as Legacy .
" Data is the new lock - in , " said O'Reilly , as he underscored the importance of the programmable Web .
The Internet is n't the operating system .
. . yet .
Just as Los Angeles is 72 suburbs in search of a city , explained O'Reilly , the Internet is 72 subsystems in search of an OS .
" We have to think about what will keep them free , " emphasized O'Reilly .
When you look up data from a proprietary service , someone owns the mapping and the connections between the data , he said .
Other people are pushing in the other direction to create an open Web plaform , however — O'Reilly pointed to the Yahoo !
Search boss , in which the company is opening up its search engine — and , he said , " People are starting to cast new energy and ideas into our ecosystem . "
Browser Wars on the Smartphone
And then there 's mobility .
The browser wars are back , said O'Reilly , but they 're back on the phone .
Fortunately , though , " Big companies like Google are putting a big stake in the ground saying ' we believe in open , we have to believe in open , ' " he said .
Google understands that if the mobile phone is n't open , they 're toast .
To explain the import of this attitude , O'Reilly explained , " This is like Microsoft in 1995 embracing open source rather than them embracing it today . "
Mobile is critical , O'Reilly said , and there 's real action happening in the open phone space .
Some of the examples he offered included Open moko and Google 's Android .
Another promise is Moblin , which was discussed at length by Dirk Hohndel , Intel 's chief Linux open - source technologist .
Intel wants to engage the open - source community to create a new category of Internet - centric devices such as mobile Internet devices and automotive in - vehicle infotainment systems .
Moblin has been around for a year , said Hohndel ; its initial adopters were not open - source developers but rather people who were thinking about products to build .
Obviously , said Hohndel , Intel wants people to build projects .
" But I want to see the open - source developers — to see the community run with it and to make it their project , " he said .
Intel is currently putting together the software stack for the next instance , Moblin 2 .
" We 're going to open this up to the public at a developer camp , in three to four weeks , " he said .
" The hope I have is that the community takes this from us , that the community makes it theirs . "
Open -Source Movement , Applied to Security and Privacy
But those are just the technology challenges .
The open - source community has political power , too , and can shape the future of how technology affects our lives .
At least that 's the opinion of Christine Peterson , president of Foresight Nanotech Institute .
Petersen largely pays attention to nanotech , but she also draws connections between technology and how it 's used .
( This is your cue to mutter , " Use this power for good and not for evil . " )
For example , she explained , dogs can pick up smells from a single molecule ; nanotech is heading in that direction .
That one item has power for social change .
" We tax income , " she said .
" What if we could tax pollution ? "
On the other hand , sewer monitoring has begun .
That 's good for things that need to be detected , whether because of terrorism or health risks .
But some municipalities are using nanotech sewer monitoring to test for illicit drugs .
" There 's no reason that they could n't take it to the property line , " she said .
" You guys are going to have a lot of influence on how this plays out . "
Petersen 's main message was in regard to the balance between privacy and security .
The federal government folks in Washington D.C. , tend to ignore the great debates in the community about the social impact , according to Petersen .
They go ahead with their plans because they 're responsible for protecting us , and the only tools they have are top down tools .
But , she says , " They 're trying to solve a bottom up problem with top down tools . "
" Who can figure this out ?
Well gosh — we need a community that understands security , privacy , functionality and freedom , " Petersen said .
" You 're the only ones who get this . "
She added , " The folks in D.C. do not have the toolsets to figure this out no matter how well meaning they are .
They want to keep you safe and they 're trying very hard to do it . "
Petersen 's catchphrase for this effort is " no secret software for public sensing data . "
She urged the open - source community to take part , not merely complain .
" Look what happened with e-voting — this will be just like that [ if you do n't get involved ] . "
The open - source community is turning its attention from technology and acceptance to bigger problems .
O'Reilly said , " As we look at our success , we could be really proud ... but what I 'm most excited and encouraged by is that you 're tackling new , hard problems . "
Work on what 's hard , work on what 's important , he urged , " so that history does not pass us by but carries us to the new future . "
France Plans Groundbreaking Tidal Power Experiment
July 28th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Coming on the heels of the inauguration of the world ’s first commercial scale tidal power turbine , Electricite de France ( EDF ) has announced that it plans to build a pilot tidal turbine system .
The plan calls for 3 to 6 turbines to be built with capacities between 4 and 6 MW by 2011 .
The location of the site ( off Paimpol in Brittany ) was chosen due to the extremely strong currents in the area .
While the recently installed SeaGen tidal power system in Ireland was certainly revolutionary , the French plan is as well .
France alone has 80 % of the potential in Europe for generating electricity from tidal currents — enough to theoretically create 10 million MWh per year .
This is not France ’s first tidal power endeavor ;
The Rance tidal power plant in Brittany was the world ’s first electrical generating system powered by tidal energy .
The plant , constructed in 1966 , outputs about 68 MW of power per year .
However , the Rance plant has had severe environmental consequences due to its placement in a fragile estuary .
Fortunately , the new plan will not have such issues — unlike the polluting barrage system used in older tidal plants , the EDF turbines are free - floating .
And the EDF plan has big implications — if all goes well with the pilot project , France hopes to make tidal power an integral industry in the country .

It ’s difficult to imagine a person not having heard the old axiom “ Buy low , sell high ” , and it is prudent advice when you are making financial decisions .
It ’s the second part of that adage that might warrant a look at our strategy for infrastructure improvement in this country .
If you are looking to make the maximum amount of money by selling something you want to sell that something when it ’s at its highest value .
I wonder then , is it time for our government to sell its infrastructure ?
You know , since the effects of Peak Oil are beginning to make themselves felt , the value of the infrastructure developed to serve cars running on cheap oil will decline each year into the future ; starting soon .
Selling high might mean selling soon .
Now , I do n’t think we should sell all of it , by any means .
We should keep the ports and the train lines , but is now a good time to start selling our roads , highways and airports ?
There has been news recently of other governments selling their infrastructure , and considering the value of these items in an energy scarce future I would contend that their value will never be higher .
In fact , there is already plenty of news about airlines facing massive losses .
( And starting to charge for baggage , pillows and normal drinks )
How valuable will an airport be if we do n’t have airlines ?
Or what if the ones we do have are marginally profitable ?
I say it ’s better to sell now while the full force of Peak Oil has n’t quite made itself felt .
I would say the same about roads and bridges .
Now , you ca n’t sell every bridge because you would n’t want it to be impossible to cross a river in the future , but the states could certainly lease some of them to companies looking for stable investments .
They could at least see some return on all the money we ’ve sunk into them .
You could say that this is not “ fair ” or it might smack of fraud , but I would say that it is n’t .
If these companies and profiteers can create our current credit crisis , and then look for a bailout from Uncle Sam , they should be smart enough to see through this and see the future for what it will be , but most likely they wo n’t .
The deal in Pennsylvania applies to just 469 miles of the 3.9 million miles of roadways in our country .
Assuming that we could sell ( or lease like in PA ) 1 % of these roads we could raise just over $ 1.3 Trillion dollars ( assuming the same pricing per mile ) which would go a long way to building our necessary rail infrastructure .
Granted , this figure is obviously not really manageable , but with some effort I would expect we could recognize a fair portion of this number .
Rail infrastructure , which has a much longer lifespan than roads , and also a higher carrying capacity , is where we should be focusing these infrastructure dollars .
Based on an estimate I saw for a brand new railway line to Yucca Mountain for nuclear waste the cost to build a new mile of railway is $ 6.2 M , or an estimate of a railway line in Illinois which was running $ 93 K per mile ( I ’ve since lost the link to the news article ) .
The cost to rehab a railway line , at least in Missouri , is around $ 250 K per mile .
That means that for our $ 1.3 Trillion we could build just under 210,000 miles of brand new tracks , using the Yucca example or 13 M miles based on the Illinois cost .
These numbers are kind of ridiculous , but the point is that by redirecting our investment from roads , which are really short term , costly , maintenance ridden items to railways , we could build a world class infrastructure for less money , less maintenance and possibly one that might work a little better .
It ’s high time we the people get something for infrastructure investments other than crappy service , lots of traffic , pollution and an ever spiraling pyramid of costs and maintenance .
Buy low , sell high .
Sell high , buy low .
That ’s the key .
Better to sell it now than hold it until it ’s worthless , which we all know it will soon be .
Despite an eleventh hour attempt by Dems to erase the telecom immunity language from the legislation that will overhaul the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the bill breezed through the Senate today in a 69 - 28 vote , putting to bed the lightning rod issue .

- Fixed a glitch that kept the rest of the game from appearing ( bicycles , airplanes , parachutes , mission variety , and additional clothing stores )
- Performing a melee attack immediately after disengaging from the cover system no longer switches to a cinematic camera angle where an unseen chainsaw carves your enemy in half as blood splatters on the screen and someone shouts " Ca n't stop the Train , baby ! "
Gameplay
- Tweaked melee combat so that instead of working 1 % of the time , counters are now completely impossible
- Bailing from a moving vehicle will no longer result in the car rolling end over end while Niko gently floats forward in a sitting position
- Attempting to aim a gun at an enemy that 's closer than ten feet away will result in Niko saving time for everyone involved by shooting himself in the face
Graphics
- Added the " Hair On A Projector " filter to our robust graphics engine which already features the innovative " Rendered At A Lower Resolution Then Stretched " and " Slightly Out Of Focus " filters
- Pop-in is no longer a problem thanks to a new loading screen that appears every three blocks
- Finally gave up on trying to model hands , replaced them with square blocks
Audio
- Cut the length of that one reggae song that you ALWAYS hear when playing pool in half so you can hear it twice as often
- Added more references to irony and trust funds in Radio Broker
- Fixed a glitch that was distorting Little Jacob and Badman 's clearly enunciated British accents
Content
- Replaced Katt Williams and Ricky Gervais stand - up routines with Bluesy St. John so the comedy club would contain actual humor
- Removed all team - based online game modes when we realized that it 's much more satisfying to kill 15 year olds that rap and talk about smoking pot than it is to get them to work together

– Dennis " Corin Tucker 's Stalker " Farrell ( @DennisFarrell )
Representative government fails when corrupt politicians mostly serve corporate and other special interests .
Then it is crucial for citizens to have direct democracy opportunities .
This means having the right to place initiatives or referenda on ballots that can make new laws , amend constitutions , recall elected officials , or control taxes and government spending .
Though many local and 24 state governments provide rules for some ballot measures and initiatives , they have been limited by diverse establishment , status quo political interests on the left and right that feel threatened by such populist citizen power .
I was impressed by the recent Wall Street Journal article by John Fund : The Far Left ’s War on Direct Democracy ( http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121702588516086143.html?mod=todays_columnists ) .
He made the point that direct democracy , though sorely needed , has been successfully crushed by ugly tactics from those interests that would rather use their money and influence to control legislative and other government functions .
They fear citizen power .
They know how to control elections and manipulate voters .
“ Unfortunately , some special interests have declared war on the initiative process , using tactics ranging from restrictive laws to outright thuggery , ” said Fund .
I agree with Fund ’s summation : “ Representative government will remain the enduring feature of American democracy , but the initiative process is a valuable safety valve .
… attempts to arbitrarily curb the initiative , or to intimidate people from exercising their right to participate , must be resisted .
It 's a civil liberties issue that should unite people of good will on both the right and left . ”
If this sounds reasonable to you , then the appropriate question to ask of presidential candidates is straightforward :
Do you support providing more direct democracy opportunities ?
Indeed , many people want some way of creating a federal ballot initiative mechanism whereby the misdeeds or inaction of government could be addressed by Americans voting directly to get the transparent and accountable government and effective public policies they want .
A national ballot measure to end the Iraq war would have succeeded in 2006 , for example .
Putting Democrats in control of Congress did not work .
Do we need the ability to recall a president because of dishonesty , incompetence and wrongheaded policies ?
Yes .
Also consider that the two - party plutocracy has been able to stifle political opposition by making third party and independent candidates unable to grasp any real power , as they can do in most other democracies .
In thinking about direct democracy I was reminded of the all too prevalent view that Barack Obama will challenge the traditional , money dominated two - party control of Washington politics .
So , I pose this challenge to Obama :
If you truly represent a force for fixing a divisive and ineffective political system , then why do n’t you explicitly come out in favor of creating more direct democracy opportunities ?
Why not condemn all attempts to crush ballot measures and initiatives ?
And why not help start a national discussion of the possibility of a federal ballot initiative mechanism ?
When over 80 percent of Americans see the nation on the wrong track it is fair to conclude that representative government has failed .
The two - party plutocracy has too much power .
This is the ideal time to recognize the limits of electoral , representative democracy and become an advocate for more direct democracy .
President Theodore Roosevelt , in 1912 , wisely observed " I believe in the Initiative and Referendum , which should be used not to destroy representative government , but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative . "
Direct democracy is all about converting the notion of sovereignty of we the people into reality .
It comes to this :
Should we be content to put our faith in elected representative or should we put it in ourselves ?
When you vote for candidates you do n’t put your faith in yourself , you put it in them .
Have n’t we been disappointed enough in those elected ?
We have less to fear from the will of the majority than from the actions of dishonest , corrupt and plutocracy - serving elected officials .
For political reform seeking Americans the litmus test for presidential candidates should be whether they support more direct democracy .
If Obama is not just about rhetorical change , but a true reformer of the political system , then we need to hear from him on this issue .
Let him explain whether or not he supports what Ralph Nader does , who has said that presidential candidates should “ put front and center empowering the American people in direct democracy format so they can move in when their so - called representatives cave in to the interests of big business .
… Campaign finance reform has got to go hand in hand with direct democracy like initiative , referendum , recall . ”
His current platform says that we need “ more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with ‘ we the people , ’ and not ‘ we the corporations . ’ ”
Can you imagine Obama saying these things ?
I can’t .
Opening a new restaurant is risky .
60 % of new restaurants close or change ownership within three years .
One way to make a restaurant stand out from the crowd is to have a theme , and the wackier the better .
It may be as simple as putting costumes on the waiters and decorating the walls , or it may be an entirely new concept , but it probably wo n’t make thefood any better .
However , strange themes will get valuable publicity .
Dinner in the Sky
Dinner in the Sky is a Brussels based restaurant that serves dinner for up to 22 people … 150 feet in the air !
The specially - designed table and chairs are lifted by a crane .
Dinner anywhere in Belgium will set you back almost 8 thousand euros ; other locations are also available .
Remember , you must wear your seat belt , and do n’t drop your fork !
In the Toilet
The food at Marton Theme Restaurant in Kaohsiung , Taiwan is in the toilet .
Patrons sit on toilets while eating , there are more toilets on the walls , and the food is served in dishes shaped like both eastern and western toilets and urinals .
And business could n’t be better .
See more pictures here .
Food for What Ails You
D.S. Music Restaurant in Taipei , Taiwan is a medical - themed restaurant with crutches on the wall , waitresses dressed a nurses , and drinks served from an IV drip bottle !
The owner came up with the idea to express his gratitude for care he received at a local hospital .
Pasta You Can’t Refuse
A restaurant situated inside the top security prison Fortezza Medicea in Italy is so popular that officials have since opened more branches .
Serenaded by Bruno , a pianist doing life for murder , the clientele eat inside a deconsecrated chapel set behind the 60ft high walls , watch towers , searchlights and security cameras of the daunting 500 - year - old Fortezza Medicea , at Volterra near Pisa .
Under the watchful eye of armed prison warders , a 20 - strong team of chefs , kitchen hands and waiters prepares 120 covers for diners who have all undergone strict security checks .
Tables are booked up weeks in advance .
I could n’t find a menu , but I made one up for them .
Safe Sex with Dinner
Cabbages and Condoms is a chain of restaurants in Thailand .
There are condoms on the walls and pictures of condoms printed on the carpets .
Instead of after - dinner mints , patrons are offered a bowl of condoms at the counter .
Profits from the restaurants go to support the Population and Community Development Association ( PDA ) .
Under the Sea
Ithaa is the name of the underwater restaurant at the Hilton Maldives Resort & Spa .
The walls and roof are a transparent acrylic arch .
Its capacity is 14 people , who go down a spiral staircase to a depth of five meters .
See more pictures here .

Revolutionary Culture
Shao Shan Chong Xiang Cai Guan in Nanning , China used the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 1976 as a theme .
The wait staff dress like Red Guards .
Although it ’s not an era people recall fondly , the restaurant is doing well .
Thefood must be good .
In the Dark
At Dans le Noir ? in Paris and in London , dinner is served in complete darkness to produce a sensory experience completely different from most restaurants .
The concept is threefold : 1 . you taste yourfood without visual cues as to what you should expect , 2 . you relate to your dinner companion (s ) differently when you ca n’t see them , and 3 .
the wait staff is blind .
NEW YORK–A U.S. appeals court decision upholding the dismissal of a lawsuit from Canadian Maher Arar essentially enables the U.S. government to send foreigners to be tortured , a lawyer with a human rights group representing Arar said late today .
" It means that the U.S. can do to anyone what they did to Maher , " said Maria LaHood , a senior attorney with the U.S. - based Centre for Constitutional Rights .
" They can do it to anyone , to any foreign citizen , and use the immigration process as a guise , basically , to send someone to be tortured . "
Arar was labelled a member of Al Qaeda when he switched planes at New York 's Kennedy Airport in 2002 as he returned to Canada from vacation .
He was eventually released without charges and he returned to Canada where a judicial inquiry cleared him of any terrorist links and Ottawa awarded him compensation of $ 10.5 million .
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York ruled today that Arar 's claims that it was a violation of due process to send him to Syria could not be heard in federal court .
The court concluded that adjudicating the claims would interfere with sensitive matters of foreign policy and national security .
" It 's a quite sweeping and reprehensible opinion , " said LaHood .
`` It 's quite sweeping in how much deference it gives to the U.S. government . "
LaHood spoke with Arar and said he is equally taken aback by the decision .
" He was not only disappointed too , but outraged , " she said .
" He 's rightfully angered that he cannot get justice , and that not only can he not get justice , but that his being sent to torture has now been in vain because he can't even stop the government from doing it to someone else . "
The decision also said that Arar , as a foreigner who had not been formally admitted to the U.S. , had no constitutional due process rights .
San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom , who built a national reputation pushing cutting - edge -- and controversial -- policies on same - sex marriage , healthcare and other issues , launched an exploratory bid for governor Tuesday .
His move placed the 40 - year - old , two - term mayor out in front of a large Democratic field eyeing the race to succeed Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger , who is barred by term limits from running again in 2010 .
Newsom said he expected to decide by year ’s end whether to proceed with a full - fledged candidacy .
The first open - seat governor ’s race in 12 years is expected to draw a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls , including former governor and current Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , Lt. Gov. John Garamendi and former Controller Steve Westly , who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 2006 .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has also been widely discussed as a possible candidate , although he faces reelection in 2009 , which could complicate any run for higher office .
Among Republicans , state Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner is seen as likely to run .

In an interview Tuesday , Newsom said he was mindful of the city ’s somewhat eccentric reputation and alluded to the “ values ” issues -- political code for gay rights and other left - leaning positions -- that opponents may try to use to his political detriment .
“ Bring that on , ” he said after signing the papers creating his campaign committee .
“ We ’re about civil rights and equal rights , you better believe it , ” Newsom said .
“ I ’m proud of that ; I ’m not going to hide from that .
. . .
So now let ’s talk about healthcare , education , the environment .
Let ’s have a conversation about your kids and what you want this state to look like five , 10 years from now . ”
Newsom , who blends movie - star looks with a wonkish devotion to public policy , faces other impediments apart from the strong competition .
There is a long list of California mayors , and ex-mayors , who have tried and failed to win the state ’s highest office .
In recent decades that includes San Francisco ’s Joseph Alioto , Los Angeles ’ Tom Bradley and Richard Riordan , and San Diego ’s Pete Wilson , who lost in his first try for the office before becoming a U.S. senator and then winning the governorship in 1990 .
Wilson defeated Dianne Feinstein , who had left the San Francisco mayor ’s office two years before .

“ One of the prerequisites of becoming governor seems to be having already won statewide office , ” said Tony Quinn , a nonpartisan election handicapper , who noted that California is so large , even the mayors of its biggest cities are a mystery to most voters outside their home region .
Newsom also starts from a political base -- a world - famous liberal bastion -- that is less than ideal for a statewide candidate .
“ While California is clearly purple to blue in most state races , it ’s not nearly as blue as San Francisco , ” Quinn said .
Newsom also has a stain on his past , an admitted affair in late 2005 , after the end of his marriage , with the wife of his campaign manager and deputy chief of staff .
Newsom apologized for the transgression and said he would seek treatment for alcohol abuse .
Voters apparently forgave him ; he was reelected last November with 72 % of the vote .
He is engaged to marry actress Jennifer Siebel later this month .
Despite those hurdles , Newsom could emerge as a serious contender .
He can make the case for change against a pair of candidates -- Brown and Garamendi -- each of whom has been on California ’s political stage for more than 30 years .
Newsom can also point to a record of creative initiatives that have turned San Francisco into a sort of policy laboratory of the left .

He is probably best known outside San Francisco for his role as a champion of same - sex marriage .
In early 2004 , Newsom ordered the city to grant a marriage license to any couple requesting one .
The move led to years of legal wrangling that resulted in May ’s state Supreme Court decision declaring a fundamental “ right to marry ” in California that extends to couples of the same sex .
Apart from gay rights , Newsom has pushed to make the city a civic leader in environmental policies and healthcare .
He started a program to recycle restaurant waste into bio - diesel that will eventually power a fleet of city vehicles , and he hired a global - warming “ czar ” to find ways for San Francisco to reduce its carbon footprint .
The city is also the first in the country to provide universal access to healthcare for its residents , regardless of their ability to pay .
The plan has drawn criticism and a lawsuit from small - business owners -- and the restaurant industry in particular -- for its cost .
Newsom , who is seen as a moderate by San Francisco standards , also earned national attention for his efforts to reduce cash payments to the homeless while increasing the availability of so - called supportive housing , where residents have access to substance - abuse and mental - health counseling .

“ He ’s used the role of San Francisco mayor not just in the traditional way , making sure Muni buses arrive on time , but to pursue innovative policies on a number of national issues , ” said Corey Cook , an assistant professor of politics at the University of San Francisco .
As governor , Newsom said , he would have three priorities : reducing poverty , providing universal access to healthcare and improving the state ’s education system .
Boosting student test scores and reducing class sizes would be two measurements of success , he said , but only part of a change that would urge closer collaboration between Sacramento and local governments .
“ It ’s not just funding everything at a higher level , ” Newsom said of his goal for schools .
He acknowledged the hurdles he would face as a big -city mayor courting voters in the suburbs and rural stretches of California .
But Newsom insisted that the issues he has addressed as San Francisco mayor are ones that concern virtually every Californian .
“ Healthcare .
Education .
What ’s going on with the roads .
Quality - of - life issues . . . .
The environment , ” Newsom said .
“ All the issues tend to be remarkably similar . ”

Do n't Run
2008 Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader discusses a remark made to him by a fellow alumnus at a recent Princeton reunion .

****
I was at my Princeton reunion the other day , and a young alumnus came up to me - he was very kind - and he said " You know , I really like what you ’re doing - I like what you did - but please do n’t run . "
I said " Do you realize what you are saying ? "
And he said " Yes , I said please do n’t run . "
I said " You ’re telling me not to use my First Amendment rights of speech , assembly , and petition inside the electoral arena .
You ’re telling me to shut up .
Are you aware of what you ’re saying ? "
He said " I understand , I understand , I like what you ’re doing , but please do n’t run . "
So I went through and I said " Well , would you tell those voters instead of trying to determine which one was worse between the Democrats and the Whigs , the two major parties in the 19th century , and instead cut out and voted for the Liberty Party , which was the anti-slavery party - would you say to those candidates , ‘ Do n’t run ’ ? "
And he sort of paused .
And I said " How about the people who refused to go least - worst between the Republicans and Democrats on women ’s suffrage ?
Would you tell those candidates ‘ do n’t run ’ ?
What do you say to that ? "
And he paused .
And I took it up to date and I said " Would you tell Buchanan not to run ? "
And he said " I understand what you are saying , but please do n’t run . "
And I said " You know , unwittingly , you are engaging in a politically bigoted statement .
Because you can oppose , and you can support , any candidates you want .
But when you are saying to someone ‘ do n’t run ’ you are saying to someone ‘ do not speak , do not petition , do not assemble inside the electoral arena . ’ "
Now I ’m saying this because I ’m sure you ’ve had these conversations with people .
Look at the word spoiler .
Spoiler is a contemptuous word of political bigotry .
They do not accuse George W. Bush of being the spoiler in 2000 , and last I heard he got more votes than I did , vis -a - vis Al Gore .
It ’s only the independent and third parties that are called spoilers .
And think of the hubris here - these two parties have spoiled our elections , they ’ve spoiled our government , they ’ve spoiled our politics - and to have the temerity to say to someone who wants to reform the process that they are spoilers - they have no sense of humor - I mean , how do you satire satire ?
- Ralph Nader , New York City , May 31 , 2008 - Watch the video
As you probably have guessed , I spend a whole lot of time running The Daily WTF when going through submissions , writing articles , and sending out free stickers .
While I do this primarily for fun and hobby , it does tend to interfere with my day job at Inedo and , as a result , I tend to earn much less than I could otherwise .
But I do n’t mind .
All I have to do is sacrifice a few , small things .
Things like a decent lunch .
Normally for me , lunch is all about getting as much nutritional value for the least amount of money possible .
This means my lunch - time staples include things like sticks of butter ( $ 0.23 / ea ) , discarded military MREs ( free … if you know where to look ) , and grocery store free - sample binges ( free … if you have no dignity ) .
Today , however , I decided to treat myself , so I scrounged up a dollar and headed on over to the Dollar Tree .
After an exhaustive search through bins of expired food items , I stumbled across a wonderful treasure : the Chow Mein “ Quick Meal ” .
Nothing screams “ appetizing ! ” like artificial beef , and this sure screams ARTIFICIAL BEEF .
Even more loudly than “ Authentic Chinese Vegetables & Seasonings ” – a feature that you ’d think would help sell the Quick Meal better .
But you ’d think wrong : I did n’t even catch that bit until salivating over it on the way back to the office .
The one important thing I did notice , however , was the Nutrition Facts on the back .
Keep in mind that , for the frugal lunch connoisseur , nutritional value is key , and this Quick Meal sure knows how to pack that in .
With two servings in this little , 100g box , the Quick Meal manages to pack in 1,200 calories .
Considering that 100g of the most caloric food – pure fat – is only 900 calories , that ’s a rather impressive feat .
Even more impressive is how the Quick Meal delivers 206 grams of carbohydrates from a 100g package .
And to think , this amazing treasure was only a single dollar !
When I arrived back at the office , I tore open the Quick Meal and was delighted by the completeness of its contents .
There ’s the spoon - shaped fork , the eerily uncongealed sauce packet , the beef “ flavour ” , and a packet of dried noodles that somewhat resembled a ramen noodle block .
But since the packaging clearly stated that the Quick Meal is chow mein , I figured the noodles would somehow morph into something resembling chow mein .
There was also the unmistakable pack of Authentic Chinese Vegetables , which are certainly worth a zoom in :
Note that there are exactly three freeze - dried peas – the exact same number as seen on the Quick Meal package .
I can only imagine how much trouble some unfortunate factory worker would have gotten in if four peas were accidently included in the packet .
But no matter , it was time to prepare my feast .
And to that , I needed the all - telling instructions :
First and foremost , I truly appreciated the CAUTION .
Who among us has n’t forgotten how Extremely Hot boiling water can get ?
But I will say , I was a little put off by the “ 350 ml ” thing .
Really … what am I , a scientist ?
Does the Quick Meal think I have beakers lying around to measure things in milliliters !?
Just tell me how many cups or half - cups I need , Quick Meal .
Well , as it turned out , I did happen to have beakers lying around , and measured out 350 milliliters as the Quick Meal instructed .
After following the rest of the instructions , this is what I ended up with .
I suppose it was just a bit different than advertized .
As for the tasting … the Quick Meal delivered a somewhat unpolished , slightly immature nose with hints of broiled sirloin , poached egg , and cellar - dried carrots , though somewhat overpowered by brine .
Its palate offered a lively medley of complex flavors from roasted sesame to buttered shallot , all influneced by a hint of smokeyness .
The finish was warming , with a touch of bitternes that was quickly replaced by a subtle yet influential balance of spices .
All told , the Quick Meal was a fine meal , and a great deal at a single dollar .
Sure , some might point out that a block of ramen noodles ( with an obligitory flavor packet ) can be had at six for a dollar , but the Quick Meal is no ramen noodle .
The Quick Meal comes with a fork and authentic Chinese vegetables .
And besides , I ’m a bit above eating just ramen noodles for lunch .
Gun-control advocates across the country reacted with shock and outrage at the Supreme Court ’s decision to strike down the District of Columbia ’s ban on handguns today , saying the ruling would threaten gun-control measures in other states .
If there was any doubt that other bans would be in peril , the National Rifle Association quickly put those questions to rest when it announced shortly after the ruling that it would file a flurry of lawsuits challenging restrictions in San Francisco , Chicago and several Chicago suburbs .
The law in Washington , which spelled out rules for the storage of weapons and made it extremely difficult for most people in the district to legally possess a handgun , was among the strictest in the nation .
“ I consider this the opening salvo in a step - by - step process of providing relief for law - abiding Americans everywhere that have been deprived of freedom , ” Wayne LaPierre , the executive vice president of the N.R.A. , said in a statement .
In its 5 - to - 4 decision , the court ruled that the Constitution protects an individual ’s right to own guns , not just the right of the states to maintain regulated militias .
It also said that the District of Columbia ’s requirement that lawful weapons be disassembled or limited by trigger locks was unconstitutional because it made them virtually useless .
It would be nice if medical professionals never lost patient information .
But unfortunately , doctors and other healthcare specialists are only human .
And the running cliché that doctors ' handwriting is hard to read is often repeated for a reason .
During his presentation at the Red Hat Summit in Boston , Dr. John Halamka , CIO of Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , discussed four key reasons why medical records should be stored online .
Storage , compliance , patient access and community are among the ( supremely productive ) Halamka 's supporting reasons for his claim that online medical records will ensure a national standard of healthcare .

Google Launches Google Health To Help Patients Manage Medical Records
Privacy Concerns Could Stop Electronic Medical Records
The Painful Side Effects of Deploying Electronic Health Records
Privacy issues are likely to arise , he admitted , but they can be worked out , and the benefit of better organization of our medical records would be phenomenal .
" Open and transparent is good , " Halamka explained to this open - source - centric audience .
" Proprietary is bad . "
Issues with Storage
Online medical records will help with storage issues concerning patient files .
Today , most medical practices write patient information on paper and store each patient 's files alphabetically .
Records are faxed to new medical offices when patients move , and are n't even passed along that quickly if a patient enters a hospital emergency room .
Equally of importance , pointed out Halamka , if a medical office does n't survive a natural or accidental disaster , what happens to the records ?
Furthermore , he said , medical records are n't stored forever .
Although it 's obviously important to keep a personal copy of medical records , if professionals could look up a patient 's information online it would speed up the medical process .
While having an RFID ( radio frequency identification ) chip installed in one 's arm for instant identification might seem too Gattaca - like for some users , storing medical records online for instant access is more necessary than ever .
According to Halamka , an estimated 65 percent of U.S. citizens believe that doctors keep electronic records , while only about 15 percent of doctors really do .
Why ?
For one thing , it 's expensive ; doctors have to subscribe to services that update medical transactions .
One answer , Halamka suggested , is for hospitals to give the needed software to individual medical practices so these updates can take place .
He suggested that the Internet could — for free — use SOAP and https standards to get the job done more efficiently and affordably .
Nor is the storage issue apt to let up anytime soon .
The state of Massachusetts requires that hospitals save all patient data for 30 years .
" We 've just crossed the half petabyte line " at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Halamka explained .
In addition to the hardware requirements , he said , the knowledge - base challenges mean " whole new areas " for service oriented architecture and software as a service .
Compliance Benefits
The relationship between doctors ' offices , hospitals and pharmacies would be greatly strengthened by online medical records , Halamka believes .
Right now , each entity generally acts alone ( aside from the all too often occurrence of a medical practice prescribing a drug based on a relationship with a pharmaceutical company ) , Halamka pointed out .
However , storing medical records online will allow medical professionals from different offices to access patient records without needing to contact one another , speeding up the " paperwork . "
In turn , patients could know that any medical professional that they visit will begin with the same information .
Patient Access
By " eliminating the clipboard , " as stated by Halamka , patients could easily access all of their personal medical history .
They — and their doctors — will be able to see the dates of their last vaccinations , and even their genome information .
Halamka showed his own personal data from Google Health , demonstrating the XML - based display of his lifetime medical record .
It 's a pure XML / XSL structure , he pointed out , which is vocabulary - controlled .
Direct access to medical records will allow patients to know exactly what 's going on , said Halamka .
Instead of having to call a doctor and be put on hold while someone searches for their information , patients will be able to log into and update their medical information from home anytime they want .
A Better Sense of Community
Making better use of the Internet also includes improving hospital websites , Halamka explained .
Websites should be formatted more like social networks , so a community feel can take shape between professionals and patients .
The United States needs to set the same health standards across the country and the Internet is one way to truly bring more organization to light .
Right now , 500 organizations are collaborating to create standards , and as Halamka joked , it 's harder than trying to get that many people to agree on lunch .
Halamka is himself active in the American Health Information Community and leads the Health InfoTech standards panel .
This is n't just about personal data , such as a patient 's cholesterol tests or the drugs he 's taking .
The standards under review include standards for telemetry , vaccine transmission , and public health data .
" Healthcare interoperability requires open standards , developed in a transparent way , by a community .
It requires reusable components and tools which accelerate technical connectivity and data sharing .
The Open Source movement embraces all these principles , " Halamka said , " so I welcome their contributions to the work connecting payers , providers and patients . "

Presidential candidates demonstrate flagrant disregard for longstanding secular tradition by submitting to Evangelical “ Civil Forum ” as first joint appearance .
LOS ANGELES , August 15 , 2008 - Atheists United , an organization dedicated to advancing the cause of atheism and secular government , criticizes the choice of both presumptive presidential nominees to submit to being questioned by Evangelical preacher Rick Warren as part of his ongoing “ Civil Forum ” series at his congregation , Saddleback Church in Lake Forest , CA .
The event , which will be carried live by CNN and will be covered by all major news networks , has the distinction of being the first joint appearance by Democrat Barak Obama and Republican John McCain in this closely watched campaign .
Many secular Americans will see the candidate ’s participation in this forum as an implicit endorsement of Evangelical political clout and a sad indicator of the diminished tradition of the separation of church and state in today ’s politics .
Pastor Rick Warren , author of The Purpose Driven Life , in this event 's official press release , admits that his primary goals for hosting the Saddleback Civil Forum include , " ...[ to ] proclaim the Gospel Truth of salvation in Jesus Christ , ... " and " ... helping the Church regain credibility ... "
With such stated goals at the heart of Warren 's ongoing forums , one wonders why any candidate running to be the president of this secular nation would agree to make this forum the first on the campaign trail or agree to participate in such an event , controlled by one preacher whose views represent a narrow segment of our diverse country , at all .
“ There are good reasons for the separation of church and state , ” says Stuart Bechman , President for Atheists United , “ and by appearing in this forum , the two candidates and the two political parties are clearly showing a preference for the religious practices and beliefs – and the political agendas derived from those beliefs - represented by this church and its pastor .
The church and its pastor could n’t buy better coverage to promote its own narrow sectarian message . ”
Bechman also serves as vice - president for Atheist Alliance International .
Brian Parra , Atheists United ’s Director of Communications and Membership says , " Certainly the Evangelicals are an important voting block and I do n't fault the candidates for courting them , but the impropriety of scheduling this as the first joint appearance of the two candidates in this historic election , whether it 's officially a debate or not , demonstrates a lack of commitment to the separation of church and state and highlights the disproportional ascendancy of Evangelicals in our political process . ”

GHALANAI , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Fiercely independent tribesmen , angered by a U.S. air strike that killed 11 Pakistani soldiers this week , vowed to raise a militia to help Pakistan ’s army defend the border with Afghanistan .
Pakistan , a staunch ally in the U.S. - led war on terrorism , denounced Tuesday ’s attack on a border post in the Mohmand tribal region as “ unprovoked and cowardly ” and said it could undermine the cooperation in the battle against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
Elders from ethnic Pashtun tribes in Mohmand , one of seven semi-autonomous tribal regions , issued a statement late on Thursday condemning the attack as “ naked aggression ” and said they were ready to raise a “ lashkar ” , or army .
“ It ’s the duty of the government to protect and defend the frontiers and we are ready to raise a lashkar to help our army in their cause , ” the elders said .
“ We are ready to fight for our homeland as we fought in Kashmir in 1948 , ” they said , referring to the first war between Pakistan and India , a year after their partition .
Chanting slogans of “ Down with America ” and “ Down with Bush ” , about 250 activists of an Islamic group paraded on the roads of Ghalanai , Mohmand ’s main town , to protest against the attack .
“ We should wage jihad ( Muslim holy war ) to teach a lesson to America for this aggression , ” imam of the main mosque of Ghalanai , Abdul Khaliq , told the crowd .
The soldiers killed were manning a border post about 35 km ( 22 miles ) northwest of Ghalanai .
U.S. - led ground forces from across the border in the eastern Afghan province of Kunar called for air support after coming under small - arms and rocket - propelled grenade ( RPG ) fire from militants occupying a ridge 200 meters ( yards ) inside Pakistan .
GRAINY IMAGES
A video released by U.S. authorities showed footage of the encounter shot by a reconnaissance drone aircraft , complete with a voice - over describing the incident .
The video was posted on the internet site here .
The blurred , grainy images showed between five and seven figures scurrying among the rocks along the ridge , and flashes of gunfire and from RPGs , according to the American commentary .

In the final sequences , four precision bombs were shown exploding , but the commentator asserted that no military structure or posts were in the impact areas .
The U.S. military said the operation was coordinated with Pakistan and the Pentagon defended U.S. forces , saying initial indications pointed to a “ legitimate strike ” carried out in self - defense after they came under attack .
Pakistan contested the U.S. version and issued a protest .

On a visit to France , Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said such “ tragic incidents ” only helped the militant cause and he called on the United States to cooperate much more with the Pakistani military .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Thursday said he regretted the death of Pakistani soldiers and praised Pakistan as an “ incredibly important partner ” .
He also invited Pakistani and Afghan officials to help investigate .
Pilotless drones have carried out several strikes targeting al Qaeda militants inside Pakistan ’s tribal areas .
The number of casualties suffered by Pakistani forces in Tuesday ’s attack was the worst they have suffered as a result of U.S. action in nearly eight years since the alliance was formed .
A new Pakistani government , led by the party of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto , has been negotiating with ethnic Pashtun tribes to get them to press the militants to give up a campaign of violence in Pakistan in which hundreds of people have been killed over the past year .
Gates told a news conference in Brussels on Friday the United States had been skeptical about such deals in the past but it was up to Pakistan to decide how to handle the situation .
“ They are ... seeing if there ’s a way to negotiate arrangements with some of the tribes and I think we just have to give them some space to be able to pursue this , ” he said .
But the American government had vetted all of the Fulbright winners for security as well as for academic achievement .
Ms. Rice said that unless there was something significant she did not know about the three men that the Israelis could present to her , she wanted them to be permitted to leave .
The three  Zuhair Abu Shaaban , 24 , Osama Dawoud , 25 , and Fidaa Abed , 23  studied at the Islamic University of Gaza , a Hamas stronghold , which is perhaps the reason Israel has concerns about them .
But all said in interviews on Sunday that they had studied there because it was the only institution in Gaza that offered the engineering fields they wanted to pursue and that they had never been involved in Hamas or politics of any kind .
“ I do n’t support Hamas , ” Mr. Dawoud said .
He is hoping to be able to accept the offer to study for a doctorate in environmental engineering at the University of Utah .
Mr. Abu Shaaban , who has been accepted into a master ’s program in electrical engineering at the University of Connecticut , said that he had been permitted to cross into Israel , where security officials interrogated him for two hours .
They told him they would let him leave if he gave them information on several dozen members of his extended family who they believed were associated with Hamas .
Mr. Abu Shaaban said he had told them that there were more than 10,000 Gazans with his last name and of those on the list given to him , he recognized only 4 .
They then sent him home , he said .
“ I am not guilty , ” he said Sunday .
“ Please tell everyone I have nothing to do with Hamas .
All I want in life is to get an education and come back to serve my community . ”
Mr. Abed , who was accepted into a master ’s program in computer engineering at Columbia University , is also hoping that the Israelis change their minds .
Major Lerner said Israel was examining the cases of students who had been offered grants from Europe .
In a change of policy announced a week ago , Israel will no longer systematically bar Gazans from leaving to accept fellowships to study abroad .
But those with grants must pass through an Israeli security check and , he said , the three Fulbright grantees had failed it .
In a breakthrough scientific study published June 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , scientists at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research have shown that neural stem cell development may be linked to Autism .
The study demonstrated that mice lacking the myocyte enhancer factor 2C ( MEF2C ) protein in neural stem cells had smaller brains , fewer nerve cells and showed behaviors similar to those seen in humans with a form of autism known as Rett Syndrome .
This work represents the first direct link between a developmental disorder of neural stem cells and the subsequent onset of autism .
The research team was led by Stuart A. Lipton , M.D. , Ph.D. , a clinical neurologist and Professor and Director of the Del E. Webb Neuroscience , Aging and Stem Cell Research Center at Burnham .
" These results give us a good hint of how to look at Rett Syndrome and potentially other forms of autism in humans , " said Dr. Lipton .
" Having identified a mutation that causes this defect , we can track what happens .
Perhaps we can correct it in a mouse , and if so , eventually correct it in humans . "
Discovered in Dr. Lipton 's laboratory , MEF2C turns on specific genes which drive stem cells to become nerve cells .
When MEF2C was deleted from neural stem cells in mice , there was a faulty distribution of neurons accompanied by severe developmental problems .
Adult mice lacking MEF2C in their brains displayed abnormal anxiety - like behaviors , decreased cognitive function and marked paw clasping , a behavior which may be analogous to hand wringing , a notable feature in humans with Rett syndrome .
" There 's a yin and yang to this MEF2C protein , " said Dr. Lipton .
" My laboratory recently showed that MEF2C induces embryonic stem cells to become neurons .
In this new research , we show that knocking out MEFC2 in the brain results in mice with smaller brains , fewer neurons and reduced neuronal activity .
The commonality is the protein's association in making new neurons . "
Collaborators were Drs. Hao Li , Shu-ichi Okamoto , Nobuki Nakanishi and Scott McKercher , of Burnham , as well as Dr. Amanda Roberts from The Scripps Research Institute and Dr. John Schwarz from the Albany Medical Center .
Rett syndrome , a form of autism , afflicts more girls than boys and results in poor brain development , repetitive hand motions , altered anxiety behaviors and the inability to speak .
Patients with Rett Syndrome also suffer from seizures and other debilitating neurological symptoms .
