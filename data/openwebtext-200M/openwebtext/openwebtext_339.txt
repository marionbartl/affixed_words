( CNN ) -- Five Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats " harassed and provoked " three U.S. Navy ships early Sunday in international waters , the U.S. military said Monday , calling the encounter a " significant " confrontation .
The USS Hopper , seen in a file photo , was one of the ships harassed by Iranian boats , officials say .
An Iranian official , however , said it was not a serious incident , the state - run news agency IRNA reported .
U.S. military officials said the incident occurred early Sunday morning in the Strait of Hormuz , a narrow shipping channel leading in and out of the Persian Gulf .
They said that as the guided missile destroyer USS Hopper , the guided missile cruiser USS Port Royal and the guided - missile frigate USS Ingraham were entering the Persian Gulf , five Iranian boats approached them at high speed and swarmed them .
The Iranian boats made " threatening " moves toward the U.S. ships and in one case came within 200 yards of one of them , the U.S. officials said .
Watch what U.S. officials are saying about the incident »
The U.S. Navy also received a radio transmission that officials believe came from the Iranian boats .
The transmission said , " I am coming at you .
You will explode in a couple of minutes , " the U.S. military officials told CNN .
When the U.S. ships heard that radio transmission , they took up their gun positions and officers were " in the process " of giving the order to fire when the Iranians abruptly turned away , the U.S. officials said .
After the radio transmission , one of the Iranian boats dropped white boxes into the water in front of the U.S. ships , the officials said .
It was not clear what was in the boxes , the officials said .

No shots were fired , and no one was injured .
A Pentagon spokesman characterized the incident as " perplexing " and " cause for real concern . "
" Such actions are dangerous and could have quickly escalated into something much worse , " said Geoff Morrell , Pentagon press secretary .
" We see it as further evidence that Iran is unpredictable and remains a threat . "
Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman downplayed the incident , calling it " ordinary , " IRNA reported .
Mohammad Ali Hosseini said that similar incidents had occurred in the past between Iranian and American ships , and the issues were resolved as soon as the ships recognized each other , IRNA reported .
The Strait of Hormuz , which is in international waters , is near much of the world 's oil supplies .
The White House urged Iran to refrain from " such provocative actions that could lead to a dangerous incident in the future , " National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the United States probably would not make a formal protest to Iran about the incident .
McCormack said , " I can't speak to their rationale , their reasoning , their motivations . "
Iran and the United States do not have diplomatic relations .
Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Tehran , while Pakistan represents Iranian interests in Washington .
McCormack declined to comment further on the incident but said , " The U.S. will confront Iranian behavior where it seeks to do harm either to us or to our friends and allies in the region . "
On Friday , the U.S. Navy announced the same team of naval ships had been searching in the Arabian Sea for a sailor missing for a day from the Hopper .
The outcome of the search was not immediately known Monday .
In November the U.S. military reported that Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps had taken command of Tehran 's naval operations in the Persian Gulf .
The United States considers the Revolutionary Guard to be a major supporter of terrorist activity .
Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have increased over the last few years .
The U.S. has concerns about Iran 's nuclear program and has accused Iran of supplying weapons to insurgents in Iraq who target American forces .
In March , Iran detained 15 crew members of a British ship before releasing them after nearly two weeks .
Iran alleged the British vessel strayed into Iranian waters -- an assertion Britain strongly denied .

SOMETHING odd is happening to the cities of eastern Germany .
Plattenbauten , the soulless prefabricated apartment blocks thrown up by the region 's former communist rulers , are being knocked down .
Occasionally one will be truncated , shorn of its upper storeys .
Older streets are gap - toothed where wreckers have removed abandoned houses .
Cityscapes are being pruned , removing dead and dying edifices in the hope of saving the rest .
City planners , normally keen to promote the building of homes , factories and roads , are responding to a double demographic crisis : the collapse of communist - era industry , which sent workers , especially young women , fleeing westwards ; and a sharp decline in the birth rate .
Saxony - Anhalt , cradle of the Reformation and of East Germany 's chemical industry , lost a fifth of its 2.9 m people in the 16 years after Germany 's unification in 1990 .
By 2025 it expects to lose nearly half a million more .
In Köthen , where Johann Sebastian Bach composed the Brandenburg Concertos , so many young workers have left that “ the population pyramid has become a mushroom ” , says Ina Rauer of the town 's building department .
The cities of the east no longer imagine they can avoid demographic decline .
Instead they seek to manage its consequences , and a few are inventing ways to shrink gracefully .
Saxony - Anhalt , which suffered an acute shortage of apartments in communist times , has now destroyed some 45,000 homes with federal help .
The infrastructure that served now - defunct factories and empty apartment blocks must be ripped up too .
“ Streets cost an unbelievable amount of money , ” not to mention water pipes and electric cabling , grumbles Klaus Bekierz , who works for the building department of Dessau , half - an - hour 's drive from Köthen .
Its population has shrunk by a fifth to 76,000 since the early 1990s .
“ We can't pay for infrastructure for 100,000 people , ” he says .
Urban attrition is frightening those left behind , bringing the threat of blight and crime .
Eastern cities are courting industry , but capital is footloose and productive new factories employ hundreds rather than the thousands who once manned East Germany 's behemoths .
“ It 's not clear what the recipe for success is , ” says Hans - Joachim Bürkner of Potsdam University .
That may account for the spirit of zany experimentalism that prevails in cities such as Dessau and Köthen .
Under the motto “ city islands ” , Dessau is nudging life and commerce towards “ core areas ” , which means making a verdant city ( which is already three - quarters parkland ) even greener .
Traces of Dessau 's busier past — a disused tower for smoking sausages or a dairy 's chimney now occupied by storks — are being preserved .
Parts of the void are being parcelled into “ claims ” of 400 square metres , which citizens can use free of charge for projects such as growing biomass for fuel .
“ Where buildings fall , gardens rise , ” a hopeful billboard claims .
Köthen is diversifying beyond Bach to Samuel Hahnemann , the father of homeopathy .
The house where he practised his treatment methods in the 1820s and 1830s still stands as a museum .
A disused monastery will house a homeopathic library and an eastern German university may soon teach homeopathy in Köthen .
Restaurants have already benefited from the extra traffic this attracts , reckons the mayor , Kurt - Jürgen Zander .
Köthen city even employs homeopaths to help provide what it hopes is a more holistic approach to curing the city 's ills .
On their advice , the municipality sought to prepare the residents of down - at - heel Ludwigstrasse for the demolition of 15 buildings by conducting painstaking interviews to find out how they thought the newly - created space should be used .
To provoke a sharper reaction , the city dimmed the street lights , highlighting only the buildings designated for sacrifice .
That “ was a shock ” , says one Ludwigstrasse resident , and it sparked off the dialogue the city fathers wanted .
The façade of things to come
Dessau and Köthen are drawing inspiration from the Internationale Bauausstellung ( IBA ) 2010 , a project dreamt up at the Bauhaus Foundation in Dessau , which occupies the building where Walter Gropius and friends helped pioneer the stark geometrical Bauhaus style in the 1920s .
Such “ building exhibitions ” are a German tradition , held when social and economic change demands new ways of using space .
Omar Akbar , the Bauhaus 's director , sees IBA 2010 as a “ laboratory ” for coping with demographic decline that will one day afflict other cities in the industrialised world .
He says the aim is to shape the process of urban contraction , rather than “ merely let it happen ” .
But IBA 2010 does not just bring cities extra fame and money ( around € 150 m or $ 235 m , largely from the federal and state governments ) .
Its organisers also want to cultivate intangible qualities , like greater public involvement and a sense of distinctive identity for each community .
The town of Aschersleben filled the gaps along its ring road with large attention - grabbing posters ( see picture above ) .
And unlike its picturesque neighbours , Stassfurt now has a lake instead of its old city centre ; the 15th - century church , town hall and 850 other buildings collapsed or were knocked down because of subsidence , caused by decades of mining to extract potash .
From the death of cities , the hope is that new life will emerge .
Last year , Skype asked the Federal Communications to force wireless phone carriers to allow any device and application to operate on their networks .
During a keynote at the CTIA Wireless trade show this morning , FCC Chairman Kevin Martin gave Skype some bad news , saying that he did n't think it was necessary to force the cellular carriers to abide by the 1968 Carterfone decision .
The Carterfone decision forced the telephone companies ( AT&T and a bunch of small , local carriers ) to allow customers to attach any lawful device to the telephone network , so long as it did n't harm the network .
The short - term result was that people no longer had to lease phones from AT&T .
Looking to open a new market , Skype said that the Carterfone decision should apply to wireless carriers as well and that the likes of T - Mobile , AT&T , and Verizon should be forced allow Skype VoIP traffic over their networks .
The company argued that forcing cellular companies to do so would benefit consumers as it would force prices down .
In the interim , something unexpected happened : the cellular carriers decided to open up their networks .
Verizon was the first to say that it would support any device and any application on its network last November , publishing the technical standards needed to connect to its network earlier this year .
Not long afterwards , AT&T followed suit , and Sprint 's Xohm WiMAX network will also be open .
" In fact , in less than a year , many of you have evolved from vocal opponents to vocal proponents , embracing the open platform concept for your entire networks , " Martin said .
Those industry moves were enough to convince Martin that FCC regulation is unnecessary .
" In light of the industry 's embrace of this more open approach , it would be premature to adopt any other requirements across the industry , " Martin said to the audience at CTIA .
" Thus , today I will circulate to my fellow commissioners an order dismissing a petition for declaratory ruling filed by Skype that would apply Carterfone requirements to existing wireless networks . "
Skype has not yet responded to our request for comment on Martin 's remarks , but other groups are already criticizing the decision .
" The chairman 's decision to oppose this important petition is a missed opportunity to usher in a new era of innovation , " said Free Press research director S. Derek Turner in a statement .
" The small handful of companies that dominate the wireless world have a track record of stifling competition and an aversion to innovation .
Trusting these same companies with the promise of the mobile Web is short - sighted . "
During his speech , Martin also touted the success of the recently - concluded 700MHz auction .
Noting that the auction raised almost twice the expected $ 10 billion , Martin expressed his belief that the auction could transform the broadband landscape in the US .
He 's also banking on auction winners to deliver wireless broadband to those living in rural areas .
.... either that , or she should consider reducing her medication so she can be a bit more alert ?

Clinton ' death watch ' puts her chances below 10 %
Is Hillary Clinton 's candidacy dead ?
It 's a question that 's cropping up more and more .
She was a shoe - in last summer .
Now she 's the underdog .
She won Texas .
Then she lost Texas .
Slate has hooked up a heart monitor and begun the bedside vigil to keep bookmakers and voters abreast of her odds .
A feature on the organization 's web site rates Clinton 's chances of capturing the nomination .
Today her odds were up slightly from 9.7 percent to 9.9 percent .
" When you 've got a 1 - in - 10 shot of winning the Democratic nomination , a day without any major screw - ups is a good one , " declared Slate .
Her odds today were down from last week when Slate kicked off its deathwatch and opened her odds at 12 perecent .
But they had risen slightly from the weekend because organization 's heart monitor determined she had n't had made any missteps over the last severals days citing a collection of polls that showed her with modest gains .
She rose four points in Gallup 's latest poll but that was balanced by several key endorsements that Obama recently received .
The New Observer reported that Obama was expected to win a couple of North Carolina endorsement 's this week .
Slate promised to " adjust Clinton 's odds as polls waver , surrogates resign , superdelegates bail , and , of course , voters vote .
We 'll also keep an eye on indicators like fundraising , political futures , media coverage ( always reliable ) , and the wind chill factor in Scranton , Pa . "
Not everyone agrees with Slate 's assessment .
Intrade , today , gave Clinton a 14.8 percent chance of winning compared to an 82 percent for Obama .
Despite the predictions Clinton seems unlikely to die quietly .
" When it comes to finishing the fight , Rocky and I have a lot in common .
I never quit .
I never give up .
And neither do the American people , " she told a group of union supports this morning in Philadelphia , according to the New York Times .
The monks pressed around the foreign journalists at the temple
Footage of the monks Tibeten monks have disrupted a tour of Lhasa by foreign journalists .
The journalists were the first to be allowed back to Tibet since protests erupted two weeks ago .
About 30 monks shouted pro-Tibetan slogans and defended the Dalai Lama as journalists toured the Jokhang Temple , the visiting reporters said .
China has accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the protests , but the US has urged Beijing to begin dialogue with Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .
Foreign journalists were expelled from Tibet at the height of the unrest , but on Wednesday China allowed a group of about two dozen reporters into Lhasa for a three - day escorted visit .
The BBC 's request to be included in the group was turned down .
The monks ' protest came as they toured the Jokhang Temple - one of Tibet 's holiest shrines .
One monk shouted " Tibet is not free , Tibet is not free " before he started to cry , an AP journalist at the scene , Charles Hutzler , reported .
Another monk said the rioting on 14 March " had nothing to do with the Dalai Lama " .
China has increased its security presence in Lhasa since the unrest
The monks said they had not been allowed to leave the temple since the rioting .
Government handlers told the journalists to leave and tried to pull them away , the reporter said .
Later , the area around the Jokhang Temple was sealed off by riot police .
The protests began on 10 March and developed into violent rioting in Lhasa before spreading to neighbouring regions .
China says 19 people were killed by rioters .
The Tibetan government - in - exile says about 140 people have been killed in a crackdown by Chinese security forces .
' Divided city '
The group of journalists has also visited a medical clinic and a clothing store , where Chinese authorities say five girls were trapped and burned to death , AP 's reporter added .
It certainly seems like a damaged city
Charles Hutzler , Associated Press
In quotes : reporters in Tibet A reporter for the London - based Financial Times , meanwhile , said that the Tibetan quarter of the city resembled a war zone , with burnt - out buildings , shuttered businesses and groups of soldiers on every corner .
" The smell of burning buildings still hangs in the air nearly two weeks after violent rioting swept through the old Tibetan quarter of Lhasa , " the Financial Times 's Geoff Dyer reported .
The rioting appeared to have been more prolonged and destructive than previously thought , he wrote .
Charles Hutzler described to the BBC a city divided .
The journalists will spend three days in Lhasa " In sort of the more recently built up , very Chinese part of Lhasa , life seems to be going on fairly normally , " he said .
" But in the older , Tibetan section of the town and the blocks leading to it we could see the remains of burnt - out buildings . "
The reporters said there was a heavy security presence in the Tibetan quarter , with squads of police and soldiers on every corner .
But in the new town , they described life as returning to a semblance of normality , with shops and restaurants busy with customers .
Treading carefully On Wednesday , US President George Bush had " encouraged the Chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama 's representatives , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
But the fact that it has taken Mr Bush this long to talk directly to Mr Hu shows that the US is treading carefully in its response , says the BBC's Jonathan Beale in Washington .
Despite calls from rights groups for an Olympic boycott , the White House has already made it clear that Mr Bush will still attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Games .

Man talking on cell phone killed by train in San Leandro
( 12-05 ) 17:02 PST SAN LEANDRO - A pedestrian apparently absorbed in a cell phone call was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in San Leandro today after he walked around a lowered crossing gate and onto the tracks , authorities said .
The victim , a man who was not immediately identified , was struck at 12:30 p.m. by a northbound Capitol Corridor train at the Alvarado Street crossing , about 8 miles south of the Oakland station , Amtrak spokeswoman Vernae Graham said .
None of the 20 passengers or crew aboard the train was injured .
That train and two others were delayed and another Capitol Corridor train was cancelled , Graham said .
Crew members aboard the Sacramento - bound train told authorities they saw the victim talking on the cell phone before he was struck , Graham said .
The warning lights and gates at the crossing were functioning properly , she added .
The evidence on mobile phone safety has been contradictory
The study , funded by mobile phone companies , suggests radiation from the handset can cause insomnia , headaches and confusion .
It may also cut our amount of deep sleep - interfering with the body 's ability to refresh itself .
The study was carried out by Sweden 's Karolinska Institute and Wayne State University in the US .
This research suggests that if you need to make a make a phone call in the evening it is much better to use a land line
Alasdair Philips
Powerwatch
Funded by the Mobile Manufacturers Forum , the scientists studied 35 men and 36 women aged between 18 and 45 .
Some were exposed to radiation equivalent to that received when using a mobile phone , others were placed in the same conditions , but given only " sham " exposure .
Those exposed to radiation took longer to enter the first of the deeper stages of sleep , and spent less time in the deepest one .
The scientists concluded : " The study indicates that during laboratory exposure to 884 MHz wireless signals components of sleep believed to be important for recovery from daily wear and tear are adversely affected . "
Researcher Professor Bengt Arnetz said : " The study strongly suggests that mobile phone use is associated with specific changes in the areas of the brain responsible for activating and coordinating the stress system . "
Another theory is that radiation may disrupt production of the hormone melatonin , which controls the body 's internal rhythms .
Electrosensitivity
About half the people in the study believed themselves to be " electrosensitive " , reporting symptoms such as headaches and impaired cognitive function from mobile phone use .
But they proved to be unable to tell if they had been exposed to the radiation in the test .
Alasdair Philips is director of Powerwatch , which researches the effects of electromagnetic fields on health .
He said : " The evidence is getting stronger that we should treat these things in a precautionary way .
" This research suggests that if you need to make a phone call in the evening it is much better to use a land line , and do n't have your mobile by your bedside table . "
Mike Dolan , executive director of the Mobile Operators Association , said the study was inconsistent with other research .
He said : " It is really one small piece in a very large scientific jigsaw .
It is a very small effect , one researcher likened it to less than the effect you would see from a cup of coffee . "
Last September a major six - year study by the UK Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme ( MTHRP ) concluded that mobile phone use posed no short - term risk to the brain .
However , the researchers said they could not rule out the possibility that long - term use may raise the risk of cancer .
In the UK , mobile services operate within the frequency ranges 872 to 960 MHz , 1710 to 1875 MHz and 1920 to 2170 MHz .
Engraved Invitation - To Steal
By L. Neil Smith
My high school German teacher was from a family that moved to the United States prior to the First World War and settled in New York .
When war came , someone threw a brick through their store window , but they survived that , and the Second World War when it came along , as well .
One summer ( in the 1960s ) she took her husband and two daughters to Europe , partly to visit relatives she 'd never met , but with whom her own family had kept in touch over the years .
I suppose she already knew that most of them lived in a town only a handful of miles away from one of the famous Nazi deathcamps -- I can't remember now which one .
She was apalled when her relatives all claimed that , even at the height of the camp 's activity , none of them suspected what was going on there , even as the ashes from the ovens settled on their rooftops and windowsills .
One relative had a shop where he manufactured metal hooks of the kind they hang sides of beef from in a slaughterhouse , or the carcasses of pigs , but even he claimed ignorance -- although the Nazis had ordered hundreds of these hooks for delivery to the camp , and they were the wrong size for sides of beef or the carcasses of pigs .
That was back in the days when we thought " It Can't Happen Here " .
A civilization never arrives at a place like this without plenty of baby steps taken toward it .
Not only was n't Rome built in a day , it did n't collapse in a day , either .
Neither did the British Empire nor the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .
And the roots of the War Between the States stretch down and deep to well before the American Revolution .
America has taken plenty of those baby steps , especially recently .
Perhaps the most disgusting footprint to be seen in the last few years appeared on an offical government website offering " federal business opportunities " to vendors .
It immediately made me think of that German hookmaker .
The federal agency in question was the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Tobacco -- that fine , upstanding example of government " help " that we all remember so well from their part in the massacre of dozens of innocent men , women , and children at Mount Carmel near Waco , not to mention their racist company picnic , the Good Ol ' Boy Roundup , or the fact that their principal stock in trade is enforcing a 40 year old unconstitutional law cribbed directly from the above - mentioned Nazis .
These are the same worthies who are instructed by their bosses to lie in court if that 's what it takes to get a conviction , who employ " testing procedures " -- with no written or objectively established protocols -- to incriminate innocent gun owners , and who think nothing of destroying the businesses of gun dealers based on questionable evidence .
What these latterday goose - steppers wanted , from the lowest bidder willing to supply them , was 2000 Leatherman Micra combination tools .
http://www.fbo.gov/spg/DOJ/BATF/APMD/........2003.html
And to learn more about the BATFE , see The Gang , a documentary produced by Jews of the Preservation of Firearms Ownership that will open your eyes to the criminality of this runaway agency .
Click on http://www.thegangmovie.com
I happen to like Leatherman tools a lot .
It 's fairly likely you do , too .
I carry two of them myself , the original model ( with needle - nose pliers ) and the little Micra model ( with scissors ) .
I use them both every day .
My family all have them and we 've given a great many as gifts .
Some folks think they 're a bit pricey , and prefer cheaper , often foreign imitators , but as a machinist , I greatly prefer the real thing .
That 's one of the reasons that I found this website thoroughly annoying , even though the actual transaction appears to have occurred several months ago , in November of 2007 .
ATF wanted their Micras blue ( mine are stainless ) , and they wanted them especially engraved , to wit :
ATF - Asset Forfeiture
and
Always Think Forfeiture
Now what , I pretend to hear you asking , is " asset forfeiture " , and why is any of this worth writing an essay ?
My lawyers friends tell me ( yes , I have actual lawyer friends ) that it 's a process which has been around throughout all of American history , one of those peculiar , all - too - convenient leftovers from medieval Europe that , like sovereign immunity , we should have pitched in the garbage when the Constitution got itself written ( I sort of thought we had with the Fourth and Fifth Amendments ) .
Basically , the government has the legal power to steal anything from you it wants to steal , for any reason it wants to , or even no reason at all , and it never has to give any of it back , even if you are proven innocent of whatever they accused you of , and sometimes even if a judge orders them to cough your property up .
After all , does n't the President himself say the Constitution 's " just a piece of paper " ?
This extremely ancient form of corruption , probably already old when Sumerian cops were filching apples from the marketplace , got an enormous boost back in the 1980s , when the federales were having a difficult time prosecuting individuals for various things that would never have been crimes in the first place , in a truly decent , free society .
The problem , the feds reasoned in their dimwitted way , was lawyers -- in that their victims usually had them .
Maybe if they took away their victims ' money ( and anything else that was n't nailed own ) before they prosecuted them , they could n't afford lawyers and would be easier to prosecute .
It would be so much easier than going to all that fuss and bother of having to trump up charges , fake evidence , play footsies with the media , intimidate witnesses , stack juries , and find malleable judges .
Best of all , the stolen goods go to the agency that steals them .
The local highway cops have a racy firebird they stole this way from somebody a few years ago and then disfigured with a police paint job featuring the acronym D.A.R.E..
Like any thieves , they love showing it off .
I 've been told they take it around to all the schools to teach kids that theft is perfectly okay if you fill out the right paperwork .
Every time I see it out on the street I have to resist the impulse to vomit .
But I digress .
If you have n't figured it out by now , what those engraved Micras represent is a " sales tool " , of the kind some corporations hand out to their field personnel .
You 've seen the stuff yourself , cheap ballpoint pens , rulers , staple removers , all with jaunty little slogans printed on them to keep that sales force perky and productive .
Sometimes they 're gifts for customers -- drug outfits give all kinds of junk to physicians -- sometimes they 're a reminder to the sales people themselves .
Except that the government does n't have to settle merely for cheap ballpoint pens , because they 're doing it all with your money and mine .
And what they 're reminding their " sales force " to do is to steal all that they possibly can , as a first , highest priority that supersedes investigations , arrests , or any of that other irritating " due process " junk .
It 's like Attila the Hun handing out decorative daggers to his barbarian hordes engraved with " Always remember , loot before you burn ! "
That 's what we 've come to .

We 're still waiting on the Roger Clemens and Mindy McCready sex tape - seriously , would anyone be surprised by that at this point - but , in the meantime , the following news will have to suffice :
Vivid Entertainment claims to possess a Jimi Hendrix sex tape .
The tape is 45 minutes long and you can watch a clip of it at TMZ .
Reportedly , the FBI probably has an entire library full of vintage videos such as this .
We can't wait until they come out with a Neil Diamond sex tape .
Google has lots to do with intelligence A LITTLE INTELLIGENCE : Firm working with spying groups , other big government agencies
When the nation 's intelligence agencies wanted a computer network to better share information about everything from al Qaeda to North Korea , they turned to a big name in the technology industry to supply some of the equipment : Google Inc .
The Mountain View company sold the agencies servers for searching documents , marking a small victory for the company and its little - known effort to do business with the government .
" We are a very small group , and even a lot of people in the federal government do n't know that we exist , " said Mike Bradshaw , who leads Google 's federal government sales team and its 18 employees .

The strategy is part of a broader plan at Google to expand beyond its consumer roots .
Federal , state and local agencies , along with corporations and schools , are increasingly seen by the company as lucrative sources of extra revenue .
In addition to the intelligence agencies , Google 's government customers include the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration , the U.S. Coast Guard , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , the state of Alabama and Washington , D.C .
Many of the contracts are for search appliances - servers for storing and searching internal documents .
Agencies can use the devices to create their own mini-Googles on intranets made up entirely of government data .
Additionally , Google has had success licensing a souped - up version of its aerial mapping service , Google Earth .
Agencies can use it to plot scientific data and chart the U.S. coastline , for example , giving ships another tool to navigate safely .
Spy agencies are using Google equipment as the backbone of Intellipedia , a network aimed at helping agents share intelligence .
Rather than hoarding information , spies and analysts are being encouraged to post what they learn on a secure online forum where colleagues can read it and add comments .
" Each analyst , for lack of a better term , has a shoe box with their knowledge , " said Sean Dennehy , chief of Intellipedia development for the CIA .
" They maintained it in a shared drive or a Word document , but we 're encouraging them to move those platforms so that everyone can benefit . "
Like Wikipedia
The system is modeled after Wikipedia , the public online , group - edited encyclopedia .
However , the cloak - and - dagger version is maintained by the director of national intelligence and is accessible only to the CIA , FBI , National Security Agency and an alphabet soup of other intelligence agencies and offices .
Agents can log in , depending on their clearance , to Intellipedia 's three tiers of service : top secret , secret and sensitive but unclassified .
So far , 37,000 users have established accounts on the network , which contain 35,000 articles encompassing 200,000 pages , according to Dennehy .
Google supplies the computer servers that support the network , as well as the search software that allows users to sift through messages and data .
Dennehy declined to asses the quality of Google 's products , but he applauded the contribution that Intellipedia can make to the government 's work .
Whether the network actually leads to better intelligence will largely depend on agents sharing some of their most important files and then their colleagues chiming in with incisive commentary - issues that are out of Google 's hands .
Normally , Google ranks results on its consumer site by using the number of links to a Web page as a barometer of its importance .
Doing so on Intellipedia is n't as effective because the service lies behind a firewall and is used by a limited number of people .
Instead , material gets more prominent placement if it is tagged , or appended by the network 's users , with descriptive keywords .
Because of the complexities of doing business with the government , Google uses resellers to process orders on its behalf .
Google takes care of the sales , marketing and management of the accounts .
Conspiracy theories
Google is one of many technology vendors vying for government contracts .
A single deal can be sizable , such as the one Google made with the National Security Agency , which paid more than $ 2 million for four search appliances plus a support agreement , according to a contract obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request .
However , the amount is insignificant when measured against Google 's overall revenue of $ 16.6 billion last year , virtually all of which came from online advertising .
On occasion , Google is the target of conspiracy theories from bloggers who say it is working with spy agencies more closely than simply selling search equipment .
The buzz got so loud two years ago that Matt Cutts , who leads Google 's fight against spam Web sites , responded by ridiculing the idea in his personal blog .
Google 's Bradshaw emphasized that the company sells virtually the same products to companies as it does to government agencies .
Google can make minor tweaks to comply with government rules about equipment security , for example , while major customization is handled by others .
" There were some wild accusations , " Bradshaw said .
" But everything we do with the government is the same as what we do with our corporate customers . "

Educating the Next Generation
JB : Do you think programmers should be " armed and dangerous " with their tools like compilers , editors , debuggers , linkers , version control systems and so on very early on in their learning or careers ?
Do you think that universities should teach debugging and how to program in a certain environment ( e.g. Unix ) as well , for example ?
BS : I 'm not 100 % sure I understand the question , but I think " yes . "
I do n't think that it should be possible to graduate with a computer science , computer engineering , etc. degree without having used the basic tools you mention above for a couple of major projects .
However , it is possible .
In some famous universities , I have observed that Computer Science is the only degree you can get without writing a program .
I 'm not arguing for mere training .
The use of tools must not be a substitute for a good understanding of the principles of programming .
Someone who knows all the power - tools well , but not the fundamental principles of software development would indeed be " armed and dangerous . "
Let me point to algorithms , data structures , and machine architecture as essentials .
I 'd also like to see a good understanding of operating systems and networking .
Some educators will point out that all of that — together with ever - popular and useful topics such as graphics and security — does n't fit into a four - year program for most students .
Something will have to give !
I agree , but I think what should give is the idea that four years is enough to produce a well - rounded software developer :
Let 's aim to make a five - or - six - year masters the first degree considered sufficient .
JB : What should C++ programmers or any programmer do , in your view , before sitting down to write a substantial software program ?
BS : Think .
Discuss with colleagues and potential users .
Get a good first - order understanding of the problem domain .
If possible , try to be a user of an existing system in that field .
Then , without too much further agonizing , try to build a simplified system to try out the fundamental ideas of a design .
That " simplified system " might become a throwaway experiment or it may become the nucleus of a complete system .
I 'm a great fan of the idea of " growing " a system from simpler , less complete , but working and tested systems .
To try out all the tool chains before making too grand plans .
How would the programmer , designer , team get those " fundamental ideas of a design " ?
Experience , knowledge of similar systems , of tools , and of libraries is a major part of the answer .
The idea of a single developer carefully planning to write a system from the bare programming language has realistically been a myth for decades .
David
Wheeler wrote the first paper about how to design libraries in 1951 — 56 years ago !
JB : What type of programs do you personally enjoy writing ?
What programs have you written recently ?
BS : These days I do n't get enough time to write code , but I think writing libraries is the most fun .
I wrote a small library supporting N - dimensional arrays with the usual mathematical operations .
I have also been playing with regular expressions using the ( draft ) C++0 x library ( the boost.org version ) .
I also write a lot of little programs to test aspects of the language , but that 's more work than fun , and also small programs to explore application domains that I have n't tried or have n't tried lately .
It is a rare week that I do n't write some code .
JB : In your experience , have there been any features of C++ that newcomers to the language have had the most difficulty with ?
Would you have any advice for newcomers to C++ or have you found a way of teaching difficult features of C++ saving students a lot of trial and error ?
BS : Some trial and error is inevitable , and may even be good for the newcomer , but yes I have some experience introducing C++ to individuals and organizations — some of it successful .
I do n't think it 's the features that are hard to learn , it is the understanding of the programming paradigms that cause trouble .
I 'm continuously amazed at how novices ( of all backgrounds and experiences ) come to C++ with fully formed and firm ideas of how the language should be used .
For example , some come convinced that any techniques not easily used in C is inherently wrongheaded , hard to use , and very inefficient .
It 's amazing what people are willing to firmly assert without measurements and often based on briefly looking at C++ a decade ago using a compiler that was hardly out of beta — or simply based on other people 's assertions without checking if they have a basis in reality .
Conversely , there is now a generation who is firmly convinced that a program is only well - designed if just about everything is part of a class hierarchy and just about every decision is delayed to run-time .
Obviously programs written by these " true OO " programmers become the best arguments for the " stick to C " programmers .
Eventually , a " true OO " programmer will find that C++ has many features that do n't serve their needs and that they indeed fail to gain that fabled efficiency .
To use C++ well , you have to use a mix of techniques ; to learn C++ without undue pain and unnecessary effort , you must see how the language features serve the programming styles ( the programming paradigms ) .
Try to see concepts of an application as classes .
It 's not really hard when you do n't worry too much about class hierarchies , templates , etc. until you have to .
Learn to use the language features to solve simple programs at first .
That might sound trivial , but I receive many questions from people who have " studied C++ " for a couple of weeks and are seriously confused by examples of multiple inheritance using names like B1 , B2 , D , D2 , f , and mf .
They are — usually without knowing it — trying to become language lawyers rather than programmers .
I do n't need multiple inheritance all that often , and certainly not the tricky parts .
It is far more important to get a feel for writing a good constructor to establish an invariant and understand when to define a destructor and copy operations .
My point is that the latter is almost instantly useful and not difficult ( I can teach it to someone who has never programmed after a month ) .
The finer details of inheritance and templates , on the other hand , are almost impenetrable until you have a real - world program that needs it .
In The Art of Computer Programming Don Knuth apologizes for not giving good examples of co-routines , because their advantages are not obvious in small programs .
Many C++ features are like that in that :
They do n't make sense until you face a problem of the kind and scale that needs that feature .
JB : Do you have any suggestions for people who are not programmers and want to learn how to program , and want to learn C++ as their first language ?
For instance , there 's a book called Accelerated C++ : Practical Programming by Example by Andrew Koenig and Barbara E. Moo .
This book 's approach is to teach by using the STL and advanced features at an early stage , like using strings , vectors and so on , with the aim of writing " real " programs faster .
Would you agree that it 's best to begin " the C++ way " if you could call it that , instead of starting off with a strictly procedural style and leaving classes , the Standard Library and other features often preceded with " an introduction to OOP " much later in a book ?
BS : I have had to consider this question " for real " and have had the opportunity to observe the effects of my theories .
I designed and repeatedly taught a freshman programming course at Texas A&M University .
I use standard library features , such as string , vector , and sort , from the first week .
I do n't emphasize STL ; I just use the facilities to have better types with which to introduce the usual control structures and programming techniques .
I emphasize correctness and error handling from day 1 .
I show how to build a couple of simple types in lecture 6 ( week three ) .
I show much of the mechanisms for defining classes in lectures 8 and 9 together with the ways of using them .
By lecture 10 and 11 , I have the students using iostreams on files .
By then , they are tired , but can read a file of structured temperature data and extract information from it .
They can do it 6 weeks after seeing their first line of code .
I emphasize the use of classes as a way of structuring code to make it easier to get right .
After that comes graphics , including some use of class hierarchies , and then comes the STL .
Yes , you can do that with complete beginners in a semester .
We have by now done that for more than 1,000 students .
The reason for putting the STL after graphics is purely pedagogical : after iostreams the students are thoroughly tired of " calculations and CS stuff , " but doing graphics is a treat !
The fact that they need the basics of OOP to do that graphics is a minor detail .
They can now graph the data read and fill class objects from a GUI interface .
JB : I read an interview in Texas A&M Engineering Magazine where you said , " I decided to design a first programming course after seeing how many computer science students — including students from top schools — lacked fundamental skills needed to design and implement quality software ... "
What were these fundamental skills students lacked , and what did you put in your programming course to address this issue ?
BS : I saw so many students who simply did n't have the notion that code itself is a topic of interest and that well - structured code is a major time saver .
The notion of organizing code to be sure that it is correct and maybe even for someone else to use and modify is alien :
They see code as simply something needed to hand in the answers to an exercise .
I am of course not talking about all students or just students from one university or from one country .
In my course I heavily emphasize structure , correctness , and define the purpose of the course as " becoming able to produce code good enough for the use of others . "
I use data structures and algorithms , but the topic of the course is " programming " not fiddling with pointers to implement a doubly linked list .
And yes , I do teach pointers , arrays , and casts , but not until well after strings , vectors , and class design .
You need to give the students a feel of the machine as well as the mechanisms to make the ( correct ) use of the machine simple .
This also reflects comments I have repeatedly had from industry : that they have a shortage of developers who understand " the machine " and " systems . "
JB : You have said that a programmer must be able to think clearly , understand questions and express solutions .
This is in agreement with G. Polya 's thesis that you must have a clear and complete understanding of a question before you can ever hope to solve it .
Would you recommend supplementary general reading like G. Polya 's book , How to Solve It along with reading books on programming and technique ?
If so , what books would you recommend ?
BS : I avoid teaching " how to think . "
I suspect that 's best taught through lots of good examples .
So I give lots of good examples ( to set a standard ) including examples of gradual development of a program from early imperfect versions .
I 'm not saying anything against Polya 's ideas , but I do n't have the room for it in my approach .
The problem with designing a course ( or a curriculum ) is more what to leave out than what to add .
JB : What are the most useful mathematical skills , generally , that a programmer should have an understanding of if they intend to become professional , in your view ?
Or would there be different mathematical skills a programmer should know for different programmers and different tasks ?
If this is the case could you give examples ?
BS : I do n't know .
I think of math as a splendid way to learn to think straight .
Exactly what math to learn and exactly where what kinds of math can be applied is secondary to me .

When I was a student at Berkeley I would often grab lunch on Telegraph Avenue .
This usually meant walking through Sproul Plaza and contending with at least a dozen pamphlet - pushing students pleading for my support for an environmental cause or ballot issue or sport ’s team or you - name - it .
I did n’t mind so much – after all , it was Berkeley and it was part of the exictement of the place and of college in general .
But I often asked “ how . ”
That is , how did these students choose – out of all of the noise – what issue , what approach , and what people with which to engage ?
Why was this girl handing me a flyer for an upcoming political rally while that guy wanted me to attend his interfaith forum ?
With so little time in college , or life , how do we decide where we put our energy ?
Are we rational about it ?
Do passions move us ?
Is it a combination or something else entirely ?
Earlier this week Natalie Angier wrote about Change Blindness for the New York Times , and I think it provides clues to the mechanism our minds employ to focus on one thing or another :
The mechanisms that succeed in seizing our sightline fall into two basic classes : bottom up and top down .
Bottom - up attentiveness originates with the stimulus , with something in our visual field that is the optical equivalent of a shout : a wildly waving hand , a bright red object against a green field .
Bottom - up stimuli seem to head straight for the brainstem and are almost impossible to ignore , said Nancy Kanwisher , a vision researcher at M.I.T. , and thus they are popular in Internet ads .
Top - down attentiveness , by comparison , is a volitional act , the decision by the viewer that an item , even in the absence of flapping parts or strobe lights , is nonetheless a sight to behold .
When you are looking for a specific object — say , your black suitcase on a moving baggage carousel occupied largely by black suitcases — you apply a top - down approach , the bouncing searchlights configured to specific parameters , like a smallish , scuffed black suitcase with one broken wheel .
This leads me to believe that , at least in part , we are either attracted to movements in a bottom - up fashion because they are the loudest , most popular , most frightening or most interesting OR in a top - down fashion , where we ignore the flashing lights and shouting pundits and pressure from friends and instead search within ourselves , think critically about what the world truly needs and what we can best offer , and then go and search for that cause .
And we do n’t become dismayed even if , when we find it , the thing we ’re looking for is a bit scuffed and has a broken wheel .
The NY Times article concludes :
“ Our spotlight of attention is grabbing objects at such a fast rate that introspectively it feels like you ’re recognizing many things at once , ” Dr. Wolfe said .
“ But the reality is that you are only accurately representing the state of one or a few objects at any given moment . ”
As for the rest of our visual experience , he said , it has been aptly called “ a grand illusion . ”
If we can only truly focus on one thing at a time – one perspective , if you will – then what a pity if our calling exists outside our current frame of reference , and when it asks for a moment of our time on Sproul we dismiss it as nothing more than a grand illusion .

Who is Japan ’s little known rice growin ’
financial hotshot ?
Who is Japan ’s little known rice growin ’financial hotshot ?
The UK has it ’s first bank run in 150 years .
Citibank fired it ’s CEO .
The whole financial world is reeling from the financial mess called subprime ( see here for our easy to understand footnote on subprime ) .
Even GM ( last I checked they made cars and not houses ! ) has been forced to book a multi-billion dollar loss due to subprime .
While hedge fund managers are collapsing left , right and centre , could there possibly be a Saviour ?
What ’s that I see on the horizon ?
Is it a bird ?
Is it a plane ?
No … it ’s a Japanese farmer !???
This sort of turmoil in the international financial market is unusual .
In July Ben Bernanke , head of the US Fed , saw subprime losses reaching $ 100 billion US dollars .
By early October , most market watchers had increased this figure to $ 400 billion US dollars .
And with yet another collapse in asset backed securities ( ABS ) prices in the last few weeks , the growth in the turmoil seems to be growing again .
Perhaps what has been scarier has been the vast number of “ respectable ” financial institutions who have been hit .
I ’m still amazed that Bear Stearns was forced to go crying to the Chinese government for a bail out after its two hedge funds blew up over subprime .
First Merrill Lynch and now Citibank announce huge multi-billion dollar write - offs for losses in the subprime investments that they claimed they never had .
While we have n’t seen that many losses amongst Japanese financial institutions , the share prices of Japanese banks have collapsed on the assumption that they inevitably have lost a lot of money on subprime , but they probably just have n’t realized it themselves yet .
( Three cheers for Japanese corporate governance standards ! )
So why , you ask , is stippy.com boring you with a commentary on the subtleties of losses by US investment banks in exotic derivatives crafted around the hopes and dreams of rural Americans who thought that their home prices would continue to rise for ever ?
Well there is one Japanese organization who has been taking an active roll in this financial ponzi scheme and they are not taking the losses sitting down .
In stark contract to the Yanks who are all too keen to take samurai style responsibility and resign after such losses ( think Chuck Prince at Citibank ) , you wo n’t see a single person at this mysterious Japanese organization do anything like that .
In fact they are standing up , and taking the losses in the stomach like Asashoryu ( 朝青龍） when he ’s playing soccer back in Korea ( bad example maybe ? ) .
Who am I talking about ?
I ’m talking about the proverbial Mr. Watanabe from the inaka , our friendly neighbourhood farmer .
A little confused ?
It ’s a little known secret , that Japan ’s farmers control one of the largest banks in the world .
With 68 trillion yen of assets , the Norinchukin Bank ( 農林中金 ) has been one of the biggest Asian players in the bank rolling of credit to subprime lenders .
You do n’t regularly borrow money from your local rice growers , you say ?
Relative Size of Japanese Banks ( Unit : Trillions of Yen )
Norin Chukin is the second largest bank in Japan in order of deposits .
Even larger than the Mizuho and only smaller than MUFG who cheats
a little by including an American bank in its figures .
( Unit : Trillions of Yen ) Norin Chukin is the second largest bank in Japan in order of deposits .
Even larger than the Mizuho and only smaller than MUFG who cheatsa little by including an American bank in its figures .
Norinchukin often hides behind the better known face of its sister bank , JA bank , the official window to the farmers of Japan .
While it plasters its homepage with the word agrifinance ( 担い手金融、ninaite kin’yu） pretending to be the financier to the farmer , in reality it dedicates only a tiny portion of its time ( and less than 20 % of its assets ! ) to lending money at all .
In reality it ( and the fishery bank and the forestry bank ) channels the vast majority of it ’s assets to the Norinchukin to manage .
Why lend to a local farmer yen for 1~2 % interest when the Norinchukin will help you earn double digit returns lending dollars to un-creditworthy American workers ?
Given that the JA bank has about 80 trillion yen ( $ 750 billion US dollars ! ) of farmers deposits , it ’s no surprise that they need a dedicated body to work out how to manage these funds .
When I first read that the Norinchukin Bank had lost about 500 million US dollars in the first half of this year in subprime related investment , I have to confess that I was a little condescending .
After all ,
What more could you expect from a bunch of imokusai country bumpkins dabbling in the financial matters of American blue collar workers ?
What stopped me in my tracks was this thread on 2 channel , Japan ’s leading BBS site .
At first I thought I ’d misread it ( after all it is in Japanese ) .
But no , even after a second appraisal it seems that the guys at Norinchukin are potentially the ballsiest farmers in the world .
Not only did they admit that they have invested over 4 trillion yen in various securitized derivatives to date , the head of bond trading has signalled to the market that the bank is going to invest another 3 trillion yen into this troubled market before the end of the year !
When every single Western bank is racing to hedge their exposure to subprime by purchasing vast quantities of credit default swaps , it seems that the only investor with enough confidence to stick up for himself , fight back , protect his position and buy more ( a true example of 逆張り , gyakubari ) is this odd collection of Japanese farmers .
That man – a 3 trillion yen big swinging dick – I take my hat off to .
The ability to take risk is the best definition of a professional investor .
Think back to the famous Chandler brothers from New Zealand who had the guts to buy 5 % of UFJ Bank back in February ‘ 04 ( full story here ) .
UFJ ’s share price had fallen 90 % in two years and it was market consensus that it and almost all other Japanese banks would go belly up .
The people who best knew Japan – the local investors – called them crazy but low and behold ( despite the stock falling 30 % in the month after they bought it ) , UFJ bank ’s share price then rallied 6 fold within the following 12 months .
Does something sound familiar ?
Domestic investors ( read Citibank , Merrill Lynch ) are panicking and selling / hedging out their exposure to sub prime .
As you can see from the chart below prices in all but the safest sub prime portfolios have fallen off a cliff steeper than the Mino waterfall ( 箕面滝 ) !
Unless you ’re a shareholder of Livedoor , I ’m sure you ’ll agree that losing 80 % of market value in such a short time is not common .
Remember , each of these lines represents a diversified portfolio of loans .
If the market thinks that all of those loans will be repaid without a problem then it should never trade below 100 ( which means 100 cents in the dollar or 100 % of the loan will be returned to the lender on maturity ) .
In other words , the market is trying to tell you ( and the Japanese farmers ) that 8/10 owners of houses whose mortgages make up the BBB - tranche will not be able to repay their loans .
They ’ll go bankrupt when they finally realise why they should have read the “ fine print ” before they signed off on the loan .
That ’s pretty extreme .
You can see why Norinchukin are getting excited .
If US housing prices pick up , enabling America ’s low income workers to escape bankruptcy then that red line should trend back to 100 .
Buy at 20 .
Sell at 100 .
Five times your money .
Very nice .
( Obviously the risk is that if you ’re wrong you lose everything , but let ’s not focus on the downside just yet ) .
Taking huge and controversial risks is nothing new to Norinchukin .
Not only do they have the biggest non-JGB ( Japanese Govt .
Bond ) portfolio of all banks , they are also by far and away the largest Japanese player in the “ alternative investment ” market ( otherwise known as hedge funds ) .
Although it is quite normal for Western banks and insurance companies to invest in a wide range of investment funds , the world of exotic finance ( read “ positive returns ” ) has been taboo in the deep , low backed , 1970s style leather seats that deck the boardrooms of Japanese banks .
Not so for our rice growing friends .
While Japanese banks spent the last five years trying to squeeze half a percent of interest out of their troubled borrowers , Norinchukin cut it ’s loan balance by a third and instead increased its investments in derivatives and funds by 50 % ( source ) .
In addition to a handy 15 trillion of investments in foreign debt related investments ( aka subprime ) , they also have another 15 trillion yen of “ alternative ” investments .
Between these two asset groups that accounts for almost half of their entire asset base .
I do n’t know about you but that makes my 401k pale in insignificance .
Norinchukin has been funnelling cash by the barrel load into hedge funds , private equity funds , subprime loans , etc for years .
I wonder how much longer they will get away with calling themselves a bank .
The “ real ” banks in Japan are too scared to take on these risks due to the high BIS penalty associated when calculating their regulatory capital ( in laymans terms , they do n’t have the financial strength to withstand the potential losses from anything riskier than a Japanese government bond ) .
It was these same “ real ” bankers that thought the shift to Basel II would be enough to scare even Norinchukin from continuing its investment strategy but this gutsy proclamation to double up ( 難平買い , nannpinngai ) on subprime will prove them wrong .
It ’s rare that I take a step back and say “ wow ” with respect for the risk taking of Japanese management , but this is one of those times .
Farmers 1 . “ Real ” bankers 0 .
~☆~☆~☆~☆~☆~
Footnote : what is “ subprime ” ( 低所得者向け住宅ローン、いわゆるサブプライム問題とは？)
So what is subprime and why is what Norinchukin doing so amazingly risky ?
Let me try to describe the current problem with subprime ( and why it is given the nickname “ toxic waste ” ) .
Although we ’re used to low interest rates here in Japan , the low interest rates in the US for the past 10 years were unusual and triggered a perception that money was almost free .
Even people who had low incomes could afford to buy a house because the monthly repayments necessary were a very small part of their disposable income .
Land prices continued to rise ( did someone say bubble ?
not me ! ) , so it was unlikely that these borrowers would have any trouble repaying their loans .
Worst case scenario , you could sell your house for a profit to repay the loan .
Could n’t be simpler !
The concept was so popular that a bunch of cunning businessmen ( who had never worked at banks ) decided that they ’d make these loans available to even the lowest of income earners in America .
Because they did n’t know much about the business , they focused on the marketing of the loans .
I ’m sure you ’ve seen those annoying ads on the web :
No down payment required !
No proof of income required !
No repayment of principal needed !
Special discount interest rates !
Too good to be true ?
Of course it was .
But nobody even bothered to read the small print .
The “ special discount interest rates ” had a life - span of only 2 years .
Most of the loans had “ resets ” at the start of the third year that rocketed the interest rate up to over 10 % .
Even on these reduced “ special ” interest rates , these low income borrowers were on average paying away about 1/3 of their pre-tax incomes ( assuming of course they did n’t lie about their salary on the application form ) .
It should be no surprise to you now that most of the blue collar workers are going to struggling to foot the interest bill at the higher rates ( let alone the principal ) .
Oh and by the way , housing prices have been falling for the past year so their house is n’t even worth as much as it was when they bought it .
The vast majority of these loans were done in the three years between 2004 - 2006 .
As anyone who can do simple addition has probably already worked out , the “ special ” interest rates on those loans are going to be rest to “ normal ” rates , one by one between 2007 - 2009 .
It ’s no coincidence that the first of these reset periods coincided with the huge losses that American banks have been announcing since July .
But hold on a sec , just because a couple of home owners go bankrupt , the law of large numbers should mean that the losses are limited , right ?
This is where the magic of investment banks comes in .
American Investment banks aggressively bought all of these loans from the cunning marketers and created “ diversified ” funds that consisted of the loans to hundreds and hundreds of home buyers .
Better yet , in order to make these funds more attractive to their clients ( naive US banks , General Motors , Norinchukin etc ) they split the funds up into several tranches .
Each trance had it ’s own credit rating and you can see the price of each of those tranches on the chart ( with the coloured lines ) above in this article .
The pink AAA tranche ( the one that is only down a little bit ) is structured in such a way that you only lose money as an investor ( ie get less than 100 at maturity ) after 20 % or more of all of the home owners have gone bankrupt .
The green AA tranche is structured in such a way that you only lose money ( ie do n’t get your original 100 back ) after 15 % or more of all of the home owners have gone bankrupt ( but you lose all of your money if 20 % or more of the home owners have gone bankrupt ) .
The blue A tranche is structured in such a way that you only lose money after 9 % or more of all of the home owners have gone bankrupt ( but lose every dime if more than 15 % of home owners file for bankruptcy ) .
I think you are starting to get the picture .
Pretty much everything below A is known as toxic waste .
We then skip a few tranches , but the red BBB - tranche is structured in such a way that if more than 7 % of home owners go bankrupt then you will lose every grain of rice you invested in the fund .
( Check this website for more up to date prices on each of these tranches )
So why is it so risky investing in subprime now ?
Put simply , those friendly “ resets ” will continue at the same pace for at least the next 12 months if not more .
If we are already seeing huge numbers of personal bankruptcies after 2 - 3 months of resets , how will this be after we see the ” resets ” hit tens times as many home owners .
Things are going to get a lot uglier before they get better .
Finally , let me leave you with my favourite subprime quote out there .
It ’s from an Aussie called Nick Parsons ( from NAB ) , who was commenting on US treasury secretary , Hank Paulson ’s ( an ex- Goldman Sachs investment banker ) plan to bail out a bunch of these funds :
“ By insulating the junk from the sellers of junk , the holders of junk should be spared the problems of junk .
The one flaw in this cunning plan , however , would be if investors took fright at being reminded just how much junk is still in the system . ”
I guess that is what we have Japanese farmers for .
Competitive types who get a buzz from climbing the social ladder also feel more pain when they plummet to a lesser rung .
That 's according to new research suggesting our brains are hard - wired for hierarchy .
Researchers from the National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) set up an artificial social hierarchy , or ranking , in which 72 participants were assigned a status representing their supposed skills at a computer game .
Then , participants saw pictures and scores of an inferior and a superior player .
Brain scans showed that when a superior player 's image popped up , participants ' brains were activated in areas thought to guide interpersonal judgments and social status — basically , sizing up others .
When a participant outperformed a superior " other player , " brain regions responsible for action planning were activated .
Brain regions linked to emotional pain and frustration showed activity in participants when they performed worse than a supposed inferior player .
Participants also answered questionnaires throughout the game .
Turns out , the " high " that a person feels at the top of the hierarchy can turn into a major downer at the bottom .
Individuals who reported more elation while at the top also showed increased activity in the brain 's emotional - pain circuitry when they performed worse than another player , threatening their status .
" Such activation of emotional - pain circuitry may underlie a heightened risk for stress - related health problems among competitive individuals , " said study team member Andreas Meyer - Lindenberg of NIMH .
The NIMH - funded study will be detailed in the April 24 issue of the journal Neuron .
CANBERRA , Australia -- Runners bearing the Olympic torch completed a 10 - mile relay through the Australian capital Thursday , cheered by thousands waving Chinese flags and unimpeded by pockets of pro-Tibet protests that led to several arrests .
Crowds lined downtown streets for the Canberra relay on the cool and sunny autumn day as police manned crowd - control barriers , making good on a vow that nothing would stop the torch from finishing its journey .
The event began without major incident as a half - dozen officers -- in jogging pants , T - shirts and baseball caps -- formed a loose cordon around the runner .
Overhead , an airplane sky writer wrote the words " Free Tibet " in white letters .
A momentary scare came an hour into the relay when a man leaped out from the crowd and sat cross - legged about 35 feet in front of the runner .
Police quickly hauled him away and the runner did n't stop .
It was the closest any protester came to the torch , which was carried through Canberra 's wide tree - lined boulevards by 80 runners .
Nearly three hours after the start , five - time gold medal winner Ian Thorpe completed the final leg by lighting a ceremonial cauldron .
Officials claimed a victory because it largely avoided the chaotic protest scenes that marred the portions held in Europe and the United States .
" We obviously feared the worst , " local government spokesman Jeremy Lasek said .
" We feel right now relieved but elated -- we think we 've pulled it off . "
Protests of China 's human rights record and its crackdown on anti-government activists in Tibet have turned the relay into a contentious issue for the Olympic movement .
Many countries have changed routes and boosted security along the flame 's six - continent journey to the Aug. 8 - 24 games in Beijing .
Officials estimated more than 10,000 people -- mostly China supporters -- attended the relay route and parks in Canberra .
China supporters strongly outnumbered those carrying Tibetan flags or placards criticizing Beijing 's human rights record .
At some places , chanting of " One China " broke out .
At others , eager supporters waving Chinese banners tried to keep up with the relay .
Away from the route , three Tibetan women blocked the street in front of Parliament and a protester shouted " stop killing in Tibet . "
Police led all four away .
Shortly before the start , dozens of China supporters faced off against a group carrying blue - colored flags representing the China 's Muslim minority Uighurs and minor scuffling erupted .
Police said at least one person was arrested .
Soon afterward , Tibetan activists set alight a Chinese flag and one person was arrested .
At one point , three protesters jumped crowd - control barricades and walked along the route waving " Free Tibet " signs .
They were chased by a larger group carrying Chinese flags that tried to cover up the signs with the flags .
" They mobbed the sign .
They were really aggressive , insulting and swearing , " said Marion Vecourcay , one of the activists .
Seven people in total were detained during the day and will likely face charges of causing a public disturbance , said police spokeswoman Laura Keating .
Pro-Tibet groups said about 500 people showed up in Canberra for peaceful protests .
In response , Chinese student groups organized bus trips from Sydney and other cities for those wanting to support the relay .
" We did n't expect this reaction from the Chinese community which is obviously a well - coordinated plan to take the day by weight of numbers , " Ted Quinlan , the chief organizer of the Australia relay , told the Australian Broadcasting Corp .
Security had been boosted -- officials say the expense doubled in recent weeks to $ 1.9 million -- along a route that had been shortened .
But it still threaded along a 10 - mile path past Parliament House and within 200 yards of the Chinese Embassy .
George Farley , chairman of the Australia Tibet Council , had urged the crowd not to be violent , even if provoked .
There were small protests Wednesday in Sydney and Canberra with a handful of arrests .
In Nepal , authorities forced an American mountaineer with a " Free Tibet " banner in his bags off Mount Everest .

A man has been arrested in Malaysia for working as a dentist for 29 years with no medical training or qualifications .
He treated patients at his home in Kuala Lumpur , using a cast - off army dentist 's chair dating from the 1940s , the New Straits Times newspaper said .
Police and health officials raided the man 's apartment , acting on a tip , and found painkillers and syringes .
He said he had assisted an army dentist in the 1960s and 1970s by carrying his bag and had learned how to pull teeth .
" I watched the doctor diagnose and treat problems with teeth , " the New Straits Times quoted the man as saying when he was arrested .
" I also saw how he would extract teeth and make models and measurements for dentures to replace missing teeth . "
He said he had tried to find work as a dental assistant but when he was rejected as too old he set up his own practice , telling neighbours he was a retired army dentist .
He has been arrested for illegally practising dentistry and faces charges under Malaysia 's law regulating private healthcare facilities and services .
He could be fined up to $ 86,000 ( £ 43,200 ) or up to six years in prison , or both , if convicted .

Ex -Alabama Governor Approved for Release on Bond While He Appeals Bribery Convictions
BOB JOHNSON
AP News
A federal appeals court approved the release of former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman on bond Thursday while he appeals his convictions in a corruption case .
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the former governor had raised “ substantial questions of fact and law ” in challenging his conviction , which Siegelman claims was politically motivated .
The once - popular Democrat began serving a sentence of more than seven years in June on his conviction on six bribery - related counts and one obstruction count .
He has been serving the sentence at a federal prison in Oakdale , La .
The former governor ’s release was approved the same day the House Judiciary Committee announced it wanted Siegelman to testify before Congress about possible political influence over his prosecution .
“ It ’s a sweet day .
He ’s an innocent man and he ’s been in prison for nine months , ” said Siegelman ’s attorney , Vince Kilborn .
Kilborn said Siegelman would be released from the Louisiana prison Friday morning after prison officials verify the court order with the 11th Circuit .
Federal prosecutors accused Siegelman , 62 , of appointing Richard Scrushy , HealthSouth CEO at the time , to a hospital regulatory board in exchange for Scrushy arranging $ 500,000 in contributions to Siegelman ’s campaign for a statewide lottery .
Scrushy , who was tried along with Siegelman , also was convicted on bribery counts and is serving a sentence of nearly seven years .
The 11th Circuit , based in Atlanta , refused Scrushy ’s request to be released on bond while he appeals his conviction , his attorney Art Leach said Thursday night .
The court had earlier refused to release the multimillionaire Birmingham businessman , saying the appellate judges consider him to be a flight risk .
Siegelman was also convicted of a separate obstruction of justice charge concerning $ 9,200 he received from a lobbyist to help with the purchase of a motorcycle .
His attorneys have said it was a legitimate transaction .
U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller of Montgomery had refused to allow Siegelman to remain free on appeal while challenging his conviction .
But the 11th Circuit said Thursday he met the legal standard to be freed in the “ complex and protracted ” case .
The appeals process had been delayed for months after the court reporter during the trial died and the transcript was not completed as it normally would have .
Appellate court Judges Susan Black and Stanley Marcus said Siegelman could be released under the same conditions that he was allowed to remain free for about a year after his June 2006 conviction .
The amount of bond then was not disclosed .
Restrictions were placed on his travel , but while awaiting sentencing he had been approved for out - of - state trips .
Chief prosecutor Louis Franklin said he was “ very disappointed ” by the ruling but still expects the appellate court to rule against Siegelman ’s appeal .
“ I do n’t view this as a setback .
The order is very short and concise and only deals with whether he is entitled to bond pending appeal , ” Franklin said .
Scrushy attorney Art Leach said the order releasing Siegelman makes him optimistic about Scrushy ’s chances for release on bond .
“ My belief is that there are substantial issues and in my opinion it requires reversal of the conviction , ” Leach said .
Siegelman has maintained that certain Republicans targeted him after he was elected governor in 1998 in an attempt to derail his political career .
Kilborn said the former governor has agreed to testify before the House Judiciary Committee , which is investigating allegations of political meddling in Justice Department affairs by the Bush administration .
The committee hopes to hear from Siegelman in May .
The department and the federal prosecutors who handled Siegelman ’s prosecution have denied any political influence , emphasizing that he was convicted by a jury .
But critics , including a group of former state attorneys general , have called for an independent review and said the case raises questions .

World War II Mystery Solved Australian Warship Found After 66 - Year Search
The 1941 sinking of the HMAS Sydney was Australia 's worst naval disaster ever .
For six decades , Australians have been wondering how the pride of its navy could have been sunk by a lightly - armed German cruiser .
Now , that mystery might finally be solved .
Heat radiating from the entire length of 150 kilometer ( 95 mile ) - long fractures is seen in this best - yet heat map of the active south polar region of Saturn 's ice moon Enceladus .
Credit : NASA
NASA 's Cassini spacecraft tasted and sampled a surprising organic brew erupting in geyser - like fashion from Saturn 's moon Enceladus during a close flyby on March 12 .
Scientists are amazed that this tiny moon is so active , " hot " and brimming with water vapor and organic chemicals .
New heat maps of the surface show higher temperatures than previously known in the south polar region , with hot tracks running the length of giant fissures .
Additionally , scientists say the organics " taste and smell " like some of those found in a comet .
The jets themselves harmlessly peppered Cassini , exerting measurable torque on the spacecraft , and providing an indirect measure of the plume density .
" A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus , what 's coming out from inside , resembles that of a comet , " said Hunter Waite , principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio .
" To have primordial material coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formation of the Saturn system . "
" Enceladus is by no means a comet .
Comets have tails and orbit the sun , and Enceladus ' activity is powered by internal heat while comet activity is powered by sunlight .
Enceladus ' brew is like carbonated water with an essence of natural gas , " said Waite .
The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatile gases , water vapor , carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , as well as organic materials , some 20 times denser than expected .
This dramatic increase in density was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes .
New high - resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer show that the so - called tiger stripes , giant fissures that are the source of the geysers , are warm along almost their entire lengths , and reveal other warm fissures nearby .
These more precise new measurements reveal temperatures of at least minus 135 degrees Fahrenheit .
That is 63 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than previously seen and 200 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than other regions of the moon .
The warmest regions along the tiger stripes correspond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images .
" These spectacular new data will really help us understand what powers the geysers .
The surprisingly high temperatures make it more likely that there 's liquid water not far below the surface , " said John Spencer , Cassini scientist on the Composite Infrared Spectrometer team at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colo .
Previous ultraviolet observations showed four jet sources , matching the locations of the plumes seen in previous images .
This indicates that gas in the plume blasts off the surface into space , blending to form the larger plume .
Images from previous observations show individual jets and mark places from which they emanate .
New images show how hot spot fractures are related to other surface features .
In future imaging observations , scientists hope to see individual plume sources and investigate differences among fractures .
" Enceladus has got warmth , water and organic chemicals , some of the essential building blocks needed for life , " said Dennis Matson , Cassini project scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
" We have quite a recipe for life on our hands , but we have yet to find the final ingredient , liquid water , but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more . "
At closest approach , Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus .
When it flew through the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon 's surface .
Cassini's next flyby of Enceladus is in August .

The most sensitive instrument in the search for life in space
Gordon Brown has begun secret talks with other world leaders on far - reaching reform of the United Nations Security Council as part of a drive to create a " new world order " and " global society " .
The Prime Minister is drawing up plans to expand the number of permanent members in a move that will provoke fears that the veto enjoyed by Britain could be diluted eventually .
The United States , France , Russia and China also have a veto but the number of members could be doubled to include India , Germany , Japan , Brazil and one or two African nations .
Mr Brown has discussed a shake - up of a structure created in 1945 to reflect the world 's new challenges and power bases during his four - day trip to China and India .
Last night , British sources revealed " intense discussions " on UN reform were under way and Mr Brown raised it whenever he met another world leader .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Prime Minister believes the UN is punching below its weight .
In 2003 , it failed to agree on a fresh resolution giving explicit approval for military action in Iraq .
George Bush then acted unilaterally , winning the support of Tony Blair .
UN reform is highly sensitive and Britain will not yet publish formal proposals for fear of uniting opponents against them .
Mr Brown is trying to build a consensus for change first .
His aides are adamant that the British veto will not be negotiated away .
One option is for the nations who join not to have a veto , at least initially .
In a speech in Delhi today , the Prime Minister will say : " I support India 's bid for a permanent place – with others – on an expanded UN Security Council . "
However , he is not backing Pakistan 's demand for a seat if India wins one .
Mr Brown will unveil a proposal for the UN to spend £ 100 m a year on setting up a " rapid reaction force " to stop " failed states " sliding back into chaos after a peace deal has been reached .
Civilians such as police , administrators , judges and lawyers would work alongside military peace - keepers .
" There is limited value in military action to end fighting if law and order does not follow , " he will say .
" So we must do more to ensure rapid reconstruction on the ground once conflicts are over – and combine traditional humanitarian aid and peace - keeping with stabilisation , recovery and development . "
He will call for the World Bank to lead the fight against climate change as well as poverty in the developing world , and argue that the International Monetary Fund should prevent crises like the credit crunch rather than just resolve them .
Arriving in Delhi yesterday , Mr Brown said he wanted a " partnership of equals " between Britain and India as he called for closer trade links and co-operation against terrorism .
He announced £ 825 m of aid over the next three years – £ 500 m of which will be spent on health and education .
Mr Brown is to bring back honorary knighthoods and other awards for cricketers from Commonwealth countries .
He said : " Cricket is one of the great things that bind the Commonwealth together .
It used to be that great cricketers from the Commonwealth would be recognised by the British nation I would like to see some of the great players in the modern era honoured . "

Security Council membership
The UN Security Council 's membership has remained virtually unchanged since it first met in 1946 .
Great Britain , the United States , the then Soviet Union , China and France were designated permanent members of the UN 's most powerful body .
Initially , six other countries were elected to serve two - year spells on the council – in 1946 they were Australia , Brazil , Egypt , Mexico , the Netherlands and Poland .
The number of elected members , who are chosen to cover all parts of the globe , was increased to 10 in 1965 .
They are currently Belgium , Burkina Faso , Costa Rica , Croatia , Indonesia , Italy , Libya , Panama , South Africa and Vietnam .
Decisions made by the council require nine " yes " votes out of 15 .
Each permanent member has a veto over resolutions .
The issue of UN reform has long been on the agenda .
One suggestion is that permanent membership could be expanded to 10 with India , Japan , Germany , Brazil and South Africa taking places .
Any reform requires 128 nations , two - thirds , to support it in the assembly .

An ad campaign by the US cotton industry has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority for making misleading claims promoting the material as an environmentally - friendly product .
The campaign , for the Cotton Council International trading as Cotton USA , consisted of a magazine and poster ad .
The ad used the line " Soft , sensual and sustainable , it 's Cotton USA ! " .
Advertising regulators received three complaints challenging the term " sustainable " , arguing that cotton is a " pesticide - and insecticide - intensive crop " that could " seriously deplete " groundwater supplies where it is grown in the US .
However , CCI argued that US cotton production met " reasonable and generally accepted " definitions of sustainability .
The organisation quoted definitions given by the United Nations , the US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Congress arguing that in each the " basic principles " were the same : economic viability , protection for the environment and social responsibility .
CCI said that pesticides today were " more targeted , less toxic and less persistent " in the environment and that cotton had been " wrongly cited as a water - intensive crop " .
The US trade body also said that the " undeniable difficulties " of cotton farmers in west Africa were the result of many factors including " corporate monopolies and the rejection of genetically modified cotton by farmers " .
CCI provided a range of research and information to back up its sustainability claim , maintaining that the cotton was a natural , renewable , biodegradable and sustainable fibre .
The ASA noted CCI 's research but also said that there was " reputable scientific opinion " that was concerned about the longer term impact .
Advertising regulators added that there was a " division of informed and scientific opinion " as to whether cotton was a water intensive crop .
The ASA said that in relation to the complaint that US subsidies hurt cotton farmers in the developing world , it noted that the World Trade Organisation had opposed these payments in 2005 .
There was not , the regulator said , " universal acceptance " that the US cotton industry had no negative impact on economies on developing countries .
The ASA concluded that because there was no universally agreed definition of sustainability and there appeared to be " a significant division of informed opinion as to whether cotton production in the US could be described as sustainable " the ad should not continue to run .
It said that in this context the term " sustainable " was likely to be ambiguous and unclear to consumers and that the CCI had not justified the claim .

Charges were dropped against LCpl. Stephen Tatum on Friday , leaving Lt. Col. Jeffrey Chessani , Sgt. Frank Wuterich and Cpl. Andrew Grayson as the remaining three Marines who have n’t had their cases resolved .
Eventually , John Murtha will be exposed as a corrupt man who used the Haditha Marines in his attempt to become the House Majority Leader .
What We Know As Fact
We know that John Murtha accused the Haditha Marines of “ killing innocent civilians in cold blood ” before the investigation on Haditha had been completed .
We know that Rep. Murtha ’s story has changed several times .
When reporters initially asked him about his sourcing on May 18 , 2006 , Rep. Murtha said this :
â€ œAll the information I get , it comes from the commanders , it comes from people who know what theyâ€™re talking about.â€ 
That did n’t last long .
On May 30 , 2006 , he made this contradictory statement :
The Commandant of the Marine Corps was in my office just last week , so you know , I know there was a cover - up someplace .
He later offered another statement .
This time , the spokesman for Marine Corps Commandant Michael Hagee had to correct Rep. Murtha :
He had told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Gen. Michael Hagee had given him the information on which he based his charge that Marines killed innocent civilians .
But a spokesman for the Marine Corps said Hagee briefed Murtha on May 24 about Haditha .
Let ’s highlight that conflict between rep .
Murtha and the Marine Corps spokesman because it highlights extremely important information .
If Gen .
Hagee did indeed brief Rep. Murtha on May 24 , 2006 , that means that Rep. Murtha could n’t make these accusations based on irrefutable facts ; at least he could n’t do that on May 17 , 2006 .
That brings us to our first ‘ counts ’ against Rep. Murtha : Violating the Haditha Marines ’ constitutional protection of ( a ) being presumed innocent until provent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and ( b ) violating their due process rights .
Another accusation Rep. Murtha made was that the officers in charge of the 3/1 Marines covered up their findings of what happened on November 19 , 2005 in the city of Haditha .
That ’s absurd because we know that Captain Jeffrey Dinsmore put together a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation , which was sent up the chain of command .
That is n’t speculation ; that ’s his sworn testimony .
The fact that the people further up the chain of command said that there is n’t anything to investigate says it all .
Rep. Murtha told ABCNews ’ Charlie Gibson that he knew there was a cover - up “ someplace . ”
As I ’ve said before , if you think something is true but ca n’t prove it , then you should say that “ I believe that there is a coverup someplace . ”
You do n’t say that you know there ’s a coverup .
That ’s the second count in the indictment .
Rep. Murtha made false accusations against the Haditha Marines .
What ’s worse is that he made those accusations without verifiable proof of wrongdoing .
Knowingly filing false charges against someone is a crime .
The third count in the indictment is possibly the weightiest of charges .
Murtha ’s connections within the Pentagon are deep .
He ’s built a mini-empire by acting as a ‘ recruiter ’ for companies in the military industrial complex .
When they want a new hardware , Rep. Murtha gets it for them .
As a result , they paid particularly close attention when Rep. Murtha made an accusation against the Haditha Marines .
With his clout , Rep. Murtha did everything except play the role of judge , jury and executioner .
In civilian court , he would ’ve been accused of poisoning the jury pool , which is another violation of the Haditha Marines ’ due process rights .
Speculation
I can only speculate that Rep. Murtha also knew about the “ shadow body ” within the Pentagon established to monitor the proceedings against the Haditha Marines .
In the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib and Pat Tillman investigations , it ’s perfectly reasonable to think that there was a strong political component to these investigations .
Here ’s what Richard Thompson , president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center , said on that matter :
“ The hysteria and media firestorm over Abu Ghraib and the Pat Tillman investigations led to fear of a similar media reaction to the Haditha incident , causing the military ’s civilian bosses to set up this shadow oversight body , ” said Richard Thompson , president and chief counsel of the Thomas More Law Center .
“ This extraordinary action politicized the military justice system and was a clear signal to top generals that they were expected to hold individuals criminally responsible .
The investigation turned into a quest for a prosecution , not justice , ” Thompson said .
If there was a political component to these investigations , then it ’s equally reasonable to think that John Murtha ’s fingerprints are all over that portion of the witch hunt .
Based on the known facts alone , Rep. Murtha would have a fight if he found himself in a court of law .
That ’s why it ’s time to turn up the heat on the House Democratic leadership to open a thorough ethics investigation into the role John Murtha played in the smearing of the American heroes we know as the Haditha Marines .
It should insult everyone ’s sensibilities when people ’s constitutional protections are ignored .
That should go double when the people whose rights were violated are military heroes .
In the end , that ’s the most damning indictment against Rep. Murtha of them all .

open up a view of architecture that is otherwise blocked and " clarified " spatial systems .
Text long :
Borderline urban spaces in Linz , major thoroughfares leading in and out of the city , lined with buildings from the 50s to the 80s .
Districts formerly located on the periphery that are today squeezed in between the city´s historical centre and the frayed suburban and industrial zones lying on its outskirts .
These are the motifs of the four photographic works in Gregor Graf´s hidden town - verborgene Stadt series .
The " stars " in these photos are are the buildings on Dinghofer , Dametz and Mozart Streets .
Back in the 60s this streets were incorporated into a traffic concept that was even then reguarded as only an interim solution to get the rising number of vehicles in the city centre under control .
Buildings were torn down , whole rows of houses were shifted and existing structures were were altered .
These intermediaryregions became spaces dedicated efficient movement , filled with all the traffic lights and signage systems that entails .
The city as living space is today no longer shaped by the individuals who inhabit it .
At the textural level - with words , symbols , logos , directional and traffic signs , commands and prohibitions - the only elements allowed are those that serve the end of law or consumption .
Free expression , such as graffiti or the unauthorized hanging of posters in the public space is punishable by law .
The real city is increasingly becoming a personality - drained world of corporationsand branding , coupled with the proliferation of rigorous regulations dictating how individuals are expected to behave .
Modernism tried to rid architecture of ornament - advertisingand directional systems have now brought it back , under a new guise and with a new function .
City centres have evolved into " literary " spaces .
New technical possibilities ( glass , large print , tickers , digital text production technologies , mega displays , transparent buildings ) turn buildings facades into another medium for conveying nwes , with whole buildings becoming there own logo .
For hidden town - verborgene Stadt Gregor Graf applied a complicated retouching process to remove all graphic elements from his photographic images .
They appear as spaces void of signs , making them seem unreal , and cultural interchangable .
At the same time , they offer an undisguised view of the architectur and at the clarified spacial systems .
The digital editing involved traffic signage and graphics .
Signs of wear and tear , such as patina or weathering , and things that hint at human usage were deliberately left unaltered .
But the cultural and communicative information we are accustomedto seeing has disappeared .
An apperantly virtualized space emerges , which we are unable to reconcile with our normal visual experience .
How is a city without signs , without visual regulations , without guiding graphics , perceived ?
How do we move through this urban construct ?
Do we still recognize these ( non ) places ?

Read An Taoiseach 's full speech
View a gallery or listen to this audio journey through Bertie Ahern 's career
Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has announced that he will tender his resignation to President Mary McAleese on 6 May .
In an emotional speech surrounded by his Government colleagues , Mr Ahern expressed thanks to his supporters over more than three decades in the corridors of power .
He said his announcement was solely motivated by what is in the best interests of the people and said recent developments had not motivated his decision .
However Mr Ahern said he had no doubt that a simplistic analysis will suggest that his decision was influenced by more recent events at the Tribunal .
Mr Ahern insisted he had never put personal interest above the public good .
' I have never done anything to corrupt my office ' he said .
' I know in my heart of hearts that I have done no wrong and wronged no one . '
During the statement at Government Buildings , the Taoiseach stressed that he had never received a corrupt payment .
He said he feared ' the constant barrage ' of commentary on tribunal - related matters would continue to dominate the political agenda at what he described as 'an important point for our country . '
Surrounded by his ministers , he said he had been humbled with ' the great responsibility ' of leading the nation and expressed his belief that all levels of Irish society had seen their well being improved while he served as Taoiseach .
Mr Ahern said it was an extraordinary honour to be elected as Taoiseach and gave his thanks to his Fianna Fáil colleagues .
He also acknowledged the steadfast support from the coalition parties and Independents who supported his Government .
' Just as stability is important in a coalition Government , it is even more vital in a political organisation . '
Mr Ahern said he had first sought election to the office of Taoiseach on the pledge that he would put people before politics .
He had kept that promise .
He said he had always placed the interests of the Irish people above his own .
Therefore , he would not allow issues relating to his own person to dominate the body politic as this would be contrary to the long - term interests of the Irish people .
The Taoiseach stressed he wanted everyone to understand one truth above all else : never in all the time that he had served in public life had he ever put his own personal interests ahead of the public good .
Mr Ahern said he had provided more details about his own personal finances than any person in public life who had held office .
And while he was the first to admit that he had made mistakes in his life and in his career , one mistake he never made was to enrich himself by misusing the trust of the people .
Mr Ahern said he had never done anything to dishonour any office that he had ever held .
11 years as Taoiseach
Bertie Ahern has been Taoiseach for almost 11 years .
Prior to attaining the highest office of Government , he held most of the important cabinet portfolios including Finance , Labour and Industry and Commerce .
He gained worldwide attention for his role in striking the Good Friday Agreement for which all sides on the political divide recognised his important vital contribution .
His career in politics began at 17 years of age when he joined Fianna Fáil .
He became a TD in 1977 and began to progress up the party hierachy .
In 1987 he was made Minister for Labour .
He later spent periods as Minister for Industry and Commerce and Minister for Finance .
Following the collapse of the Fianna Fáil / Labour Government in 1994 , Mr Ahern was elected leader of his party and three years later , he led Fianna Fáil into coalition with the Progressive Democrats .
During his time as Taoiseach he has won acclaim for the role he played in the peace process - helping to negotiate the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 .
His spell in office has also seen a period of record economic growth and prosperity , but has been plagued by questions about his financial affairs in the 1990s .
Bertie Ahern is the first Fianna Fáil leader since Eamon De Valera to have won three terms in office for his party .
Focus Likely to be on GOP Voter Fraud Front Group ' American Center for Voting Rights ' as New Mexico 's Fired US Attorney David Iglesias , Missouri 's SoS Robin Carnahan and Others Are Set to Testify on the Republican - Run Voter Disenfranchisement Scheme ...

Blogged by Brad Friedman from the road ...
The insidious nexus between phony GOP charges of " voter fraud " and the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal will finally be explored in a Senate Hearing on " In- Person Voter Fraud : Myth and Trigger for Disenfranchisement ? " this Wednesday in Sen. Dianne Feinstein's ( D - CA ) Rules Committee .
The complete witness list and press release from Feinstein 's office , announcing the hearings , is posted at the end of this article .
Witnesses will include , among others , former NM U.S. Attorney David Iglesias , believed to have been fired for his unwillingness to bring phony voter fraud charges in the state despite pressure from folks such as Sen. Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) , Rep. Heather Wilson ( R- NM ) , and a representative of Republican operative Thor Hearne 's now - defunct " American Center for Voting Rights , " ( ACVR ) which The BRAD BLOG originally outed as a White House / GOP front group in a long series of investigative reports dating back to 2005 , which began just after the supposedly non-partisan group ( co- founded by two very high level White House / GOP operatives ) first appeared on the scene ...
The ACVR 's mission , as run by Hearne out of his offices at the high - powered Republican lawfirm Lathrope & Gage in Missouri --- a battleground state and initially ground zero for the well - organized and well - funded GOP Voter Disenfranchisement scheme --- was to create propaganda concerning allegations of Democratic " voter fraud " in order to create a perceived need for Photo ID restrictions at the polling place in order to disenfranchise largely Democratic - leaning voters wherever they could implement such restrictions .
One prong of the strategy was to counter the success of legitimate voter registration organizations , such as ACORN , by attempting to discredit --- and in fact , bring illegitimate prosecution against them just prior to elections --- for heading some sort of voter fraud scheme .
All of that , despite the paucity , by the Bush DoJ 's own numbers , of any actual such voter fraud via registration campaigns or at polling places ( other than by Ann Coulter , anyway ) .
In today 's Baltimore Chronicle , Jason Liepold offers an excellent , detailed backgrounder on the entire affair so far , pulling together many of the dots in the shameful saga to date , and how it all ties directly into the White House / DOJ's U.S. Attorney Purge scheme .
Election Attorney Just Levitt , of NYU 's Brennan Center for Justice , is scheduled as one of the witnesses for this Wednesday 's Senate hearing .
He best summed up the broad , well - financed GOP voter - suppression conspiracy in a Washington Post article last year when he wrote : " the notion of widespread voter fraud ... is itself a fraud .
Evidence of actual fraud by individual voters is painfully skimpy . "
Leopold tees up the context for this week 's hearing , describing the White House / Rove - headed anti-democracy operation , its intended Demcoratic - voter disenfranchisement , and the way it all sits at the heart of the U.S. Attorney purge thusly ...
There is no concrete evidence of voter fraud in the United States .
Many election integrity experts believe voter fraud is a ploy by Republicans to suppress minorities and poor people from voting .
Historically , those groups tend to vote for Democratic candidates .
Raising red flags about the integrity of the ballots , experts believe , is an attempt by GOP operatives to swing elections to their candidates as well as an attempt to use the fear of criminal prosecution to discourage individuals from voting in future races .
Now a Senate panel chaired by California Democrat Dianne Feinstein is investigating whether the myth of voter fraud has led to " disenfranchisement " among individual voters .
On Wednesday , the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration is scheduled to hold a hearing to explore the matter .
Iglesias is one of the witnesses who will testify about the issue .
In an interview , he said he intends to recount how his office was pressured by a close confidant of former White House political adviser Karl Rove to file criminal charges against Democrats for voter fraud .
Iglesias said in an interview that he had set up a task force and launched an in - depth investigation into claims of voter fraud in New Mexico and found the allegations to be “ non-provable in court . ”
He said he is certain that his firing was due , in part , to the fact that he would not file criminal charges of voter fraud in New Mexico .
Iglesias added that , based on evidence that had surfaced thus far and " Karl Rove 's obsession with voter fraud issues throughout the country , " he now believes GOP operatives had wanted him to go after Democratic - funded organizations in an attempt to swing the 2006 midterm elections to Republicans .
In addition to Leopold 's detailed backgrounder , we 'll also , once again , strongly recommend Columbia Unversity 's political science expert Lorraine Minnite 's superb " The Politics of Voter Fraud " report [ PDF ] as essential reading on this matter .
Further , as additional background we 'd recommend New Mexico Attorney John Boyd 's detailed explanation of what really happened in the state , prior to the 2004 election , when the GOP first launched their " voter fraud " scheme there , pushing for the prosecution of some 6,000 allegedly fraudulent voters on the rolls .
( None of them were . )
The BRAD BLOG featured exclusive insider details from Boyd , who had been an election attorney working for the state Democratic Party at the time , on all of this , detailing what Iglesias had faced from his own party as they rolled out their scheme in the Land of Enchantment .
He summarized what he described as " a three - pronged scandal " for us , this way ...
First , there is the scandal of the “ voter fraud ” fraud which the Republicans have been trying to use to help promote restrictive , disenfranchising voter i.d. legislation .
Second , there is the scandal of the Republicans attempting to enlist the US Atty ’s office in their voter fraud fraud by getting him , at taxpayer expense and contrary to the most elemental ethics , to use his office to generate headlines about “ voter fraud ” when none was occurring , for the sole purpose of shaving Democratic party margins .
Third , there is the scandal of firing Iglesias for refusing to go along with this fraudulent manipulation .
It should also be noted that Pat Rogers , a still - high - ranking GOP muckety - muck in NM , was said to have been working for the now - discredited ACVR at the time he was applying political pressure to Iglesias ' office to bring the fraudulent " voter fraud " charges .
Leopold covers that aspect in some detail in his report today .
Rogers has again appeared as the face of the NM GOP recently , forwarding still another fraud himself in the recent " vote - buying " allegations that have surfaced over the last week , as covered in some detail by The BRAD BLOG .
Late last week , reporter Dennis Domrzalski highlighted a phony invoice produced by Rogers in an attempt to swiftboat the former Republican Governor who is one of several state officials who have alleged " vote - buying " took place at a recent NM GOP Delegate Nominating Convention .
Our Special Coverage Page on the New Mexico Republican / Rep. Heather Wilson " vote - buying " scandal is now posted here .

MEDIA ADVISORY : Monday , March 10 , 2008 Monday , March 10 , 2008 Chairman Feinstein to Hold Hearing on Voter Fraud Washington , DC – On Wednesday , March 12 at 10:00 a.m. , U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) will hold a hearing of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee on voter fraud .
Senator Feinstein chairs the Rules Committee and will preside over the hearing .
Specifically , the hearing will focus on the issue of purported charges of rampant in - person voter fraud ; as well as the drive for voter photo identification laws , despite concerns that these requirements could disenfranchise vulnerable voters .
The hearing will feature testimony from : Robin Carnahan , Missouri Secretary of State ;
Missouri Secretary of State ; Robert Simms , Georgia Deputy Secretary of State ;
Georgia Deputy Secretary of State ; David Iglesias , Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico ;
Former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico ; Professor Jeff Milyo , University of Missouri - Columbia ; and
University of Missouri - Columbia ; and Justin Levitt , Counsel , Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law .
What : “ In - Person Voter Fraud : Myth and Trigger for Disenfranchisement ? ”
When : Wednesday , March 12 , 2008 , 10:00 a.m .
Where : 301 Russell Senate Office Building Background Serious questions have been raised about whether a photo ID requirement , when rigorously enforced without adequate alternatives , could prevent vulnerable voters from exercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to vote , one of the most essential rights in our democracy .
In particular , concerns have been raised about the potential impacts on voters who have historically encountered obstacles at the polls – disabled , poor , minority , and senior voters .
The hearing will also examine the evidence of charges about rampant impersonation of registered voters at the polls , which is the primary type of fraud that could be prevented by a strict photo identification requirement .
Despite a major effort by the Bush Administration to investigate charges of voter fraud , and after millions upon millions of voters cast ballots in 2002 , 2004 and 2006 , no federal cases of impersonation voter fraud have been successfully prosecuted .

It arrived for me in Beirut under plain cover , a brown envelope containing a small , glossy paperback in Arabic , accompanied by a note from an Egyptian friend .
" Robert ! " it began .
" Did you really write this ? "
The front cover bore a photograph of Saddam Hussein in the dock in Baghdad , the left side of his head in colour , the right side bleached out , wearing a black sports jacket but with no tie , holding a Koran in his right hand .
" Saddam Hussein , " the cover said in huge letters .
" From Birth to Martyrdom . "
And then there was the author 's name – in beautiful , calligraphic typeface and in gold in the top , right - hand corner .
" By Robert Fisk . "
So there it was , 272 paperback pages on the life and times of the Hitler of Baghdad and selling very well in the Egyptian capital .
" We all suspect a well - known man here , " she added .
" His name is Magdi Chukri . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Needless to say , I noticed one or two problems with this book .
It took a very lenient view of the brutality of Saddam , it did n't seem to care much about the gassed civilians of Halabja – and it was full of the kind of purple passages which I loathe .
" After the American rejection of the Iraqi weapons report to the UN , " ' Robert Fisk ' wrote , " the beating of war drums turned into a cacophony ... "
Dare I suggest to readers that this kind of cliche does n't sound like Robert Fisk ?
The only war drums I could hear were those of my own astonishment .
For I never wrote this book .
It was n't plagiarism – a common practice in Cairo , which is why I ensure that all my real books are legally published in Arabic in Lebanon .
No , this was n't plagiarism .
This was forgery .
And it was clearly the moment for Detective Inspector Fisk to hunt down " The Mystery of the Cairo Forger " .
Elementary , my dear reader , which is why I boarded Middle East Airlines flight ME304 from Beirut to my least favourite Arab capital , the bureaucratic , traffic - snarled , bankrupt , wonderful , lawless , irredeemable , spectacular Cairo .
I had called an Egyptian journalist friend , Saef Nasrawi , to be my Dr Watson and – a few metres from the front door of the Marriott Gezira Hotel – we found our faithful driver , Yasser Hassan .
" Make sure you put my family name in your newspaper , " he announced .
I have now done so .
It 's always been my theory that a taxi driver – especially in Cairo – will be more helpful , more friendly and altogether more enthusiastic if he knows why you 're in the back of his cab .
So , when I showed him the slim paperback , he raced off at once to what we all hoped was the office of the publisher , clearly printed on page two .
" Ibda " the company was supposedly called and the Egyptian telephone operator had traced the name to an address in Old Cairo , No 953 Corniche el - Nil .
Through the downtown morning traffic , we ground , canyons of black and white taxis like our own ; vast , single - storey buses packed with Galabiya - clad and bearded men ; 4x4s carrying Cairo 's demimonde of jewelled ladies and young men with shaving problems – the bewhiskered chin - for machismo is as much a problem in the Middle East as it is in London .
No 953 was a tall tenement block into which Saef and I could not penetrate without the permission of a black - cowled lady whose child was playing in the dust of the roadway .
She listened as we called upstairs .
Yes , a woman 's voice said .
We could take the elevator .
On the wall beside the lift was a sign : " Ibda – the house of creativity for journalism , publication and distribution " .
I could believe in the " creativity " bit .
But the veiled and polite lady on the 11th floor was all ignorance .
" We never published such a book , " she said , and called her female boss , who was at the Cairo Book Fair .
She called us back on our mobile and insisted – quite truthfully – that Saddam Hussein was not her work .
Not only did she deny all knowledge of the forgery – her assistant weighed us down with her own genuinely produced books of literary endeavour .
Saef and Yasser debated our problem .
The publishing details in the front of the book were clearly wrong .
But the frontispiece announced that the book had been registered for circulation with the Egyptian government – in other words , it has been cleared for sale by the official censor .
So , Detective Inspector Fisk decided that a visit to the Dar al - Kutb – the official " House of Books " attached to the Ministry of Culture – was our next destination .
Had the forger , the so - called Magdi Chukri , been smooth enough to legalise his illegally produced book with the oh - so - law - abiding Egyptian government of President Hosni Mubarak ?
" This is not good enough ! " our driver , Yasser , roared at me .
" Mr Robert , the people of Egypt will think you wrote this book .
You must go to the British embassy , you must go to the Egyptian government , you must go to the police , you must go to our intelligence services . "
I had been through this kind of trust curtain before .
Despite all evidence to the contrary , Egyptians still evince a blind confidence in Ottoman authority .
The Brits would n't care a damn about this forgery and the Egyptians even less – always supposing " Magdi Chukri " had n't slipped the civil servants a few piastas for registering a book by " Robert Fisk " .
We arrived at the Ministry of Culture , a bleak Stalinist office block next door to which we found " House of Books " .
On the first floor was an emporium – I hesitate to call it an office – of books , a vast atrium of volumes and manuscripts .
They lay feet high on desks , metre high on shelves and – so it seemed – miles high from the floor .
Hundreds , nay thousands , of books were stacked in Dickensian rows , floor to ceiling , bodice - rippers and Arabic fiction and treatises on Islamic jurisprudence and physics textbooks .
Two veiled ladies and two bearded men sat at a desk amid this forest of literature , one of them – there is always a miracle in Cairo – in front of a grimy , faded - yellow desktop computer .
I asked if my favourite volume had been approved by the Egyptian government for sale .
" By Robert Fisk ? " the man asked .
" The very one ! " I shouted .
" Yes , it was registered with us on 30 May 2007 . "
" Is there a name for the man who wanted to register it ? "
" No , only an address .
13 Hassan Ramadan Street in Dokki . "
Within seconds , Detective Inspector Fisk was bounding down the stairs , his faithful Dr Saef Watson on his heels .
" To Dokki ! " we demanded of the delighted Yasser .
Now , surely , we were hot on the trail of the Forger of Cairo .
A chance at last to confront Mr Magdi .
The problem – which all three of us realised – is that Magdi Chukri is about as common in Cairo as John Smith is in Britain .
There must be hundreds of thousands of Magdi Chukris in Egypt – one of whom is a former Egyptian foreign minister , a man of great probity who would never forge a book –which is probably why the writer chose the name .
We turned left into an evil - smelling alleyway – Hassan Ramadan Street – and stopped outside No 13 .
It was an underground mosque .
Not only was it underground but , when Saef and I tried to enter the building , the wailed prayers of a funeral ascended from the basement .
A helpful bo 'ab – all Egyptian buildings possess a doorman – arrived to insist that no publisher lived in the leaning , mud - brick tenement behind the mosque .
" I know all these people , " he said , pointing to each heavily - hung washing line .
" These are the Wassiss , there are the Salmans ... "
At which point an elderly lady in spectacles , dressed in a smart black and white business suit , emerged from a stairway .
No , she told Saef , there were no publishers here .
" But there used to be that nice Mr Magdi Chukri . "
" Magdi Chukri ? ! "
" Yes , but he moved out a year ago [ before he registered his false address with the government , the Detective Inspector 's computer brain worked out ] and now he works at the branch of Mgboulli 's bookshop around the corner . "
Neither Holmes nor Watson ever moved so fast .
Saef , Yasser and I hooted and screamed the wrong way out of Hassan Ramadan Street , donkey riders tight - eyed with hatred as we tooted them off the road .
Only one thing mattered now .
Number 45 Al - Batal Ahmed Abdul - Aziz Street , the local Mgboulli bookshop .
And there it was , its window packed with paperbacks , the " G " and " U " of Mgboulli having long ago fallen to the pavement .
There was a slim , cigarette - smoking Egyptian in a yellow smoking jacket with black velvet lapels blocking the doorway .
" I want to buy a book , " I said softly , the winning smile – I 'm afraid – of an undercover policeman suffusing my face .
There were two tough , beefy men inside , shop assistants as you 've never seen them before .
I asked for a well - known volume on the life of Saddam Hussein .
" By Robert Fisk ? " I was asked .
" Why yes , the very one ! "
I followed one of the beefy men upstairs to the " Saddam Hussein biography " section .
At which point , he darted back downstairs and retrieved the book from a secret pile behind the counter .
" Thirty Egyptian pounds , " he said .
I paid .
Yes , I paid the equivalent of £ 2.86 for a book with my name on it which I never wrote .
The man in the yellow jacket - he now introduced himself as " Mahmoud " – asked me why I wanted to buy this particular tome .
" Because this is my name on the cover , " I said .
" And here is my business card .
I never wrote this book . "
" Mahmoud " and the two beefy men burst into laughter .
So did Saef .
So did I .
For this was a ticklish moment .
Did " Mahmoud " know " Magdi Chukri " , I asked ?
" Yes , he is a good friend of mine .
But he left us some time ago and now he lives in 6th October City .
Here is his number . "
I called it .
Switched off .
There was another number .
A woman answered , refused to give her name or address and hung up .
" Mahmoud " shrugged .
" How many copies of this book have you sold , " I asked .
" Mahmoud " drew on his cigarette .
" At least 100 so far . "
" So you owe me 3,000 Egyptian pounds ! " I was enjoying this .
" But , no , Mr Robert , we do n't owe you this , " " Mahmoud " said with a cringing smile .
" Because you have just told me you did n't write this book .
How can we pay you for a book you did not write ? "
Why did I like " Mahmoud " ?
Why did I love this moment ?
Was it possible to find Mr Chukri in 6th October City ?
Could we perhaps go street by street to hunt him down ?
Saef leaned over my shoulder .
" Mr Robert , about nine million people live in 6th October City . "
I got the message .
Clutching my second copy of " Robert Fisk's ' biography of Saddam Hussein " – Yasser was delighted to receive it as a gift – I left Mgboulli's and returned to the Marriott .
That night , I sat upon my hotel balcony and looked across the fume - encrusted minarets and the black tide of the Nile to the twinkling lights of 6th October City .
Far out there in the darkness , " Magdi Chukri " must be working on another historical volume .
What will be its title , I wondered ?
And which author 's name will grace the front cover in gold ?

スキー＆スノーボードのゲームをしながら、楽しく（？）C/C++、Javaの基本を学べるボードゲーム「c-jump」が存在する。謳い文句によれば、" c-jump helps children to learn basics of programming languages " ──子供たちがプログラミング言語の基礎を学ぶのを手助けする、とある。
プレー人数は2人から4人、対象年齢は11歳以上。最初にすべてのスキーヤーをゴールさせたユーザが優勝だ。
ゲームは通常のサイコロを振るタイプのボードゲームと同じだが、どれだけ進むかはサイコロの目の数ではなく、目の数をxに代入した結果の評価式に依るようになっている。プログラムの処理をトレースするような仕組みだ。
c-jumpは中学生以上の学生を対象に、プログラミングの基本機能を勉強するための教材としては適切なものかもしれない。とくにサイコロの目の数による加算や、繰り返し、分岐などの処理が実施されるため、実際にどのようにコードが動くのかをトレースする訓練になるだろう。

Along an isolated , rocky stretch of Greek shoreline , a Florida State University researcher and his students are unlocking the secrets of a partially submerged , " lost " harbor town believed to have been built by the ancient Mycenaeans nearly 3,500 years ago .
" This is really a remarkable find , " said Professor Daniel J. Pullen , chairman of FSU 's Department of Classics .
" It is rare indeed to locate an entire town built during the Late Bronze Age that shows this level of preservation . "
Pullen and a colleague , Assistant Professor of Classical Studies Thomas F. Tartaron of the University of Pennsylvania , led students from both universities in conducting an initial study of the site during May and June of 2007 .
What they found was unique : an archaeological site that required very little digging .
" Because of soil erosion and tectonic subsidence " -- the latter induced by earthquakes along the numerous local faults -- " much of the soil had already been stripped from the site , " Pullen said .
" So the architectural remains of about 20 acres of closely built structures were plainly visible . "
Although more than three millennia of earthquakes and other factors have collapsed the structures , what remains are the buildings ' foundations , walls that in some places still stand nearly 5 feet tall , and a number of clues as to the settlement 's construction and purpose .
" All of the structures were laid out in a grid pattern , which suggests that the entire community was planned and then built all at once , rather than piecemeal , " Pullen said .
" This would indicate that the settlement was built with some strategic purpose -- perhaps as a military or naval outpost . "
The settlement , referred to as Korphos - Kalamianos by Pullen and Tartaron , rests on the shores of the Saronic Gulf in the western Aegean Sea about 60 miles to the southwest of the Greek capital , Athens .
Directly across the gulf , the ancient city - state of Kolonna on Aigina likely was a rival of the emerging city - state of Mycenae , which sits about 40 miles inland to the west , during the period between 1400 and 1200 B.C. when Korphos - Kalamianos was built .
" We have identified some fortification walls with gates on the inland side of Korphos - Kalamianos , which does suggest that the town had at least some role as a fortress , possibly to protect the harbor , " Pullen said .
Pullen and Tartaron 's 2007 work involved conducting a systematic study of the architectural remains at Korphos - Kalamianos and producing an accurate map of their location using Global Positioning System and other high - tech instruments .
This summer , they plan to return to the site with more students ( five FSU graduate students and two alumni will make the trip ) to conduct underwater research along the shoreline .
" We do n't know exactly why , but some portion of the settlement is now submerged in the Saronic Gulf , " Pullen said .
" We can say that in the Bronze Age the configuration of the coastline at Kalamianos was very different from that of today .
So this summer , we plan to collaborate with Greece 's department of underwater antiquities on a bathymetric survey of the shallow waters around the Korphos region that should clarify aspects of the Bronze Age coastline . "
( Bathymetry is the measurement of the depths of oceans , seas or other large bodies of water . )
Pullen and Tartaron have named their three - year undertaking the Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project , or SHARP , and shared their initial findings at a meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America in Chicago in January .
SHARP has received financial support from several groups , including the Institute for Aegean Prehistory , the Loeb Classical Library Foundation , the Stavros S. Niarchos Foundation , FSU and the University of Pennsylvania .

Additional reporting by Nivair H. Gabriel .
Oh !
My God !!
Sure enough , James Carville was the designated pass rusher and spoke the true Hillary and Bill feeling when he compared Governor Bill Richardson to Judas .
But did this mean he compares Hillary to Christ ??
Such is the quandary of tough times .
It exposes the raw nerve of true feelings .
There is a feeling of entitlement within the minds of Hillary and Bill and within their own campaign .
The evidence is not just within the remarks of James Carville .
They go far deeper and there is a pattern of them .
It is the feeling of betrayal that exposes that raw nerve , however .
It is the constant denigrating remarks for Obama while building John McCain up .
It is the fact that only once in 24 elections , has Hillary actually congratulated him or acknowledged his victory and her defeat .
It is a lack of the common respect and decency toward a fellow candidate .
Once again , the Carville remark is an obvious warning to any other person with Clinton connections to toe the line or be scalded with boiling water within the press .
Such reactionary retaliation is something learned in the ruthless power of the White House , and has never been practiced by candidates before they reached that lofty post .
Clinton supporters , mostly women in empty nests who have equated to the Hillary position often worship the “ toughness ” of Hillary .
But this shows the true Hillary that some of us have seen before and have not forgotten .
It is the seed of contempt , or maybe even advancing contempt of its own .
It is a seething feeling awaiting a ‘ mark ’ ; an anger boiling for release .
It is n’t frustration .
We will see a continuing round of whining about coverage ; blaming others ; and slicing as we Democrats see our chances of winning in the Fall played as if they are the fodder of this “ entitlement ” .
For it is also the truth when spoken that the scorched earth , “ kitchen sink ” strategy has already fed directly into the third McBush term .
And it will not subside when launched by those that feel entitled and now cheated .
There is substance to a point that an Obama campaign which has played by the rules ; won the most states , popular vote and delegates would react by sitting out the election if the nomination was wrested away by super delegates .
Even with moderate support , Hillary Clinton ’s national negatives remain at over 50 % , and that is near assurance that she is unelectable .
Independents will simply not vote for Hillary Clinton in Florida , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan or other states .
They will favor McBush especially with eight years of campaign fodder awaiting the general election , and at every turn the continuing campaign compresses the general election timeframe to where the negatives of the Clinton White House plus these last fifteen months of campaigning will be the library for the campaign and the 527 Swift Boat ads .
Obama will be assaulted also .
Can he withstand it ?
Is he tough enough , say the Clintons as part of their assault upon him ; a part of their kitchen sink ?
There is one thing for sure , the race for the White House has shown to honestly have little to do with your problems and mine of paying the bills ; buying gas ; sending the sons and daughters of the poor and middle class to fight an unpopular war ; of worrying about the future of aging parents .
None of these issues are even vaguely comparable to the blind and seething ambition of the Clintons or their supporters .
That is the proof – dead proof – that this race is based on the Clinton feeling of Entitlement – not you , me , or the nation .
This is about the Clintons .
All of the charm was just another ploy .
The authenticity is not in empathy or care ; but is within raw ambition .

But the music industry has changed tremendously in the past eight years .
Bands and record labels long ignored the threat of the internet and for a time refused to experiment with online distribution .
But with physical CD sales in persistent decline and legal music downloads only partly making up for the lost revenue , the music industry is frantically searching for a new business model .
Artists including Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead both ditched their record labels , opting to sell their music directly to fans over the internet .
Radiohead 's
In Rainbows was offered on the band 's website for two months before launching in stores and fans could download it for free or for whatever price they were willing to pay .
Nine Inch Nails are selling their latest four - volume album , Ghosts I - IV , through their website and the first nine tracks are offered for free , including on BitTorrent websites that also house reams of pirated music .
In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine , Ulrich said Metallica 's contract with Warner Music expired after their next album .
" We want to be as free a player as possible , " he said .
" We 've been observing Radiohead and [ Nine Inch Nails frontman ]
Trent Reznor and in 27 years or however long it takes for the next record , we 'll be looking forward to everything in terms of possibilities with the internet . "
Ulrich said eight years ago the band was a fierce critic of sharing music over the web because the members thought that sharing should be on the artists ' terms .
" Back in the day there was a much bigger question about ' On whose terms ? ' " Ulrich said .
" We said , ' Wait a minute , it should be about the artist . '
Then all hell broke loose and we sat on the sidelines for a while . "
For their part , Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails have accepted that it is virtually impossible to stop music piracy .
Instead of trying to fight back the tide , both bands have embraced the internet and , by giving some songs away for free , have been able to harness the web 's viral marketing power .
While many , even most , users will be content with the freebies , even if a small percentage go on to buy the music , the bands , thanks to the low overheads of online distribution , can turn a tidy profit .
Nine Inch Nails announced that Ghosts I - IV , released via NIN.com , earned the band $ US1.6 million ( $ 1.7 million ) .
Official sales figures for Radiohead 's
In Rainbows have n't been released but when the album was released on CD in stores , after already spreading virally online , it hit No.1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart .
The evolutionary history of the comb jelly has revealed surprising clues about Earth 's first animal .
Credit : Casey Dunn
A new study mapping the evolutionary history of animals indicates that Earth 's first animal - - a mysterious creature whose characteristics can only be inferred from fossils and studies of living animals -- was probably significantly more complex than previously believed .
The study , which was funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , is the cover story of the April 10 , 2008 issue of Nature .
Using new high - powered technologies for analyzing massive volumes of genetic data , the study defined the earliest splits at the base of the animal tree of life .
The tree of life is a hierarchical representation of the evolutionary relationships between species that was introduced by Charles Darwin .
Shaking Up the Tree of Life
Among the study 's surprising findings is that the comb jelly split off from other animals and diverged onto its own evolutionary path before the sponge .
This finding challenges the traditional view of the base of the tree of life , which honored the lowly sponge as the earliest diverging animal .
" This was a complete shocker , " says Dunn .
" So shocking that we initially thought something had gone very wrong . "
But even after Dunn 's team checked and rechecked their results and added more data to their study , their results still suggested that the comb jelly , which has tissues and a nervous system , split off from other animals before the tissue - less , nerve - less sponge .
The presence of the relatively complex comb jelly at the base of the tree of life suggests that the first animal was probably more complex than previously believed , says Dunn .
While cautioning that additional studies should be conducted to corroborate his team 's findings , Dunn says that the comb jelly could only have achieved its apparent seniority over the simpler sponge via one of two new evolutionary scenarios : 1 ) the comb jelly evolved its complexity independently of other animals , after it branched off onto its own evolutionary path ; or 2 ) the sponge evolved its simple form from more complex creatures -- a possibility that underscores the fact that " evolution is not necessarily just a march towards increased complexity , " says Dunn .
" This scenario would provide a particularly dramatic example of that principle . "
How Old is Old ?
How long ago did the earliest comb jelly diverge " " Unfortunately , we do n't have fossils of the oldest comb jelly , " laments Dunn .
" Therefore , there is no way to date the earliest jelly and determine when it diverged . "
After diverging from other species , the comb jelly probably continued to evolve , says Herendeen .
Therefore , today 's comb jelly - - a common creature -- probably looks very different that did the earliest comb jelly .
Moreover , the tentacled , squishy but bell - less comb jelly developed along a different evolutionary path than did the classically bell - shaped jellyfish , says Patrick Herendeen , an NSF program director .
Such divergences mean that " the jellyfish type of body form has independently evolved several times , " says Herendeen .
Remaining Gaps in the Tree of Life
While reversing the evolutionary order of the sponge and comb jelly , Dunn 's study also resolved some long - standing questions about other species .
Among these was whether millipedes and centipedes are more closely related to spiders than to insects .
The answer : spiders .
But despite these and other important evolutionary insights provided by Dunn 's team , the tree of life remains a work in progress .
" Scientists currently estimate that there are a total of about 10 million species of organisms on earth , " says Dunn .
" But so far , only about 1.8 million species -- most of which are animals -- have been described by science .
Very few of these species have , so far , been positioned in the tree of life . "
A Methodological Breakthrough
But at least some of the tree of life 's remaining gaps will likely be filled through the use of high - powered analytic approaches pioneered in Dunn 's study -- which involved using more than 100 computers to analyze more data than incorporated into any previous comparable evolutionary study .
" Dunn 's high - powered approach is just what we need to continue assembling the tree of life , " says Herendeen .
" We are going to see a lot of this approach in the future . "
Dunn explains one of the advantages of his team 's approach : " Even though we looked at fewer than 100 species , they were sampled in such a way that they inform the relationships of major groups of animals relative to each other .
Therefore , this study , and others like it , will have implications for the placement of far more species than just those that are sampled . "
Remaining Challenges
But no matter how many high - tech analytic tools scientists use to analyze the genetics of organisms , they must still conquer " the exact same challenges that naturalists faced 200 years ago , " says Dunn .
" We still do n't even know enough about many species to have a good idea where to look for them . "
" And even as it is getting easier and cheaper to analyze the DNA of organisms with increasingly powerful computers , it is getting more expensive and difficult to find , collect , and identify organisms . "
For example , Dunn 's team had to use remotely operated underwater vehicles to collect one of the comb jellies included in this study .
Dunn concludes : " It may come as a surprise to some that the many that huge advances in technology actually bring us right back to the same challenges that naturalists faced 200 years ago : the day - to - day practical challenges of just figuring out what lives on our planet , where to find it and how to collect it .

Vladimir Putin Pulls a Sarkozy ; Dating 24 Year Old ( Photos )
Russian presidentis reportedly separated from his wife Ludmilla and has taken up with 24 year old former gymnast .
Alina is a model and actress and recently became a seated member of Russia 's parliament .
The 56 year old Putin , according to Moskovski Korrespondent , has been seen kissing the young woman at a restaurant and the world leader plans to marry his new love after he steps down from office .
His 50 year old wife has always remained in the background , seldom photographed at her husband 's side .
We have one photo below showing the couple together .
The former KGB spy rose from obscurity after winning the Russian presidential election in 2000 and again in 2004 .
Putin claims that he has rebuilt the pride of a nation shattered by post communist chaos .
His second term ends on May 7 , 2008 when Dmitry Medvedev will begin serving as the next Russian president .
Alina represented Russia in rhythmic gymnastics at the Sydney and Athens Olympic Games .
International Gymnast Magazine also posted details of the romance between the world leader and the former Olympic gymnast .
Undoubtedly it is Alina 's elevated status in Russia that facilitated her being named to a government post in parliament .
The entire scenario is not unlike that of another world leader , French president Nicholas Sarkozy .
He left his wife in October and began a whirlwind public courtship with model and singer Carla Bruni , much to the displeasure of his fellow countrymen .
The two became engaged several months into the relationship and have since married .
Putin was named Person of the Year 2007 by Time magazine .
Check out some interesting photos below .
Daily Mail has more photos of the lovely Alina in various gymnastic and modeling poses .
Anti-Beijing protesters have used the Olympics to publicise their causes
China must ensure open access to the internet during the Beijing Games , Olympic officials have warned .
Inspectors from the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) said China was obliged under its Games contract to provide journalists with web access .
The IOC's Kevan Gosper said there was concern that the web had been blocked during recent unrest in Tibet .
He said this could not happen during the Games .
IOC inspectors are on a final visit to Beijing before the August Games begin .
Internet ' management '
Mr Gosper said blocking the internet during the Games would " reflect very poorly " on the host nation .
" There was some criticism that the Internet closed down during events relating to Tibet in previous weeks - but this is not Games time , " he said .
" Our concern is that the press is able to operate as it has at previous Games during Games time . "
Some 30,000 journalists are expected to be in Beijing to cover the Games .
China frequently blocks access to certain websites - often restricting access to foreign media sites .
But foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang
Yu told the Associated Press that China 's " management " of the internet followed the " general practice of the international community " .
She declined to say if the internet would be unrestricted for journalists during the Olympics , AP noted .
THE FACTS
It is a basic tenet of human biology , taught in grade schools everywhere : Identical twins come from the same fertilized egg and , thus , share identical genetic profiles .
But according to new research , though identical twins share very similar genes , identical they are not .
The discovery opens a new understanding of why two people who hail from the same embryo can differ in phenotype , as biologists refer to a person ’s physical manifestation .
The new findings appear in the March issue of The American Journal of Human Genetics , in a study conducted by scientists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and universities in Sweden and the Netherlands .
The scientists examined the genes of 10 pairs of monozygotic , or identical , twins , including 9 pairs in which one twin showed signs of dementia or Parkinson ’s disease and the other did not .
It has long been known that identical twins develop differences that result from environment .
And in recent years , it has also been shown that some of their differences can spring from unique changes in what are known as epigenetic factors , the chemical markers that attach to genes and affect how they are expressed  in some cases by slowing or shutting the genes off , and in others by increasing their output .
Mr. Ward had been treasurer of the national Republican committee since 2003 .
He had also been a partner in a private campaign consulting firm , Political Compliance Services , that gained notice in the 2004 presidential campaign because of its work on behalf of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , a group that ran advertisements that criticized the military record of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts , the Democratic presidential nominee .
Committee officials said that bookkeeping irregularities were discovered in January after the chairman of the panel ’s auditing committee , Representative Mike Conaway of Texas , a certified public accountant , repeatedly asked to meet with representatives of the audit firm that was supposed to be reviewing the committee ’s books .
“ I just kept insisting that we meet with the auditors , ” Mr. Conaway said in an interview .
“ It finally came into my head , and as the circumstances unfolded , that no audit had been done . ”
He said that Mr. Ward had promised to set up a meeting with the auditors and scheduled the gathering in late January .
But 30 minutes before the scheduled meeting , committee officials said , Mr. Ward sent an e-mail message to colleagues announcing that , in fact , no audit had been done .
The officials said the fund - raising committee had since determined that its books had not been audited since 2003 and that Mr. Ward had submitted a series of falsified audits .
The committee then called in the F.B.I .
It is not clear , lawmakers said , if any fees were paid to audit firms in recent years by the committee , or where that money ended up .
“ This was a longtime trusted employee and there were no obvious signs that he was living beyond his means , ” Mr. Conaway said .
Mr. Conaway said that the many Republican lawmakers who used Mr. Ward for their campaign funds or for bookkeeping for their political action committees were now hurriedly reviewing their own books for evidence of missing money or other improprieties .
No CSS Reset
When asked recently about using a CSS reset stylesheet , I readily admitted that I do n't use them .
I do n't use them for my blog or for any project that I work on .
Admitting such can raise an eyebrow or two .
Reset stylesheets are definitely becoming commonplace — as you 'd expect with companies like Yahoo and industry leaders like Eric Meyer actively using them .
So , why have n't I jumped on board ?
What is a CSS Reset ?
In case you 've never heard of such a thing , a CSS Reset is designed to set a number of element styles to a specific baseline that creates consistency across various browsers .
In the beginning
When the idea of a reset style was first introduced , it was very basic .
It reset the margin and padding for all elements .
The problem with that was it caused havoc with elements that did n't want their margins or padding reset ( namely , form elements ) .
* { margin:0 ; padding:0 ; }
From there , people worked on adding to and fine - tuning the reset stylesheet to be more flexible and to reset more styles .
The Meyer reset is probably the finest culmination of this effort .
Eric Meyer 's Reset
Eric
Meyer 's reset took the concept of resetting margin and padding and took it to a whole new level , stripping styles from a number of elements , forcing you to think about what you wanted and add them back in .
List items would no longer have bullets , headings would no longer be bolded , and most elements would be stripped of their margin and padding , along with some other changes .
Working with Nothing
The problem I 've had with these resets is that I then find myself declaring much more than I ever needed to just to get browsers back to rendering things the way I want .
As it turns out , I 'm perfectly happy with how a number of elements render by default .
I like lists to have bullets and strong elements to have bolded text .
And I 'm okay if the various browsers show things slightly differently .
I 'm okay if one browser displays an H1 a few pixels larger or smaller than other browsers .
If one browser defaults to circle bullets and another to squares , that 's usually not a problem .
If it is , then I create a style that addresses that specific issue .
I do n't reset it back to zero and then set it again to what I really want .
One of the principles I took away from the Web Standards community was the concept that pixel perfect precision across the various rendering engines was impractical and a remnant of the table - based layouts of yesteryear .
With CSS and progressive enhancement , it was okay that things might look a little different from one browser to the next because of variations in what they supported .
Building up
With that said , the idea of developing a base CSS file that defines some common styles that I often want from project to project — like turning off margin and padding for form elements — is a good idea .
We 're seeing various CSS frameworks crop up such as Blueprint , YUI and 960.gs .
Each breaking the system down only to build it back up again .
Each starts with a reset , then adds on typography and a grid system .
Each of those still seem like more than I need , even though none are that large in size .
Blueprint is the heaviest at around 13 KB uncompressed but also includes lots of extras like styles for error messages and a print stylesheet .
Less is more
One of these days I 'll put together my own base CSS or maybe I wo n't .
To date , I have n't felt myself being overly repetitive in the styles that I set ; and I have n't thought to myself , " oh , the hours I 'd save myself if only I had a reset stylesheet . "
So , while I have nothing against CSS reset stylesheets , I simply do n't use them personally and I think that 's okay .
WASHINGTON  Undeterred by President Bush and Senator John McCain proudly pointing to progress in Iraq , Congressional Democrats are trying to mount new lines of attack against the administration ’s war policies .
In a shift from last year ’s failed legislative efforts to force a reduction of troops , the Democrats ’ new approach is aimed primarily at framing the issue for the November elections by focusing on the financial cost of military operations and on the war ’s implications for the nation ’s troubled economy .
With the fifth anniversary of the war fast approaching , the Democrats , citing testimony by the Pentagon ’s own commanders , are also emphasizing the strain on the armed forces .
In addition the Democrats contend that the war against terrorism should be waged primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan , not Iraq .
The change in tactics by the Democrats is one of necessity .
The closest they came last year to forcing the administration to alter its war plans was in September , when they mustered 56 votes  4 short of the 60 they needed  to advance legislation that would have required troops to be given as much time back in the United States as they spent overseas before being redeployed .
A catnap may be just as good as a long sleep
Just six minutes " shut - eye " for volunteers was followed by significantly better recall of words , New Scientist magazine reported .
" Ultra - short " sleep could launch memory processing in the brain , they suggested .
One UK researcher disagreed , saying that longer sleep was needed to have an impact on memory .
This demonstrates for the first time that an ultra - brief sleep episode provides an effective memory enhancement
University of Dusseldorf researchers
Dozens of studies have probed the relationship between sleep and memory , with clear evidence that body 's natural sleep - wake cycle plays an important role .
The team from the University of Dusseldorf wanted to see just how short a sleep could have any discernable impact .
They used a group of students who were asked to remember a set of words , then given an hour 's break before testing .
During that hour , some of the students were allowed to sleep for approximately six minutes , while the rest were kept asleep .
Remarkably , on waking , the napping students performed better in the memory test .
Some theories suggests that the processing of memories takes place in deep sleep , a phase which does not normally start until at least 20 minutes after falling asleep .
Six minute warning
However , the team , led by Dr Olaf Lahl , said that it was possible that the moment of falling asleep triggered a process in the brain that continued regardless of how long the person actually stayed awake .
" To our knowledge , this demonstrates for the first time that an ultra - brief sleep episode provides an effective memory enhancement , " he wrote .
Professor Jim Horne , from the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University , said that while the study was " interesting " , he was yet to be convinced that the effect was purely one of memory enhancement .
" The idea that memory could be enhanced in just six minutes is a quite unique finding and one has to be rather cautious about it .
" There is quite a bit of evidence that memory processing probably takes place more than six minutes into sleep . "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N is offering bankers at Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N bonuses to stay and support the controversial takeover , a person familiar with the situation said on Thursday .

JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon met with hundreds of Bear Stearns executives late Wednesday , his first meeting with bank employees since the takeover was agreed to on Sunday .
At the meeting , Dimon , aiming to head off an exodus of Bear Stearns staff , proposed incentives to bank employees who stay and support the deal .
He also expressed confidence that the deal would be completed as proposed , said the source , who was briefed on the meeting and is familiar with JPMorgan ’s thinking .
Employees who are offered jobs by JPMorgan would receive a bonus that includes JPMorgan shares .
Employees who are not offered jobs will receive at least a cash bonus of about 30 percent of their 2007 compensation if they stay through the completion of the deal , the source said .
It is unclear whether Bear Stearns employees , who own about 30 percent of the firm , were swayed by the offer .
“ There ’s more questions than answers at this point , ” said a person familiar with the workings at Bear Stearns .
Spokesmen for JPMorgan and Bear Stearns declined to comment .
Faced with a sudden cash crunch that threatened it with collapse , Bear Stearns agreed to an all - stock takeover offer from JPMorgan that values the storied investment bank at about $ 285 million .
A week ago it was valued at more than $ 8 billion .
BROKER POACHING
The fire sale offer of about $ 2.41 a share at current market prices shocked Bear Stearns employees , who saw much of their savings evaporate .
Layoffs are all but certain , though the extent of the job losses is not yet clear .
With Bear Stearns employees unsettled , recruiters sense an opportunity .
A Google search for “ financial services brokers ” brought up a link tagged “ Bear Stearns Brokers ” that connected to the Web site of executive search firm Willis Consulting Inc .
The sponsored link , however , has since been removed .
“ This opens up opportunities for us , ” said Audrey Cullen Davis , president of First Call Associates , a recruiter that specializes in commodities and energy trading .
“ For individuals that may not have taken the time to speak with us , now they ’re more interested in knowing what other opportunities they may be able to consider , ” said Davis , whose firm represents investment banks , commodities traders and private equity firms .
As part of the deal , JPMorgan secured special Federal Reserve financing for $ 30 billion of Bear Stearns ’ less liquid assets .
The agreement also includes an option that gives JPMorgan the right to buy Bear Stearns ’ valuable Manhattan headquarters , even if the deal is voted down by shareholders .
The transaction , seen as leaving little room for a counter offer , is a plum deal for JPMorgan , according to analysts .
The firm ’s shares have risen more than 20 percent this week and were up nearly 8 percent to $ 45.82 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
Bear Stearns shares were up 66 cents , or 12.5 percent , to $ 5.92 , buoyed by hopes of a better offer after tycoon Joseph Lewis , who owns 8.35 percent of Bear Stearns ’ shares , said he would talk with the bank and others about possible options .
This is going to piss off some people - considering who I 'm commenting to - but it drives me insane to see people just walking around with these things hanging from their ears when they 're not even talking to anyone .

When we think of the genetic changes that had to take place during our evolutionary history , we typically think of changes that resulted in a gain of function , like genetic changes that resulted in a larger and more sophisticated brain , improved teeth for our changing prehistoric diet , better bone anatomy for bipedalism , better throat anatomy for speech , and so on .
In many cases however , we have lost genes in our evolutionary history , and some of those losses have been beneficial .
The most widely known example , found in every introductory biochemistry textbook , is the sickle - cell mutation in hemoglobin - a clear example of a mutation that damages a functional protein yet confers a beneficial effect .
People with mutations in both copies of this particular gene are terribly sick , but those who have one good and one bad copy are more resistant to malaria .
Another example is thegene - people with mutations that damage this gene are more resistant to HIV .
In the more distant past , a universal human mutation in a particular muscle gene that results in weaker jaw muscles may have played a role in brain evolution , by removing a constraint on skull dimensions .
These few examples were found primarily by luck , but now with the availability of multiple mammalian genome sequences , researchers can systematically search for human genes that show signs of being adaptively lost at some point in our history .
David Haussler 's group at UC Santa Cruz , in a recent paper , looked for the genes we lost as we developed into our modern - day human species .
What they found could help us better understand our evolutionary history , and possibly the human diseases that are the side - effects of that history .
It 's not hard to find genes that have been lost in the human genome - our genomes are littered with pseudogenes , genes which harbor inactivating mutations making them unable to produce a functional protein .
But most of these damaged genes have functional copies elsewhere in the genome .
Genes are frequently duplicated in the random shuffling that goes on in our chromosomes , and often the duplicate copy will be destroyed by mutations while the good copy continues to perform its original function .
Another frequent phenomenon is the production of - these are genes that were produced when RNA was transcribed back into DNA and integrated into the genome .
The result is a gene that looks just like a highly processed RNA molecule , often surrounded by the classic genetic residue that is left behind when a piece of DNA is integrated back into the genome .
Haussler 's group was not interested in these two relatively mundane classes of pseudogenes ; they were searching for genes that are clearly functional in other mammals , and which have not been duplicated or reverse transcribed from RNA .
In other words , the genes they were looking for would have no other functional copies hanging around somewhere else in the genome .
Genes in this category are likely to be candidates forAfter completing their genome scan , and applying various quality control filters , Haussler 's group came up with 72 candidate lost genes .
They found some well - known lost genes , such as , an enzyme necessary for making vitamin C that was been destroyed in primates , but is still functional in most other mammals .
( If we still had a functional copy of this gene , we would n't get scurvy . )
Thee researchers found new lost genes as well , most of which have poorly characterized functions .
One gene , named ( NM_177028 in the mouse genome , for those of you who want to check out GenBank ) , contains a very highly conserved enzyme structure , called an acyltransferase domain ( see more here ) .
This particular acyltransferase domain is very ancient - it is found in bacteria , archaea , plants , fungi , and animals .
Many species have multiple copies of this domain ( the fruitfly has over 30 ) , but mammals have only a few copies , and humans have absolutely no functional copies .
We know almost nothing about this gene : it produces a membrane protein , it is expressed in the mouse pituitary gland , and it is necessary for normal embryo development in worms and flies .
Why was it lost in humans , and was that loss beneficial ?
We do n't know yet .
Do we get some diseases that mice do n't get , because we lack this gene ?
It would be fascinating to figure out .
Although we know little about , Haussler 's group was able to pinpoint the timeframe of the loss .
This gene was destroyed by a , a change from TGG ( coding for the amino acid tryptophan ) to TGA , which means stop - the protein is truncated right in the middle of a highly conserved region .
This TGG to TGA change is found only in chimps and humans , not gorillas , orangutans , or any other mammals checked .
The mutation therefore happened after the chimp - human lineage split off from the other great apes .
Gorillas and orangutans have a functionalgene ; humans and chimps do n't .
Other lost genes found by these researchers included genes lost in only chimps , gorillas and humans , genes lost in all great apes , and genes lost in primates .
Each of these losses is an example of an ancient gene that was functional for hundreds of millions of years , but then lost very recently in the lineage that led to primates , and ultimately humans .
Without detailed functional studies in multiple species , it is hard to know which genes were lost adaptively , providing an immediate benefit sustained by natural selection , and which were lost simply because they were no longer necessary in a particular environment ( such as the vitamin C biosynthesis enzyme ) .
But with this list of genes in hand , we know where to start .
It would be fascinating to figure if any of these lost genes are linked to human diseases ( likeand scurvy ) , since the lost function could provide an important clue regarding the mechanism of the disease .
It 's worth noting the implications of studies like this for the creation - evolution debate .
Creationists , including most of the major advocates for its latest form , Intelligent Design , have frequently expressed their disbelief in human evolution and the common ancestry of today 's species .
In the case of , the only plausible explanation for the pattern of mutation that Haussler 's group found is that humans and chimps shared a common ancestor .
If humans and chimps had been createdas separate species , it would an be extremely unlikely coincidence for these identical mutations to occur by chance individually in each species .
And when you factor in the distribution of dozens , hundreds , thousands of such mutations , all occurring in a similar pattern , it becomes not just unlikely but essentially impossible that such patterns of mutation would have arisen by chance in each separately created species .
One could suggest that a designer just decided to arrange things this way , but that argument falls in the same class as the claim that God just made the universe and the earthold , after creating it all 10,000 years ago .
There is simply no rationale based on evidence to question the fact of common descent , and those who continue to resist this fact can only do so for religious or psychological reasons .

As we taxi out to the runway please make yourself comfortable … and for those of you sitting on the right side of the plane … pelase ignore our other … um … airliner . ”
On August 22 , 1999 , Mandarin Airlines Flight 642 from Bangkok to Hong Kong crashed upon landing .
The plane , an MD - 11 , encountered a 24 - knot crosswind coincident with Typhoon Sam and came down too hard on its right side , causing the No. 3 engine to hit the runway and the right wing to separate from the fuselage .
The MD - 11 rolled over and slid off the runway upside down , bursting into flame and grinding to a halt on a grassy area adjacent to the runway , and stayed there for a couple of days , so all passengers from arriving flights came to see it .

Roth IRAs are one of my favorite investment vehicles because they offer great tax benefits , especially now that the IRS removed the income limitations for Roth IRA conversions , making Roth IRAs more easily accessible to virtually everyone .
That said , there are some limits to how much of a good thing you can have , and the IRS imposes strict limits for Roth IRA contributions .
In addition to the contribution limits , IRAs are a use it or lose it proposition – you only have one opportunity to make the contribution , and once it is gone , it is gone .
This article will show you how you can take advantage of the tax benefits IRAs offer and maximize your contributions .
How to Max Out Your Roth IRA Contributions
We are going to work with the assumption that you already have an IRA .
If you do n’t , then here is an article that discusses where to open an IRA .
In addition , I frequently reference Roth IRAs because I believe them to be the superior option for most people , however , these tips work or both Traditional and Roth IRAs .
Once your IRA is open you need to fund it .
You can do this one of several ways : contribute a lump sum for the entire year , set up a monthly allotment to maximize your contributions on a monthly basis , or a combination of these .
Let ’s a look at a couple examples and the pros and cons of each .
Maximizing IRA Contributions with a Lump Sum
People under age 50 can contribute up to $ 6,000 per year in an IRA , or up to $ 12,000 per couple ( people age 50 and over can contribute $ 1,000 more as a catch - up contribution ) .
If you have the money available to invest all at once without affecting your cash flow or emergency fund , then this is a good way to max out your contributions and be done with it .
Advantages of Lump Sum Investing
Pros : Studies show the lump sum investing at the beginning of the year almost always outperforms market timing or investing via dollar cost averaging , or making regular contributions throughout the year .
Studies show the lump sum investing at the beginning of the year almost always outperforms market timing or investing via dollar cost averaging , or making regular contributions throughout the year .
The markets tend to go up over the long run , so the longer you have your money in the market , the longer it has to grow in value .
Disadvantages of Lump Sum Investing
Cons :
There are some downsides to investing all at once – the first is you could invest everything right before a market crash or adjustment and lost a lot of money ( dollar cost averaging would spread your contributions and minimize your upside and downside ) .

The other risk is contributing too much if you are near the Roth IRA income limits or Traditional IRA deductibility income limits .
Did you contribute too much ?
Here is what to do about excess Roth IRA contributions .
Maximizing IRA Investments with Dollar Cost Averaging
Dollar Cost Averaging ( DCA ) is a method of investing where you make contributions on a periodic basis ( usually monthly , or with your paycheck ) to the same investment .
This is a common way to invest in employer - sponsored retirement plans such as a 401k , but also works for individual investments .
There are pros and cons to this approach .
Advantages of Dollar Cost Averaging
Pros : Dollar Cost Averaging is easy , more affordable for the average investor , and it removes guesswork and market timing from the equation .
Dollar Cost Averaging is easy , more affordable for the average investor , and it removes guesswork and market timing from the equation .
Setting up automatic monthly payments ensures you always make the investment , and the monthly investments make it easier to maximize your contributions .
It is easier for most people to contribute a few hundred dollars each month vs. making an annual lump sum contribution of several thousand dollars .
DCA removes market timing from the equation : since you make the same contribution each period , you buy more shares when the value is low and fewer shares when the value is high .
Disadvantages of Dollar Cost Averaging
Cons :
There are a couple of things to look out for with dollar cost averaging – because you are making more transactions , you may be subjecting yourself to more fees .
This is n’t likely the case when making 401k contributions because there normally are n’t transaction fees , but it may be the case if you are investing through a brokerage or buying individual shares of stocks on a regular basis .

Most studies show that lump sum investing is advantageous , with time in the market being more important than timing the market .
How to Maximize Your IRA Contributions with Dollar Cost Averaging
To set your investment contributions on auto - pilot , simply divide your maximum contribution by the number of months ( or paychecks ) .
For example , if you want to max out your IRA with 12 monthly contributions , then you would set up automatic investments for $ 500.00 per month for a single investor ( $ 6,000 max annual contribution ) or $ 1,000.00 per month for a married couple ( $ 12,000 max contribution ) .
Learn more about spousal IRAs , which allow you to contribute to an IRA for a spouse , even if he or she has no earned income of their own ( this is only allowed for married couples filing jointly ) .
If you are age 50 or over , then divide $ 7,000 by 12 for $ 583.33 per month .
Combination of Lump Sum and Dollar Cost Averaging
The third way to max out your IRA contributions is to do a combination of the two methods listed above ( Value Averaging is another common method ) .
There are a couple ways this can benefit you .
For example , say you want to maximize your IRA contributions , but it ’s May and you have n’t started yet .
You can contribute a lump sum of $ 2,000 to make up for the first 4 months of the year , then set up a monthly contribution of $ 500.00 per month for the remainder of the year .
This will ensure you are able to maximize your annual Roth IRA contributions this year .
The bonus is you will also have automatic contributions set up for maximizing your Roth IRA contributions next year .
Another way to do it is to set up monthly contributions for the amount you can afford on a monthly basis , then try to make contributions for that tax year before the tax filing deadline .
The IRS allows IRA contributions until that tax year ’s filing deadline , giving you a few extra months to max out your IRA contributions .
For example , if you set up a monthly investment plan of $ 300 per month at the beginning of the year you would contribute $ 3,600 by Dec. 31st .
You could still contribute the additional $ 2,400 to max out your IRA by the tax deadline of April 15th .
The benefit of going this route is that it allows you to contribute what you can afford , and still have time to make up for the full contributions if you are able to do so at a later date .
It also gives you the ability to reassess your income situation if you are concerned about your ability to make contributions to a Roth IRA based on income limitations .
Maximizing Your IRA Contributions Will Help You Reach your Goals
Maxing out your IRA contributions each year is a great way to set yourself up for retirement .
The more you contribute each year , and the longer your time frame , the more money you will likely accumulate in your IRA .
Keep in mind , each retirement account has different rules regarding how and when you can make withdrawals .
For example , Roth IRA Withdrawal rules allow you to withdraw contributions at any time , but there are specific rules regarding when you can withdraw earnings .
There are also age limitations .
We encourage you to understand the impact of making your contributions as well as what happens when you finally tap into your hard - earned investments !

THE JET FUEL ; HOW HOT DID IT HEAT
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER ?
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) report into collapse of the WTC towers , estimates that about 3,500 gallons of jet fuel burnt within each of the towers .
Imagine that this entire quantity of jet fuel was injected into just one floor of the World Trade Center , that the jet fuel burnt with perfect efficency , that no hot gases left this floor , that no heat escaped this floor by conduction and that the steel and concrete had an unlimited amount of time to absorb all the heat .
With these ideal assumptions we calculate the maximum temperature that this one floor could have reached .
" The Boeing 767 is capable of carrying up to 23,980 gallons of fuel and it is estimated that , at the time of impact , each aircraft had approximately 10,000 gallons of unused fuel on board ( compiled from Government sources ) . "
" If one assumes that approximately 3,000 gallons of fuel were consumed in the initial fireballs , then the remainder either escaped the impact floors in the manners described above or was consumed by the fire on the impact floors .
If half flowed away , then 3,500 gallons remained on the impact floors to be consumed in the fires that followed . "

Remember , this figure is a huge over - estimate , as ( among other things ) it assumes that the steel and concrete had an unlimited amount of time to absorb the heat , whereas in reality , the jet fuel fire was all over in one or two minutes , and the energy not absorbed by the concrete and steel within this brief period ( that is , almost all of it ) would have been vented to the outside world .
" The time to consume the jet fuel can be reasonably computed .
At the upper bound , if one assumes that all 10,000 gallons of fuel were evenly spread across a single building floor , it would form a pool that would be consumed by fire in less than 5 minutes "
Summarizing :
We have assumed that the entire 3,500 gallons of jet fuel was confined to just one floor of the World Trade Center , that the jet fuel burnt with perfect efficency , that no hot gases left this floor , that no heat escaped this floor by conduction and that the steel and concrete had an unlimited amount of time to absorb all the heat .
Then it is impossible that the jet fuel , by itself , raised the temperature of this floor more than 257° C ( 495° F ) .
" In the mid-1990s British Steel and the Building Research Establishment performed a series of six experiments at Cardington to investigate the behavior of steel frame buildings .
These experiments were conducted in a simulated , eight - story building .
Secondary steel beams were not protected .
Despite the temperature of the steel beams reaching 800- 900° C ( 1,500 - 1,700° F ) in three of the tests ( well above the traditionally assumed critical temperature of 600° C ( 1,100° F ) , no collapse was observed in any of the six experiments . "
Conclusion :
So , once again , you have been lied to by the media , are you surprised ?
Quote from the FEMA report into the collapse of WTC's One and Two ( Chapter Two ) .
Since the aircraft were only flying from Boston to Los Angeles , they would have been nowhere near fully fueled on takeoff ( the aircraft have a maximum range of 7,600 miles ) .
They would have carried just enough fuel for the trip together with some safety factor .
Remember , that carrying excess fuel means higher fuel bills and less paying passengers .
The aircraft would have also burnt some fuel between Boston and New York .
Quote from the FEMA report into the collapse of WTC's One and Two ( Chapter Two ) .
What we propose to do , is pretend that the entire 3,500 gallons of jet fuel was confined to just one floor of the World Trade Center , that the jet fuel burnt with the perfect quantity of oxygen , that no hot gases left this floor and that no heat escaped this floor by conduction .
With these ideal assumptions ( none of which were meet in reality ) we will calculate the maximum temperature that this one floor could have reached .
Of course , on that day , the real temperature rise of any floor due to the burning jet fuel , would have been considerably lower than the rise that we calculate , but this estimate will enable us to demonstrate that the " official " explanation is a lie .
Note that a gallon of jet fuel weighs about 3.1 kilograms , hence 3,500 gallons weighs 3,500 x 3.1 = 10,850 kgs .
Jet fuel is a colorless , combustible , straight run petroleum distillate liquid .
Its principal uses are as an ingredient in lamp oils , charcoal starter fluids , jet engine fuels and insecticides .
It is also know as , fuel oil # 1 , kerosene , range oil , coal oil and aviation fuel .
It is comprised of hydrocarbons with a carbon range of C9 - C17 .
The hydrocarbons are mainly alkanes C , with n ranging from 9 to 17 .
It has a flash point within the range 42° C - 72° C ( 110° F - 162° F ) .
And an ignition temperature of 210° C ( 410° F ) .
Depending on the supply of oxygen , jet fuel burns by one of three chemical reactions : ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Reaction ( 1 ) occurs when jet fuel is well mixed with air before being burnt , as for example , in jet engines .
Reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) occur when a pool of jet fuel burns .
When reaction ( 3 ) occurs the carbon formed shows up as soot in the flame .
This makes the smoke very dark .
In the aircraft crashes at the World Trade Center , the impact ( with the aircraft going from 500 or 600 mph to zero ) would have throughly mixed the fuel that entered the building with the limited amount of air available within .
In fact , it is likely that all the fuel was turned into a flammable mist .
However , for sake of argument we will assume that 3,500 gallons of the jet fuel did in fact form a pool fire .
This means that it burnt according to reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .
Also note that the flammable mist would have burnt according to reactions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , as the quantity of oxygen within the building was quite limited .
Since we do not know the exact quantities of oxygen available to the fire , we will assume that the combustion was perfectly efficient , that is , that the entire quantity of jet fuel burnt via reaction ( 1 ) , even though we know that this was not so .
This generous assumption will give a temperature that we know will be higher than the actual temperature of the fire attributable to the jet fuel .
We need to know that theof jet fuel when burnt via reaction ( 1 ) is 42 - 44 MJ/kg .
The calorific value of a fuel is the amount of energy released when the fuel is burnt .
We will use the higher value of 44 MJ / kg as this will lead to a higher maximum temperature than the lower value of 42 ( and we wish to continue being outrageously generous in our assumptions ) .
For a cleaner presentation and simpler calculations we will also assume that our hydrocarbons are of the form C .
The dropping of the 2 hydrogen atoms does not make much difference to the final result and the interested reader can easily recalculate the figures for a slightly more accurate result .
So we are now assuming the equation : ( 4 ) However , this model , does not take into account that the reaction is proceeding in air , which is only partly oxygen .
Dry air is 79 % nitrogen and 21 % oxygen ( by volume ) .
Normal air has a moisture content from 0 to 4 % .
We will include the water vapor and the other minor atmospheric gases with the nitrogen .
So the ratio of the main atmospheric gases , oxygen and nitrogen , is 1 : 3.76 .
In molar terms : Because oxygen comes mixed with nitrogen , we have to include it in the equations .
Even though it does not react , it is " along for the ride " and will absorb heat , affecting the overall heat balance .
Thus we need to use the equation : ( 5 ) From this equation we see that the molar ratio of Cto that of the products is :
In the conversion of moles to kilograms we have assumed the atomic weights of hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen and oxygen are 1 , 12 , 14 and 16 respectively .
Now each of the towers contained 96,000 ( short ) tons of steel .
That is an average of 96,000 / 117 = 820 tons per floor .
Lets suppose that the bottom floors contained roughly twice the amount of steel of the upper floors ( since the lower floors had to carry more weight ) .
So we estimate that the lower floors contained about 1,100 tons of steel and the upper floors about 550 tons = 550 x 907.2 ≈ 500,000 kgs .
We will assume that the floors hit by the aircraft contained the lower estimate of 500,000 kgs of steel .
This generously underestimates the quantity of steel in these floors , and once again leads to a higher estimate of the maximum temperature .
Each story had a floor slab and a ceiling slab .
These slabs were 207 feet wide , 207 feet deep and 4 ( in parts 5 ) inches thick and were constructed from lightweight concrete .
So each slab contained 207 x 207 x 1/3 = 14,283 cubic feet of concrete .
Now a cubic foot of lightweight concrete weighs about 50kg , hence each slab weighed 714,150 ≈ 700,000 kgs .
Together , the floor and ceiling slabs weighed some 1,400,000 kgs .
So , now we take all the ingredients and estimate a maximum temperature to which they could have been heated by 3,500 gallons of jet fuel .
We will call this maximum temperature T. Since the calorific value of jet fuel is 44 MJ / kg .
We know that 3,500 gallons = 31,000 kgs of jet fuelThis is the total quantity of energy available to heat the ingredients to the temperature T .
But what is the temperature T ?
To find out , we first have to calculate the amount of energy absorbed by each of the ingredients .
That is , we need to calculate the energy needed to raise :
To calculate the energy needed to heat the above quantities , we need their
The specific heat of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise one kilogram of the substance by one degree centigrade .
Substituting these values into the above , we obtain :
The assumption that the specific heats are constant over the temperature range
25° - T° C , is a good approximation if T turns out to be relatively small ( as it does ) .
For larger values of T this assumption once again leads to a higher maximum temperature ( as the specific heat for these substances increases with temperature ) .
We have assumed the initial temperature of the surroundings to be 25° C .
The quantity , ( T - 25 ) ° C , is the temperature rise .
So the amount of energy needed to raise one floor to the temperature T° C is= ( 39,857 x 1,690 + 97,429 x 845 + 349,680 x 1,038 + 500,000 x 450 + 1,400,000 x 800 ) x ( T - 25 ) = ( 67,358,330 +
82,327,505 + 362,967,840 + 225,000,000 + 1,120,000,000 ) x ( T - 25 ) Joules= 1,857,653,675 x ( T - 25 ) Joules .
Since the amount of energy available to heat this floor is 477,400,000,000 Joules , we have that 1,857,653,675 x ( T - 25 ) = 477,400,000,0001,857,653,675 x T - 46,441,341,875 = 477,400,000,000
Therefore T = ( 477,400,000,000 +
46,441,341,875)/1,857,653,675 = 282° C ( 540° F ) .
So , the jet fuel could ( at the very most ) have only added T - 25 = 282 - 25 = 257° C ( 495° F ) to the temperature of the typical office fire that developed .
Quote from the FEMA report into the collapse of WTC's One and Two ( Chapter Two ) .
Here are statements from three eye - witnesses that provide evidence that the heating due to the jet fuel was indeed minimal .
Donovan Cowan was in an open elevator at the 78th floor sky - lobby ( one of the impact floors of the South Tower ) when the aircraft hit .
He has been quoted as saying : Stanley Praimnath was on the 81st floor of the South Tower : Ling Young was in her 78th floor office : Neither Stanley Praimnath nor Donovan Cowan nor Ling Young were cooked by the jet fuel fire .
All three survived .
Now this temperature is nowhere near high enough to even begin explaining the World Trade Center Tower collapse .
It is not even close to the first critical temperature of 600° C ( 1,100° F ) where steel loses about half its strength and it is nowhere near the quotes of 1500° C that we constantly read about in our lying media .
Quote from the FEMA report ( Appendix A ) .
Recalling that the North Tower suffered no major structural damage from the intense office fire of February 23 , 1975 , we can conclude that the ensuing office fires of September 11 , 2001 , also did little extra damage to the towers .
The jet fuel fires played almost no role in the collapse of the World Trade Center .
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexican soldiers looking for drug traffickers found $ 6 million in cash inside a truck near the U.S. border and arrested five men at the scene , the army said on Friday .
Army drug squads in the northern state of Tamaulipas , a smuggling hot spot over the border from Texas , found the U.S. currency stuffed into eight suitcases as they inspected a tractor trailer and smaller truck parked along a highway .
They also found four pistols , the army said in a statement .
Army and federal police units deployed in President Felipe Calderon ’s 15 - month - old crackdown on drug cartels are grappling with a spike in violence that has left more than 800 people dead in gangland - style killings so far this year .
The U.S. - Mexico border is the main entry point for South American cocaine and other drugs smuggled north to U.S. consumers .
Mexico ’s powerful cartels buy masses of U.S. arms and their safe houses brim with cash from their organized crime businesses .
Army raids have turned up big hauls of guns and cash since Calderon ’s operation began .
Also on Friday , the daily El Universal reported that five soldiers had been arrested for passing information to the Sinaloa alliance of Pacific Coast smugglers .
JERUSALEM ( CNN ) -- Vice President Dick Cheney arrived Saturday night in Israel , where he pledged America 's " enduring and unshakable " commitment to the security of the Jewish state as it approaches its 60th anniversary .
Vice President Dick Cheney , left , and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reaffirmed their alliance Saturday .
Cheney met with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to kick off a weekend of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders .
" Our two countries have been more than just strong allies .
We 've been friends , special friends , " Cheney said at a news conference with Olmert .
" Both our nations share the ideals of liberty , equality , human dignity and representative government . "
" Both our nations have stood firm against forces of terror and intimidation .
...
We are natural allies , " Cheney added .
He reaffirmed that the United States was committed to Israel 's " right to defend itself against terrorism and rocket attacks and other threats from forces dedicated to Israel 's destruction . "
In turn , Olmert called Cheney " a very good supporter and friend of the state of Israel . "
Watch Cheney discuss the U.S. - Israel relationship »
The Israeli prime minister said the two leaders would discuss Iran and peace negotiations with the Palestinians as well as Syria and Hezbollah .
" We will always be happy to hear your advice and your observations about these very important issues , which are on the top of the agenda of the state of Israel , " Olmert told Cheney .
Cheney , who spent the past two days in Saudi Arabia , planned to attend an Easter service Sunday in Jerusalem before heading to Ramallah in the West Bank for talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Cheney 's visit comes on the heels of a similar trip by President Bush , who pushed renewed Mideast peace talks that he hoped would achieve a resolution before his final year in office ends .
Cheney reiterated Bush 's goals , saying Abbas and Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad " too can be certain of America 's goodwill in this process . "
" It 's not America 's role to dictate the outcome , but we will help with the negotiations and provide all the support and encouragement we can , " Cheney said .
" We want to see a resolution to the conflict and an end to the terrorism that has caused so much grief for the Israelis . "
Southern Israeli towns have faced a near - daily stream of rocket attacks from Palestinian militants in Gaza for months .
In response , Israeli troops launched a five - day push into Gaza this month that left at least 110 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers dead .
And earlier this month , a man armed with an automatic weapon and a handgun slipped into a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem and killed eight students .
" We must not and will not ignore the darkening shadows of the situations in Gaza , in Lebanon , in Syria and in Iran and the forces there working to derail the hopes of the world , " Cheney said .
A delegation of Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives , led by Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio , also arrived in Jerusalem on Saturday .
" This congressional visit will give us the opportunity to discuss important issues of mutual concern between our two countries , the peace process and regional security , including Iraq , Iran , Syria , and Lebanon , " Boehner said in a statement .

Proteins in alligator blood could lead to new drugs that fight the super infections that plague humans , Louisiana researchers says .
Alligators often get banged up in battles over territory or food , but Mark Merchant of McNeese State University in Lake Charles , La. , noticed they never seem to get infected , despite slimy living conditions in bacteria - filled swamps .

Blog keeps you on top of infectious diseases
" These alligators tend to get into tussles and fights , " says Lancia Darville , a researcher at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and a study co-author .
" They have torn limbs and scratches that are exposed to all of this bacteria in the water , yet they are never infected . "
In a study , presented this week at the American Chemical Society meeting in New Orleans , Merchant and other experts explain why .
When researchers exposed 23 species of bacteria to the serum from alligator blood , all of the bugs were destroyed .
Humans typically can defeat only eight of the bacteria .
" That was a good indication that alligators must have some other additional proteins or some proteins that are overly expressed in their system that are either not present in ours or not overexpressed in ours , " Darville says .
The study was the first to explore the anti-microbial activity of alligator blood in detail , according to the American Chemical Society .
Alligators have what is called an innate immune system , one that is born ready to fight bugs .
People also have innate immunity against certain bacteria , but must develop immunity to some invaders through exposure to the bugs .
Researchers are encouraged because the alligator blood serum killed more species of bacteria .
" They do n't need to be exposed to any microorganism such as bacteria , viruses , fungi for their bodies to respond against them , " Danville says .
The findings may lead scientists to new drugs that can fight some of the most stubborn infections in humans , such as the " superbugs " that resist antibiotics .
If scientists can identify and then mimic the alligator 's microscopic defenders , Darville says , they might be able to make stronger bug - fighting pills or creams that could be applied to burns to fight infections .
" Ultimately , we would like to determine what the chemical structure is , " Darville says .
" Once we can do that , we could eventually develop these into different anti-bacterial and anti-fungal drugs . "

An investigation by Fox 4 News in Dallas , Texas has turned up a story that is becoming more and more common as ticket cameras spread across the country .
A Dallas man found the house of his dreams and was ready to buy , but his credit score came back as inadequate .
Here ’s the surprising reason why :
Bob needed a score of 700 or higher to get the loan , and had it until ACS , a Dallas based company reported an unpaid collection of $ 100 .
“ My initial reaction was , ‘ What could it be ? ’ ” asked Bob .
“ Who is ACS ?
I do n’t have a single dollar owed to a credit card , ” he continued .
ACS , Affiliated Computer Services , is the private company the City of Dallas hired to run its red light camera program .
As it turns out , several of the cars used by Bob ’s company were in his name .
Someone driving one of them got a red light ticket in the spring .
He did n’t know about the ticket until the collection showed up on his credit report .
He still does n’t know who was behind the wheel .
“ Was it an employee that had a ticket in the car that thought they could pay it and did n’t want to tell me about it ?
I do n’t know , ” said Bob .
This is a real - life example of a major flaw in red - light camera programs which we outlined in an earlier post , 10 Reasons To Oppose Red-Light Cameras .
Ticket recipients are not adequately notified .
And this is not an isolated case .
According to Fox 4 News , in the first 11 months of Dallas ’s red light camera program , ACS and the city reported 11,073 unpaid citations to credit bureaus .
How many of those people are unaware of their tickets ?
How many people have had their credit damaged because a ticket got lost in the mail or their address was incorrect ?
The state of Texas passed a law earlier this year , co-authored by State Sen. John Carona ( R ) , to stop the practice of reporting unpaid camera tickets to credit bureaus , but the city of Dallas has found a loophole :
So why , three months after the law went into effect , is Dallas still reporting people to credit bureaus ?
City staff says the law applies only to new contracts executed after the law went in to effect .
In October , the City of Dallas extended its contract with ACS to 2013 .
But that does n’t wash with Senator Carona .
“ I think it would be offensive to the intent of the law , ” said Carona .
Dallas mayor , Tom Leppert , is aware of the process and clearly has no intention of stopping it .
Check out this political doublespeak :
“ Clearly we ’re going to obey the law , ” said Dallas Mayor , Tom Leppert .
Mayor Leppert says the city will not use a technicality to justify credit reporting .
“ We ’re not going to play loopholes , ” said Mayor Leppert .
“ We want to be fair with the spirit of the law and I agree with the senator there .
To be consistent though , we also have to look at what our contractual arrangements are . ” FOX 4 interviewed Mayor Leppert on November 19 .
So far , the city is still reporting people to credit bureaus for not paying red light tickets .
Will that change ?
Not likely .
The mayor ’s spokesperson now says there ’s nothing wrong with what they ’re doing , and they ’ll keep on reporting .
The politicians in Dallas are saying one thing and doing another .
It ’s clear that their allegiance is to the ticket camera manufacturer and not their constituents .
Apparently a few bad credit reports for Dallas residents do n’t compare to the millions in dollars in revenue that the cameras generate .
We need to put pressure on the city to stop this practice now , not in 2013 .
Malware authors have written a worm for Orkut , Google - owned networking site that 's big in Brazil .
The Scrapkut worm uses active code injection to spread between victims and their friends on Orkut .
The malicious code appears on a victim ’s scrapbook , containing a link to a supposed YouTube video .
People who click on the link are redirected to an external site hosting malware that 's disguised as a Flash upgrade .
Users duped into installing the software get malicious Javascript code injected into their next active Orkut web session .
This malicious scrapbook entry is then sent to all the victims ' friends , recommencing the infection cycle .
An analysis by Symantec can be found here .
Judging by the counter on a web page associated with the malware ( not the most reliable of indicators ) about 13,000 users are already infected by the Scrapkut worm , which is n't - for now - doing anything particularly nasty other than spreading .
By contrast an earlier worm that spread across the Orkut network last December infected an estimated 655,000 people .
Google plugged the cross -site scripting ( XSS ) error that made the attack possible hours later , thwarting tfurther propagation of that fast - spreading worm . ®
Exceptions to the process should be reserved for exceptional circumstances .
It ’s business as usual
Critical Chain is an amazing book .
The narrative form — a novella detailing a technical project team and their search for a way to manage an uncertain process — highlights the ways that Critical Chain Project Management handles risks and uncertainty and makes it visible where you can manage it in advance .
The section on estimating tasks alone is priceless , and I can tell you that the book gave me a vocabulary and a process for effectively negotiating dates and deliverables with my managers .
If doing things “ The wrong way ” is common practice on your team , it is n’t exceptional :
It ’s business as usual .
This essay was provoked ( in a good way ! ) by James Golick ’s Crunch Mode Paradox : Turning Superstars Average .
This basic principle came up during a discussion of Crunch Mode .
“ Crunch Mode ” is a hip way to say Death March , only you make it sound like it ’s not so bad because it only happens for a short time at the end of a project , and it ’s a temporary phenomenon just to tide us over until things return to normal .
In other words , Crunch Mode is an exception to the way things are normally done in response to exceptionally tight deadlines .
Or is it ?
I have encountered developers who say “ I know this is n’t the right way to do things , but this is an exception ” to explain why they are not writing unit tests , refactoring problem code , or any of a number of other practices that they assure me are the right way to write software .
Yes , they know the overall value of certain practices .
And they understand that the rot they are introducing to the code — like technical debt — is dangerous and expensive to carry .
Not just for “ future generations of maintenance programmers , ” but for the current team on the current milestone .
But this is an exception , damn it !
My first question is always how often this has happened in the past .
Were they doing this last week ?
Last milestone ?
Last project ?
If the answer is yes ( and sadly for me , it has been yes far often than no ) , then my next job is to stop them from using this excuse .
If doing things “ The wrong way ” is common practice on your team , it is n’t exceptional : .
And that means you have to change or ‘ fess up , jut your chin out , and boldly proclaim that you do n’t need no stinkin’ unit tests .
Exceptional behaviour is certainly possible and might be the right thing to do under exceptional circumstances .
But there are two tests for exceptional circumstances you can apply :
First , if they happen frequently , they are n’t exceptions :
The way you handle them is your business as usual .
Second , if they can be predicted in advance , they are n’t exceptions either .
I know for a fact that stake holders want things that are n’t in the telephone book of requirements .
I know for a fact that no matter how many rspecs and unit tests I write , handing my software to someone else will uncover bugs .
H*ck , I might discover bugs just deploying my software on another system , and I think it ’s an immutable law of software that the more important the person viewing a demo , the more embarrassing the bugs will be .
I cannot tell you with a straight face that any of these “ unplanned things ” require exceptional behaviour on my part .
I may not know exactly which bug will arise , but I know statistically that bugs happen , that requirements come into focus , and that estimates are just estimates .
I do not say to my boss , “ I had no idea they wanted a view for this behaviour , I had no idea this other thing would n’t work as expected , therefore we need to finish the work without testing .
” I can — and do — expect these things to happen , and therefore I can — and must — plan for them .
Of course , if you fail to manage appropriately , or fail to convince your team that you ought to manage appropriately , then you will find yourself doing things “ The wrong way . ”
But you cannot blame the circumstances , you must blame the choices your team made ( or neglected to make ) when you first planned your development .
You must say , “ We chose this course of action with our eyes wide open back on such - and - such a date .
” I ’ve been talking about coding here , but I usually think about team management as the goats .
When people are burning out in a Death March at the end of the project , am I to believe that the manager “ had no choice , the client was unreasonable ? ”
Let me see .
How do all of the projects you manage go ?
Are they all like this ?
Must I look at the second test , whether you could have predicted that this client would behave like every other client ?
Managing projects means either endorsing and advocating things like Death Marches or it means predicting the circumstances that lead to them and making decisions in advance that avoid them .
Crunch
Time can be a conscious decision .
But please , show me where you wrote “ overtime ” in the plan at the start of the project .
Show me how you planned to complete the high value , must do well features first , leaving the ones that could be incomplete and buggy for the end when people would be working without sleep .
If you fail to plan for Crunch Time , you are not managing your project properly .
For example , the traditional model of project management had the software become “ feature complete ” first , and then Crunch Time would inevitably occur during a bug fixing phase .
The problem with this is that the team was now painted into a corner where you could not manage the process .
Sure , you could decide which bugs to fix , and therefore you had some ability to decide which features were more important than others , but you could only manage the buggy features .
If something was of lower value but was working properly , you cannot go back and do a buggy job of it in half the time so that the developer would be freed up to fix bugs on something important .
Managers knew this , of course , which is why they often whipped developers to complete their work in haste early in the project .
Paradoxically , this made it easier to manage priorities in a traditional model .
The agile model addresses the issue of managing Crunch Time by doing high value activities first , so that when Crunch Time comes around , you only have low value items .
There is no need to whine that you have no choice because a critical feature needs to be ready on Monday .
And if you discover something entirely new and unforeseen to do for Monday , you know that it can leapfrog the other items in the backlog because they are n’t that important .
Does agile always eliminate Crunch Time ?
No , nothing involving humans and free choice always does what you expect .
But it is an example of a model where you predict the “ exceptional circumstances ” and prepare for them .
There are other ways to predict exceptional circumstances and prepare for them , of course .
The point is that the ends of milestones and projects are known to be difficult and challenging and you need to have a plan from day zero .
And that is the point of managing software development , whether you are managing your behaviour as a developer , managing a team , managing stake holder expectations , or managing a product : it ’s your job to expect and plan for these things so that the only time you are “ making exceptions ” is when the circumstances are truly exceptional , when rare and unforeseeable opportunities arise .
Sea level rise is fuelled by melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change proposes a maximum sea level rise of 81 cm ( 32 in ) this century .
But in the journal Nature Geoscience , researchers say the true maximum could be about twice that : 163 cm ( 64in ) .
They looked at what happened more than 100,000 years ago - the last time Earth was this warm .
The results join other studies showing that current sea level projections may be very conservative .
Sea level rise is a key effect of global climate change .
There are two major contributory effects : expansion of sea water as the oceans warm , and the melting of ice over land .
In the latest study , researchers came up with their estimates by looking at the so - called interglacial period , some 124,000 to 119,000 years ago , when Earth 's climate was warmer than it is now due to a different configuration of the planet 's orbit around the Sun .
That was the last time sea levels reached up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) above where they are now , fuelled by the melting of ice sheets that covered Greenland and Antarctica .
' Robust ' work
The researchers say their study is the first robust documentation of how quickly sea levels rose to that level .
" Until now , there have been no data that sufficiently constrain the full rate of past sea level rises above the present level , " lead author Eelco Rohling , of Britain 's National Oceanography Centre in Southampton , said in a statement .
Rohling and his colleagues found an average sea level rise of 1.6 m ( 64in ) each century during the interglacial period .
Back then , Greenland was 3C to 5C ( 5.4 F to 9 F ) warmer than now - which is similar to the warming period expected in the next 50 to 100 years , Dr Rohling said .
Current models of ice sheet activity do not predict rates of change this large .
However , they also do not include many of the dynamic processes already being observed by glaciologists , the researchers said .
" The average rise of 1.6 m per century that we find is roughly twice as high as the maximum estimates in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report , and so offers the first potential constraint on the dynamic ice sheet component that was not included in the headline IPCC values , " explained Dr Rohling .
Last year , a separate study found sea level rise projections could be under - estimating the impact of human - induced climate change on the world 's oceans .
Stefan Rahmstorf , from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research , Germany , and colleagues plotted global mean surface temperatures against sea level rise , and found that levels could rise by 59 % more than current forecasts .

Nice try !
It is exactly specualtion and rationalization on your part ( without knowledge of all the case facts ) to insist Donahue 's passing a polygraph regarding the Girard case prevented his continuation as a suspect in the any other case .
I am not sure I must have missed where Donohue took a polygraph in the Giambra case .
Jim , I have not claimed that Donohue 's passed polygraph regarding the death of Crystallynn Girard " prevented his continuation as a suspect in any other case . "
Nor have I stated that Donohue was polygraphed in connection with the death of Joan Giambra .
What I 'm suggesting is that had not investigators relied on Donohue 's passed polygraph , and had they not wrongly excluded him as a suspect in the death of Crystallynn Girard , then Donohue might not have been at liberty to kill Joan Giambra some seven moths later .
Quote :
Remember , polygraph is an investigative tool , NOT the end all to be all in investigations .
Does what you suggest occur ?
Sure .
But if the DA or police had anything ( at the time ) concerning either case , they certainly would have considered it and probably discounted the polygraph results .
That happens all the time .
The police had nothing , so to suggest the polygraph results in one case presented itself as a wall for further consideration of involvement in that or any other case is rediculous .
Investigators either believe the polygraph community 's claims that their " test " has an accuracy rate in the 90 % percentile or they do n't .
If do believe such claims ( which are
Quote :
At the time , there was no DNA .
So let 's look at it from that time frame .
No evidence to suggest his involvement , no ability to pursue him .
Donohue had both motive and opportunity .
And he had been questioned in connection with the 1975 strangulation of Carol Reed , who lived in the same building and with whom he had had a relationship .
Quote :
OK george I get it .
False negatives occur .
If your purpose is to attack every infrequent case a polygraph is less than viable , then so be it .
But to attack the overall utility and accuracy because of a few select cases out of hundreds of thousands is a weak strategy .
Polygraph errors are not so uncommon , and AntiPolygraph.org is not prepared to allow them to be swept under the rug or flushed down the memory hole .
High - profile cases where killers passed the polygraph include the aforementioned case of Green River Killer
Quote :
Furthermore , there is no way to know if the victim Giambra would still be alive if the polygraph results pertaining to Girard were any different and to suggest so is disinformative and borderline insanity .
What you 're suggesting is that had the results in the Girard case been different , Donohue would definitely not have committed any further murders ?
You do not know that , neither does anyone else .
But , I guess it serves your purpose to connect dots that do n't exist ..
It 's true that we cannot know that Joan Giambra would not have been killed had not Dennis Donohue ( apparently erroneously ) passed his polygraph regarding the death of Crystallynn Girard .
But it 's a distinct possibility .
sackett wrote on Apr 30 , 2008 at 11:00 pm: Jim , I have not claimed that Donohue 's passed polygraph regarding the death of Crystallynn Girard " prevented his continuation as a suspect in any other case . "
Nor have I stated that Donohue was polygraphed in connection with the death of Joan Giambra .
What I 'm suggesting is that had not investigators relied on Donohue 's passed polygraph , and had they not wrongly excluded him as a suspect in the death of Crystallynn Girard , then Donohue might not have been at liberty to kill Joan Giambra some seven moths later .
Investigators either believe the polygraph community 's claims that their " test " has an accuracy rate in the 90 % percentile or they do n't .
If do believe such claims ( which are unsupported by the scientific evidence ) , then investigatorial misdirection is inevitably going to result , as it appears to have in the Crystallynn Girard murder investigation .
Donohue had both motive and opportunity .
And he had been questioned in connection with the 1975 strangulation of Carol Reed , who lived in the same building and with whom he had had a relationship .
Polygraph errors are not so uncommon , and AntiPolygraph.org is not prepared to allow them to be swept under the rug or flushed down the memory hole .
High - profile cases where killers passed the polygraph include the aforementioned case of Green River Killer Leon Gary Ridgeway , " Angel of Death " Charles Cullen , and " Woodchipper Killer " Richard Crafts .
And these fooled the lie detector at a time when information on polygraph countermeasures was not readily available on - line

PRINCETON , NJ --
When Americans are asked which of the leading candidates left in the race for president they least want to see elected president this year , 40 % name John McCain , 36 % Hillary Clinton , and 20 % Barack Obama .
McCain leads this inauspicious list in part because he is the only Republican among the three candidates -- meaning he is the primary focus of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic , while Republicans can split their choices between Obama and Clinton .
Seventy - one percent of Democrats name McCain .
Republicans divide their answers between the two Democratic candidates , although they name Clinton by nearly 2 - to - 1 over Obama , 60 % vs. 34 % .
Why ?
A follow - up question asking respondents for the reasons they least want to see their named candidate elected finds the overwhelming criticism of Obama is his lack of experience .
The main rationale for spurning a Clinton presidency is the perception that she is untrustworthy , while the knocks against McCain are threefold : his associations with the Iraq war , with President George W. Bush , and with the Republican Party .
Obama : " Not Qualified "
Nearly 4 in 10 of those who least want to see Obama elected ( 39 % ) say they believe he is " inexperienced " or " not qualified " to be president .
All other explanations are much less frequently mentioned .
The reason cited second most frequently is trustworthiness , mentioned by 15 % of those opposed to his becoming president .
However , nearly as prevalent ( 12 % ) as an explanation for not wanting Obama elected is the belief that he is a Muslim .
( Obama himself has said this is incorrect , and he is a member of the Chicago - based Trinity United Church of Christ . )
An additional 8 % of Obama 's detractors say they dislike his " religious affiliation , " but it is unclear whether this is a reference to perceptions about Obama 's connection to the Muslim religion , or to his ties to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Trinity United Church of Christ .
McCain : Iraq , Bush , and the GOP
Those who least want to see McCain elected president are most likely to cite his position on the Iraq war ( 27 % ) , his similarity with President Bush ( 25 % ) , or the fact that he is a Republican ( 23 % ) .
In line with these policy - oriented reasons for opposing him , an additional 8 % say they " disagree with his views on most issues . "
Although McCain 's advanced age has been raised as a possible liability for his candidacy , only 7 % of those most opposed to him say they think he 's too old .
Only 2 % mention McCain 's well - known temper management issues .
Clinton : Do n't Trust Her , Reservations About Bill , and Likability
The most prominent reason given by those opposed to Clinton being elected president is not trusting her -- mentioned by 24 % .
However , the 18 % saying they do n't want Bill Clinton back in the White House and the 16 % saying they do n't like Hillary Clinton rank a fairly close second and third , respectively .
The 12 % saying they think Clinton lacks the experience to be president is relatively small compared to the 39 % saying this of Obama , but it is still more than a trivial issue for her .
Half as many ( 6 % ) say the country is not ready for a woman to be president and only 2 % cite her healthcare plan .
Bottom Line
The responses give an interesting initial indication of the potential vulnerabilities of these candidates in the general election .
There is a notable difference in the negative perceptions of the candidates held by those most opposed to each one becoming president .
The most prevalent criticisms leveled against Obama and Clinton are all personal in nature : trustworthiness , likability , experience , and family connections .
By contrast , the top criticisms of McCain are all more policy oriented : Iraq , associations with Bush , and being a Republican .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,005 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted March 24 - 27 , 2008 .
Respondents were randomly drawn from Gallup 's nationally representative household panel , which was originally recruited through random selection methods .
The final sample is weighted so it is representative of U.S. adults nationwide .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
An apparent false alarm early Sunday triggered a massive air - sea rescue operation to evacuate over 500 workers from an oil rig in the North Sea , police and the British coast guard said .
A 23 - year - old woman who works on the rig was taken on shore in connection with the incident , according to the local police force coordinating the operation .
Grampian police are expected to formally detain and question the British woman once she is on land , a spokesman for the force said .
Jake Molley , from the British Offshore Workers Union , said it appeared the alert was the result of " someone with an overactive imagination . "
" I expect we 're going to have one very embarrassed individual , " Molley told CNN by phone .
In a statement , Britannia Operator Limited , the oil company operating the rig , said the alert was raised following an allegation by a worker that there was a suspicious device on the installation .
The British Press Association said the incident was sparked by threats made by a woman on board the vessel .
A total of 14 helicopters , including five Royal Air Force helicopters , were scrambled to the Safe Scandinavia rig -- described as " a floating accommodation unit " -- after emergency services were contacted early Sunday , British coast guard spokesman Fred Kaygill told CNN .
A bomb disposal unit was also deployed to the scene .
Kaygill called it a " security incident " and said " it is in no way , shape or form related to terrorism . "
Britannia said 161 of the rig's workers were evacuated to two nearby platforms before the operation came to a halt .
Those workers are being returned to the rig .
A bomb disposal team had been called to the Safe Scandinavia rig , which is owned by Norwegian - based firm Pro-Safe and provides accommodation for workers from the oil company Britannia Operator Limited , according to a British defense ministry spokesman .
He later confirmed that the military assistance operations had ceased .
In the initial rescue effort , a total of 539 staff were being evacuated to nearby installations from the rig , around 280 kilometers ( 175 miles ) northeast of the Scottish coastal town of Aberdeen .
Pro-Safe , the Norwegian - based owners of the rig , provides off - shore support to oil and gas companies .
The Safe Scandinavia rig is described on the company 's Web site as " a floating accommodation unit " with 583 beds .
A Pro-Safe official in Aberdeen told CNN by phone that the rig was contracted out to the oil company Britannia Operator Limited and that it was their employees who were being evacuated from the vessel .

A new book written by a leading globalist luminary provides a blueprint for how 6,000 elitists plan to completely end national sovereignty , impose a system of global governance , and how they will deal with an international network of people that resist their agenda .
Superclass : The Global Power Elite and the World They Are Making is a manifesto for how the elite plan to shape the course of the planet and impose a new world order while combating the inevitable " global network of antiglobalists " who will rise up against it .
The author of the book , David J. Rothkopf , is a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and has previously served as the Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade during the administration of Bill Clinton before he became managing director of Kissinger and Associates in January 1996 .
A Salon.com review alarmingly details the brazen premise of Rothkopf ’s book – a global elite now run the planet and have usurped the power of national governments while ensuring laws constrained by borders are all but obsolete .
" Each one of them is one in a million .
They number six thousand on a planet of six billion .
They run our governments , our largest corporations , the powerhouses of international finance , the media , world religions , and , from the shadows , the world ’s most dangerous criminal and terrorist organizations .
They are the global superclass , and they are shaping the history of our time , " states the promo for the book .
The threadbare notion that Rothkopf ’s book is a critical and impartial investigation of the global elite can be rejected out of hand just by looking at the author ’s biography – in reality he is a cherished insider .
Throughout the book Rothkopf fawns over the global elite of which he too is a member .
The Salon review notes his " palpable thrill " at " recognizing CEOs , oil company executives and Harvard professors on his way to a fondue restaurant , " in the globalist enclave of Davos , Switzerland and his obsession with listing every banal " achievement " of each elitist he speaks with .
According to the article , the kind of elitist celebrated in Rothkopf ’s book " have little need for national loyalty , view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing , and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite ’s global operations . "
Rothkopf himself concurs that laws and regulations defined by borders and nation states are obsolete and need to be replaced not by a global government but by " global governance " .
The fact that the ultimate goals of the two – the total elimination of national sovereignty – are essentially identical is not lost on globalists who know that a more subtle imposition of centralized control needs to be enacted in order to con the serfs into sacrificing their identity .
A sharply defined " world government " is too visceral a concept and would attract fierce opposition , therefore a method of forcing countries to adopt harmonized policies of " global governance " is the new approach that globalists have embarked on .
Rothkopf ominously expresses the plan to mandate the " Registration and management of Internet domain names ( via a collection of organizations ) " under a global umbrella , which the informed will recognize as a bastardized version of Internet 2 , where individuals require government permits to operate a website under tight regulation .
The article concedes that , " Rational as it may sound to set up such systems , they just are n’t directly answerable to the populace at large — they ’re undemocratic , " which Rothkopf admits will give rise to rebellions and pave the way for more people like Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez , who he labels as being part of " the global network of antiglobalists , " and a man who has " made political theater out of taunting and thwarting the global elite . "
Rothkopf ’s answer to the inevitable antagonism that will be directed towards the globalists as their agenda unfolds is to hoodwink the commoners into thinking they have influence in the new world order that is being built around them – a method otherwise known as the Delphi Technique , which is universally recognized as an underhanded and unethical ploy of achieving consensus through deception .
According to Rothkopf the , " Superclass ought to be smart enough to foresee any such crisis and head it off by doing more to make the currently disenfranchised feel like " stakeholders " in the new global order . "
The fact that the same elitists Rothkopf affords such sycophantic adulation are also personally responsible for the policies that result in the slaughter of untold millions and the misery of countless others across the globe matters little to Rothkopf , who also has no qualms about including Osama Bin Laden in a group of 6,000 " global elite " who now control the world and " whose connections to each other have become more significant than their ties to their home nations and governments . "
Superclass maintains that the elite , who mainly comprise " older males of European descent who graduated from prestigious Western colleges , " are " an improvement on those of the past , " but this rings hollow when we consider the state of the planet that they have crafted .
A million - plus dead Iraqis since 2003 , a global economy in chaos and individual freedom under attack in every corner of the world suggests the much - vaunted global elite – worshipped in Rothkopf ’s book as saviors of the Earth – are more accurately parasites and a cancer upon humanity .
Watch Rothkopf give a lecture on the power of the global elite .
He identifies Bohemian Grove as a key meeting venue for the globalists .
Decide for yourself whether he is a fawning sycophant or an objective critic .
Rothkopf ’s approach is to blame the world ’s problems on free - market capitalism and and imply that global elitists are a new phenomenon and therefore part of the solution , when in reality the elite created monopoly capitalism and have been a hidden - hand manipulating world events and offering solutions to problems they created for centuries .

1 {scene : The swamps of Dagobah} 1 Obi-Wan 's ghost :
When I first knew him , your father was already a great pilot .
But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him .
2 Obi-Wan 's ghost : I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi .
I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda .
I was wrong .
3 Qui-Gon 's ghost : {appearing suddenly}
Hey , Obi-Wan . 3 Obi-Wan 's ghost : Qui-Gon ! 3 Qui-Gon 's ghost : Remember , Yoda trained Dooku , who became a Sith Lord too .
You did do just as well as Yoda .
4 Qui-Gon 's ghost :
In fact , your Sith Lord killed his Sith Lord - so you actually trained him better than Yoda !
There have been very few Star Wars strips since I began work on Darths & Droids .
Mostly because my head is full of Star Wars anyway , so I do n't want to do it so much here .
But this one has been sitting in my ideas file for some time , and there was no chance it would ever get turned into a D&D strip , so here it is .
It 's slightly odd that Qui-Gon appears younger than Obi-Wan , when he was significantly older than Obi-Wan when they were alive .
But Obi-Wan had a longer life , so his Force ghost is presumably older than Qui -Gon's .
Things like this make me wonder how afterlifes are supposed to work .
Imagine a young couple , very much in love , but one of them dies at 25 and the other lives to be 90 or something , and remarries twice along the way .
Is there now a 25 - year - old + 90 - year - old couple in the afterlife ?
And what about the other two spouses ?
Does it become a polyamorous family ?
What if 25 - year - old does n't want to spend eternity with a 90 - year - old partner ?
Or if 90 - year - old becomes a rejuvenated 20 - something in the afterlife , what happens to 90 - year - old third spouse ?
Or do people just not care about any of their previous relationships any more ( which would be pretty awful and miserable if this was supposed to be one of those " eternal happiness " afterlifes ) ?
Perhaps Darths & Droids ' more " scientific " take on Force ghosts is more philosophically plausible than how they are represented in the original Star Wars .

An Aboriginal woman in a group ejected from a Northern Territory hostel says the incident made her want to cry .
Bethany Langdon and other members of her remote community are reportedly considering legal action against the Alice Springs hostel 's management following their weekend ejection .
" When we booked in , the manager , she gave us the keys to the rooms and we went and put our stuff in the rooms .
" We all went outside and the manager came out and told me that we were n't suitable to stay there , " Ms Langdon told ABC Radio today .
The Department of Energy has just wrapped up a fascinating experiment in Washington State in which it provided both homeowners and their appliances with tools that can sense stress on the power grid .
Homeowners who made use of the tools saved money — approximately 10 percent on their electric bills — and the grid was more stable , too .
There were two projects , both of which were run by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory over the last year .
In the Olympic Peninsula project , 112 homeowners used new electric meters , thermostats , water heaters , and dryers that were all connected to specialized home gateways .
Using software designed by IBM , the homeowners in the study could tell their appliances to react to the changing cost of electricity throughout a day by changing behavior — lowering the temperature of the home or water heater , for instance .
Not only did the system save users an average of 10 percent on their monthly electric bills , but it also reduced peak distribution loads by 50 percent on many days .
" The tools used in the study gave consumers the chance to be active participants in managing the electric grid , " said Rep. Norm Dicks , D - Bremerton .
PNNL - built screensaver charting frequency of AC power
The second project , the Grid Friendly Appliance Project , put special circuit boards into appliances in 150 homes in both Washington and Oregon .
The circuit boards detected stress on the electric grid by monitoring its frequency ; anything more than a tiny variation from the 60 Hz US standard indicates the presence of unusual activity on the grid .
The circuit boards responded by switching off electricity to high wattage items like a dryer 's electric heating element .
The lab found that this simple change can " reduce electricity consumption enough to stabilize the balance between supply and demand on the grid without the need to turn on inefficient gas - turbine generators , " and without building more plants to cope with peak loads .
In effect , such technologies make both the machines and their human owners into members of what the lab calls " a collaborative , distributed , commerce - driven ' society ' " — some of the same terms used to describe the many " Web 2.0 " destinations .
In this case , though , the purpose is n't to create the Internet 's most tech - savvy collection of minds ( see the Ars OpenForum for that ) but to create a " shock absorber " for the national power grid ; saving money for consumers is simply a byproduct of that process .
Utilities are already starting to roll out such technology to consumers .
Here in Chicago , ComEd now runs the first - in - the - nation Residential Real - time Pricing Program ( not by choice ; it was mandated by the Illinois Commerce Commission ) .
That program allows customers to see rates throughout the day and get billed according to the changing costs .
It requires a new electric meter , but for those who are able to save major appliance usage for the early mornings and after - work hours , it can save some decent cash .
ComEd also runs a program targeted specifically at air conditioners , devices that put high stresses on the electric grid during the summer .
The company offers a yearly credit to consumers who allow ComEd to switch off their condensers ( the fan remains active ) for up to 30 minutes at a time when the grid is under strain .
President Bush said Thursday that he wanted to lock in the outlines of a Palestinian state before he left office , even as Mahmoud Abbas , president of the Palestinian Authority , said the road was “ paved with obstacles . ”
With less than nine months to achieve his goal , Bush is holding a flurry of diplomatic meetings , including a session with Abbas in the Oval Office on Thursday , seeking to pressure Israel , the Palestinians and their Arab allies .
“ A Palestinian state is a high priority for me and my administration -- a viable state , a state that does n’t look like Swiss cheese , ” Bush said .
He met Wednesday with King Abdullah II of Jordan .
In May , he plans to make his second visit to the Middle East this year .

Abbas , speaking with Bush during a photo session at the end of their roughly 35 - minute meeting , said that “ time is of the essence . ”
Without spelling out specific challenges , he said : “ I can not say that the road to peace is paved with flowers .
It is paved with obstacles . ”
Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert resumed meetings this month after a six - week break , seeking to make progress on U.S. - sponsored peace talks .
They have met only sporadically since a peace conference in Annapolis , Md. , in November .
Serious questions remain about whether Bush , Abbas and Olmert can reach the necessary compromises to finalize the outlines of a Palestinian state by Jan. 20 .

“ Mahmoud Abbas has to not only convince the Palestinians he can get things from the Israelis and the Americans , but that he can get more than any other Palestinian leader .
I do n’t think he has made that case , ” said Jon B. Alterman , director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington - based think tank .
Alterman also is a former member of the State Department policy planning staff .
Also Thursday , the militant group Hamas proposed a six - month truce between the Israeli army and Palestinian fighters in the Gaza Strip , which is controlled by Hamas .
Mahmoud Zahar , a senior Hamas political leader , announced the proposal in Cairo after meeting with Egyptian officials mediating between Hamas and Israel .
Zahar said smaller militant factions from Gaza would meet in Cairo next week and would be asked to adhere to the terms of the truce proposal before the Egyptians presented it to Israel .
If a truce goes into effect , Egypt will work to extend it to the West Bank , Zahar said .

Israel ’s army withdrew its bases from Gaza in 2005 but continues to operate in the West Bank .
It makes periodic incursions into Gaza to try to stop militants from firing rockets into Israel .
Scores of Palestinians , four Israeli soldiers and two Israeli civilians have been killed in the fighting since early March .
Israel is not expected to reply to the truce proposal until the Egyptians present it .
Israeli officials have said they would have no reason to launch attacks in Gaza if militant groups halted rocket fire from the territory and weapons smuggling from Egypt .
But they have said they favor a waiting period to assess whether a truce is working before they would lift restrictions on the movement of people and goods across Gaza ’s border .

An environmental group on Monday harshly criticized the way New York reviews wastewater pollution permits , saying the process has likely increased pollution in the state ’s waterways and has violated federal laws .
The group , Environmental Advocates of New York , said in a report that the process is so flawed that it allows discharges from thousands of factories and sewage treatment plants to go without a thorough review for a decade or longer .
“ We have no idea what this is doing to our waterways , and neither does the state , ” said Katherine Nadeau , water and natural resources program associate for the group and author of the report .
“ When you ’re going 10 to 20 years without a thorough review , it means you have no idea if the permit that a plant is operating under is protective of the waterway at all . ”
Most reviews for major pollution permits are cursory , requiring little more than a self - evaluation by a plant operator , the report said .
These permits account for more than 99 percent of the pollution that is discharged in New York waterways .
Addendum added February 15 , 2008 : Letter of response from Philip Zelikow .
President George W. Bush used his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington last week to , once again , attempt to define his presidency as a long struggle against the dark forces responsible for the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
“ Six and a half years ago , our country faced the worst attack in our history , ” Bush said .
“ I understood immediately that we would have to act boldly to protect the American people .
So we ’ve gone on the offense against these extremists .
We ’re staying on the offense , and we will not relent until we bring them to justice . ”
The Bush administration has continually used — and abused — this popular frame over the past seven years .
As Philip Shenon writes in his new book - length expose , The Commission , Karl Rove began planning an electoral strategy based on strength against terrorism on Sept. 12th .
Donald Rumsfeld , as we know , began planning an invasion of Iraq only hours after the towers came down .
In so many ways , the Bush administration ’s most disastrous policies — the invasion of Iraq , torture , wiretapping , Guantanamo , the unitary executive , and so on — were all enabled by the administration ’s assertion that it had the unique ability to fight the good fight and prevent another terrorist attack .
But what if it was revealed that in the months leading up to Sept.
11 , 2001 , the administration had ample evidence that the attack was imminent , and was negligent in its response ?
What would become of the 9/11 presidency ?
The White House faced this very real problem in 2003 when public and congressional pressure forced Bush to sign a law creating a commission to examine the events surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks .
Philip Shenon , the New York Times reporter covering the 9/11 Commission , has since discovered the great lengths that the administration went to in order to neuter the findings of the Commission .
Among his discoveries :
Vice - President Cheney consistently tried to kill the Commission , calling Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle early on and discouraging him from opening probes , saying they would be “ a very dangerous and time - consuming diversion . ”
Many commissioners later suspected that he was the one directing then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez in stonewalling the Commission .
Philip Zelikow , who was hired as “ executive director ” of the Commission , meaning he would run the day - to - day operations , was a close friend and former colleague of Condoleezza Rice ’s who spoke with her many times during the investigation despite his pledges not to do so .
Shenon writes that it was clear to some investigators “ that they could not have an open discussion in front of Zelikow about Condoleezza Rice and her performance as national security advisor . ”
Rice , you will recall , was the primary person responsible for briefing Bush about the dangers of a potential attack that were laid out in memos like the one he received in August 2001 in her presence entitled , “ Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the U.S. ”
All investigators and staffers on the Commission were originally forbidden to talk to the press or even to the commissioners themselves .
Only Zelikow was so empowered , thereby allowing him to control all access to it .
Zelikow also received multiple phone calls from Karl Rove over the course of the investigation .
When commissioners discovered this fact , Zelikow ordered his secretary to stop keeping a log of his phone calls .
Records from the Government Accountability Office show continued , frequent calls from Zelikow to the White House .
( He claims the conversations were strictly non-political and involved matters relating to the University of Virginia , where he is a professor . )
Zelikow did not disclose to the Commission that he was the secret author of a white paper outlining a defense for pre-emptive war , which many credit as one of the key intellectual justifications for the Bush administration ’s misbegotten invasion of Iraq .
Zelikow later tried to add wording to the Commission ’s report linking Iraq to Al Qaeda , despite a continued lack of evidence that this was the case .
Zelikow also apparently failed to disclose to the Commission the full extent of his work on President Bush ’s 2000 transition team .
It would be a neater story if the White House had actually placed Zelikow on the team in order to have its own mole there , given its concern about the likely outcome of the report .
Yet Commission chairmen Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton apparently came to Zelikow on their own and hired him , apparently unconcerned with the myriad conflicts of interest his appointment could raise .
According to Shenon , even then - White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card was surprised to hear Zelikow ’s name mentioned as a candidate and was concerned there would be too much blowback to Zelikow ’s hiring , given his administration ties .
But Kean and Hamilton prevailed .
Zelikow was a historian and political scientist by training , and was deeply concerned with the historical record .
He got the job of executive director in part because Kean and Hamilton were impressed by his idea that the Commission ’s report should n’t collect dust on a shelf like many government reports , but rather should be written in plain English and sold as a work of popular history in bookstores across America .
When I was working on my doctoral dissertation , which later became the book When Presidents Lie : A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences , I found Zelikow ’s work on the Cuban Missile Crisis to be first rate , both from an intellectual standpoint and that of a writer .
I wondered about his appointment to the Commission , knowing not only that he was a close friend of Rice ’s , but also that he was her co-author in a study lauded by the first President Bush about U.S. policy toward the breakup of the Soviet Empire .
As I wrote in The Book on Bush , published in early 2004 , “ Formerly a member of George H. W. Bush ’s National Security Council staff , as well as a member of President George W. Bush ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , Zelikow was also co-author with Condoleezza Rice of an admiring study of their ex-boss ’s — and the president ’s father ’s — handling of the end of the Cold War .
Without casting any personal aspersions on Professor Zelikow , who is also a first - rate scholar of the Cuban missile crisis , it is hard to imagine that anyone could conduct a thoroughly honest and potentially damning investigation of his friends and former colleagues .
In October 2003 , a group of families of September 11 victims wrote to the commission co-chairs asking that Zelikow recuse himself ‘ from any aspect of national security and executive branch negotiations and investigations ’ because of his past connections to the National Security Council and to key Bush administration officials . ”
This did n’t happen , of course , but at the time , I imagined that if he was good enough for the other commissioners , he deserved the benefit of the doubt as both a scholar and an individual .
Shenon ’s careful study calls all of those judgments into question .
Shenon shows a man operating not as a historian or honest broker , but as a politician working under the protective cover of an independent scholar .
And the result is that we are still living in the shadow of a 9/11 presidency , with all the catastrophic implications that entails .
And much of the historical record of the tragedy of that day remains lost to us , forever , with no hope of recovery .
Addendum
Letter of Response from Philip Zelikow
Philip Zelikow wrote me in response the above article and during the course of our exchange , made the following points in response to it .
All the words are his but are lightly edited by me for the sake of clarity and continuity :
Professor Alterman :
I saw your article on the Shenon book posted on the site of the Center for American Progress .
I appreciated your kind words about my scholarship and your initial tendency to give me the “ benefit of the doubt ” until you read Shenon ’s book .
Rather than make a defensive argument to you , my only request is that , as a scholar , please check out some of Shenon ’s charges before you repeat them .
To do that , you can check the February 11 edition of Steve Aftergood ’s “ Secrecy News ” web bulletin , put out by the Federation of American Scientists , which provides quite a bit of information and links to more , plus Aftergood ’s personal evaluation of the underlying data ( he did some homework ) .
In addition , I invite you also to check either with former commissioners or former staff members of the Commission whom you respect , and check out the charges .
In a staff full of individuals with former government service ( many more with Democratic administrations or Democratic Hill staff in fact — and I led the hiring ) , it was also important to design a fact finding and writing process in which anyone — including me — had to subject their views to peer review and consensus argument .
I designed that process to offset anyone ’s potential biases , including mine , and I believe it worked .

Mr. Shenon ’s past reporting has indeed had problems — he was , for instance , the main press outlet in 2005 for the “ Able Danger ” claims then being promoted by former Congressman Curt Weldon , claims which several investigations have now shown were indeed baseless .
( Contrast , if you are interested , the more sober reporting on that by Dan Eggen of the Washington Post , whose reporting was confirmed by subsequent inquiries . )
There were other problematical episodes commissioners and staff were aware of during the course of the Commission ’s work .
… Also , because there have been mistaken statements made by others on this : I played no part in drafting the statement the former commissioners issued last week .
I also played no part in drafting the letter Slade Gorton prepared for the Seattle Post - Intelligencer .
Nor was I the drafter of the talking points prepared for commissioners ( quoted in brief part in my message to you ) .
My former deputy , and Hamilton staffer , Chris Kojm held the pen on that last document .
Also , several other former staffers are concerned about other specific errors and mischaracterizations in the book ( including its stories of arguments about how to handle the Iraq - Al Qaeda issues ) and have told me they are preparing a collective response of their own to set the record straight .
But I have not been part of their drafting process and do not know how soon they will post their additional information .

These are very grave charges , which will be read by many of my colleagues and students .
Again , I ’m not trying to pick a fight .
I just rely on respected scholars like you , whatever their political orientation , to check out such serious claims before they repeat them .
As you ’ll see , I ’ve done what I can to empower people to do that .

His blog , “ Altercation , ” appears at www.mediamatters.org/altercation.
His seventh book , Why We ’re Liberals : A Political Handbook for Post - Bush America , will be published in March .
George Zornick is a New York based writer .
The White House official serving as President Bush ’s liaison to conservative groups resigned Friday after it was disclosed that a newspaper column he wrote contained material lifted without attribution from a student publication .
The aide , Timothy S. Goeglein , has worked at the White House since 2001 , most recently as special assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of Public Liaison .
White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in a written statement that Bush was “ disappointed ” about Goeglein ’s plagiarism and “ saddened ” for him and his family .
Goeglein , 44 , was accused Friday of using material from the Dartmouth Review -- an independent student publication for which a number of leading conservative writers have worked -- in columns he wrote , without White House sanction , for the News - Sentinel of his native Fort Wayne , Ind .

The News - Sentinel reported on its website that Goeglein had admitted that portions of a column about education that appeared under his name in Thursday ’s paper “ were used from another source without attribution . ”
The newspaper said that 20 of 38 columns Goeglein had written for it from 2000 to 2008 “ have been found to have portions copied from other sources without attribution . ”
It said he had submitted guest columns , for which he was not paid , for more than 20 years , and that the paper was checking his earlier essays .
In a statement on the News - Sentinel ’s website , Editor Kerry Hubartt said : “ We will not publish writings by Goeglein in the future . ”
Goeglein first went to work for Bush as an aide during 2000 presidential campaign .
He was enlisted by Karl Rove , the top political advisor to the then - governor of Texas .

In the White House , Goeglein continued to work for Rove , who left the White House staff last year .
Goeglein ’s most recent position involved reaching out to the president ’s conservative allies , mainly economic and religious groups , as the White House sought to build support for Bush ’s programs .
His guest columns in the News - Sentinel were not written with the sanction of the administration , although he was identified as a White House official .
Emily Lawrimore , a White House spokeswoman , said the press office did not know that he was writing the essays .
She added that Goeglein has said that earlier in the administration , he had notified someone in the office of his submissions .
The similarities between his work and that in the Dartmouth publication were disclosed by a blogger , Nancy Nall , a former News - Sentinel columnist .
On Friday , she posted several examples , including this one :

From Goeglein ’s most recent column : “ A notable professor of philosophy at Dartmouth College in the last century , Eugene Rosenstock - Hussey , expressed the matter succinctly .
His wisdom is not only profound but also worth pondering in this new century .
He said , ‘ The goal of education is to form the Citizen .
And the Citizen is a person who , if need be , can re-found his civilization . ’
“ He meant that , I think , in quite a large sense .
He did not mean that you had to master all the specialties you can think of , but rather to be an educated man or woman , you needed to be familiar with the large and indispensable components of our civilization . ”
From the Dartmouth Review , in an article by Jeffrey Hart , which Nall said was published in 1998 : “ A notable Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth , Eugene Rosenstock - Hussey often expressed the matter succinctly .
‘ The goal of education , ’ he would say , ‘ is to form the Citizen .
And the Citizen is a person who , if need be , can re-found his civilization . ’
“ He meant that in quite large a sense .
He did not mean that you had to master all the specialties you can think of .

“ He meant that you need to be familiar with the large and indispensable components of your -- this -- civilization . ”
Goeglein did not return a call to his office for comment .
Perino said that Goeglein “ accepted responsibility for the columns published under his name in his local newspaper , and has apologized for not upholding the standards expected by the president . ”
She said Bush , who left at midday to spend the weekend at his ranch near Crawford , Texas , “ has long appreciated Tim ’s service , and he knows him to be a good person who is committed to his country . ”

Perino said Goeglein helped the White House establish its office that works with faith - based and community groups , as well as the unit that oversees Bush ’s emergency plan for AIDS relief .
He also was part of the administration teams that guided the Senate confirmations of John G. Roberts Jr. as Supreme Court chief justice and of Samuel A. Alito Jr. as a justice on the court .
Goeglein previously worked for former Sen. Dan Coats ( R - Ind . ) and in the office of Vice President Dan Quayle .

People have done some terrible things , over the years , with science , and with their science skills .
I ’m talking about Zyklon B , electrocuting gay people straight , torturing people in concentration camps , leaving syphillis untreated in large numbers of black men for an experiment ( without telling them , in the US , until the 1970s ) , and more .
Stuff where it ’s hard to find any humour .
This is why we have research ethics committees , codes of practise , professional bodies , and regulators like the The US Office for Human Research Protections .
Sometimes these organisations can cock up quite badly .
Let me tell you about two stories which have been unfolding over the past few months .
In New York , a fiendishly clever trial in ITU departments has looked at one of the simplest interventions imaginable : a ticklist for giving IV lines , a helpful little reminder to wash your hands , wear gloves , and so on .
Can something as simple as “ using a ticklist ” , to check if people are doing the right thing , reduce infections and save lives ?
This is the bread and butter of medical academic research , which is usually not about pills , or placeboes , or molecules , but about looking pragmatically at whether one thing works better than another .
You will remember that homeopaths and various other quacks are philosophically opposed to this process .
The results were spectacular : in 3 months , the incidence of blood infections from these IV lines fell by two - thirds , and over 18 months , the program saved 1,500 lives and an estimated $ 200 million .
Then someone complained to the OHRP , because this was a research study , and they did not have ethics committee clearance .
The project was shut down .
This week , the OHRP grandly lifted their ban , explaining that now – since it turns out the research bit is over , and the hospitals are just putting the ticklist into practise – they may tick away unhindered .
This is what we might call the “ ethical paradox ” .
You can do something as part of a treatment program , entirely on a whim , and nobody will interfere , as long as it ’s not potty ( and even then you ’ll probably be alright ) .
But the moment you do the exact same thing as part of a research program , trying to see if it actually works or not , adding to the sum total of human knowledge , and helping to save the lives of people you ’ll never meet , suddenly a whole bunch of people want to stuck their beaks in .
Hilary Hearnshaw did an elegant study where she pretended to apply to do a medical research project in the Israel , the UK , and 11 other countries in Europe .
She said she wanted to do a trial on a leaflet – contain your excitement – which was designed to help older patients get more engaged with their GP .
Only three countries required the project to go through a process of ethical approval , and in the UK , this was more arduous than in any other country .
Getting ethical clearance took ten weeks , required two submissions ( because they demanded changes ) , and five full days of administration , during which the proposal had to be reviewed by full committees , some of which required multiple copies of the application paperwork .
This is just the tip of the iceberg ( and I would always welcome more examples by email ) .
For one multicentre clinical trial , each of 125 local research ethics committees required between 1 and 21 copies of a protocol .
Ethics approval for another trial , involving 51 centres , required over 25 000 pieces of paper , 62 hours of photocopying , and an average of 3.3 hours of investigator time for each centre .
You feel like you ’re dying when administrators drag their heels .
In the case of medical research , when you delay research findings , and deter researchers from even bothering , people really are dying .
This wider harm seems to be a blindspot for the ethics committees , captivated by their own mission creep .
But it ’s not the only ethical blindspot .
These regulations have their roots in the Nuremburg Code .
But while the world of clinicians and academics splits ethical hairs , with our eye off the ball , an elephant has walked into the room .
February has seen another string of prominent psychologists resigning from their membership of the American Psychological Association , in disgust at its failure to take a stand on “ abusive interrogation techniques ” , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , and other activities which you might consider to be torture .
Psychologists are key to these interrogations and other activities , both in designing and enacting what I would rather not call “ protocols ” , out of compassion for the people on whom they are grimly enacted , in places cameras do not go .
APA members , trained , clinical professionals on their register , who have signed up to their codes of practise , now participate in these activities .
The APA ’s response has been to specifically bend the codes of conduct to permit their actions , and to obfuscate .
Where ’s your ethics committee now , science boy ?
Bits :
Ken Pope , prominent member of the American Psychological Association ( and a former chair of its Ethics Committee ) , resigned his membership on February 6 .
He ’s the latest of a growing number of professional psychologists who have quit APA in protest of its position on the use of psychologists in government interrogations in the “ War on Terror . ”
Lots more on the APA and torture at Mindhacks .
EXTRA :
Here ’s a nice letter from Hilary Hearnshaw , the researcher who did the study looking at different countries ’ ethics committee palaver .
Religious freedom is guaranteed under Malaysian law
In the Malay language " Allah " is used to mean any god , and Christians say they have used the term for centuries .
Opponents of the ban say it is unconstitutional and unreasonable .
It is the latest in a series of religious rows in largely Muslim Malaysia , where minority groups claim their rights are being eroded .
A spokesman for the Herald , the newspaper of the Catholic Church in Malaysia , said a legal suit was filed after they received repeated official warnings that the newspaper could have its licence revoked if it continued to use the word .
" We are of the view that we have the right to use the word ' Allah ' , " said editor Rev Lawrence Andrew .
' Unlawful '
The Sabah Evangelical Church of Borneo has also taken legal action after a government ministry moved to ban the import of religious children 's books containing the word .
In a statement given to Reuters news agency , the church said the translation of the bible in which the word Allah appears has been used by Christians since the earliest days of the church .
There has been no official government comment but parliamentary opposition leader Lim Kit Siang said the decision to ban the word for non-Muslims on security grounds was " unlawful " .
" The term ' Allah ' was used to refer to God by Arabic - speaking Christians before Arabic - speaking Muslims existed , " he said .
Religious issues are highly sensitive in Malaysia , which has a 60 % Muslim population .
Religious freedom is guaranteed in the law but minority groups have accused the Muslim Malay majority of trying to increase the role of Islam in the country .
The parents of two Bronx preschoolers are suing the city , charging that their kids were tossed out of class – and handcuffed by a school - safety officer – for refusing to take a nap .
Lawyer Scott Agulnick said Jaden Diaz and Christopher Brito – both then 4 and students at CS 211 , The Bilingual School – told their parents that a substitute teacher took them and another boy to an empty classroom on Nov. 17 , 2006 , and left them there alone .
Soon , the lawyer said , the school - safety officer entered the room , cuffed the boys ’ wrists – and further terrified them by telling they that they would never see their parents again .
“ I was n’t shot , but my hands were tied , ” Christopher , now 5 , recalled , according to his mother , Vasso Brito , a 34 - year - old office worker – who says the little guy is now scared of police officers .
Brito , who ’s trying to transfer Christopher to another public school , said she was “ shocked ” to learn of what she considers to have been an absolute abuse of authority .
“ Right now , I feel [ there are ] monsters in school , ” she said .
“ I ’m still perturbed .
As I ’m talking to you , I ’m shaking . ”
Jaden , now 6 , remembers that a man who was dressed like a cop walked in , sat at a big desk – “ like the one the judge is on ” – and threatened them .
“ He was police , ” Jaden said .
“ He said , ‘ You know what happens when you do n’t go to sleep in there ?
. . .
‘ When you go to jail , you ’re not going to have no fun , no TV , no toys . ’ ”
Jaden – who asked his dad to move far enough away from him so as not to be able to hear his account of what happened - whispered to a reporter that he got a “ little scared ” when he saw the handcuffs attached to the safety officer ’s “ costume . ”
He insisted that he was not handcuffed – though his mom , Sasha Diaz , said he confided in her that he was .
“ It took me about a day to get it out of him .
He did n’t want to tell me . . .
I do n’t know if he thought it was his fault , ” said Diaz , 27 , an assistant teacher who now finds herself suddenly struggling to pay for her only child to attend Catholic school .
The families are seeking unspecified damages , said Agulnick , adding : “ Failure to comply with nap time is hardly an offense that warrants being handcuffed , or threatened , for that matter .
Nothing would ’ve warranted that . ”
The city Department of Education and the NYPD , which oversees school - safety officers , did not return requests for comment .
The boys ’ claims recall two other recent cases .
In one , a mentally challenged 10 - year - old Brooklyn girl said a school - safety officer handcuffed her outside school .
In the other , a 5 - year - old Queens boy said a school - safety officer snapped the cuffs on him inside his school .

Redacted secrets of NSA
Apr 29 , 2008 by Ilya Levin
You know that NSA is all about secrecy and stuff .
This is why they always redact declassified documents out of any sensitive information .
Just like this one : the Cryptologic Spectrum article named " The Russian Language Training Program " ( pdf , 627 kb ) .
Let 's look at page 3 there .
Here is the snapshot with my red marks :
Marvelous , is n't it ?
In fact , the entire The Staff section look like a puzzle similar to the notorious Einstein 's challenge .
It is entirely solvable .
Try it for fun .
By Jonathan Fildes
Science and technology reporter , BBC News
Scientists in the US have developed novel brush - like fibres that generate electrical energy from movement .
Weaving them into a material could allow designers to create " smart " clothes which harness body movement to power portable electronic gadgets .
Writing in the journal Nature , the team say that the materials could also be used in tents or other structures to harness wind energy .
" Our goal is to make self - powered nanotechnology , " Professor Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology and one of the authors of the paper told BBC News .
" Airflows , vibrations - all these are mechanical energy that we can harvest to power devices . "
Dr Dianne Jones , technical director of textile electronics firm Fibretronic , said that as the market for wearable electronics expands , technologies such as the nanofibres would become increasingly attractive .
" Any new power source which could provide a more integrated and soft solution in place of conventional hard battery technology would be very attractive for clothing or other electronic textile - based applications , " she said .
Ottilia Saxl , chief executive of the Institute of Nanotechnology , believes the technology could also find a use in healthcare .
" It could perhaps be used to power tiny medical devices like a true cochlear implant or heart pacemaker , or a delivery mechanism for subcutaneous drug delivery implants or antibiotic drug reservoirs for preventing infection in retinal implants , " she said .
Hair spray
The nano - generators , as the technology is known , consist of pairs of fibres that look similar to tiny , bendable bottle - brushes .
At the core of each fibre is a Kevlar stalk .
" On the surface we grow crystals called nanowires , " said Professor Wang .
Each tiny wire is 30 - 50 nanometres ( billionths of a metre ) in length and is made of zinc oxide .
They are grown in solution .
" The growth is so spectacular that on the surface of the fibre all these nanowires stick out radially , " he said .
" And you can grow these on any substrate - hair or whatever you have . "
One of the bristled fibres is also dipped in gold to act as an electrode .
When the pair is scrubbed together they create a small amount of electrical energy .
" The fibre has a piezoelectric effect , " said Professor Wang .
" This is an important effect that converts mechanical energy to electricity . "
Experiments with the prototypes showed that two 1 cm - long fibres could generate a current of four nanoamperes and an output voltage of about four millivolts .
" If we can optimise the design we can get up to 80 milliwatts per square metre of fabric - that could potentially power an iPod . "
The ability to generate power for personal electronics using the clothing we wear would be a breakthrough in smart and interactive garments
Dianne Jones
However , Professor George Stylios of Heriot Watt University , who works on smart flexible materials , said he believed it may be tricky to generate " meaningful " amounts of energy from clothing using the fibres .
" I think it will be very difficult to generate an output useful enough to power up devices , " he said .
In particular , he believes anybody wearing the fibres would have to move very fast and would have to wear a lot of fabric .
" You may be able to use the fibres for other applications such as changing the structure or colour of materials , " he said .
Fashion show
The fibres are the latest development in the field of " energy harvesting " which seeks to develop methods to recover otherwise - wasted energy and convert it into useful electrical energy .
Everyday examples include wind - up radios and self - winding watches .
The US defence research agency Darpa also has a project to tap energy from generators implanted in soldier 's boots .
And earlier this year , scientists in Canada showed off a knee brace that would work as a dynamo .
Professor Wang and his team are aiming to develop devices that could be incorporated into everyday fabrics and materials .
He has already presented a nano - generator attached to a rigid surface that could be used to power sensors on vehicles .
The new fibres , he believes , could be used in smart fabrics .
These could be useful to the military as well as gadget lovers .
" The ability to generate power for personal electronics using the clothing we wear would be a breakthrough in smart and interactive garments , " said Dr Jones .
Her company - Fibretronic - make textile switches and keypads for clothing that allow users to control mp3 players in their pockets .
She said , there were several challenges to overcome before the nano - generator technology could be used commercially such as developing effective storage for the electricity to ensure a consistent supply .
Cost and ease of manufacture would also be important , she said , but believes the research shows promise .
" The possibility of developing piezoelectric , or energy generating fibres or fabrics has been something that the smart fabrics research community has been speculating about for some time , " she said .
" [ This work ] may have brought the concept one step closer to realisation . "
Earlier this week , an acquaintance of mine found himself trapped in a Kafka - esque nightmare , a nightmare that should make all of us stop and think .
He wants to remain anonymous so let ’s call him Bob .
Bob was an early adopter of all things Google .
His account was linked to all sorts of Google services .
Gmail was the most important thing to him – he ’d been using it for four years and all of his email ( a.k.a. “ his life ” ) was there .
Bob also managed a large community in Orkut , used Google ’s calendaring service , and had accounts on many of of their different properties .
Earlier this week , Bob received a notice that there was a spam problem in his Orkut community .
The message was in English and it looked legitimate and so he clicked on it .
He did n’t realize that he ’d fallen into a phisher ’s net until it was too late .
His account was hijacked for god - knows - what - purposes until his account was blocked and deleted .
He contacted Google ’s customer service and their response basically boiled down to “ that sucks , we ca n’t restore anything , sign up for a new account . ”
Boom !
No more email , no more calendar , no more Orkut , no more gChat history , no more Blogger , no more anything connected to his Google account .
:: gasp : :
My heart threatens to attack my throat at the mere idea of losing four years worth of email .
:: shudder ::
Or what if this blog disappeared ?
Like , OMG .
{insert horror film music here}
Luckily , Bob is well - connected .
His friends in high places forwarded his story to powerful people inside Google .
Today , his account was restored .
While such a restoration should provide a sigh of relief , it ’s also a bit disconcerting .
What if Bob had n’t been so well connected ?
What other kinds of damage can phishers do to people who have so many of their key tools linked together under a common account ?
Most tech companies blame phishing victims .
Basically , the general sentiment is that if people were n’t so stupid , there would n’t be a problem .
Yet , there is great research on Why Phishing Works that shows that even sophisticated users can be deceived .
While education is important , it is unrealistic to expect all users to keep up with the developments of scammers ’ deceptive techniques .
Consider the story of Clementine , a 13 - year - old citizen of Gaia Online who fell victim to a phishing attack and had her account deleted without recourse .
Once again , Clementine ’s saving grace was that she had connections , but it took a long time and she was written out of her primary social space in the meantime .
When companies host all of your data and have the ability to delete you and it at - will , all sorts of nightmarish science fiction futures are possible .
This is the other side of the “ identity theft ” nightmare where the companies thieve and destroy individuals ’ identities .
What are these companies ’ responsibilities ?
Who is overseeing them ?
What kind of regulation is necessary ?
There ’s also a flip - side to this story .
Google was able to restore his account because they kept everything on backup servers .
In this case , Bob did n’t want to have all of his content deleted .
But what if he had deleted it himself and expected it to be deleted permanently ?
Who should have the right to recall his data and under what circumstances ?
I find it particularly haunting that there is no way to delete your Facebook account .
You can only “ deactivate ” it , but you can reactivate it at any time and everything will come right back .
What if you do n’t want to go down on Facebook ’s permanent record ?
These are the issues that worry all sorts of privacy and identity types .
They are the cornerstone of books like Daniel Solove ’s The Digital Person and Simson Garfinkel ’s Database Nation .
Yet , as with identity theft , few people stop to think about data loss until it happens to them .
But perhaps we should .
How would you feel if the company hosting your email suddenly decided to disappear you ?
Or if Facebook / MySpace / Flickr / Xanga /etc. decided to delete your account right now ?
( There are plenty of examples of this one too .
For example , many celebrities have found their accounts obliterated because company reps think that they ’re fake .
And then there was Friendster … )
Imagine if you had no path of recourse .
Talk about disempowering !
In thinking about this , your first response should be to back up your data .
( And grumble loudly about all of the places where this is n’t possible . )
But what ’s your second step ?
What kind of legislation is necessary to address this ?
What kind of data recovery ( or non-recovery ) policies should companies have ?
Update : Check out this case of a guy being banished from Facebook for reasons that the company refuses to explain to him ( in a Kafka - esque nightmare ) .
This is particularly intriguing given that the company is trying to make Facebook a universal platform .
If Facebook becomes a platform , what rights to due process do users have ?

I wrote previously about discrepancies in the vote totals reported by Sequoia AVC Advantage voting machines in New Jersey ’s presidential primary election , and the incomplete explanation offered by Sequoia , the voting machine vendor .
I published copies of the “ summary tapes ” printed by nine voting machines in Union County that showed discrepancies ; all of them were consistent with Sequoia ’s explanation of what went wrong .
This week we obtained six new summary tapes , from machines in Bergen and Gloucester counties .
Two of these new tapes contradict Sequoia ’s explanation and show more serious discrepancies that we saw before .
Before we dig into the details , let ’s review some background .
At the end of Election Day , each Sequoia AVC Advantage voting machine prints a “ summary tape ” ( or “ results report ” ) that lists ( among other things ) the number of votes cast for each candidate on that machine , and the total voter turnout ( number of votes cast ) in each party .
In the Super Tuesday primary , a few dozen machines in New Jersey showed discrepancies in which the number of votes recorded for candidates in one party exceeded the voter turnout in that party .
For example , the vote totals section of a tape might show 61 total votes for Republican candidates , while the turnout section of the same tape shows only 60 Republican voters .
Sequoia ’s explanation was that in certain circumstances , a voter would be allowed to vote in one party while being recorded in the other party ’s turnout .
( “ It has been observed that the ‘ Option Switch ’ or Party Turnout Totals section of the Results Report may be misreported whereby turnout associated with the party or option switch choice is misallocated .
In every instance , however , the total turnout , or the sum of the turnout allocation , is accurate . ” )
Sequoia ’s memo points to a technical flaw that might cause this kind of misallocation .
The nine summary tapes I had previously were all consistent with Sequoia ’s explanation .
Though the total votes exceeded the turnout in one party , the votes were less than the turnout in the other party , so that the discrepancy could have been caused by misallocating turnout as Sequoia described .
For example , a tape from Hillside showed 61 Republican votes cast by 60 voters , and 361 Democratic votes cast by 362 voters , for a total of 422 votes cast by 422 voters .
Based on these nine tapes , Sequoia ’s explanation , though incomplete , could have been correct .
But look at one of the new tapes , from Englewood Cliffs , District 4 , in Bergen County .
Here ’s a relevant part of the tape :
The Republican vote totals are Giuliani 1 , Paul 1 , Romney 6 , McCain 14 , for a total of 22 .
The Democratic totals are Obama 33 , Edwards 2 , Clinton 49 , for a total of 84 .
That comes to 106 total votes across the two parties .
The turnout section ( or “ Option Switch Totals ” ) shows 22 Republican voters and 83 Democratic voters , for a total of 105 .
This is not only wrong – 106 votes cast by 105 voters – but it ’s also inconsistent with Sequoia ’s explanation .
Sequoia says that all of the voters show up in the turnout section , but a few might show up in the wrong party ’s turnout .
( “ In every instance , however , the total turnout , or the sum of the turnout allocation , is accurate . ” )
That ’s not what we see here , so Sequoia ’s explanation must be incorrect .
And that ’s not all .
Each machine has a “ public counter ” that keeps track of how many votes were cast on the machine in the current election .
The public counter , which is found on virtually all voting machines , is one of the important safeguards ensuring that votes are not cast improperly .
Here ’s the top of the same tape , showing the public counter as 105 .
The public counter is important enough that the poll workers actually sign a statement at the bottom of the tape , attesting to the value of the public counter .
Here ’s the signed statement from the same tape :
The public counter says 105 , even though 106 votes were reported .
That ’s a big problem .
Another of the new tapes , this one from West Deptford in Gloucester County , shows a similar discrepancy , with 167 total votes , a total turnout of 166 , and public counter showing 166 .
How many more New Jersey tapes show errors ?
What ’s wrong with Sequoia ’s explanation ?
What really happened ?
We do n’t know the answers to any of these questions .
Is n’t it time for a truly independent investigation ?
UPDATE ( April 11 ) : The New Jersey Secretary of State , along with the two affected counties , are now saying that I am misreading the two tapes discussed here .
In particular , they are now saying that the tape image included above shows 48 votes for Hillary Clinton , not 49 .
They ’re also saying now that the West Deptford tape shows two votes for Ron Paul , not three .
It ’s worth noting that the counties originally read the tapes as I did .
When I sent an open records request for tapes showing discrepancies , they sent these tapes – which they would not have done had they read the tapes as they now do .
Also , the Englewood Cliffs tape pictured above shows hand - written numbers that must have been written by a county official ( they were on the tapes before they were copied and sent to us ) , showing 84 votes for Democratic candidates , consistent with the county ’s original reading of the tape ( but not its new reading ) .
In short , the Secretary of State talked to the counties , and then the counties changed their minds about how to read the tapes .
So : were the counties right before , or are they right now ?
Decide for yourself – here are the tapes : Englewood Cliffs , West Deptford .
UPDATE ( April 14 ) : Regardless of what these two tapes show , plenty of other tapes from the Feb.
5 primary show discrepancies that the state and counties are not disputing .
These other discrepancies are consistent with Sequoia ’s explanation ( though that explanation is incomplete and more investigation is needed to tell whether it is correct ) .
Thus far we have images of at least thirty such tapes .

A review of MPs ' perks and expenses has been condemned as a stitch - up .
The panel picked by Commons Speaker Michael Martin to carry out the investigation is dominated by politicians tainted by sleaze or who have campaigned to keep allowances secret .
Five of the six on the Members ' Estimates Committee have been embroiled in controversy , while three voted against opening up to scrutiny the payment of taxpayers ' money for MPs ' homes , travel and office costs .
Critics claimed the decision - backed by Gordon Brown - to appoint Commons " grandees " was simply intended to take the heat out of the expenses scandal .
They said the cross-party committee 's decision not to report on the future of allowances until the autumn gave the impression the issue was being kicked into the long grass .
The Estimates Committee , however , insisted it needed time to come up with " genuinely openminded and radical " proposals .
The six members on the review are Speaker Martin , Harriet Harman , Theresa May , David Maclean , Sir Stuart Bell and Nick Harvey .
Only Mrs May has not been implicated in concerns over her financial affairs .
As members of the House of Commons Commission , which runs Parliament , all were involved in the decision to battle Freedom of Information rulings to publish how much they spend on transport .
Speaker Martin , a Labour MP , has been described as the greatest obstacle to full disclosure of MPs ' financial arrangements .
He has helped block the release of detailed records about expenses .
Mr Martin , 62 , has claimed more than £ 75,000 for overnight stays away from his main residence .
Last year he claimed £ 13,925 in travel expenses , including £ 10,587 on air fares .

His wife has claimed £ 23,885 in four years .
Tory MP Mr Maclean , who once used £ 3,300 of Commons money to buy a quad bike , led an MPs ' campaign to have Parliament exempted from the Freedom of Information Act .
Labour MP Sir Stuart , who employs his wife at taxpayers ' expense , faced embarrassment in 2001 when his son stole cheques from another MP 's office while working as a researcher .
Leader of the Commons Miss Harman was recently embroiled in the " dodgy donations " scandal , after it emerged she received £ 5,000 from tycoon David Abrahams paid using a middleman to keep his identity under wraps .
Labour MP
Alan Simpson said the committee would have to address " a huge level of public cynicism " .
Simon Hughes , a Lib - Dem frontbencher , also suggested the final decision on expenses should be made by an independent body .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The battle between Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. has escalated by several notches amid a flurry of reports that has the Web portal working with rivals Google Inc. and AOL in an attempt to put together a deal that would thwart the software giant 's unsolicited takeover offer .
Not to be outdone , Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % is reportedly in its own talks with media giant News Corp. to put together a potential joint bid for Yahoo YHOO .
Against this backdrop , Yahoo shares rose more than 2 % to about $ 28.40 at the opening bell on Thursday .
Microsoft 's stock rose a fraction to about $ 29 .
The action comes just days after Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer tried to jump - start the stalled process by sending a letter to Yahoo 's board -- setting a three - week deadline to close the deal and threatening a proxy battle if the offer was rejected .
See full story
It 's been 10 weeks since Microsoft announced its offer to buy Yahoo for $ 31 per share in a mix of cash and stock .
Yahoo rejected the offer as undervaluing its business , and since then , the value of the deal has fallen from its original level of about $ 44.6 billion to around $ 39 billion , based on Microsoft 's share price .
Yahoo has since raced to put together alternatives to the Microsoft proposal .
Wednesday , the company announced it will begin a test program with arch- rival Google GOOG , +0.32 % , under which it will use Google 's search - advertising service to deliver ads through related searches done on Yahoo 's Web site .
Yahoo said the test will last up to two weeks , involve traffic only on its site in the U.S. and relate to no more than 3 % of its search queries .
See full story
The company added that the test " does not necessarily mean that the company plans to join Google 's AdSense for Search program or that any further commercial relationship with Google will result , " adding that it will not comment on " the nature or timing of any potential relationship . "
Citigroup analysts Mark Mahaney and Brent Thill called the test with Google " an aggressive response " to the threat of a proxy battle from Microsoft .
" As such , we believe this will increase pressure on Microsoft to increase its $ 31 offer price , " the analysts wrote in a note to clients .
" Arguably , a worst - case scenario for Microsoft would be a full Google search outsource decision by Yahoo . "
AOL rumors re-emerge
Meanwhile , The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo was also in talks with the AOL unit of Time - Warner Inc. TWX , .
Rumors of talks between the Web brands were floated several weeks ago , but no deal has emerged .
According to the Journal , Time - Warner is considering a move to fold AOL into Yahoo and make a cash investment of an unspecified amount for a 20 % stake in the combined entity .
The deal would value AOL at about $ 10 billion .
The cash would allow Yahoo to buy back a large portion of its own stock , paying between $ 30 to $ 40 a share .
The report cited unnamed sources " close to the talks " who added there was still " a lot of work to do " before ironing out an agreement .
See Wall Street Journal story .

A deal among Yahoo , Google and AOL would potentially face scrutiny from regulators , since Google already controls about two - thirds of the search - ad market .
Following Yahoo's announcement of the test with Google , U.S. Sen .
Herb Kohl , D - Wis. , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's Subcommittee on Antitrust , Competition Policy and Consumer Rights , said his subcommittee will be " following closely the results " of the test .
" Should there be moves to make this agreement permanent , we will examine it closely in the antitrust subcommittee to ensure that it does not harm competition , " Kohl said in a statement .
The move promptly drew a response from Microsoft , which blasted any proposed alliance between Yahoo and Google in the search market as potentially anticompetitive .
Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith said the agreement " would consolidate over 90 % of the search advertising market in Google 's hands . "
" This would make the market far less competitive , in sharp contrast to our own proposal to acquire Yahoo , " Smith said in a written statement .
" We will assess closely all of our options .
Our proposal remains the only alternative put forward that offers Yahoo shareholders full and fair value for their shares . "
News Corp. back at the table ?
Another potential player in the affair is News Corp. NWS , - 3.57 % NWS .
The Journal story said Microsoft was in talks with the media giant over a potential joint - bid for Yahoo , but gave no further details .
Another report in the New York Times said the companies were talking over a joint bid that would create an Internet behemoth that would combine Yahoo with Microsoft 's MSN service and the popular MySpace social networking hub owned by News Corp .
The Times said talks between Microsoft and News Corp. " are at a sensitive stage , " citing unnamed sources .
An alliance between the companies could remove a potential ally for Yahoo ; News Corp. was said to be in earlier talks with the Web portal , but no deal emerged from those discussions .
News Corp. owns MarketWatch , publisher of this report , as well as the Journal .

Latest popular story : McCain withholds medical records for fifth time .
Sen .
Barack Obama 's tax returns have been online for a little more than a week now , but reporters , political rivals and opposition researchers are still licking their chops at the chance to dig into the IRS filings of his opponent Hillary Clinton .
Financial disclosure documents already filed by the New York senator show she and her husband , former president Bill Clinton , have made at least $ 50 million since leaving the White House in 2001 .
ABC
News investigative reporter Brian Ross takes an early crack at divining what details may be revealed from the Clinton 's tax returns , which her campaign has said will be released within the next two weeks .
The tax returns , Ross says , " will answer a lot of questions about how they made so much and whether they paid their taxes like average Americans -- or like the super rich they 've become . "
Citing Hillary Clinton 's campaign stump pledges to end tax breaks for wealthy Americans , Ross looks at the six - , seven - and eight - figure sums Bill Clinton has reaped since his term ended .
Among those are a reported $ 20 million payout Clinton is expected to receive for severing business ties with billionaire grocery store magnate Ron Burkle .
The former president also has made $ 47 million on a speaking tour , raking in up to several hundred thousand dollars per speech , Ross reports .
Another source of mystery in the Clinton financial world is the Clinton Foundation , Bill Clinton 's charity that has fought AIDS in Africa , promoted sustainable development , built the Clinton Presidential Library and sent the former president around the globe as a goodwill ambassador .
USA Today , in an editorial distributed by the Obama campaign , called for the Clinton Foundation donors , who include foreign governments and have pledged more than $ 500 million , to be made public .
Whether the foundation 's donor rolls ever see the light of day is another matter , but Clinton 's campaign has said it is preparing her tax returns for imminent release .
A spokesman tells
Ross the former president and his wife " pay full US taxes at the ordinary income tax rates . "
But , Ross observes , " with taxes , the devil is in the details , and the proof of what they really pay will come when the Clintons finally make public their tax returns . "

In the most recent edition of its annual â€ œContemporary Global Anti-Semitismâ€ released Thursday , the State Department â€ ” and hence the U.S. government â€ ” moves ever more closely to a long - standing neo-conservative tenet : that criticism of Israel or Israeli policies often , if not always , equals anti-Semitism .
The report also suggests that comparing Israelâ€™s treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories to South African apartheid â€ ” as former President Jimmy Carter did in his 2006 book Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid â€ ” also amounts to anti-Semitism .
And it focuses on the United Nations as a breeding ground for anti-Semitism as expressed through criticism of Israel , another major neo-conservative theme that has intensified sharply over the past five years , notably through the efforts of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , the National Review Online and the Wall Street Journalâ€™s editorial page .
Hereâ€™s the argument as laid out in the introductory section of the report entitled Contemporary Forms of Anti-Semitismâ€ :
â€ œAnti-Semitism has proven to be an adaptive phenomenon .
New forms of anti-Semitism have evolved .
They often incorporate elements of traditional anti-Semitism .
However , the distinguishing feature of the new anti-Semitism is criticism of Zionism or Israeli policy that â€ ” whether intentionally or unintentionally â€ ” has the effect of promoting prejudice against all Jews by demonizing Israel and Israelis and attributing Israelâ€™s perceived faults to its Jewish character .
â€ œThe new anti-Semitism is common throughout the Middle East and in Muslim communities in Europe , but it is not confined to these populations .
For example , various United Nations bodies are asked each year on multiple occasions to commission investigations of what often are sensationalized reports of alleged atrocities and other violations of human rights by Israel .
Various bodies have been set up within the UN system with the sole purpose of reporting on what is assumed to be ongoing , abusive Israeli behavior .
The motive for such actions may be to defuse an immediate crisis , to show others in the Middle East that there are credible means of addressing their concerns other than resorting to violence , or to pursue other legitimate ends .
But the collective effect of unremitting criticism of Israel , coupled with a failure to pay attention to regimes that are demonstrably guilty of grave violations , has the effect of reinforcing the notion that the Jewish state is one of the sources , if not the greatest source , of abuse of the rights of others , and thus intentionally or not encourages anti-Semitism .
â€ œComparing contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis is increasingly commonplace .
Anti-Semitism couched as criticism of Zionism or Israel often escapes condemnation since it can be more subtle than traditional forms of anti-Semitism , and promoting anti-Semitic attitudes may not be the conscious intent of the purveyor .
Israelâ€™s policies and practices must be subject to responsible criticism and scrutiny to the same degree as those of any other country .
At the same time , those criticizing Israel have a responsibility to consider the effect their actions may have in prompting hatred of Jews .
At times hostility toward Israel has translated into physical violence directed at Jews in general .
There was , for example , a sharp upsurge in anti-Semitic incidents worldwide during the conflict between Hizballah and Israel in the summer of 2006.â€ 
[ Italics added . ]
Of course , it would be interesting to apply this analysis to the rhetoric used by senior political figures , neo - conservative groups ( such as FDD or the American Enterprise Institute ) , and media in the U.S. and Europe about Islam , Muslims or about various kinds of Islamic political movements in the Arab and Islamic worlds , particularly with respect to the notion that these actors may have a â€œresponsibility to consider the effects their actions may have in promptingâ€  Islamophobia .
[ I suspect the reportâ€™s author meant â€œpromotingâ€ rather than prompting . ]
The report purports to apply a definition of anti-Semitism established by the European Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia ( EUMC ) to its own analysis .
But it actually goes beyond that by suggesting at various points , particularly in relation to UN conferences , resolutions , and the reports by UN Special Rapporteurs , that any comparison of the treatment by Israel of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories with apartheid amounts to anti-Semitism .
Carter , however , goes unmentioned , perhaps because the reportâ€™s scope does not cover the anti-Semitism in the United States .
If it did , I suppose it would have to also address the anti-Semitism â€ ” as opposed to the philo - Zionism â€ ” of the Christian Right , and that wouldnâ€™t be good for a Republican administration .
That anti-Semites like Tim LaHaye , Pat Robertson , and Jerry Falwell can be the most zealous supporters of Israel , particularly a Greater Israel , for theological reasons certainly poses some delicate challenges for those disposed to equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism .
So far as the neo - conservatives are concerned , however , that conundrum was settled 25 years ago when Irving Kristol noted that Jews should not be concerned about an alliance with the Christian Right despite its anti-Semitic beliefs .
â€ œWhy would it be a problem for us ?â€ he wrote back in the early 1980s .
â€It is their theology ; but it is our Israel.â€ 
The report is being issued in advance of next Wednesdayâ€™s a meeting at AEI next week on the subject of â€ œAnti-Semitism and the War on Terrorâ€ featuring Germany historian Matthias Kuentzel , the author of the â€˜Jihad and Jew - Hatred : Islamism , Nazism and the Roots of 9/11.â€ ™
As pointed out in the AEI blurb , the authorâ€™s â€œcentral thesis is that a great deal of contemporary Islamist anti-Semitism comes directly from the Third Reich , that it was institutionalized in the Middle East during the Second World War , and that is has grown ever since , thanks to organizations and individuals who â€ ” in many cases â€ ” received direct ideological , political , and financial support from teh Nazis and who are still very active .
â€ AEI fellows Michael Ledeen and Michael Novak ( who personally assured me at another AEI seminar back in 1981 that the Argentine military junta could not possibly be considered a neo - Nazi regime as alleged by one its most famous victims , Jacobo Timerman , after his release â€ ” as a result of pressure from Jimmy Carter , no less â€ ” from one of its secret torture prisons ) will comment after the presentation .

Senator McCain Condemns Torture -- But Votes Against the Bill That Would Prevent It
Marty Lederman
Our body ’s 24 - hour internal clock , or circadian clock , regulates the time we go to sleep , wake up and become hungry as well as the daily rhythms of many metabolic functions .
The clock -- an ancient molecular machine found in organisms large and small , simple and complex -- properly aligns one ’s physiology with one ’s environment .
Now , for the first time , a Northwestern University and Evanston Northwestern Healthcare ( ENH ) study has shown that overeating alters the core mechanism of the body clock , throwing off the timing of internal signals , including appetite control , critical for good health .
Animals on a high - fat diet gained weight and suddenly exhibited a disruption in their circadian clocks , eating extra calories during the time they should have been asleep or at rest .
The study , which will be published in the Nov. 7 issue of the journal Cell Metabolism , also shows that changes in metabolic state associated with obesity and diabetes not only affects the circadian rhythms of behavior but also of physiology .
Probing beyond the behavioral level , the researchers observed actual changes in genes that encode the clock in the brain and in peripheral tissues ( such as fat ) , resulting in diminished expression of those genes .
These findings close an important loop in studies led by Joe Bass , M.D. , assistant professor of medicine and neurobiology and physiology at Northwestern and head of the division of endocrinology and metabolism at ENH , of the relationship between the body clock and metabolism .
Two years ago Bass and his colleagues reported in the journal Science that a faulty or misaligned body clock can wreak havoc on the body and its metabolism , increasing the propensity for obesity and diabetes .
Since then , knowing that genetic mutations rarely are the reason for a malfunctioning body clock , Bass has been wondering what could upset the operation of this internal timing device .
What are the environmental factors or common influences that might affect the clock and in turn disrupt the sleep / wake cycle ?
“ Our study was simple -- to determine if food itself can alter the clock , ” said Bass , senior author of the paper .
“ The answer is yes , alterations in feeding affect timing .
We found that as an animal on a high - fat diet gains weight it eats at the inappropriate time for its sleep / wake cycle -- all of the excess calories are consumed when the animal should be resting .
For a human , that would be like raiding the refrigerator in the middle of the night and binging on junk food . ”
The clock - metabolism cycles feed on each other , creating a vicious loop , says Bass .
Once weight gain starts , the clock is disrupted , and a disrupted clock exacerbates the original problem , affecting metabolism negatively and increasing the propensity for obesity and diabetes .
“ Timing and metabolism evolved together and are almost a conjoined system , ” said Bass .
“ If we perturb the delicate balance between the two , we see deleterious effects . ”
The biological clock is central to behavior and tissue physiology .
Clocks function in the brain as well as lung , liver , heart and skeletal muscles .
They operate on a 24 - hour , circadian ( Latin for “ about a day ” ) cycle that governs functions like sleeping and waking , rest and activity , fluid balance , body temperature , cardiac output , oxygen consumption and endocrine gland secretion .
In their study , Bass and his team studied mice with the same genetic backgrounds .
After feeding them a regular diet for two weeks , they were split into two groups for the remaining six weeks , one kept on a regular diet and the other fed a high - fat diet .
After two weeks , those on the high - fat diet showed a spontaneous shift in their normal pattern of activity / eating and resting / sleeping .
They began to eat during their typical rest or sleep period ( daylight for a mouse ) .
The animals on a regular diet did not exhibit this behavior .
“ It ’s not just that the animals are eating more at regular meals , ” said Bass .
“ What ’s happened is that they actually shift their eating habits so that all excess food intake occurs during their normal rest period . ”
In the study ’s high - calorie , high - fat diet , 45 percent of calories was contributed by fat .
For humans , a diet with no more than 30 percent of calories from fat is recommended .
The entire study was conducted in darkness so that the behavior of the animals simply reflected their internal clock ; a normal animal has a very fixed daily period of just less than 24 hours .
For animals on a high - fat diet , after two weeks on that diet the animals ’ behavior changed : their daily period of sleep / wake was lengthened by a significant amount .
This suggests , says Bass , that the central mechanism in the brain that controls the timing of the cycle of activity and rest is affected by a high - fat diet .
“ Our findings have implications for human disease , ” said Bass .
“ These basic advances in science can be applied to the studies of common disorders like obesity and diabetes .
It is important to understand what happens when diet changes . ”

Ms Huwaider joins the main highway after driving in her compound
Wajeha Huwaider talks of the injustice of the ban and calls for its abolition as she drives calmly along a highway .
She says the film was posted to mark International Women 's Day .
Thousands have viewed it on the YouTube website .
The last such public show of dissent was in 1990 when dozens of women were arrested for circling Riyadh in cars .
Last year , Ms Huwaider and other activists circulated a petition which was sent to King Abdullah urging him to lift the ban .
Many women in this society are able to drive cars , and many of our male relatives do n't mind
Wajeha Huwaider
In the three - minute clip , she at first drives around a residential compound where she notes that women are allowed to drive because it is not a public road .
But about halfway through , without comment , she executes a left turn onto the main highway and proceeds to drive along it in defiance of Saudi law .
" Many women in this society are able to drive cars , and many of our male relatives do n't mind us driving , " she says in Arabic .
" I hope that by next year 's International Woman 's Day , this ban on us will be lifted , " she concludes .
In February , two leading Islamic scholars said there was no reason to continue the ban .
However , many conservatives continue to resist reform , arguing it would lead to mingling of the sexes which is banned under Saudi Arabia 's strict interpretation of Islamic Law .
The 1990 protest , coming at the height of the Gulf crisis when US forces had come to defend Saudi Arabia , was followed by a crackdown on the women drivers and their passengers .
The women were jailed for one day , their passports confiscated , and many lost their jobs .
King Abdullah has in the past said that he thought a day would eventually come when Saudi women were allowed to drive .
A selection of your comments :
I feel women here will be able to drive in the near future due to international pressure .
We have to admit that some problems will emerge in the beginning , but our society will get used to it .
There was a similar experience with satellite channels when they were first allowed .
Women driving will be the same .
Fahad Al - Nafisah - Hafr Al - Batin Saudi Arabia , KSA
I am a Muslim woman who has recently moved to the Middle East from Canada .
Driving is allowed for women in the UAE , yet I have chosen not to drive .
The kinds of harrassment that a women is subjected to here are a cause of concern .
I felt safe driving in Canada and not here in the UAE .
For this reason , I salute the religious leaders who issued this law because it actually protects women .
Fatima Saad , Al - Ain , UAE
While I disagree with the law banning women from driving , I do n't think society is quite ready for that change .
People are aggressive and rarely obey any sort of traffic laws .
Accidents are common and often end up in a fight .
To throw women into the mix , many of whom have never driven a car , will only make the situation worse .
Especially since many man do not treat women with the kindness and respect that they deserve , as is ordered in Islam .
Sommer Wahab , Madinah , Saudi Arabia
" Mingling of the sexes " This is cited as one of the reasons women should not be allowed to drive ?
How ironic ....
I live in Jeddah and who do you think drives us ( women ) around now ?
Our drivers who are NOT part of our families !
Hello !
Hello !
I 'd much rather be in a car alone than with someone brought to me by an employment agency with questionable driving skills .
April Tosch , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
I strongly support the Saudi Government not allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia .
It is proved that women have more weak hearts and get more confused or nervous than men .
There are double the amount of vehicles on the highways than there is room for already .
Having women on the road will make more rush and more accidents for no reason .
Khalid , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia
Maybe those who are against women driving are afraid that women may be better drivers .
Men should be proud of a wife who can manage to drive and support her family because then they have the proof that she 's in that marriage because of love for him , not because she does n't have a choice .
Ahmed , Beirut , Lubnan
Having lived and worked in KSA , my opinion is , it 's their country let them decide .
Internal affairs such as this , are just that , internal , nothing to do with the rest of us .
Thomas , Haukipudas , Finland
The West is the real culprit .
It does not respect women .
They are treated as sex objects .
They have to look sexy and walk naked to have any ' material ' value in their societies .
Women there have to work to pay for their livelihoods .
In Saudi Arabia , a woman has to be cared for and paid for by their husband and or parents .
Good for Saudi women !
Mowafaq Arab , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
The Saudis are turning tradition into religion , this is the point of no return , what 's next ?
How about burning books ... believe me this will never stop .
Give Saudi women the rights they deserve .
Qaiss Dashti , Kuwait
Women are quite heavily oppressed in Saudi .
However , much of this is due to the beliefs held by male members of the family .
There need to be laws to protect women and give them status equal to men .
The fact that women cannot drive shows that in the eyes of many they are inferior to men .
Ms Huwaider is a brave woman and I wish her luck .
Ele Reader , High Wycombe ( used to live in Jeddah )
The ban should be lifted of course .
However driving in the kingdom is the least of our worries .
Some men in Saudi Arabia do not even view us as human .
First we need female police officers with the same power as the male officers to protect us .
I was once involved in a car accident in Saudi Arabia , the police officer was more interested in learning what the relation was between me and the driver rather than asking if I was OK or needed medical assistance .
a saudi woman , Saudi Arabia
What happens in case of a serious emergency when the woman has got to get help , for her or other family members - like going to hospital ?
All power to those courageous women who are standing up for their rights as humans .
Yared Issac , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia
I had to wear my husband 's clothes as a disguise and drive to pick up my 3 year old daughter from nursery becuase my driver just suddenly decided not to work .
I had to put someone with me in the car because I could n't go into the nursery dressed up like a guy and I thought what a hassle !
I have 2 beautiful cars parked in front of my door but I 'm at the mercy of my driver !!
Alaa , KSA
If the authorities do n't want the sexes to intermingle then why do n't they allow women to drive and ban men from driving ?
Nicola While , Brussels
I think it is a matter of fear ; Saudi men do not allow women to drive because they fear the psychological change in the women¿s personality that will follow .
Part of men¿s dominance is having special privileges that women don¿t have .
Women in KSA now can¿t go out without having a man to drive which gives Saudi men absolute monopoly on their movements .
Such control is praised by the Saudi culture , and men will not forfeit such advantage easily at all !
Bassam , Egypt
If the ban were lifted , this small symbolic act would improve a lot of image problems Muslims have in the west and open up the way for more advances in the observance of women 's rights in the Kingdom and beyond .
The latter , however , will probably be seen as a negative rather than a positive in the Kingdom .
I think the ban should be lifted , but I 'm not holding my breath .
Mehdi Rifai , Damascus , Syria
I believe the west is using those women as a gateway , to influence very basic Saudi internal affairs .
If they respect women as they say , let them remove those women in glass windows , like a monkey who is only waiting monkey business ...
So back off and mind your own women .
Jamal Al Nakhlani , London - Yemeni
I lived for 12 years in Saudi Arabia and enjoyed the luxury of relaxing in the backseat as my driver tackled the busy and chaotic Riyadh highways .
In time I have no doubt Saudi women will be driving - perhaps their lack of peripheral vision due to the traditional face and hair coverings ought to be addressed .
Maddeleana Merrigan , Dublin , Ireland
To Mr Salahuddin Ahmed - do you have such a lack of self control that you need archaic laws to control your personal behavior ?
The Kingdom and all other countries that use this way of thinking to oppress its citizens in the name of religion need to move into the 21st century or face the eventual collapse when new blood take over and in time my friend they will .
Waffa Meddin Farouk , Dubai U.A.E
The only way for women to get their rights is to TAKE them .
Ms. Huwaider has been in the forefront of this push and is extremely brave .
Those outside Saudi Arabia cannot comprehend the guts needed to make this move and the extent to which women in the Kingdom are powerless .
I lived in Saudi Arabia for over 20 years so I know first - hand the oppression of women by the system .
Brenda Gant , La Crescenta , CA , USA
Saying a lot of husbands do not mind that women drive is quite exaggerated .
Most of the men of the age of 45 and above , including my father , approve the actual law .
Perhaps in a few years when the new generation takes his place it will change , but for now , forget it .
Omar Stitou , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
I think that Saudi women proved to be smart , clever , and hardworking and driving a car is not an issue .
There are many subjects that should be tackled that are much more important than a woman driving a car .
Lubna Dawany , Jordan
Islam gives the same rights to both men and women , so as long as the women are in proper Islamic ijab ....
Let us say that in Afghanistan , Pakistan and many Islamic countries we have Muslim drivers and pilots , so should we ban them too ?
Let the women drive , but they should be in proper ijab .
Angaar , Kabul , Afghanistan ( recently living in Dubai U.A.E )
Why should women in these Arab countries be treated with such cruelty ?
Their men should understand that tradition , religion and customs are things of the mind .
They themselves can only be free when they realise the truth and stop pushing the women to the back .
Stanley Tankoh , Cameroon
I feel that women should not be allowed to drive since this is an Islamic country .
If they are allowed to drive then it would result in many crimes including intermingling of sexes ... The ban should remain in place .
Salahuddin Ahmed , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
Surely it is now time to apply international pressure on the Saudi government , or rather royal family , to end this archaic law and give the women of Saudi Arabia the basic right to drive .
This would , at least , provide some kind of dignity and freedom .
All power to them .
Kris Steele , Bahrain
The irony is that the Saudi authorities insist that there is no law against women driving in the country .
Rather , it is ' socially condemned ' and thus unacceptable .
My question then is - if it is n't technically illegal , why should women fear being arrested ?
Of course , the authorities identify this technicality to highlight their ' acceptance ' of it , yet blame it on society and reprimand those who do drive .
Mohammed , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
We 've got a ton of plastic bags at our house that just sit in the cupboard waiting to be used as lunch bags or trash can liners , but we 're getting them faster than we use them .
I was wondering if anybody had some useful / creative things that they can be used for around the house , other than lunches or trash bags .
What are some good uses for plastic grocery bags ?
Applicative functors are gorgeous and versatile creatures , but as is common in Haskell , they lack a little in documentation .
The paper that Conor and Ross wrote introducing them is good , but dense .
What if we were to skip all the scene - setting kerfuffle , and plunge into using them by example ?
I wo n’t attempt to describe what applicative functors actually are , because the idea is easy to absorb : we ’ll pick it up as an incidental product of figuring out how to use them .
Bear with me .
To begin with , we need a motivating example , and we ’ll choose something simple , yet chewy : parsing an application / x - www - form - urlencoded string .
Remember , they look like this :
name=bryan+o%27sullivan&city=san+francisco
While we ’ll use Parsec as our parsing library , we ’ll give it a completely new skin .
module ApplicativeParsec ( --
Re-export the contents of these modules , for convenience .
module Control .
Applicative , module Text.ParserCombinators .
Parsec ) where import Control .
Applicative import Control .
Monad ( MonadPlus (.. ) , ap ) -- Hide Parsec 's definitions of some Applicative functions .
import Text .ParserCombinators .
Parsec hiding ( many , optional , ( ) ) -- Every Monad is an Applicative .
instance Applicative ( GenParser s a ) where pure = return ( <*>) = ap -- Every MonadPlus is an Alternative . instance Alternative ( GenParser s a ) where empty = mzero ( < | > ) = mplus
We ’ve made two claims in the code above .
We ’ve said that a Parsec parser is an applicative functor ( you know , whatever that is ) , and that we can chain parsers into a series of alternatives .
There does n’t seem to be general agreement about whether it ’s okay for a key in an urlencoded string to have no associated value , so we ’ll assume that it is by wrapping the value up in Maybe .
If a key has a value ( including an empty string ) , we ’ll use Just , otherwise Nothing .
p_query :: CharParser ( ) [ ( String , Maybe String ) ]
I ’ll give the complete definition of the parser here , then walk through what the various bits mean .
p_query = pair `sepBy` char ' & ' where pair = lift A2 ( , ) ( many1 safe ) ( optional ( char ' = ' *> many safe ) ) safe = oneOf urlBaseChars < |> char ' %' *> lift A2 diddle hexDigit hexDigit < |> ' ' <$ char '+' diddle a b = toEnum .
fst . head .
readHex $ [ a , b ] urlBaseChars = [ 'a '..'z ' ]++[ ' A '..' Z ' ] ++[ ' 0 '..'9 ' ]++ " $-_.!*'( ) , "
First of all , notice the complete lack of variables in the code .
This is the reason behind calling these beasts applicative : we construct our code by combining applications of functions .
Now for a piecewise decomposition of the code .
pair `sepBy` char '& '
The sepBy combinator takes two parsers as its arguments .
It applies the left parser , then the right , then the first , accumulating the results of each left - hand parse in a list .
The definition of pair is where things begin to become interesting .
pair = lift A2 ( , ) ( many1 safe ) ( optional ( char ' = ' *> many safe ) )
We ’ll dissect this from the inside out , which leads us to consider this first .
char ' =' *> many safe
The *> combinator applies the parser on the left , throws away its result , then applies the parser on the right .
You can think of the > as “ pointing at ” the parser whose value is really to be returned .
This implies that there ’s probably a <* combinator which throws away the result on the right , and indeed there is .
As for the parser on the right , many applies a parser repeatedly , building up a list of results as it goes .
It terminates as soon as the parser fails .
This snippet amounts to “ match an equals sign , then run the safe parser repeatedly until it fails , accumulating each result into a list ” .
The optional combinator turns a parser that must succeed into one that might fail .
optional :: ( Alternative f ) => f a -> f ( Maybe a )
By wrapping our earlier snippet with optional , we ’ve turned it into a parser that will return Nothing if our key is n’t followed by a value , or Just wrapping the value if there is one .
The meaning of the many1 safe snippet should be easy to guess : many1 applies the safe parser repeatedly , like many , but it fails if its parser does n’t succeed at least once .
( If you ’re used to thinking in terms of regular expressions , many is like * , and many 1 like + .)
Now to lift A2 ( , ) .
This takes two parsers as arguments .
It applies the first parser , then the second , then applies a function to their results .
Here , the function is ( , ) , which constructs a tuple .
Considered as a whole , this gives us a parser that applies two other parsers , and tuples up their results , returning the tuple as its result .
The safe parser handles a single character of a key or value .
Now that we ’re beginning to become familiar with the notation , we can gloss a little over its details and concentrate on what ’s new .
safe = oneOf urlBaseChars < |> char ' %' *> lift A2 diddle hexDigit hexDigit < |> ' ' <$ char '+'
Most obvious is the < |> combinator .
It takes two parsers as arguments .
If the left succeeds , its result becomes the result of < | > .
If it fails , the result becomes the result of the right parser .
As the above code implies , we can chain uses of < | > .
The first “ arm ” of safe parses a single character , taken from a set of acceptable characters .
The second consumes a percent - encoded character , using the lift A2 combinator that we saw earlier : it consumes a “ % ” character , followed by two hex digits , then applies diddle to the digits to turn them into a single Haskell character .
diddle a b = toEnum .
fst . head .
readHex $ [ a , b ]
The readHex function lives in the Numeric module , and parses a hex string as an integer .
readHex :: ( Num a ) => String -> [ ( a , String ) ]
We ’re now faced with a new combinator , < $ .
' ' < $ char '+'
This applies the parser on the right : if it succeeds , it throws away its result and instead returns the value on the left .
In other words , if we match “ + ” , we return a space .
Here ’s another example : here , we parse a series of RFC2822 or HTTP ( or MIME , or what have you ) headers into a list of name / value pairs , including the proper handling of continuation lines .
p_headers :: CharParser st [ ( String , String ) ] p_headers = header `manyTill` crlf where header = lift A2 ( , ) fieldName ( char ' :' *> spaces *> contents ) fieldName = lift A2 ( :) letter ( many field Char ) field Char = letter < |> digit oneOf " - _ " contents = lift A2 (++ ) ( many1 notEOL pure [ ] ) continuation = lift A2 ( :) (' ' <$ many1 ( oneOf " \t " ) ) contents crlf :: CharParser st ( ) crlf = ( ( ) <$ string " \r
" ) < | > ( ( ) < $ newline ) notEOL :: CharParser st Char notEOL = noneOf " \r
"
Notice our use of the <* combinator that we mentioned earlier , and once again the lack of let - or lambda - bound variables .
It can take a little while to get used to constructing and reading parsers in a wholly applicative style , but it does quickly start to feel both natural and appealing .
Compared to writing a parser in monadic style , the notation of the Control .
Applicative module leads to significantly more compact code .
Some of the big wins in expressivity come from the attention of the authors to surprisingly small details , like the <* and <$ operators , and their precedences and associativities .
These let us write chains of “ pointy ” functors , where we visually follow the arrows to see what ’s really being used .
By the way , the complete name for applicative functors is a mouthful : they ’re strong lax monoidal functors .
These structures come to us from abstract algebra and category theory .
If you ’re a functional programmer and you ’re not following the work of people like Conor McBride and Jeremy Gibbons , you really should : it ’s a whole lot of fun when the seemingly ethereal world of abstract mathematics comes home to roost in Haskell .
Solar System Leases : Taking the Industry By Storm
April 17th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
[ social_buttons ]
Buying a solar system is similar to going to Cosco and buying a 30 year supply of a staple .
It will have a large upfront cost , but will result in long - term savings in states with good solar energy potential .
What if you could lease a solar system and have the savings outweigh the monthly cost ?
SolarCity is changing the landscape of the residential solar market in California and the Phoenix metropolitan area by offering solar leases , which significantly reduces the upfront cost of going solar .
“ Customers have called for alternatives to solar purchasing , and our innovations in financing will allow them to get the benefits of renewable energy quickly , easily and affordably , ” said David Arfin , Vice President of Customer Financing at SolarCity .
The Solar Company
SolarCity takes responsibility for installing , maintaining , and monitoring the solar system .
The energy output of the system can be monitored through a website , which the homeowner also has access .
This allows performance issues to be addressed very quickly by SolarCity , without the customer having to notify them .
The homeowner benefits from the monitoring system by easily knowing the value the system is providing .
The Solar Homeowner
A typical home with a $ 225 electric bill can have a 4 kilowatt solar system installed .
At current electric rates , the system will lower the electric bill by an estimated $ 150 a month .
As the cost of electricity increases , so do the savings .
The initial cost of the system is $ 2,000 , with a monthly payment of $ 125 .
The monthly payment will increase by 3.5 % annually , but I would bet that electricity costs will go up more than that .
Maintenance and repairs are free of charge to the homeowner .
Solar Finances Behind the Scene
The leasing program is made possible by a financing program that is backed by Morgan Stanley .
“ This transaction will allow the consumer to source environmentally friendly power without having to make a large capital investment , ” said Aaron Lubowitz , Managing Director at Morgan Stanley .
SolarCity is able to take advantage of additional federal government incentives because of a tax credit that is available to companies .
This lowers the overall cost of the solar system for SolarCity , with savings that are not available to homeowners .
“ Leasing is actually financially better for the homeowner than purchasing the system , ” said Lyndon Rive , the company ’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer .

Consider choices like :
Do I push folks at my large company to hire my son ?
Do I spend college money from my parents to pursue an acting career ?
Do cut open this patient to try my new surgical technique ?
Such choices might be justified if , for example ,
My son is really good fit for the job opening .
I have an excellent chance to succeed in acting .
This is a very promising surgical technique .
But when am I justified in having such beliefs ?
Most people think they are justified in acting on a belief if that belief is " sincere . "
And by " sincere " they mean they are not conscious of just pretending to believe .
When they go to the shelf in their mind where that belief is suppose to sit , this is what they find .
And they do n’t remember anything illicit about how that belief got there .
But sincerity is way too low a standard !
Since humans have an enormous tendency toward self - deception , wishful thinking , and so on , we are clearly " sincerely " biased in many ways .
So to be justified in acting on a belief , you must have tried to identify and overcome relevant biases .
Furthermore , your efforts should be proportionate to the magnitude of the actions being considered , and to the magnitude of the biases that could distort your beliefs .
For important actions where biases tend to be large , you must try very hard to consider what you might have seen and felt if the world were other than you think it is .

Son preference in India is a well documented fact and its implications on skewed sex ratios , female feticide and high child morality rates is no news either .
For over a century India has shown marked gap in the number is boys vs girls born each year .
With technological advancement this gap is only increasing .
Indians worship the goddesses in temples but kill their daughters at home .
Preference for boys over girls is driven by these factors :
Sons are expected to provide emotional and social care to parents especially in their old age as well as are responsible for their lineage while daughters will go away to other families .
It appears sons compensate for the lack of social security in India .
Only if the son light the funeral pyre can the parents ascend to heaven .
Sons add to family wealth and property , whereas daughters will drain that in the form of dowry for marriage .
Sons will protect the parents whereas daughters have to be protected .
Economic prosperity and growing awareness has not reduced Indians ’ love for sons .
Education to women has increased the number of sex- selective births .
The kind of discrimination daughters will face in the family is a direct result of the sex of her older siblings .
Girls with two or more elder brothers will be treated much better than a girl with an older sister .
Preference for boys has also resulted in girls being undernourished , not vaccinated , uneducated , subjected to child marriage , abuse , and a life with inferior rights .
Preference for son is deeply inbred in Indian society and girls are looked upon as objects of liability to the family and society .
Even religious scriptures speak of value of sons born to a family .
Manu Smriti , dated in the second century AD , which notes , “ She is a true wife who has borne a son . ”
Another ancient text , the Atharva Veda , states , “ The birth of a girl grant elsewhere , here grant a son . ”
Although Hindu law officially provides daughters with equal access to property under the Hindu Succession Act of 1956 , that law is easily superseded by several edicts of Hindu religious law .
For example , a woman ’s access to property is dependent on her father ’s consent , whereas all Hindu sons have indisputable access to family property .
Hindu law also notes that married women have absolutely no rights to reside on family property after marriage .
In addition , whereas married daughters are considered to be part of their husband ’s family and are not expected to monetarily support their own parents .
Sex selective abortions have added fuel to fire .
Parents while going through abortions have been heard to say to the unborn girl ,
‘ We do not need you ; send your brother . ’
Advertisements like these are common –
It is better to pay 500 Rs. now than 50,000 Rs. later
( in dowry for the girl child at marriage )
It is difficult to ascertain statistics concerning female infanticide as this practice is carried out in remote areas and , it is assumed , never reported .
These trends are not only prevalent amongst Indians living in India but even those residing abroad .
Countries like UK and USA which have significantly large population of Indians are showing skewed sex ratios .
A new 2000 Census has revealed this new development since 1990 Census .
US parents have been known to prefer daughters over sons .
Here are some statistics :
Gender Requested by Adoptive Parents
70 -90 % Girls , 10 - 30 % Boys
Gender of Children Awaiting Adoption in U.S. Foster Care
Same ratio reported for 1998 , 2000 , and 2001
48 % Girls , 52 % Boys
Gender of Children Adopted from U.S. Foster Care , 1971 - 2001
64 % Girls , 36 % Boys
Gender of All Adopted Children in the U.S. Under Age 18
According to Year 2000 U.S. Census
53 % Girls , 47 % Boys
The new trends in US population ” suggest that in a sub-population with a traditional son preference , the technologies are being used to generate male births when preceding births are female , ” co-authors Douglas Almond and Lena Edlund said of their findings , appearing in edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The normal sex ratio at birth is 1.05 boys to 1 girl and that holds for first children of these families , the researchers found .
But if the first baby is a girl , the odds of a boy coming next rise to 1.17 - to - 1 , and after two sisters the likelihood of having a son jumps to 1.51 - to - 1 .
About fifty million women are missing in Indian population due to feticide , infanticide , and dowry murders .
Realizing the crisis Indian Government has now launched cradle scheme which is an attempt to stem the practice that has killed more than 10 million female fetuses in the last two decades , leading to an alarming imbalance in the ratio between males and females in India .
Under the plan the Indian government will set up a series of orphanages to raise unwanted baby girls in a bid to halt the widespread practice of aborting female fetuses .
In addition the girl child would be provided an insurance cover of 100,000 rupees at birth and the rest of the incentives would come to a cash package of about 200,000 rupees .
What is the future of Indian society ?
Even if the imbalance is met will Indian women ever experience gender equality ?
The question remains unanswered .
PBS : Missing Girls of India
Today 's Bloggingheads dialogue features me and writer John Horgan -- I will spare you a screen capture of our faces , but here is a good old - fashioned link .
John is the author of The End of Science , in which he argues that much of modern physics has entered an era of " ironic science , " where speculation about unobservable things ( inflation , other universes , extra dimensions ) has replaced the hard - nosed empiricism of an earlier era .
Most of our discussion went over that same territory , focusing primarily on inflation but touching on other examples as well .
You can judge for yourself whether I was persuasive or not , but the case I tried to make was that attitudes along the lines of " that stuff you 're talking about can never be observed , so you 're not doing science , it 's just theology " are woefully simplistic , and simply do n't reflect the way that science works in the real world .
Other branches of the wavefunction , or the state of the universe before the Big Bang , may by themselves be unobservable , but they are part of a larger picture that remains tied to what we see around us .
( Inflation is a particularly inappropriate example to pick on ; while it has by no means been established , and it is undeniably difficult to distinguish definitively between models , it keeps making predictions that are tested and come out correct -- spatial flatness of the universe , density fluctuations larger than the Hubble radius , correlations between perturbations in matter and radiation , fluctuation amplitudes on different scales that are almost equal but not quite ... )
If you are firmly convinced that talking about the multiverse and other unobservable things is deeply unscientific and a leading indicator of the Decline of the West , nothing I say will change your mind .
In particular , you may judge that the question which inflation tries to answer -- " Why was the early universe like that ? " -- is a priori unscientific , and we should just accept the universe as it is .
That 's an intellectually consistent position that you are welcome to take .
The good news is that the overwhelming majority of interesting science being done today remains closely connected to tangible phenomena just as it ( usually ! ) has been through the history of modern science .
But if you instead ask in good faith why sensible people would be led to hypothesize all of this unobservable superstructure , there are perfectly good answers to be had .
The most important point is that the underlying goal of science is not simply making predictions -- it 's developing an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the operation of the natural world .
This point is made very eloquently by David Deutsch in his book The Fabric of Reality .
As I mention in the dialogue , Deutsch chooses this quote by Steven Weinberg as an exemplar of hard - boiled instrumentalism :
The important thing is to be able to make predictions about images on the astronomers ' photographic plates , frequencies of spectral lines , and so on , and it simply does n't matter whether we ascribe these predictions to the physical effects of gravitational fields on the motion of planets and photons or to a curvature of space and time .
That 's crazy , of course -- the dynamics through which we derive those predictions matters enormously .
( I suspect that Weinberg was trying to emphasize that there may be formulations of the same underlying theory that look different but are actually equivalent ; then the distinction truly would n't matter , but saying " the important thing is to make predictions " is going a bit too far . )
Deutsch asks us to imagine an " oracle , " a black box which will correctly answer any well - posed empirical question we ask of it .
So in principle the oracle can help us make any prediction we like -- would that count as the ultimate end - all scientific theory ?
Of course not , as it would provide no understanding whatsoever .
As Deutsch notes , it would be able to predict that a certain rocket - ship design would blow up on take - off , but offer no clue as to how we could fix it .
The oracle would serve as a replacement for experiments , but not for theories .
No scientist , armed with an infinite array of answers to specific questions but zero understanding of how they were obtained , would declare their work completed .
If making predictions were all that mattered , we would have stopped doing particle physics some time around the early 1980's .
The problem with the Standard Model of particle physics , remember , is that ( until we learned more about neutrino physics and dark matter ) it kept making predictions that fit all of our experiments !
We 've been working very hard , and spending a lot of money , just to do experiments for which the Standard Model would be unable to make an accurate prediction .
And we do so because we 're not satisfied with predicting the outcome of experiments ; we want to understand the underlying mechanism , and the Standard Model ( especially the breaking of electroweak symmetry ) falls short on that score .
The next thing to understand is that all of these crazy speculations about multiverses and extra dimensions originate in the attempt to understand phenomena that we observe right here in the nearby world .
Gravity and quantum mechanics both exist -- very few people doubt that .
And therefore , we want a theory that can encompass both of them .
By a very explicit chain of reasoning -- trying to understand perturbation theory , getting anomalies to cancel , etc. -- we are led to superstrings in ten dimensions .
And then we try to bring that theory back into contact with the observed world around us , compactifying those extra dimensions and trying to match onto particle physics and cosmology .
The program may or may not work -- it 's certainly hard , and we may ultimately decide that it 's just too hard , or find an idea that works just as well without all the extra-dimensional superstructure .
Theories of what happened before the Big Bang are the same way ; we 're not tossing out scenarios because we think it 's amusing , but because we are trying to understand features of the world we actually do observe , and that attempt drives us to these hypotheses .
Ultimately , of course , we do need to make contact with observation and experiment .
But the final point to emphasize is that not every prediction of every theory needs to be testable ; what needs to be testable is the framework as a whole .
If we do manage to construct a theory that makes a set of specific and unambiguous testable predictions , and those predictions are tested and the theory comes through with flying colors , and that theory also predicts unambiguously that inflation happened or there are multiple universes or extra dimensions , I will be very happy to believe in the reality of those ideas .
That happy situation does not seem to be around the corner -- right now the data are offering us a few clues , on the basis of which invent new hypotheses , and we have a long way to go before some of those hypotheses grow into frameworks which can be tested against data .
If anyone is skeptical that this is likely to happen , that is certainly their prerogative , and they should feel fortunate that the overwhelming majority of contemporary science is not forced to work that way .
Others , meanwhile , will remain interested in questions that do seem to call for this kind of bold speculation , and are willing to push the program forward for a while to see what happens .
Keeping in mind , of course , that when Boltzmann was grounding the laws of thermodynamics using kinetic theory , most physicists scoffed at the notion of these " atoms " and rolled their eyes at the invocation of unobservable entities to explain everyday phenomena .
There is also a less rosy possibility , which may very well come to pass : that we develop more than one theory that fits all of the experimental data we know how to collect , such that they differ in specific predictions that are beyond our technological reach .
That would , indeed , be too bad .
But at the moment , we seem to be in little danger of this embarrassment of theoretical riches .
We do n't even have one theory that reconciles gravity and quantum mechanics while matching cleanly onto our low - energy world , or a comprehensive model of the early universe that explains our initial conditions .
If we actually do develop more than one , science will be faced with an interesting kind of existential dilemma that does n't have a lot of precedent in history .
( Can anyone think of an example ? )
But I 'm not losing sleep over this possibility ; and in the meantime , I 'll keep trying to develop at least one such idea .
Everyday Murder Nazi Atrocities , Committed by Ordinary People

A Bush administration lawyer resisted a San Francisco federal judge 's attempts Wednesday to get him to say whether Congress can limit the president 's wiretap authority in terrorism and espionage cases , calling the question simplistic .
" You ca n't possibly make that judgment on the public record " without knowing the still - secret details of the electronic surveillance program that President Bush approved in 2001 , Justice Department attorney Anthony Coppolino said at a crucial hearing in a wiretapping lawsuit .
Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker did n't rule immediately on the government 's request to dismiss the suit by an Islamic charity in Oregon , which says a document that federal authorities accidentally released showed it was wiretapped .
But Walker , in an extensive exchange with Coppolino , said Congress had spoken clearly in a 1978 law that required the government to obtain a warrant from a secret court before it could conduct electronic surveillance of suspected foreign terrorists or spies .
" The president is obliged to follow what Congress has mandated , " Walker said .
Coppolino replied that Congress has also authorized the president to protect the nation and its military secrets .
The case may determine whether any U.S. court can judge the legality of Bush 's covert order to the National Security Agency to intercept phone calls and e-mails between Americans and suspected foreign terrorists without seeking judicial approval .
After Bush acknowledged the existence of the program , Congress temporarily extended it in August and now is debating whether to protect telecommunications companies from lawsuits for their past cooperation .
Most lawsuits challenging the program have been dismissed because the plaintiffs were unable to show that they had been wiretapped .
But Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , a now - defunct organization that was once on the government 's terrorist list , said it learned it had been a surveillance target from a document that the National Security Agency inadvertently turned over in 2004 .
The foundation returned the document at the government 's request .
The Ninth U.S Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in November that the document was so sensitive that Al - Haramain 's lawyers could n't even rely on their recollections of it to establish wiretapping .
Rather than dismissing the suit , however , the court returned the case to Walker to decide whether the case could proceed under an untested provision of the 1978 surveillance law that allows a federal judge to hold a closed - door hearing and review accusations by wiretapping targets that the government has engaged in illegal spying .
At Wednesday 's 90 - minute hearing , Coppolino renewed the Bush administration 's attempt to scuttle the suit , arguing that the 1978 law authorizes a court to review the legality of a particular wiretap only when the government has acknowledged that it engaged in electronic surveillance and filed criminal charges based on wiretap evidence .
That did n't occur in this case , so Al - Haramain can't show that it was affected by the surveillance program , Coppolino said .
But Walker pressed him on a more basic issue : whether Congress acted constitutionally when it required court approval for such wiretaps in the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" I think it 's a bit of a simplistic question , " Coppolino said .
" One might call it a fundamental question , " the judge replied .
The government lawyer said that Congress " sought to intrude on the president 's authority to authorize surveillance " when it enacted the law , and that Bush , acting under his constitutional powers , had determined that its provisions were not sufficient to allow law enforcement authorities to thwart terrorists ' attack plans .
But Coppolino said the constitutionality of the law , and the related question of whether it is binding on the president , can't be resolved without delving into operational details whose exposure would damage national security .
Al - Haramain 's lawyer , Jon Eisenberg , contended that the 1978 law allows Walker to review the secret National Security Agency document and decide whether the foundation was wiretapped and can proceed with its lawsuit .
Responding to Coppolino 's argument that only those who are charged with crimes based on wiretap evidence have the right to contest the electronic surveillance , Eisenberg noted that the 1978 law defines unauthorized wiretapping as a felony .
" When the president of the United States commits a felony in his efforts to protect national security and nobody knows about it , the harm is to this country , " Eisenberg said .

INDIANAPOLIS , Indiana ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Sunday he would not hold another debate with rival Hillary Clinton until after the May 6 nominating contests in North Carolina and Indiana .
Clinton had challenged the Illinois senator and front - runner for the Democratic White House nomination to a 90 - minute debate in Indiana without a moderator , but Obama turned her down .
“ We ’ve got nine days to try to campaign and reach as many voters as possible , and so rather than being in a studio , I want to make sure that we ’re reaching out to folks where they live , answering their questions , ” Obama told reporters .
He said he would be “ more than happy to consider ” another debate with the New York senator and former first lady after the two upcoming primary contests .
Campaigning in North Carolina , Clinton said she regretted Obama ’s rejection of a pre-primary debate .
“ We need a president on day one ready to be our commander in chief , ready to turn our economy around , ” she told a rally on the banks of the Cape Fear River in Wilmington .
“ That is why I have to say I am very , very regretful that my opponent will not agree to a debate in North Carolina , because I think these issues are worth debating . ”
After Indiana and North Carolina , there will be only six more contests in the space of one month to finish the process of voting for a Democrat to face Republican John McCain in the November election .
April Fool ’s Day Survival Mode
April 1st is approaching , which means that the Museum will probably experience its annual surge of traffic that results in pages loading incredibly slowly or not at all .
I 'm going to do whatever possible to stop the site from crashing on April 1st , though I 'm not sure how much I can really do .
I 've already moved most of the images to a separate server , to reduce the strain on the main server .
I 'm also going to temporarily eliminate avatars in the forum .
I 'm not deleting them .
They just wo n't show up until I reactivate them after April 1st .
Unfortunately , because of the way the forum software works , I can't move them to a different server .
They 're either served up by my web host , or they 're not served up at all .
I 'm also tweaking settings in the blog software .
If it can be easily done , I might turn off commenting on April 1st .
Better to have new visitors be able to see something , but not leave comments , than not see anything at all because the page wo n't load .
Is this a joke ?

If it is , the joke 's on me .
Every April 1st , the site crashes because of the huge spike in traffic .

Sounds like you have a good plan in place , Alex .
Good luck !
By the way , do you have any speaking engagements or appearances ( radio or TV or other ? ) planned yet that we should be aware of ?
Posted by Tah in Idaho ( Yes , Idaho ) on Tue Mar 25 , 2008 at 02:59 PM
Not a joke MadRat , it happens every year .
I 'm just lucky that I live in the opposite time zone to the majority of people visiting so it does n't go too slow for me .
And I second Tah's question .
It 's nice to know in advance if you 'll be making an appearance anywhere Alex .

If you have admin control of the web server , check out bandwidth settings .
Most web servers have some sort of throttle to limit bandwidth for these kind of situations .
Well , not April Fools Day , but when expecting a huge spike in traffic .
Posted by Bill on Wed Mar 26 , 2008 at 04:11 AM
I do n't have admin control of the server , but I 've given my web host a heads up , so hopefully they 'll be able to manage the situation .
So far , I 'm scheduled to appear on an NPR show based in Cleveland , " Sound of Ideas , " on April 1 , 9 am ( which means I 'll have to wake up at 6 am :long : )
I 'll also be on BBC Radio Jersey at about 10:10 am on the first .
That 'll be taped , so I do n't need to wake up early .
And I 'll be on 95 bfm in New Zealand at around 1 pm on the 1st .
MSN.com should also be linking to the site .
As well as National Geographic News .

I almost got caught tweaking my blog once too , Alex .
I was 12 and it was in the basement of St. Alphonso 's School for Wayward Werechildren .
I had a copy of " National Geethatsgraphic " magazine , and was enjoying an article entitled " Lycan Ladies of Micronesia " , when Father Down happened upon me .
It was all the more embarressing because , you guessed it .
It was his magazine .

SANTA ANA , Calif . 
Drawing a sharp distinction between himself and the two Democratic presidential candidates , Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Tuesday against vigorous government action to solve the deepening mortgage crisis and the market turmoil it has caused , saying that “ it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers . ”
Mr. McCain ’s comments came a day after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York called for direct federal intervention to help affected homeowners , including a $ 30 billion fund for states and communities to assist those at risk of foreclosure .
Mrs. Clinton ’s Democratic opponent , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , has similarly called for greater federal involvement , including creation of a $ 10 billion relief package to prevent foreclosures .
As the foreclosure crisis has rippled across the economy , it has thrust itself to the forefront of the presidential race , with Democrats seizing on the issue in urging forceful government steps to alleviate the crisis .
Mr. McCain ’s remarks Tuesday , to a group of Hispanic businessmen here , signaled a sharpening divide between the two parties ’ candidates , with the senator warning against quick , costly government fixes to a crises rooted in the private sector .
“ Rampant speculation ” on both sides is the root cause of the crisis , Mr. McCain said .
He placed part of the responsibility for the mortgage mess on lenders , who he said had grown “ complacent ” in a rising market and as a result acquired a “ false sense of security ” that caused them to “ lower their lending standards . ”
I usually only drink while cleansing myself if I have a tub .
Showers get water in the beer .
Although , the other day , I was taking a shower , and I gradually turned up the water temperature until I could barely stand it , and got so relaxed that I could barely move , and the only thing I could think was : " If only I had an ice - cold lager ... "
The thought still haunt s me , and I think I 'm going to set aside a super relaxation day , just to try drinking a bunch of liquor and beer in the shower .
I hope I do n't drown
Update :
I have now ascertained that there is nothing in this world that is so relaxing as drinking in the shower .
After careful examination , I think I have elevated it to an art ...
Here follows a list of the proper procedure .
Get in the shower .
As you shower , turn the heat of the water up .
when the water temperature has reached its ( or your ) maximum , allow the water to stream down on your face , focused ( especially good with a massaging shower head ) just above your nose , between your eyes .
This will relax you greatly .
As you start entering this state of bliss , turn around , open your beer , and begin to drink , while occasionally turning around to keep your whole body warm .
I reccommend a lager , but in a pinch malt liquor will do .
Once done with the beer , turn off the water , towel off , and collapse into bed naked ( music optional ) and realize that to you , there exists no such thing as stress .
This perfect world lasts for roughly 1 /2 to 1 1/2 hours .
Treasure it .
Clash of Clans fans should be happy to know that Supercell , the developer behind the game , is rolling out a major update .
This is one of the most popular mobile games and it can often be found sitting on the first spot in the most downloaded apps category and this new update will ensure that it stays there .
The update weighs in at 85.9MB and it brings Clash of Clan ’s build number up to v9.105.10 .
Clash of Clans APK v9.105.10
First off , we need to mention that this update is exclusive to the Android ecosystem and it requires a minimum of Android 4.0.3 Ice Cream .
There are a bunch of reasons why this mobile combat strategy game managed to amass such a huge fan base and Supercell ’s constant stream of updates which make the game better with every patch is certainly one of them .
Even though the update weighs in at 85.9MB , it does n’t contain any new in - game features .
However , Clash of Clans fans should still update their game as soon as possible since this new update takes care of some highly irritating bugs .
No one likes to be annoyed by bugs or software issues and Supercell knows that too well .
This is the reason why the game developer makes sure to roll out a steady number of updates which prevents that from happening .
Strategic , Fast - Paced Combat Game
Clash of Clans is an immersive combat strategy game which gives players the ability to take control over medieval characters such as Wizards , Barbarians and Dragons among many other mighty fighters .
The best thing about this game though , is the fact that players get an opportunity to let their imagination go wild and show their strategic mindset through the way they decide to fight .
Free to Play
Considering how highly optimized Clash of Clans is , one would expect it to charge a monthly subscription .
Luckily , this is n’t the case since Clash of Clans is completely free .
Although , the way Supercell is making profits is through in - game purchases .
Players are not forced in any way to spend money on anything since most of these in - game purchases are cosmetic changes .

The real significance of the ISS thruster test failure Last month ’s failure of a test of a pair of rocket engines on the International Space Station has taught a whole series of unexpected lessons and has answered questions that the station ’s operators had n’t even intended to ask .
Yet since nothing actually happened , a senior NASA spokesman said it was a “ non-story ” .
But that ’s nowhere near the truth .
The incident and repercussions of it further underscore that operating a space facility as complex and poorly documented as the ISS is an irremediably non-deterministic process .
That is , anything can happen , at any time — and blindside everybody involved .
In this case , a significant station operation appears to have been planned without adequate understanding of how changes to the station ’s external configuration might impact the process .
When something went wrong , the station was out of range of Russia ’s inadequate tracking network , and garbled reports circulated within ground control sites , the news media , and even prestige trade press publications .
Then , two weeks later , something else went wrong with the station ’s maneuver capability , and this made the original test much more critical , and in much more urgent need of repetition .
In this case , a significant station operation appears to have been planned without adequate understanding of how changes to the station ’s external configuration might impact the process .
The original plan developed at the Moscow Mission Control Center ( the “ TsUP ” in the Russian acronym ) was to test - fire the engines “ just to see if they would work ” after being idle for almost six years .
The pair of engines are installed at the back end of the Service Module , named Zvezda ( or “ Star ” ) , and were used to push the 20 - ton habitation module from its original low parking orbit up to an altitude where the rest of the embryonic station could fly over and dock to it .
That occurred in July 2000 , and opened the way for the arrival of the first long - term crew .
The station has been occupied continuously since then .
But the engines , each slightly smaller than the reaction control system thrusters that control the orientation of the US space shuttle , were no longer needed after the docking .
When the orbit of the complex had to be changed ( usually , but not always , by raising it ) , thrust was provided by a visiting docked vehicle , either a Russian Soyuz or Progress , or a US shuttle .
However , sometimes a docked vehicle may not be in the proper position , or may not have enough propellant , when an orbital change is urgent .
The most common need for such a quick move ( several times per year , on average ) is when computers on Earth are processing radar tracking data and realize that another space object may soon pass uncomfortably close to ( that is , to within unavoidable uncertainties , threaten to collide with ) the station .
A small shove from any available rocket engine , if performed long enough in advance , changes the path of the station enough to miss the impending orbital intersection .
But then , on May 5 , the engine test failure suddenly became much more serious .
In an internal - use - only “ on - orbit status report ” , a NASA headquarters official described a new malfunction that directly threatens that debris avoidance capability .
“ Both Progress ships are currently exhibiting problems with … the electronic interface for [ Service Module ] computer control of Progress propulsion , ” the report notes on the bottom of the last page .
A “ special commission ” is investigating “ the resulting inability of configuring Progress thrusters ” .
The engines can still be turned on by direct radio commands from Russian tracking sites , the report adds , but it does not address the issue that , due to the absence of any overseas or space - based relay stations , the station is completely out of range for half of every day , and then in range only briefly every hour and a half during the “ good ” half .
The odds of a debris avoidance maneuver being needed at all , and being needed during the out - of - range periods , is low .
Yet the completely unexpected concatenation of problems that directly relate to a major flight safety theme — collision with another space object — is most definitely not a “ non-story ” .
The original burn
The original test burn had been scheduled to occur at 19:49 GMT on Tuesday , April 18 ( the crew ’s day is set to GMT , so this was in the middle of their evening mealtime ) , as the station was passing southwest to northeast across Iran , in range of Russian tracking sites in central Asia .
Since the Soyuz TMA - 7 had undocked from the aft port ten days earlier and a new supply ship launch was still five days away , the aft end of the station was clear — a fairly rare configuration .
The burn was to last ten seconds and increase the station ’s speed by about 0.35 meters / sec .
That impulse would , in turn , throw the opposite end of the orbit about 1,400 meters higher , raising the average altitude by 700 meters .
I had tuned in to the “ streaming audio ” from a news media hosting site , just to hear what might be heard .
I got an earful .
“ We had an emergency message ” was the first , brief call - down , in Russian and translated by an interpreter in Moscow .
A few more snippets of downlink indicated that engine number two had failed to ignite but they did not know how long — if at all — engine number one may have fired .
For the next twenty minutes , there was only silence on the downlink .
Moscow radioed up a few queries , “ ISS , Moscow ” — the space age equivalent of “ come in , please ” — but the crew did not respond .
I had tuned in to the “ streaming audio ” from a news media hosting site , just to hear what might be heard .
I got an earful .
Finally , Pavel Vinogradov came back on the air , just as the station was passing out over the Pacific and out of range of Russian ground sites .
Voice coverage was continuous due to piggybacking on NASA ’s relay satellites , but in Moscow they had no telemetry from the malfunctioning Russian hardware .
Instead , the Russian capcom asked Vinogradov to read him the error messages that had appeared on his laptop , the way most ISS systems are commanded and monitored .
Vinogradov laughed — there just were too many messages .
He explained how the problem had initially manifested itself .
“ The worse thing was it happened when I activated the TV camera in the [ service module midsection ] , ” that was watching a station solar array to see how it flexed back and forth during the thrusting .
“ I thought , wow , look at what happened when I pushed this little button . ”
It had all been a coincidence : just a few seconds before the scheduled ignition , the autopilot detected an error and aborted ignition of both engines .
The messages told of the detection of “ lack of readiness ” , then of the burn cancellation , then of the absence of the orbital correction .
Finally there were several messages announcing that pressurization and propellant valves were being closed , back into their passive posture .
In Moscow , this was the only information they had , at first , to troubleshoot the problem .
Vinogradov was thanked , and told to relax and sleep well .
They would talk more in the morning .
“ Thank you , ” he radioed down , “ and best wishes ” .
In the following hours , two initial misinterpretations began circulating in Moscow and Houston .
First was the report that the burn was aborted because “ a propellant isolation valve did not open ” ( in the words of a NASA spokesman ) .
That was quickly retracted , but another misinterpretation gained traction — that the crew had seen something was wrong and had manually commanded the burn be aborted ( that would be the way Aviation Week reported it , based on reading a news wire story ) .
The true cause becomes clear
That misinterpretation can be traced directly to a spokesman for Moscow TsUP , Valeriy Lyndin , when he was also giving the correct technical explanation for the cause of the abort .
“ Nozzle covers have to open before the engines are fired , ” he told newsmen the following morning , “ but telemetry showed that one of the covers did not open fully so we decided to delay the orbit firing . ”
He further explained : “ It was precisely the cosmonauts that spotted the glitch in preparing for the maneuver . ”
A week after the abort , the Russian space team had figured out why the cover had n’t opened fully : it had bumped into something .
But there was no tell - tale telemetry reading at the TsUP : they had no data since the ISS was out of range .
The reading was detected onboard the ISS and the autopilot , as it had been instructed , stopped at this point and began “ backing out ” of the burn configuration .
Contrary to Lyndin ’s description of people making a no - go decision , all the people involved were left in ignorant confusion while the well - programmed autopilot did its job perfectly and then presented the humans with a HAL - like fait accompli .
A week after the abort , the Russian space team had figured out why the cover had n’t opened fully : it had bumped into something .
On April 27 , the TsUP released a statement attributing the fault — the door had been 15 degrees short of fully opening — to physical interference from an antenna .
The hardware had been installed by spacewalking crewmen for use in guiding the European Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) to its planned docking at the back end of the Service Module .
That spacewalk , by Gennadiy Padalka and Mike Fincke , had occurred on September 3 , 2004 .
Computer animation of the work at the SM ’s back end , released by NASA prior to the EVA , showed one of the crewmen working very close to one of the engine covers .
The proximity of the additional antenna to the engine cover had never been invisible .
Two years earlier , while Russian spacewalk experts prepared a training session in their “ hydro- laboratory ” at Star City ’s cosmonaut training center , the test equipment clearly showed very small , if any , clearance .
An American engineer observing the test recalls remarking about the dubious clearance , but he was assured by his Russian colleague that this would n’t be a problem .
“ We ’re not going to use this engine again anyway ” , is how he recalled the Russian waving off the question .
Inadequate ground preparation on the part of the TsUP had been the cause of another more disastrous interference error , according to Guy Pignolet , a French space official working on a joint project .
In February 1999 , Pignolet observed a Mir experiment from the Russian control center .
In the experiment , a thin - film aluminum space mirror , called Znamya , was to have been deployed as part of a program to illuminate regions of the Earth at night with reflected sunlight .
As the rotating dispenser unfurled what was supposed to become an aluminum disk 25 meters in diameter , another console in the control center suddenly issued a command to deploy a boom - mounted antenna .
The boom extended directly into the space where the disk was rotating .
As a result , the aluminum wrapped itself around the boom and tore itself into shreds .
The operator claimed that nobody had told him there would be any physical contact .
After the failure , senior space engineer Vladimir Syromyatnikov , the developer of the mirror , remarked bitterly to a TASS reporter that “ Our style of life is responsible — such a complex experiment demands more time , more specialists . ”
When asked why the command to deploy the antenna had not been canceled , he answered , “ Because we did n't think of it . ”
Salvaging interim capabilities and long - term recovery Following the cancellation of the burn , TsUP officials were in no hurry to reschedule it .
The station ’s orbit was plenty high enough , and the upcoming launch of a Progress cargo ship proceeded without incident .
The question of whether the engines will work remains unanswered .
Previous space station modules in the Salyut program , and Mir , were equipped with such engines .
The main engines of Salyut - 7 , launched in April 1982 , were last used four years later during a joint maneuver with the just - launched Mir , but by now that experience was twenty years in the past .
Mir ’s back end was soon blocked by the addition of a new science module , and its pair of engines was never fired again after its first year in space .
The SM engines , with a rated thrust of 3,090 newtons , are canted fifteen degrees outwards from parallel to the module ’s long axis .
Furthermore , they have a small range of inboard / outboard swivel , about plus / minus 5 degrees , to fine - tune the thrust vector close to the station ’s center of mass .
This thrust centerline cant , in theory , allows either engine to be fired , alone or as a pair , with or without a docked vehicle at the SM ’s back end .
There would be a lot of plume impingement on the docked vehicle , and perhaps contamination of sensors from fuel residue , but it should hold together .
So even the current computer commanding problem with firing the engines of docked vehicles from the station ’s on - board computers is just another complication , not a crippling catastrophe - in - the - making .
So at the very least , engine number one , whose cover opened fully , is available for testing and verification .
Engine number two could probably also be used once the logic sequence of checking for a fully - opened cover is deleted .
So the next time the aft end of the SM is open , now planned for mid-September , another test is possible .
Meanwhile , the docked vehicles remain the station ’s mainline orbital adjustment engines .
Although the vehicle docked to the SM ’s back end thrusts most efficiently through the station ’s center of mass , even vehicles docked at the Russian segment ’s two side ports can be used to impart thrust , if needed .
A test firing last February showed this was feasible , if less efficient .
So even the current computer commanding problem with firing the engines of docked vehicles from the station ’s on - board computers is just another complication , not a crippling catastrophe - in - the - making .
The overlapping complexity of the station ’s own engines and its visiting “ propulsion providers ” provides a wide range of options , just as it has — this time — provided another example of a system far too complicated to ever really predict with any certitude .
Things will keep catching station operators by surprise .
As long as their bag of tricks stays just one layer deeper than the demands placed upon it , things should work out .
That ’s the unrequested — but unavoidable — lesson of this highly informative “ non-event ” .

An independent watchdog is asking Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate alleged criminal mismanagement by the Bush administration that resulted in the disappearance of more than 10 million internal e-mails .
Ongoing lawsuits and congressional investigations have revealed that the White House apparently failed to properly maintain e-mail archives from March 2003 until October 2005 .
This also means that millions of e-mails , which could have provided valuable insight to historians examining the inner workings of Bush administration as it planned the Iraq war or leaked the identity of former CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson , likely are lost forever .
Because the White House ’s failure to maintain its archives may have violated federal law , including the Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act , a special prosecutor is needed , says Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , which is suing over the lost e-mails .

That , I think , is the only question * that matters now , in terms of Tuesday 's result in Pennsylvania .
Will the Keystone State 's Democratic voters -- remember , these are Democrats , not general - election voters -- rebel against the negativity , the " gotcha " - ism , the endless drumbeat of cynical word - twisting and opportunistic gaffe - pouncing , that has become the central operating principle of the Clinton campaign , and vote instead for the man whose message of " hope " and " change " and a " new kind of politics " so inspired voters in the early stages of this nomination contest ?
If there 's ever a moment for that message to gain new traction , it would be now .
The conventional wisdom holds , and the polling suggests , that undecided voters will break for Hillary , as they did in New Hampshire , and in various big Super Tuesday states , and in Texas and Ohio .
But in the last week , Hillary 's campaign has gone almost entirely negative , and her inner attack dog been unmasked as never before .
Pennsylvanians , remember , have rarely if ever been the center of the political universe like this before -- they 're not used to being New Hampshire on steroids -- and the negativity must be absolutely overwhelming at this point .
I imagine a lot of voters are getting awfully tired of it all .
If I 'm right , tonight 's debate , while superficially helpful to Hillary ( Sullivan calls it Obama 's " worst performance yet on national television , " and I do n't disagree ) , may actually have damaged her -- precisely because it seemed , in some ways , almost like an extension of the last week of her campaign .
It was n't really a " debate " so much as an endless series of " gotcha " moments , an ongoing riff on " electability " and side - issues and distractions .
The lefty blogosphere is in an uproar ; Ed Rendell is mad as hell ; commenters on ABC 's site are livid .
But what will Pennsylvania 's voters think ?
And if they were turned off the debate , will that turn them on to Obama 's message , and turn them off to Clinton 's transparent Rovianism ?
I think it just might .
One of the night 's most popular answers , according to WPVI 's undecided voter reaction tracker thingy , was this response by Obama to a question about his relationship to former Weather Underground bomber William Ayers :
George , but this is an example of what I 'm talking about .
This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood , who 's a professor of English in Chicago , who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from .
He 's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis .
And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when I was 8 years old , somehow reflects on me and my values , does n't make much sense , George .
... [ T ] his kind of game , in which anybody who I know , regardless of how flimsy the relationship is , is somehow -- somehow their ideas could be attributed to me -- I think the American people are smarter than that .
They 're not going to suggest somehow that that is reflective of my views , because it obviously is n't .
Hillary 's response ?
" Well , I think that is a fair general statement , but I also believe that Senator Obama served on a board with Mr. Ayers for a period of time , the Woods Foundation , which was a paid directorship position . "
The undecided - voter meter plummeted .
Perhaps I 'm being a pollyanna-ish member of the Cult of Obama here , but I think there is a real chance the voters of Pennsylvania will rise up and , once and for all , reject the endless , party - destroying " gotcha " tactics of Hillary Clinton , and choose the candidate of " change . "
It would be the backlash to end all backlashes .
I 'm not predicting it .
But I think it could happen .
And it would be so sweet if it did .
* Check that : " Will there be a backlash ? " is one of two questions that matter .
The other one is , " What constitutes ' victory ' for Hillary Clinton ? "
I still maintain she must win by double digits , but I worry , in keeping with the yea theory , that a late rush of pro-Obama polls -- or even leaked , unweighted , pro-Obama exit polls on election night -- could lower the bar and allow her to claim " victory " with a mere narrow win .
UPDATE : Welcome , Andrew Sullivan readers !
P.S. Full disclosure for my new readers : before you put too much stock in my quasi- prediction here , you should be aware of my track record .
In October 2005 , I made a friendly bet that Giuliani , not McCain , would win the GOP nomination .
In November 2007 , I bragged that Rudy 's strong showing in national polls proved my long - held belief that the GOP is n't as monolithically closed - minded as many liberals think it is .
( I actually still think this point is correct , but my use of Giuliani as an exemplar was obviously woefully premature . )
In January 2008 , one day before New Hampshire , I predicted that Hillary Clinton , after being crushed in the Granite State , would quickly fade and " will not win a single primary . "
I implied she 'd drop out after Super Tuesday .
The next day , I picked not just Obama , but Romney , as New Hampshire winners .
Later that month , in a reversal of wrongness , I picked McCain to win Michigan .
I subsequently opined about a possible " Rudy surprise " in Florida .
I could go on , but you get the idea .
I 've repeatedly been spectacularly wrong this election season . :)
But hey , here 's hoping this is the time I 'm right !
UPDATE , 7:45 AM : I 've been Digged !
Also Kossed and DU'd .
Already more than 5,000 hits today , and it is n't even 8:00 AM yet .
Craziness !
Meanwhile , in comments , Jim Hu writes , " Maybe there will be a backlash , but basing it on the uproar in blogs and comments sections strikes me as wishful thinking .
If these were reliable indicators , Ron Paul would be the GOP nominee . "
Heh .
Touche .
But actually , I 'm not " basing it on " those things .
I 'm basing it on my own sense of voters ' likely reactions , which the online uproar has only confirmed .
My sense is simply this : Democratic voters ( not to be confused with general election voters ) seem generally unmoved by Bittergate and these other " gotcha " issues .
That sense seems to be generally confirmed by polls , " man on the street " interviews , and so forth .
So , given that voters are generally unmoved by those issues ; and given that Hillary has run an unceasingly negative campaign in the last week or so , based primarily on those issues ; and given that last night 's debate seemed like an extension of that negative campaign ; and given that Pennsylvania has really never been saturated like this with a sustained , PA - centric , negative campaign ; I think a backlash is possible .
I may well be wrong , but if I am , it wo n't be because I 'm putting too much stock in online commentary .
It 'll be because my internal predictive sense of how voters are likely to react is wrong .
As demonstrated above , it would n't be the first time !
UPDATE : The ever - insightful FlyOnTheWall writes in comments :
There may be a backlash provoked by the debate , Brendan , but I suspect that the narrative of a backlash will be far more important .
Scanning the coverage this morning , there seems to be an emerging consensus among the talking heads that Clinton hurt herself through her unrelenting negativity last night .
I 'm not sure that 's entirely fair - it strikes me that she 's mostly guilty of sinking to the level of the moderators , and taking their bait .
But it may not matter .
Consider , for example , this gem from Halperin : " The Obama campaign tells Stephanopoulos that ' prominent Pennsylvania supporters ' will switch their support from Clinton to Obama Thursday morning due to Clinton ’s negativity . "
Now , I 'd be willing to wager that if they actually exist , these supporters came around before last night .
But Axelrod and Plouffe are n't stupid - they recognize the value of reinforcing perceptions .
So they 'll roll them out this morning , and the day - after cycle will be dominated by the news that Hillary even turned off some of her own supporters .
( Assuming Stephanopolous is correct - can you trust the guy after last night ? )
I doubt that the debate itself changed many minds .
But far more people will see coverage of the debate and its aftermath than tuned in to watch the event itself last night .
And if Obama can make Hillary 's negativity the crucial issue , he can turn a truly dismal performance to his advantage .
Well , hey , Hillary won New Hampshire on the basis of a ridiculous , trumped - up " sympathy card . "
If Obama can do the same in Pennsylvania , they 'll be even .
Oh , and Obama will be the nominee .
UPDATE TO THE UPDATE : Upon reflection , it occurs to me that the " narrative of a backlash " could be bad for Obama , because it could have the effect of resetting the expectations game -- again ! -- so as to lower the bar for Clinton -- again ! -- thus allowing her to claim a " win " on the basis of a narrow margin that should really be seen as a moral victory for Obama -- again !
As commenter " yea " pointed out two weeks ago , and as I alluded earlier in this post , this late - in - the - game resetting of expectations has been a major Achilles ' heel for Obama throughout the campaign .
( Think New Hampshire , Super Tuesday , Texas & Ohio . )
And it could happen again , with the " backlash narrative " being the launching point .
Think about it : there are still six whole days before the primary .
That 's a lot of time .
And polls are already showing a tightening race , as they always seem to do when primary day nears .
That in itself will start to reset expectations , but what 's worse , the " backlash narrative " may convince the commentariat that Obama will pick up a big chunk of the undecided vote .
Throw in a couple more polls that , by random variation , show Obama with a slight lead -- which will , in keeping with the conflation of correlation and causation , be attributed to the " backlash , " thus strengthening the meme -- and , by Tuesday , the MSM could be well - nigh convinced that Obama has a chance to win Pennsylvania outright .
And then think about what will happen when the first wave of leaked , unweighted exit polls -- which always seem to favor Obama -- appear on the media 's and blogosphere 's radar .
If those numbers show a dead heat or an Obama victory , and if the first round of published , issue - based exit polls show the voters saying by wide margins that they hate all the negative campaigning , and that it was important to their vote -- which voters always say , whether it 's true or not -- the narrative of a " possible Obama upset " will become conventional wisdom by the time the polls close .
All of which will mean that , when Hillary wins by 5 or 6 points , she 'll be able to claim a " comeback " victory , and the narrative will abruptly shift back to : " Well , I guess that ' bitter ' stuff , and the Wright stuff , and the Rezko stuff , and the Ayers stuff , and the flag stuff , really hurt Obama after all !
Why , look , he lost the working - class white male vote by a 2 - to - 1 margin !
Obama is in trouble ! "
The superdelegates go back to being alarmed ; Hillary again vows to stay in the race until the convention ; the thumb - suckers suck their thumbs vigorously ; and , basically , we 're back to square one .
All because of a narrative that I played some small role in starting .
Dammit . :)
Companies like Encore often schedule dozens of payments and make dozens of calls before the loan is paid off .
Encore  which also operates as Midland Capital Management  also files sheaves of lawsuits against customers who do not respond .
Sometimes the debt is so old that the statute of limitations for filing a suit has passed , and it may already have vanished from a person ’s credit report .
If the debtor makes a new payment , though , the statute of limitations starts all over again .

Credit counselors in the United States say more and more of their clients are being contacted by debt collectors based in India .
Sometimes , it can cause problems .
When clients “ run into someone who does n’t speak English well or there is a communication gap , it can add to the frustration of the customer , ” said Bill Druliner , manager and financial counselor for GreenPath Debt Solutions in Milwaukee .
Debt collection , no matter who does it , can have “ a devastating impact on people ’s lives , ” Mr. Druliner said , because calls can stress family relationships and sometimes debtors are pressed into paying late bills instead of buying necessities like prescriptions .
Still , he said , he had not run into any specific problems with overseas debt collectors .
“ What they may lack in authority or ability to handle slang , they do handle the process very well and are very well spoken , ” he said .
Mortgage loans , which involve complex state and national laws , are nearly always handled by collectors in the United States .
But credit card , auto and other debt are prime candidates for collection overseas .
Just over 4.5 percent of all bank credit card accounts were delinquent in the fourth quarter of 2007 , according to the Federal Reserve , up from 3.5 percent two years before .
Businesses in the United States put $ 141 billion in delinquent consumer debt up for collection in 2005 , according to a PriceWaterhouseCoopers survey commissioned by an industry group , and debt collection agencies collected $ 51 billion that year .
They kept nearly a quarter of that in profits .
" About halfway through , I bit in and felt something hard and crunchy . "
That ’s what NYU senior Benjamin Jarosch declared after eating part of a found muffin , and he was n’t talking about a walnut : his innocuous - looking blueberry muffin was stuffed with three razorblades .
Jarosch and his buddies had discovered the muffin , along with four others , wrapped in tin foil , upon arriving in the classroom .
It seems they were left over from a previous class and were " props " used by a student to demonstrate " ideas of absurdism and randomness . "
Professor Heidi
White forgot to discard the muffins when class was dismissed , and the professor for the next class knew nothing about the muffin's sharp surprise .
Jarosch ’s muffin was the only one with razorblades , and despite eating half of it before noticing anything unusual , he survived uninjured .
“ I spit them out before they cut .
It could have been a lot worse , there 's no doubt about it , " Jarosch told the Sun .

Harry Yates will join up with Everton after being spotted playing for his junior side .
After much interest from a number of teams , including Manchester United and Liverpool , his parents decided the young goalkeeper from Heaton Mersey in Stockport , will be given the best care at Everton .
Harry ’s father Phil , himself a former goalie , reckons it was only a matter of time .
“ He has no other real hobbies – it really is his number one passion , ” he said .
“ We even had to get him soft balls because we ca n’t stop him kicking around inside , so bang go the ornaments and glassware . ”
Harry also practices every day with the half - sized nets that have been put up in his back garden .
The potential young star will practice on the same field as the first team at their Finch Lane facility in Halewood , Cheshire .
“ He ’s not stopped talking about it and says he has butterflies in his tummy , ” said Phil , “ He is old enough to understand what a big thing it is but his mother and I have kept his feet on the ground . ”
“ He also knows he can be dropped just as easily if the effort flags but it will be a fantastic experience . ”
Harry ’s mum Julia added : “ Our biggest concern is that he enjoys his journey . ”
I wrote recently about the trials and tribulations I have suffered being the father of a talented young player , but to start all that at the age of seven ?!
When I first read the news I was n’t entirely sure what I felt about it .
I ’m all for finding and developing young talent , but seven years - old just seems too young and vaguely wrong somehow .
I am in no way criticising Harry or his parents and I wish them the very best of luck .
They seem really sensible and are doing what almost any parents would do in the same situation .
If I am criticising anything , it is the football world and society in general .
Surely seven years old is too young for any football clubs to be ‘ pursuing ’ anyone .
I have a friend of a friend who has had a son at Bristol Rovers since the age of nine .
Now , at seventeen , the boy has been released .
That is an awful situation for the boy .
Eight years of dreaming of being a professional footballer and playing for his local professional side , and then gone .
It ’s all over .
I know from personal experience that on that dreaded day when you are told , “ Sorry son , you ’re not going to make it , ” the lives of the children and parents change forever .
Imagine this family at Bristol Rovers .
At least twice a week for eight years the boy has met up with and trained with his mates .
The Dad , if he was anything like me , will have formed great frienships with the other parents at the club .
So when the child is released by the club , not only are dreams shattered , your whole life changes as well .
You walk in one door to speak to the Academy director and walk out the other with a different life .
It is a massive moment and one that needs to be managed carefully if it is n’t to have a psychological effect on all concerned .
I ca n’t speak for Everton , but in the case of most professional clubs it is a case of “ Goodbye and thanks for coming ” when they release a young player .
As far as they are concerned that is the end of their involvement with the young person , and it is left to the parents to pick up the pieces .
That is what worries me about young Harry .
He might turn out to be the next Neville Southall or Tim Howard , but that is still a one in a million chance .
So many things could go wrong .
He might not grow big enough for example .
I have another friend who is the father of a very talented goalkeeper .
He was at Bournemouth for a while but he stopped growing at around 5 ’ 8 ″ .
It does n’t matter how talented he is , at that size he will never go beyond semi-pro football .
The boy might just not develop enough to make it .
I hope he does , but although Harry ’s father talks about keeping ‘ his feet on the ground ’ the dreams are already beginning .
To Everton , Harry will just be another kid on the production line .
To Harry and his parents this is their life .
They must start to prepare for possible disappointment because Harry could go all the way to sixteen or seventeen years old and then be discarded .
Everton wo n’t care because they ’ll have other young keepers that they think are better .
I do n’t want to sound like the ‘ Grinch ’ and I do n’t want to spoil anyones ambitions or dreams , but I do fear for the psychological well being of kids who are handed the dream at such a young age .

Defining a word is notoriously difficult .
Try to explain the difference between hatred and enmity , or define chair in such a way that includes bean bag chairs but excludes stools .
This is an annoyance for lexicographers and a real headache for philosophers and psychologists .
Several centuries ago , British philosophers like Hobbes worked out what seemed like a very reasonable theory that explained human knowledge and how we acquire it .
However , this system is based on the idea that all words can be defined in terms of other words , except for a few basic words ( like blue ) which are defined in terms of sensations .
This difficulty led at least one well - known philosopher , Jerry Fodor , to declare that words cannot be defined in terms of other words because word meaning does not decompose into parts the way a motorcycle can be disassembled and reassembled .
You ca n’t define chair as an artifact with legs and a back created for sitting in because chair is not a sum of its parts .
The problem with this theory is that it makes learning impossible .
Fodor readily acknowledges that if he is correct , babies must be born with the concept airplane and video tape , and in fact all babies who have ever been born were born with every concept that ever has or ever will exist .
This seems unlikely , but Fodor is taken seriously partly because his arguments against definitions have been pretty convincing .
Ray Jackendoff , a linguist at Tufts University , argued in his recent Foundations of Knowledge , that words do in fact have definitions .
However , those definitions themselves are not made up of words composed into sentences .
Observing ( correctly ) that one usually cannot find airtight definitions that work all of the time , Fodor concludes that word meanings cannot be decomposed .
However , his notion of definition is the standard dictionary sort : a phrase that elucidates a word meaning .
So what he has actually shown is that word meanings cannot be built by combining other word meanings , using the principles that also combine words into phrases .
( p. 335 )
That is , there are ways that words can be combined in sentences to achieve meaning that is greater than the sum of the meanings of the words ( compare dog bites man to man bites dog ) .
This is called phrasal semantics .
Although linguists still have n’t worked out all the rules of phrasal semantics , we know that there are rules , and that these allow for certain combinations and not others .
Jackendoff has proposed that a very different system ( lexical semantics ) using different rules is employed when we learn the meanings of new words by combining little bits of meaning ( that themselves may not map directly on to any words ) .
I think that this is a very attractive theory , in that it explains why definitions have been so hard to formulate : we were using phrasal semantics , which is just not equipped for the task .
However , he has n’t yet proven that words do have definitions in terms of lexical semantics .
He has the sketch of a theory , but it ’s not yet complete .
High levels of customer satisfaction with Apple 's new Leopard operating system are spurring " explosive sales " of the company 's Mac computer line , a new consumer spending survey has revealed .
The survey of 4,604 ChangeWave Alliance members , conducted January 2 - 8 , revealed 17 percent of respondents bought an Apple notebook over the past 90 days , up 3 full percentage points from the firm 's previous survey this past November .
Meanwhile , Apple desktop purchases came in at 16 percent over the same time period , up 6 percentage points , likely driven by robust demand for the Cupertino - based firm 's new line of glass and aluminum - clad iMac all - in - one systems .
" The results represent an astonishing leap for Apple among consumer PC purchasers over the holidays , " ChangeWave wrote in its report .
" Looking at the next 90 days , a third of planned PC buyers ( 33 percent ; up 4 - pts ) say theyâll purchase an Apple notebook — a new all - time high for the electronics giant . "
At the same time , 29 percent of buyers say theyâll buy an Apple desktop , matching the same all - time high percentage reported by the firm in its November study .
According to the latest report , Apple also maintained its commanding lead in customer satisfaction when compared to other major PC manufacturers , with nearly four - in - five Apple buyers ( 79 percent ) over the past 90 days saying they are Very Satisfied with their purchase .
By comparison , the Mac maker 's two biggest competitors — Dell and Hewlett - Packard — had 59 percent and 58 percent satisfaction ratings , respectively .
" It comes as no surprise that Apple sets the standard in terms of customer satisfaction , " said Tobin Smith , founder of ChangeWave Research , " but thereâs a new twist on why theyâre outperforming the rest of the industry — itâs the amazing customer satisfaction rating on Appleâs new Leopard OS . "
Smith said that more than four - in - five Apple buyers ( 81 percent ) said they were Very Satisfied with Leopard , which is " an exceptionally high rating " for a new operating system .
This compares to 53 percent and 51 percent for Windows XP , and just 27 percent and 15 percent , respectively , for the Microsoft Vista systems .
The high customer satisfaction in Leopard not only dwarfs its competitors , but is also having a direct impact on consumer intentions to purchase an Apple Mac , Smith added .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday said the Bush administration opposes “ major government interventions ” in the slumping housing market that would bail out speculators or lenders .
“ We ’re focused on plans to keep homeowners who want to stay in their homes and are willing to work with lenders in their homes , ” he told WGN Radio in Chicago in an interview that was broadcast on the Web .
“ What we ’re against are major government interventions that would be a bailout for speculators or lenders , ” he added .
Two prominent congressional Democrats -- Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and House of Representatives ’ Financial Service Committee Chairman Barney Frank of Massachusetts -- have offered proposals that would use government funds to either buy or help refinance mortgages .

Calls for a new 9/11 inquiry are reaching a crescendo , with well - respected authorities and celebrities alike adding their voices to the cause , as the official 9/11 story crumbles under the weight of revelations of White House ties to the 9/11 Commission , and other cover-ups on behalf of authorities staffed with investigating the attacks .
The corporate media ’s insistence on ignoring hundreds of professional experts who are calling for a new 9/11 investigation has spurred many celebrities to use their public platforms to speak out , knowing that the press will at least have to address the issue .
The latest to do so is top comedian Margaret Cho , who told the Alex Jones Show yesterday that the public were going to become very angry when it was fully disclosed that the attacks were a conspiracy , concurring with fellow comedian George Carlin who also questioned the official story last year .
The path was trailblazed by Charlie Sheen in March 2006 when he spoke of his doubts about the official story and questioned the collapse of WTC Building 7 .
Sheen was endlessly smeared for weeks after but he prompted a national debate about 9/11 and the 9/11 Truth Movement enjoyed what many consider to be its most productive year .
In September 2006 , former Governor , actor and wrestling star Jesse Ventura questioned 9/11 during an on -camera interview with Alex Jones and also cited Operation Northwoods and the Gulf of Tonkin as examples of how the government has planned and carried out staged war provocations in the past .
In July 2007 , popular film maker Michael Moore told WeAreChange.org reporters that he had many more questions about 9/11 than at the time of making Fahrenheit 9/11 and did not believe the public had been told " half the truth " about what really happened .
Martin
Sheen echoed his son ’s comments in October 2007 along with rising actor Mark Ruffalo , following in the footsteps of Rosie O’Donnell , who caused shockwaves when she brought 9/11 truth to national prominence during her stint as The View host .
The View was also used as a platform for actor James Brolin to raise 9/11 truth , who questioned the official version of events in the same week that acclaimed director David Lynch spoke out .
Lynch told Dutch television he thought WTC Building 7 was brought down via controlled demolition and that the Pentagon and Pennsylvania crash sites were suspicious due to the absence of evidence that a plane crashed at either location .
Other notable public figures speaking out at the same time included Ed Asner , Matthew Bellemy of Muse and director Richard Linklater .
American icon Willie Nelson threw his hat in the ring last month , when he told The Alex Jones Show that he thought the twin towers were imploded like condemned Las Vegas casino buildings .
Nelson ’s comments were almost universally blackballed by the corporate media , who had patently learned from the Sheen controversy that smear campaigns were only leading to more people being exposed to the information and beginning the wake - up process .
Of course , the really important advocates of 9/11 truth are the hundreds of architects , scholars , engineers and other expert professionals who are demanding a fresh inquiry , but they are habitually ignored by the media as the 9/11 Truth Movement is smeared as a fringe interest fad populated by kooks and imbeciles .
In reality , doubts about the official 9/11 story are shared by a myriad of well - respected figures .
The Japanese Parliament were recently a captive audience to a 9/11 truth presentation by Fujita Yukihisa – a member of the House of Councillors in the Diet .
Andreas von Buelow , the former German Defense Secretary , was perhaps the first most prominent individual to go on the record back in 2004 , when he blamed the CIA for orchestrating the attacks .
He was followed by former environment minister in Tony Blair ’s government Michael Meacher , who questioned the stand down of NORAD on 9/11 and dismissed the entire war on terror as a hoax .
Veteran CIA agent and respected geopolitical expert Robert Baer said that " all the evidence points to " 9/11 having had elements of an inside job during a radio apperance in June 2006 .
Late last year , former Italian President Francesco Cossiga told Italy ’s most respected newspaper that the attacks were run by the CIA and Mossad and that this was common knowledge amongst global intelligence agencies .
Former Wall Street Journal editor , U.S. Treasury Secretary and founder of Reaganomics Paul Craig Roberts questioned the susupicious collapse of the twin towers and Building 7 in February 2006 .
Headed up by Richard Gage , the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth organization lists hundreds of experts in their field who all concur that the implosion of the buildings is not consistent with the official story and needs to be investigated .
Scholars For 9/11 Truth & Justice , headed by Professor Steven Jones , counts amongst its ranks hundreds of physicists , scientists and academic professionals who all share doubts about 9/11 .
Another website , Patriots For 9/11
Truth , lists hundreds more former government , military , air force , and navy officials who have all spoken out about 9/11 .
With the impartiality of the 9/11 Commission having been blown wide open by revelations of White House ties with Philip Zelikow , allied to the fact that the Pentagon knowingly lied to the Commission during testimony , the call for a new independent inquiry , armed with subpoena powers , is amplifying to a crescendo .
Allegations of a cover - up in regard to the organization responsible for investigating the collapse of the twin towers on behalf of FEMA this week also increased the pressure .
The more prominent figures that add their voice to that call , be they captains of culture or respected authorties in their discipline , can only increase the eventual likelihood of a new investigation .

The modified TGV was powered by two engines
The previous TGV record was 515 km/h ( 320 m ph ) , set in 1990 .
The record attempt by a modified TGV took place on a track between Paris and the eastern city of Strasbourg .
The absolute train speed record was set by a Japanese magnetic levitation train - Maglev - in 2003 .
It reached a top speed of 581 km/h ( 361mph ) .
The TGV set the new record at 1314 ( 1114GMT ) on Tuesday .
It was a modified version called V150 , with larger wheels than usual and two engines driving three double - decker cars .
The BBC's Emma Jane Kirby said the three train drivers were seen grinning on French TV after they realised they had broken the record .

Three motorised bogies Power output : more than 25,000 horsepower Cost : 30 m euros ( £ 22 m ; $ 40 m )
See world speed records
The train travelled almost as fast as a World War II Spitfire fighter at top speed .
The electrical tension in the overhead cable was boosted from 25,000 volts to 31,000 for the record attempt .
Spectators clapped and cheered as the train zoomed underneath bridges .
" We saw the countryside go by a little faster than we did during the tests , " engineer Eric Pieczac told the Associated Press .
The train travelled as fast as a WWII fighter plane
" Everything went very well .
There are about 10,000 engineers who would want to be in my place , " Mr Pieczac said .
" It makes me very happy , a mixed feeling of pride and honour to be able to reach this speed . "
French TGV trains , in service since 1981 , generally travel at about 300 km / h .
But from 10 June they will be allowed to reach 320 km/h on the recently opened Paris - Strasbourg LGV Est line .
SNCF and the train 's makers Alstom say the record attempt represents a test on the infrastructure in extreme conditions , which is impossible to carry out in the laboratory .
After the record was broken , President Jacques Chirac conveyed his congratulations on " this new proof of the excellence of the French rail industry . "
Rival trains
" Economically efficient and respectful of the environment , the TGV is a major asset in efforts to ensure sustainable development in transport , " Mr Chirac was quoted as saying .
" What is important for us today is to prove that the TGV technology which was invented in France 30 years ago is a technology for the future , " said Guillaume Pepy , director - general of SNCF .
Alstom also aims to boost TGV sales abroad , where it is competing with the Japanese Shinkansen and the German Inter - City Express high - speed trains .
China , South Korea and Taiwan are the most important customers for high - speed trains .
The technology is also being looked at in California for a new high - speed service between Los Angeles and San Francisco , according to AFP news agency .
DailyCamera.com , Nancy Sullo , Tom Moore , and Liz / Bruce Robinson —
There seems to be considerable confusion as to what is being asked of the Boulder City Council regarding an “ Impeachment Resolution . ”
It is not an “ Impeachment Resolution . ”
To quote from the resolution :
“ BE IT RESOLVED that the Citizens of Boulder and the Boulder City Council believe that there is sufficient evidence to commence hearings in the House of Representatives that may lead to impeachment of either or both President George W. Bush and Vice President Richard B. Cheney . ”
In other words , the resolution simply urges that the House of Representatives perform its constitutional duty to investigate allegations of violations of our Constitution .
Boulder is hardly unique in this .
More than 90 other cities ranging from Detroit and Cambridge to Chapel Hill , N.C. , and Brattleboro , Vt. , have taken action , many much stronger than what we ’re asking .
National public opinion surveys find that more than half of American voters believe that both Bush and Cheney have committed serious crimes against the Constitution .
This is not just a liberal sentiment .
Among others , Bruce Fein , a constitutional scholar who served as associate deputy attorney general under President Ronald Reagan , insists that the concerns are serious enough to be investigated .
We have been asked why bother when Bush and Cheney will be out of office soon .
Every future president could , and probably will , use and expand on the powers usurped by this administration .
If the rule of law , truth telling , openness , and the Bill of Rights do n’t count for Bush and Cheney , will those ideals be more sacred to Obama , Clinton or McCain ?
Will it be legitimate for future presidents to redefine terms like “ torture ? ”
Will it be okay to pull out fingernails or gouge out eye balls ?
Will it be okay to use signing statements to change laws that Congress has just passed ?
Bush has done so nearly 1,000 times , some with serious consequences .
Other presidents have used signing statements to clarify language , but not to change the intent of the law .
To those who say we should get over it and move on , we ask you to consider the following : Could our children be falsely accused and not have the right of habeas corpus ( the right to face their accusers and know the charges ) ?
Or could they be disappeared as was done by Pinochet in Chile ?
Will they have the protections given us in the Bill of Rights and in the Constitution ?
Could they be arbitrarily defined as “ enemy combatants ” or “ terrorists ” with no legal rights , per Bush ’s presidential directives ?
Who wins the next election is of minor importance in comparison to the question of whether future administrations are bound to operate under the rule of law and to do so openly in full compliance with the Constitution .
We need to establish , once and for all time , that we are not to be dragged into war based upon lies , that we will not tolerate torture , that we expect full compliance with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , and that we will not tolerate signing statements that change the meaning of laws .
The purpose of impeachment is to set standards for future administrations .
Even to begin impeachment hearings will serve notice that they will be held accountable .
Why Boulder City Council ?
Impeachment is a matter for citizens .
It is important because it is mentioned in the Constitution six times .
House rules make it clear that the House will accept petitions from local governments .
Court cases point to the same conclusion .
Our City Council should represent Boulder citizens in matters of public importance .
In their oath of office , they promised to “ support the Constitution of the United States ” .
There was nothing in that oath that gave “ potholes ” precedence over the Constitution .
We should expect them to take serious interest in both .
Is Boulder so insular that we should not be concerned about the shredding of our Constitution and the loss of our civil rights ?
Do we really think it cannot happen here or will not affect us ?
( See Naomi Wolf ’s book , “ The End of America . ” )
Citizenship is not a spectator sport .

Five years after the start of the war in Iraq , millions of Iraqis are still lacking clean water , sanitation and health care , a report from the International Committee of the Red Cross said Monday .
" The humanitarian situation in most of the country remains among the most critical in the world , " said the report , " Iraq : No let - up in the humanitarian crisis , " from the Geneva - based agency .
The conflict has worsened the impact of previous wars and years of international sanctions that caused severe hardship in the country , it said .
The country 's 172 public hospitals — many of which are in substandard condition — provide only 30,000 of the necessary 80,000 hospital beds .
Few Iraqis can afford to pay the $ 2 to $ 7 cost of private clinics .
" The Iraqi health - care system is now in worse shape than ever .
Many lives have been lost because prompt and appropriate medical care is not available , " it said .
Iraqi government officials estimate more than 2,200 doctors and nurses have been killed and more than 250 kidnapped since 2003 .
Of the 34,000 doctors registered in 1990 , at least 20,000 have left the country .
Clean water is difficult for Iraqis to maintain and access because of population growth , increasing costs , lack of qualified staff and poor security conditions .
Chlorine supplies used to sterilize the water are limited because the chemical can be used to make bombs .
" The poor quality of much of the water is due to other factors , including illegal connections to the water supply , outdated networks of pipes that do not fully protect the water against contamination and frequent interruptions of the supply of the chemicals needed to treat and disinfect the water , " it said .
The average Iraqi , who brings home roughly $ 150 US per month , spends about $ 50 per month for water .
Violence down , but gains fragile : general
American military officials report violence has decreased in Iraq since a massive troop surge early last year .
Gen . David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , says violence rates have fallen by 60 per cent , but the gains are fragile .
Beatrice Mégevand Roggo , the ICRC ’s head of operations for the Middle East and North Africa , says security improvements are limited to certain areas of Iraq .
" Better security in some parts of Iraq must not distract attention from the continuing plight of millions of people who have essentially been left to their own devices , " said Roggo .
" Among them are displaced and refugee families , and those who have returned to their homes , children , elderly people , disabled people , households headed by women and families of detainees . "
LONDON ( MarketWatch ) -- BP and Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday both posted sharply higher quarterly earnings , handily surpassing most estimates as a nearly 70 % rise in crude prices helped offset virtually flat oil production and skyrocketing costs .
The earnings bump in Europe sets the stage for profit reports from peers Exxon Mobil XOM , - 2.91 % and Chevron CVX , - 2.74 % later this week .
In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange , shares of BP and Shell both rose more than 4 % .
Other major oil shares edged higher as the Amex Oil Index XOI , - 2.53 % rose fractionally .
BP BP , - 2.80 % ( BP ) said its first - quarter earnings rose to $ 7.62 billion from $ 4.66 billion .
Adjusting for the impact of energy - price changes on unsold inventory and other charges , BP would have earned $ 6.49 billion , trumping analyst estimates by over $ 1 billion .
At Royal Dutch Shell , RDS.A , - 1.68 % ( RDS.A ) net profit rose to $ 9.08 billion from $ 7.28 billion .
Adjusted for the impact of energy - price changes on unsold inventory and $ 77 million in charges , Shell said it would have earned $ 7.7 billion , up 5 % from a year earlier and above the $ 6.77 billion that analysts had forecast .
For both companies , production growth stalled .
It was essentially unchanged for BP at 3.91 million barrels of oil equivalent a day , while Shell saw only a 1 % rise to 3.44 million barrels .
But BP sold its oil and gas for 52 % more than it did in the year - earlier period , as Shell received 66 % more .
That led BP 's exploration - and - production arm to earn $ 10.1 billion , up 60 % , and Shell 's E&P arm to earn $ 5.14 billion , up 52 % .
" The consensus thrashing first - quarter results , clearly aided by high oil and gas prices , have nevertheless shown that ( BP's ) turnaround is well advanced , " said Richard Griffith , an analyst at Evolution Securities .
Griffith was similarly effusive about Shell , calling their results " stellar . "
Analysts said BP 's refining performance was n't as bad as forecast , and Shell 's gas sales in Europe were helped by a cold winter .
Both BP and Shell have put in a strong month 's performance on the back of rising oil prices that traded near $ 120 a barrel .
Shell CFO
Peter Voser repeated the company 's claim that oil prices are n't justified by fundamentals but said oil and gas prices will rise from here .
Oil also a cost
But oil also is a cost for these companies as they refine oil into gasoline and jet fuel .
Excluding a gain from contributing its Toledo refinery into a venture with Husky Energy , and BP 's refining and marketing arm reported a 29 % profit fall .
At Shell , the profit fall in its oil products division excluding charges was 20 % .
In other divisions , Shell 's gas and power unit reported an 18 % profit rise , helped both by strong liquefied natural gas prices and increased LNG volumes , and it doubled its profit in its oil sands division to $ 249 million despite lower volumes and higher costs .
BP upped its dividend by 31 % and Shell increased its dividend by 11 % .

Children 's campaigners today welcomed a recommendation by the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) to ban six artificial food colourings .
The board of the FSA said UK manufacturers should voluntarily remove the additives from their products by 2009 and also called on the EU to take action .
The FSA wants the E numbers to be removed from food products because of an " accumulating body of evidence " that they are associated with child hyperactivity .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At a meeting in London , the board agreed that the EU should phase out the colourings but said UK manufacturers should voluntarily remove them in the meantime .
The colourings involved are sunset yellow ( E110 ) , quinoline yellow ( E104 ) , carmoisine ( E122 ) , allura red ( E129 ) , tartrazine ( E102 ) and ponceau 4R ( E124 ) .
UK ministers will now consider the recommendation but the final decision will be made at EU level .
The board 's chairwoman , Dame Deirdre Hutton , concluded : " If one puts consumers first , which is our duty , we must recognise that these colours are not necessary and it would be sensible to have them removed from all foods . "
In a study for the FSA , researchers at Southampton University looked at the effect of food colouring on behaviour .
Professor Jim Stevenson , who carried out the research , said he believed the effect of the additives posed a threat to psychological health .
More research is to be carried out on the preservative sodium benzoate used in many fizzy drinks .
In a paper to the board , officials said discussions with British companies suggested they would be able to introduce satisfactory alternative ingredients by the end of this year .
However , they said some products where alternatives had been difficult to find , such as canned and mushy peas , Battenberg and angel cakes , Turkish delight and tinned strawberries , " might be lost to the market temporarily or even permanently " .
The paper said some consumers would be disappointed by changes in the colour of their food but many others would be content that action had been taken to protect them .
The Children 's Food Campaign , which called on the FSA to ban additives linked to hyperactivity in children , welcomed the recommendation .
Spokesman Richard Watts said : " This decision is good news for children and parents , who have known for many years that these additives affect children 's behaviour .
" The FSA had little choice other than to take this step as soon as they received scientific evidence that these additives were about as harmful to children as leaded petrol . "
Anna Glayzer , of the Food Commission 's Action on Additives campaign , said it would be urging the removal of the colourings from medicines such as cold and flu remedies , and intended to contact the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency on the issue .
She said : " We are delighted that the FSA has put its duty to the consumer first in its decision to recommend an EU ban .
" We will be keeping a close eye on the industry to see what effect the voluntary ban has .
We will also continue to lobby the European Commission on this issue .
" The onus is now on the European Commission to follow the example of the FSA and act for benefit of the consumer .
The colours are totally unnecessary and a risk to children 's health .
There is no public benefit whatsoever in allowing their continued use . "
The Food and Drink Federation said the agency 's action was " bizarre " and might be unworkable .
Spokesman Julian Hunt said British manufacturers were already removing such colourings .
He said : " UK food and drink manufacturers are already taking these colours out of products on supermarket shelves , so we are surprised the FSA board feels it is an appropriate use of their powers to call for a voluntary ban .
" The FSA proposal puts the UK at odds with the rest of Europe , where decisions about the safety of additives are made .
Such a ban could not apply to imports from Europe since the UK would be the only country to ban these colours , which raises questions about how workable it really is . "
In the wake of the Southampton University research , published in September , the FSA advised that cutting the six colourings from the diet of hyperactive children might improve behaviour .
Advice to parents on the issue will now be strengthened , although it will make clear that colourings are not the only or main cause of hyperactivity in children .
In March , Europe 's food safety watchdog dismissed the study as too inconclusive to justify updating advice for parents .
The European Food Safety Authority said the results " provided limited evidence that the mixtures of additives tested had a small effect on the activity and function of some children " .
The FSA said the Southampton study was of " the highest scientific quality " .

Few residents of Park Slope , Brooklyn are probably aware that they share their neighborhood with a firearms company that has operated in the borough for almost a century .
The Henry Repeating Arms Co. is garnering some unwelcome attention this week , however , after it was revealed that the company shipped four of its lever - action rifles with live rounds inside .
The company produces around 100,000 rifles annually .
The incident where loaded weapons were shipped has to do with the industry standard practice of test firing weapons before they are distributed .
In this particular case , loaded weapons were shipped after they were loaded but before they were test fired .
Anthony Imperato , who is the current president of the family - owned business attributed the four loaded weapons to an oversight of its quality control procedures , which have been adjusted .
Another casualty of the heated property market in NYC , Henry Repeating Arms is in the process of leaving its home in Brooklyn for Bayonne , NJ .
Henry Repeating Arms has a factory on 8th St. off of 3rd Ave. that manufactures long guns whose design dates back to one that was patented in 1860 and played a pivotal role in the Civil War .
The quick re-loading lever action of the rifle allowed a much greater rate of fire over traditional muzzle loading guns .
Although many of its guns are engraved " Brooklyn , USA , " the company generally tries to keep a low profile in NYC .
On a Lot of occasions we proceed out into the road to Execute any Form of Action , the disadvantage is that when we move out and only step onto the street we believe hot due to the climate change we are currently facing .

British Airways chief executive , Willie Walsh , refused to resign today as the chaos at Heathrow 's Terminal 5 threatened to spill over into the weekend .
The turmoil could even threaten the flag - carrier 's transfer of operations from Terminal 4 by the scheduled date of April 30 .
But , as full details of the opening - day disaster emerge , it is becoming clear that the nation 's flag - carrier must bear the brunt of the blame for the T5 debacle .
According to informed sources , a catalogue of errors led by serious problems with BA 's new baggage sorting regime caused the entire system to collapse within hours .
Things went wrong yesterday almost immediately .
The first baggage shift , starting at 4.30 am , was delayed by a lack of staff spaces in a specially - designated car park .
Baggage handlers arrived late at the terminal 's staff security checkpoint after being forced to park elsewhere .
By this point , the first flight from Hong Kong was arriving and BA was already playing catch - up .
According to staff who arrived late at T5 after the car park saga , only one of the airport 's employee security checkpoints was operating and at one point 60 people were queuing to get through .
The bottleneck , BAA 's responsibility , was exacerbated by airport and airline staff who arrived early in order to " rubberneck " and look around the new terminal .
Once into the baggage sorting area , some staff were unable to log on to the computer system , which caused three flights to " cut and run " and fly off without bags - creating the first backlog of the day .
Simultaneously BA baggage teams struggled immediately with an automated system that , via handheld devices , told them which flight to unload and which flight to put bags onto .
According to staff , the devices told handlers to sort bags for flights that were already cancelled .
This meant they turned up to load flights that were not there while , in other parts of the sorting area , bags piled up unattended .
Without managers on the ground to allocate work , there appeared to be a communication breakdown between handlers and their supervisors in the BA control centre elsewhere in the terminal .
By midday , 20 flights were cancelled as handlers frantically tried to reduce T5 's inaugural baggage mountain .
Throughout early morning and afternoon , two overarching factors contributed to the delays .
According to industry sources , some baggage teams were disorientated despite months of training and were late turning up at loading areas , which are spaced around the cavernous baggage area .
Plus , there was a shortage of special storage bins that all bags must be put in before going onto planes - a new requirement for T5 .
By 4 pm , with too many bags , too few storage bins , an already clogged conveyor belt system and handling staff under severe pressure , all it took was a wave of new luggage to choke the system to a standstill .
At 4 pm a wave of passengers came to Terminal 5's departure hall and checked - in bags that were delivered by a lift system to the main conveyor belt area on the ground floor .
The conveyor belt system could not physically function within one hour and ground to a halt as bags jammed the entire handling network .
Minutes later BA suspended all baggage check - in .
It was , according to one observer , " literally a case of the baggage computers saying ' No " ' .
Whipping therapy cures depression and suicide crises
The effect is astounding : a patient starts seeing only bright colors in the surrounding world
Source : REX / Shutterstock
Russian scientists from the city of Novosibirsk , Siberia , made a sensational report at the international conference devoted to new methods of treatment and rehabilitation in narcology .
The report was called “ Methods of painful impact to treat addictive behavior . ”
Siberian scientists believe that addiction to alcohol and narcotics , as well as depression , suicidal thoughts and psychosomatic diseases occur when an individual loses his or her interest in life .
The absence of the will to live is caused with decreasing production of endorphins - the substance , which is known as the hormone of happiness .
If a depressed individual receives a physical punishment , whipping that is , it will stir up endorphin receptors , activate the “ production of happiness ” and eventually remove depressive feelings .
Russian scientists recommend the following course of the whipping therapy : 30 sessions of 60 whips on the buttocks in every procedure .
A group of drug addicts volunteered to test the new method of treatment : the results can be described as good and excellent .
Doctor of Biological Sciences , Sergei Speransky , is a very well known figure in Novosibirsk .
The doctor became one of the authors of the shocking whipping therapy .
The professor used the self - flagellation method to cure his own depression ; he also recovered from two heart attacks with the help of physical tortures too .
” The whipping therapy becomes much more efficient when a patients receives the punishment from a person of the opposite sex .
The effect is astounding : the patient starts seeing only bright colors in the surrounding world , the heartache disappears , although it will take a certain time for the buttocks to heal , of course , ” Sergei Speransky told the Izvestia newspaper .
The whipping therapy has not become a new discovery in the history of medicine .
Tibetan monks widely used it for medical purposes too .
Soviet specialists used a special method of torturing therapy at mental hospitals .
They made injections of brimstone and peach oil mixture to inspire mentally unbalanced patience with a will to live .
A patient would suffer from horrible pain in the body after such an injection , but he or she would change their attitude to life for the better afterwards .
” People might probably think of me as a masochist , ” Dr. Speransky said .
“ But I can assure you that I am not a classic masochist at all , ” he added .
The revolutionary method may take the Russian healthcare to a whole new level .
The method is cheap and highly efficient , as its authors assure .
Why not using something more efficient , a rack , for example ?
Jonathan Chait passes along an interesting anecdote about the personalities inside the Oval Office .
Dick Armey , the House Republican majority leader when Bush took office ( and no more a shrinking violet than DeLay ) , told me a story that captures the exquisite pettiness of most members of Congress and the arrogance that made Bush and Rove so inept at handling them .
" For all the years he was president , " Armey told me , " Bill Clinton and I had a little thing we'd do where every time I went to the White House , I would take the little name tag they give you and pass it to the president , who , without saying a word , would sign and date it .
Bill Clinton and I did n't like each other .
He said I was his least - favorite member of Congress .
But he knew that when I left his office , the first schoolkid I came across would be given that card , and some kid who had come to Washington with his mama would go home with the president 's autograph .
I think Clinton thought it was a nice thing to do for some kid , and he was happy to do it . "
Armey said that when he went to his first meeting in the White House with President Bush , he explained the tradition with Clinton and asked the president if he would care to continue it .
" Bush refused to sign the card .
Rove , who was sitting across the table , said , ' It would probably wind up on eBay , ' " Armey continued .
A security researcher on his way this week to speak at a conference about mobile phone security was stopped by British authorities at Heathrow Airport and questioned before being relieved of his Nokia phone , SIM card and USRP ( Universal Software Radio Peripheral ) .
The researcher was on his way to Dubai to deliver a talk at the Hack - in - the - Box security conference about cracking GSM encryption to intercept mobile phone calls and text messages and track the location of users using less than $ 1,000 in equipment .
The researcher described the airport incident in an anonymous blog post .
He writes that the inspectors had done their homework and already knew who he was , where he lived , who he worked for and what day he was speaking at the conference .
He speculates that the government may have wanted to make sure he was n't exporting any cryptanalytic device but notes that if this were the case it was odd that investigators did n't try to keep either his laptop or his paperwork , which would have been the most likely place to find any information he was carrying about cracking GSM encryption .
They were also not interested in my 160 GB harddrive which would have been the obvious place for storing the rainbow tables .
Neither were they interested in the high performance FPGA chip .
Instead they took all equipment that could have been used for demonstrating that GSM signals can be received with publicly available hardware for 700 USD .
It does not appear that they were after cryptanalytic information .
I received a yellow paper about my detained goods .
They left the field blank that reads
" The goods specified below are detained for the following reason : " .
What reason ?
They also crossed out the field " Agent " of the officer who was in charge of the operation .
He notes that the inspectors were perplexed by his USRP .
They said they do not know what the USRP is and that I can not take it until they have checked it in the lab .
This can take 14 days ( 1/2 month ) .
So be it .
They have it for 14 days .
Guys , enjoy the device !
It 's fun playing around with it !
Although the blogger does n't identify himself , he notes that he gave a talk about cracking GSM encryption at the Black Hat security conference held earlier this year in Washington , D.C .
David Hulton from Pico Computing in Seattle and someone identified only as " Steve " delivered a talk at Black Hat on cracking GSM and building a scanner to intercept and decipher GSM signals .
A news article about the talk identifies Steve as Steve Muller of the UK - based company CellCrypt .
Hulton is listed as giving the same talk in Dubai with someone using the hacker handle " Skyper . "
Hulton and Muller have not responded to e-mails I sent them .
Presumably they 're both still in Dubai at the conference .
They ended their talk at Black Hat saying , " Receiving , transmitting and cracking GSM will become cheaper and easier .
It will become easier to mount an attack against the mobile network infrastructure .
We are expecting a rise in unlawful interception , data / identity theft and tracking the location of mobile phone users . "
The researchers maintain a Wiki describing their work .

Texas Congressman Ron Paul today released a statement urging public support for a House Bill advocating the government stay out of the medical marijuana business and allow state sanctioned clinics the freedom to dispense pot without fear of being raided .
Paul has introduced the “ Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act ” , H.R. 5842 , which would bar the Federal Government from intervening in doctor / patient relationships that violate no state law .
This , by the way , is the second legislation co-sponsored by Congressman Paul dealing with the cannabis plant .
More on that later .
As a physician , Paul states his position that doctors and patients should make health care decisions , not politicians or federal agents .
His legislation would call off the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) “ dogs ” that regularly hassle state - sanctioned clinics and their patients .
He cited the plight of K.K. Forss , a resident of Minnesota , who suffers pain from a ruptured disc in his neck .
Forss is unable to work or attend church due to the debilitating pain .
$ 18,000 a year was paid by Medicare each year on various medications that were useless .
Then , Forss took a chance and tried marijuana , illegal in his state , and found it helped him regain 38 pounds he had lost , calmed muscle spasms and helped him sleep .
If he could continue using cannabis for his pain , Forss believes , according to Rep .
Paul , that he’d be able to work occasionally and attend some church services .
The Congressman cites a study by Scientists at the University of Calfornia at Davis that says cannabis demonstrates significant relief of neuropathic pain .
Twelve states have passed legislation allowing marijuana , under certain conditions , according to Paul , but those clinics , physicians and patients are still under fire from the Drug Enforcement Administration .
In summary , . the Congressman says ,
“ The bottom line is that K.K. Forss should be treated as a free American .
Mr. Forss is one of many who would like to use marijuana medicinally because it helps him .
Politicians and bureaucrats have no right to interfere ” .
INDUSTRIAL HEMP
Congressman Paul is also co-sponsor of H.R. 1009 , calling for the legalization of industrial hemp as an agricultural product .
Hopefully , these two bills will begin to chip away at the DEA and it ’s stranglehold on the issue of industrial hemp and medical marijuana .
Two North Dakota farmers have taken their case to a U.S. Court of Appeals Court in an effort to force the DEA into a “ hands off ” position when it comes to industrial hemp cultivation .
In case you have n’t heard , industrial hemp is a lousy smoke , resulting in a bad headache and no high .
Of course , this action will not lead to legalizing recreational marijuana , but it will sort out the differences , allow the cultivation of an amazingly diverse agricultural product and promise medical relief for those who would benefit from marijuana .
But right now , the Feds have been striking out at state - sanctioned marijuana clinics , stating in most part that it ’s just another way to dispense illegal drugs .
Hats off to Congressman Paul , and North Dakota State Representative David Monson and Wayne Hauge , both farmers , who are trying desperately to put the DEA ’s feet to the fire .

Nicholas Cage Tired of Acting
Sounds like another Hollywood actor is on the brink of disconnect .
recently said " Some movie stars look like they are having a ball , but I am tired of it .
It has made me reclusive .
That is an increasingly gnawing feeling at my body . "
Cage feels like he makes the audience mad and that if you like him in one certain type of movie , you will hate watching him in any other .
This seems to be as good of time as any to retire or change careers .
The actor is married to Alice Kim and they have a 2 year old son .
The three have set up residence at an English castle .
Get out now Nicholas , before your child grows up with a bitter , nasty and unappreciative father .
Python best practices

Version 1.30 , Jun 16 2011
Sometimes even good programmers at their first tries of Python use less than optimal solutions and language constructs .
In the years Python has accumulated few redundancies and few warts ( and some of them will be removed with Python 3.0 .
This article refers to CPython V.2.5 , it 's not about Python 2.6 yet , or about Jthon , or PyPy or IronPython , that may have subtle differences ) , but it 's a generally clean language still , so with a page like this you can avoid the most common ones .
This page hopes to be really simple and short enough , you can find explanations online elsewhere .
For some things I may be wrong , but this page comes from some experience , so when you do n't agree with me , I suggest you to go look for the truth inside many newsgroups and Web pages , just do n't assume you are right .
If you find I am wrong , or you have questions or comments my email address can be found in my Home Page , I 'll glady improve this page and learn from my mistakes .

Teachers at the school said that this year , they had noticed a better attitude among the students , which they attributed to the incentive program .
One recent day , fourth graders talked eagerly about the computer games they have been playing to get ready for this week ’s state math exam .
During the school ’s recent winter break , dozens of students showed up for extra tutoring to prepare .
“ My teacher told me to study more , so I study , ” said Jazmin , who had already taken eight standardized exams this school year .
“ I did multiplication tables .
I learned to divide . ”
When asked why she took so many tests , Jazmin replied earnestly , “ To show them we have education and we learn stuff from education and the tests . ”
The students spoke excitedly about their plans for the money .
Several boys said they were saving for video games .
Abigail said she would use it to pay for “ a car , a house and college , ” apparently unaware that the roughly $ 100 she ’s earned this school year might not stretch that far .
Another little girl said she would use the money simply for food .
When asked to elaborate , she answered quietly , “ Spaghetti . ”
Changing the attitudes of seventh graders seems to be more complicated .
At J.H.S. 123 in the Bronx , for example , a seventh - grade English class was asked one morning if there were too many standardized tests .
Every hand in the room shot up to answer with a defiant yes .
But at the same time , the students all agreed that receiving money for doing well on a test was a good idea , saying it made school more exciting , and made doing well more socially acceptable .
“ This is the hardest grade to pass , ” said Adonis Flores , a 13 - year - old who has struggled in his classes at times .
“ This motivates us better .
Everybody wants some money , and nobody wants to get left behind . ”
Would it be better to get the money as college scholarships ?
Shouts of “ No way ! ” echoed through the room .
“ We might not all go to college , ” one student protested .

So is doing well in school cool ?
A few hands slowly inched up .
But when their principal , Ms. Connelly , asked what could be done to make being the A - plus student seem as important as being the star basketball player , she was met with silence .
Skeptics who argue that global warming is caused by cosmic rays rather than man -made greenhouse gases have been dealt another blow .
Some who question the human - induced global warming scenario argue that changes in the intensity of these rays , which are caused by variations in solar activity , affect the cloud cover of the Earth , allowing heat from the sun to build up , and accounting for the rise of global temperatures in recent years .
But a new study detailed in the Institute of Physics ’ journal , Environmental Research Letters , finds no link between the incoming cosmic rays and global cloud cover .
The research was led by Terry Sloan of Lancaster University in the UK and Arnold Wolfendale of Durham University , also in the UK .
The sun ’s rays are of course the key drivers of Earth ’s climate as they are the main source of our planet ’s energy .
However , some skeptics have argued that changes in solar activity are responsible for the current period of warming .
They argue that the sun 's magnetic fields cause fluctuations in the intensity of cosmic rays , which they contend can ionize gases in Earth ’s atmosphere , creating small particles that collect water to form low - level clouds .
These clouds , in turn , scatter incoming light , causing a cooling effect .
Among the skeptics , a small group of scientists say it is a decrease in cosmic rays that has decreased the amount of low - level clouds , causing the current phase of warming .
A recent British television special , " The Great Global Warming Swindle , " which aimed to debunk current scientific understanding of the causes of global warming , named this as the main cause of Earth ’s rising temperatures .
But the new study found no significant link between the intensity of cosmic rays hitting the Earth and low - level cloudiness .
Its findings " suggest that it is fairly unlikely that [ cosmic rays ] have any discernable effect on the cloudiness , " said Rasmus Benestad of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute , who was not involved with the study .
" If the effect were important , then we would have seen it , " Benestad told LiveScience .
" [ Cosmic rays ] cannot account for the present warming trend . "
Benestad also pointed out that no long - term trend in cosmic ray intensity that corresponds with the decades - long rise in global temperatures has been detected , which is a bigger stumbling block for those who support cosmic rays as the source of global warming .
Security vendors like VeriSign consider a new technology called EV SSL an important measure against phishing attacks .
But two recent items suggest it will do little to stop skilled conmen from spoofing trusted websites .
Exhibit A was this post from network services company Netcraft , which documents a recently discovered cross-site scripting error on the popular open source website SourceForge .
The gaping hole allowed unauthorized data to be injected into the website , opening up a new browser window .
It just so happens that SourceForge is one of the 5,000 or so websites using EV SSL , which is short for Extended Verification Secure Sockets Layer .
It works just like plain - vanilla SSL except that it requires website operators to take additional steps to verify their identity before receiving an electronic certificate .
Sites that use the technology show up in green in a browser 's address bar .
They 're designed to give users additional confidence that the site is not an impostor under the control of bad guys .
And yet , as the SourceForge goof made clear , there 's no guarantee at all that sites showing up green are n't under the control of unauthorized parties .
A cross-site scripting error on the right site can prove a bonanza to phishers because it allows them to inject rogue content into a trusted site - for instance a dialog box that instructs the visitor to enter his login credentials .
The concern is the green bar will cause end users to drop their guard by giving them a false sense of security .
Exhibit B came in the form of a recently released survey by NetBenefit that finds 70 per cent of UK online shoppers do n't understand what a green browser bar is anyway .
Not that everyone is convinced EV SSL is a waste .
According to this article from Network World , the lack of support for EV SSL is one reason PayPal is recommending its users steer clear of Apple 's Safari browser .
It reports that people using EV SSL are more likely to actually log in to PayPal than those who do n't , presumably because they have greater confidence .
Still , it 's not clear exactly what problem EV SSL is supposed to solve .
While it 's theoretically possible for phishing sites to use SSL , reports of SSL - protected sites spoofing PayPal or other sensitive websites are rare , if not nonexistent .
We think we 'll wait out the the rush to acquire extended certificates for the time being . ®

Thank god , only Hillary is [ was ] the only other ' real ' opponent in the running for the Democrats , otherwise , if ' Tuvok ' had tossed his hat in , too ( I do n't think Tuvok ever wore a hat ) , but , I , for one , would be hard pressed to know the person I was really voting for .
Obama ?

Damn !
Barack and Tuvok , they are so much alike , appearance - wise , almost in a ' shape - shifting ' way .
But of course , that is not the case , this is not fiction , this is reality .
Barack and Hillary are vastly different .
True ?
One an actor and musician and once - upon - a - time alien ( on TV ) , one a once - upon - a - time lawyer and politican , and the other ... also , a once - upon - a- time lawyer and politican .
No shape shifting there .
I hope the comparisions above wo n't change your vote .
I 'm pretty certain Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are not aliens .

A few of you may remember our October 2006 post regarding the multiple ways of making money on the internet .
We ’ve recently come across several more ways to make a little coin online .
We ’ve used the same rules as qualifiers that I will recap here :
What ’s NOT included : Taking Surveys , Get Paid to Surf the Internet , MLM , Programs with a ton of negative user experiences ( based on researching forums , googling them , etc. ) , Contest Sites , “ Buy my DVD , CD , Audiobook ” , etc .
What IS included :
Things you can use to legitimately make money online .
Everything from product reviews to writing code , creating videos .
So with that , here we go :
ReviewMe –
In order to participate , you must have a blog and it has to be active .
Companies go to ReviewMe to advertise a product and ReviewMe asks their members to write a review of the product in exchange for cash .
In regards to ethics , ReviewMe mandates that the blogger / site owner indicate that they are being compensated to write the review AND the advertiser cannot insist on a positive review .
This is the opposite of other similar services that do n’t mandate trustworthy behavior .
Ultimately the goal is to spread the word honestly .
You can expect to earn $ 20 – $ 200 per review that you write .
Vizu – I really like the sound of this one and may try it on Dumb Little Man .
Instead of putting ads on your site , you insert polls .
You get paid based on the CPM ( cost per thousand ) that you set .
The better positioning on your site , the better you will do .
The nice part of this is that everything is embedded into your site allowing visitors to participate without leaving .
That is key .
PS – I learned about this site today from Digital Inspiration .
Clickbooth – Clickbooth is a site that blog owners or site owners can join to place Cost Per Action ads on their site .
It has a good base of advertisers and is similar to Commission Junction or Linkshare .
Freelancer.com :
This is well known freelancing website .
Take on a project , get it done and get paid .
Good Luck .

It was announced this evening by the Pennsylvania Department of State that voter registration for Tuesday ’s primary has set a new record with 8,328,123 people registered to vote .
This number is only 38,540 voters behind the all time record which was set during the 2004 general election campaign .
“ It is unprecedented for a primary election in Pennsylvania , and it is very exciting to see so many people want to participate in the electoral process , ” Secretary of the Commonwealth Pedro A. Cortes said .
Since January of this year , 218,923 new voters have registered .
Of these , 152,775 registered Democratic and 40,195 registered Republican .
There has also been a large group of registered voters who switched their affiliation to the Democratic Party , 164,026 registered voters changed their affiliation to Democratic and 14,887 changed to Republican .

It is impossible to tell where these voters are coming from because the form does not require voters to specify what party they are leaving .
“ Whether for the first time as a new voter , or for the first time with a different party , these numbers show a growing interest in participating in the April 22 primary election , ” Cortes said .
By age group the highest number of registered voters is 45 - 54 .
The lowest group is 18 - 24 .
This demographic breakdown is one of the key reasons why Hillary Clinton is favored to win here on Tuesday .
It will be interesting to see what kind of impact these 200,000 + new voters will have on the general election in the fall .
Pennsylvania is a state that has voted Democratic in the last four presidential elections .
This is a trend that I expect will continue in the fall .

Following the law is for chumps , the banks might say .
When industry complains about the dreaded class action lawsuits ( which have not yet been raised ) they always skip around situations like this , where they are in violation of the law but do n’t really care .
They collection millions , perhaps even billions and it ’s not as though they ’re going to cut their own bonus plans when there are millions of people out there who will pony up extra fees without even knowing about it .
During the GOP Congress and Bush years , it ’s not as though anyone ever asked big business to follow the rule of law or think about consumers .
It would be great if Democrats in Congress can make progress on this issue but realistically , the banks are in one of their worst down turns in decades and are looking for every cent under every stone so it would be surprising to see them fall in line just by asking .
Is it really so difficult for business to follow the laws they helped write in the first place ?
If regulators go too far ( which I doubt they would , even if they wanted to ) it will all come back to industry stonewalling previous attempts to be reasonable .
On a quiet Sunday morning in June , as worshippers settled into the pews at Allen Baptist Church in southwestern Michigan , Pastor Jason Burrick grabbed his cellphone and dialed 911 .
When a dispatcher answered , the preacher said a former congregant was in the sanctuary .
" And we need to , um , have her out A.S.A.P . "
Half an hour later , 71 - year - old Karolyn Caskey , a church member for nearly 50 years who had taught Sunday school and regularly donated 10 % of her pension , was led out by a state trooper and a county sheriff 's officer .
One held her purse and Bible .
The other put her in handcuffs .
( Listen to the 911 call )
The charge was trespassing , but Mrs. Caskey 's real offense , in her pastor 's view , was spiritual .
Several months earlier , when she had questioned his authority , he 'd charged her with spreading " a spirit of cancer and discord " and expelled her from the congregation .
" I 've been shunned , " she says .
Her story reflects a growing movement among some conservative Protestant pastors to bring back church discipline , an ancient practice in which suspected sinners are privately confronted and then publicly castigated and excommunicated if they refuse to repent .
While many Christians find such practices outdated , pastors in large and small churches across the country are expelling members for offenses ranging from adultery and theft to gossiping , skipping service and criticizing church leaders .
The revival is part of a broader movement to restore churches to their traditional role as moral enforcers , Christian leaders say .
Some say that contemporary churches have grown soft on sinners , citing the rise of suburban megachurches where pastors preach self - affirming messages rather than focusing on sin and redemption .
Others point to a passage in the gospel of Matthew that says unrepentant sinners must be shunned .
Pakistan 's new leaders tell US :
We are no longer your killing field
The Bush administration is scrambling to engage with Pakistan 's new rulers as power flows from its strong ally , President Pervez Musharraf , to a powerful civilian government buoyed by anti-American sentiment .
Top diplomats John Negroponte and Richard Boucher travelled to a mountain fortress near the Afghan border yesterday as part of a hastily announced visit that has received a tepid reception .
On Tuesday , senior coalition partner Nawaz Sharif gave the visiting Americans a public scolding for using Pakistan as a " killing field " and relying too much on Musharraf .
Yesterday the new prime minister , Yousaf Raza Gilani , said he warned President George Bush in a phone conversation that he would prioritise talking as well as shooting in the battle against Islamist extremism .
" He said that a comprehensive approach is required in this regard , specially combining a political approach with development , " a statement said .
But Gilani also reassured Bush that Pakistan would " continue to fight against terrorism " , it said .
Since 2001 American officials have treasured their close relationship with Musharraf because he offered a " one- stop shop " for cooperation in hunting al - Qaida fugitives hiding in Pakistan .
But since the crushing electoral defeat of Musharraf 's party last month , and talk that the new parliament may hobble the president 's powers , that equation has changed .
Now the US finds itself dealing with politicians it previously spurned .
The body language between Negroponte and Sharif during their meeting on Tuesday spoke volumes : the Pakistani greeted the American with a starched handshake , and sat at a distance .
In blunt remarks afterwards , Sharif said he told Negroponte that Pakistan was no longer a one - man show .
" Since 9/11 , all decisions were taken by one man , " he said .
" Now we have a sovereign parliament and everything will be debated in the parliament . "
It was " unacceptable that while giving peace to the world we make our own country a killing field , " Sharif said , echoing widespread public anger at US - funded military operations in the tribal belt .
" If America wants to see itself clean of terrorism , we also want our villages and towns not to be bombed , " he said .
US officials have long paid tribute to the virtues of democracy in Pakistan .
But , as happened in the Palestinian Authority after the 2006 Hamas victory , policymakers are racing to catch up with the consequences of a result that challenges American priorities .
The US has long been suspicious of Sharif , whom it views as sympathetic to religious parties .
Unlike Benazir Bhutto , whose return from exile was negotiated through the US , Sharif came under the protection of Saudi Arabia .
But now Sharif 's party , which performed well in the poll , is an integral part of the new government .
Yesterday Negroponte and Boucher travelled to the Khyber Pass in North - West Frontier Province , the centre of a growing insurgency .
They met with the commander of the Frontier Corps , a poorly equipped paramilitary force that the US has offered to upgrade .
The US has earmarked $ 750 m ( £ 324 m ) for a five - year development programme in tribal areas .
At least 22 military instructors are due to start training the corps this year .
The timing of the American visit - before the new cabinet is announced - has offended Pakistanis .
" It flies in the face of normal protocol at a time when public opinion is rife that they are making a last ditch effort to save Musharraf , " said Talat Hussain , a prominent journalist .
It is unclear how Pakistan 's foreign policy will be formulated in future .
Musharraf 's power may have been cut but the strong army is lurking in the shadows , and the coalition is wrangling over cabinet posts , including that of foreign minister .
Gilani must manage other tensions , particularly over whether to reinstate Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , the deposed chief justice who was freed from house arrest on Monday .
Chaudhry has become a folk hero but is viewed with suspicion by Gilani's Pakistan People 's party .

When Melanie Allen and her husband Rob , a quantity surveyor , adopted a five - year - old called Alex , they could n't believe their good fortune .
Heartbreakingly beautiful , as well as affectionate , she seemed to be a dream child .
But as the months passed , Melanie and Rob , both now 44 , began to see a very different side of their ' perfect ' daughter - and found themselves sucked into a nightmare in which they faced losing everything ...
Jumping out of the car , I could just make out the small , lone figure waiting at the front door .
My heart began to pound .
She was so beautiful - and she was smiling .
Her eyes seemed to have a magnetic pull , and as each step drew me closer , they grew larger .
The photo from the adoption agency had not done those eyes justice .
Nor had it captured the silken gloss of her fair hair , which hung to her waist .
I was in love already .
Her foster father urged her forward .
" Do you know who these nice people are ? " he asked .
" It 's my new Mummy and Daddy , " Alex answered - so quietly that I had to replay the words in my head to make sure I 'd heard them right .
With a thrill , I realised I had .
And as I looked down at my new daughter , her eyes were brimming with a pleasure that mirrored my own .
Scroll down for more ...
Adorable on the outside : But Melanie Allen and her husband Rob discovered their adoptive daughter Alex was ruthless and manipulative ( picture posed by model )
I 'd always dreamt of rescuing " unwanted " children .
A year after our wedding , Rob and I conceived our son Daniel naturally , but we seemed unable to have a second child .
After 18 months of trying , we decided to pursue adoption instead .
It had taken four years of interminable form - filling and interviews to be accepted onto the adoption register but I knew that day in August 1997 that we'd found the little girl who was to complete our family .
Snuggling Alex under her Disney duvet in our four - bedroom semi in the Midlands that night , we vowed we 'd love her for ever .
Certainly , if anyone deserved love and security , it was Alex .
Her mother , Michelle , was an alcoholic and drug addict , sustaining her habit by prostitution .
Alex was 18 months old when , acting on a tip - off , social workers broke into the flat to find her 22 - year - old mother unconscious on the floor and Alex , malnourished , lying in squalor .
Alex was fostered until Michelle got clean from drugs .
But when returned to her mother 's care , Michelle 's new boyfriend , a paranoid schizophrenic , attacked Alex , hitting her under the guise of " punishing " her .
Finally , Michelle forced him out .
Alone and depressed , Michelle returned to her old habits .
One day she woke in hospital , having overdosed , to learn that she and Alex had narrowly escaped being burned to death after an attempt by Alex , aged three , to grill herself fish fingers .
Alex was made a ward of court and freed for adoption - which is how we came to meet her .
We 'd been warned by social workers that Alex had learning difficulties and her vocabulary was very limited .
It was hard to put my finger on but her behaviour started to make me feel uneasy .
However hard we tried , she seemed incapable of learning anything .
I spent hours showing her the buttons to press on the TV remote control , button her top , brush her teeth , use a knife and fork - all to no avail .
Part of me wanted to scream : we loved her dearly but it seemed we could do nothing to help her .
Alex had been with us almost a year when I first began to doubt her .
Maybe she 's faking it , I thought ; or deliberately needling me just to get attention ?
Then one day I overhead Daniel pleading with Alex to stop hurting our precious cat , Scooter .
She 'd been pulling his tail .
Looking into Alex 's big , black eyes as I gently told her off , I found nothing there .
No emotion , no anger .
But , as I stepped away , I heard her whisper to Daniel : " I hate you .
You made Mum hear . "
It chilled my blood .
Alex had been with us 19 months when I found her in the bath , very deliberately pouring water from a bath toy onto the floor .
For months I 'd been mopping up water " accidentally " sloshed out of the bath and washing towel after towel .
Alex could n't - or would n't - explain .
" Mm , err ... , " she stammered , her face crumpling under the force of my fury .
" I dunno .
I was , um , putting water , um , on the floor . "
Later that night , I poured out our despair and confusion to my friend Sophie .
I knew that Alex was just a little girl with a hideous past who wanted to be loved but I could n't help myself .
" I pace the floor sometimes thinking she 's some evil person reincarnated , intent on destroying us .
" Then I curse myself for such hateful thoughts , " I confided in Sophie .
Sophie had no solution but she made me promise to get help .
Desperate , I rang the Post - Adoption Centre , a national charity offering support , and we were referred to a counsellor .
He was convinced that Alex was betraying a desperate need to be in control in a world where once she 'd had none .
Alex had to learn that she was now in safe hands and that we were people she could trust .
It seemed like good advice and relief washed over us .
But sadly it was n't that simple .
Instead ,
Alex 's tactics intensified .
One day , when she was still six , I told her she could n't have a second lollipop before tea .
She spent the next five minutes glued to my side , mirroring my every step purely to wind me up .
Her tactics were bizarre but insidious : walking strangely , staring fixedly , tapping her feet incessantly , dressing completely inappropriately , often with clothes inside out or back to front .
Everything , in short , to make herself the centre of attention .
Friends , family and teachers were blinded by Alex 's manipulative behaviour , blaming everything on her " learning difficulties " .
At school she was the model student - bumbling but eager .
The exception was Alex 's drama teacher , who herself had an adopted child .
She 'd seen through her manipulative behaviour .
" Alex is not the self - effacing little thing she appears , " she said ominously .
" It 's the staring that first made me suspect .
My son did the same when he was angry .
" I also think she 's overplaying the helplessness .
These kids are very good at playing innocent . "
I wanted to hug the drama teacher with relief .
By now I dreaded time alone with Alex , so took a part - time job at our local university .
Still Alex dominated every waking moment , demanding constant attention .
I do n't believe Alex disliked or resented Daniel but she sensed how precious his well - being was to us .
She disturbed his homework , interrupted when his friends came to play , stared at him at mealtimes and - most annoying of all - started waking him at 5 am .
She tried his patience terribly .
We were now convinced that Alex was a very seriously damaged child .
It felt too much for us to handle alone , so in early 2000 our doctor referred us to CAMHS - Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services - a government - backed network of therapists .
" It 's her ability to control her emotions that worries us the most , " I explained to our therapist .
" If it were n't for her anger , I 'd say she was a machine .
And it 's destroying us . "
The therapist , though , seemed blinded by Alex 's charm , calling her " Little Scrumptious " .
With her , Alex was all simpering smiles , acting the shy , slow learner for all she was worth .
Desperate , I started doing my own research .
And that 's when I finally made the breakthrough - in a brochure we'd been given when we first applied to adopt .
It described a child identical to Alex - steely , controlled and staring .
Her condition had a name : Reactive Attachment Disorder ( RAD ) .
Imagine attachment as a string between infant and mother .
The infant 's needs for food , warmth and touch are answered .
Now imagine an infant like Alex , born into an environment where its carer is unable to respond due to mental health problems or drug - induced oblivion .
This infant 's string is useless , so it has no sense of belonging to anyone ; nor anyone to it .
The consequences are immense .
Fear , rage , lack of conscience ( neglected children are not taught right from wrong ) , lack of compassion or empathy .
By the time the infant is removed from its environment , it 's a broken soul .
But , as we were about to discover , RAD was only part of the problem .
Alex , now eight , also had a voice in her head - telling her what she could and could not do .
It came tumbling out one day after a couple of years when we battled to understand why Alex had refused a simple instruction to say " Thank you " .
She admitted that her " voice " had ordered her not to .
Suddenly everything clicked into place .
It was n't just her anger Alex kept hidden .
She seemingly wanted nothing because the voice demanded total secrecy , forbidding her to reveal her emotions to anyone .
Even us .
I was convinced that Alex desperately needed treatment in a hospital specialising in disturbed children .
I pleaded with her psychologist : " We 're living with a child who 's secretive beyond belief , who 's got a voice in her head , who talks of death - threatening to kill me at the drop of a hat - who 's filled with hate , who at eight years old can't even write her name and who can shut herself down like a computer . "
But Alex was such a consummate actress that no one believed us .
She mirrored the attitude of whoever was talking to her , seeming to know precisely what each person wanted to hear .
By now Rob was at the end of his tether .
" I do n't know how much I can take of this , " he whispered .
" I want my life back . "
Tense and on edge , we decided we had only one option - to get the adoption annulled .
Instead , we 'd foster Alex .
That would free her from the expectations to attach to us , and us from the expectations of making her our daughter .
And , if it got no easier , we could hand her back .
Our announcement to Alex 's social worker was like a bomb going off .
Suddenly , the authorities went into action , doing anything to prevent us annulling the adoption .
Our social worker agreed to refer Alex to a hospital specialising in children with RAD .
We were thrilled .
And then everything changed .
I 'd refused Alex a treat - an outing with my sister - because I knew she'd be so disruptive .
An hour later , I was at the kitchen sink when I heard a single clicking noise behind me .
I spun round to find Alex pointing Daniel 's red metallic spud gun at me , her eyes locked to mine .
I looked down .
A 2in nail lay on the floor , inches from my feet .
I was too stunned to speak .
I bent down , picked up the nail and held out my hand .
" It works better with potatoes , " I said .
I found Rob and recounted the incident .
" That 's it !
I want her out of the house ! " he said .
" We 've got Daniel to think about .
" I 'd never forgive myself if ... "
He could n't finish the sentence .
The next day I rang the hospital , begging for news about our appointment - only to discover our social worker had never even referred us .
We gave Social Services one last chance : a week to confirm a date for a hospital assessment .
The deadline came and went .
We 'd been abandoned .
Alex could sense something different in the air .
I was n't ignoring her mind games ; I simply was n't reacting .
When she did her usual routine of stumbling into the car in a deliberately clumsy heap , I ignored her .
I was waiting for the treacherous moment we'd be breaking the news to her that she was moving on .
About a week after the gun incident , Rob returned from work to tell her .
Alex , then nine , was sitting propped against her bedroom wall with her knees up , eyes straight ahead .
I think she knew .
" Alex , love , we 've got something to tell you , " I said gently .
The eyes she turned on me were dead .
" You 're going to be staying somewhere else for a while , just until we 've found someone to help you .
I 'm sorry . "
My tears were n't for me .
They were for the girl who'd never been loved : not by me , not by anyone .
Alex simply nodded , barely displaying a hint of emotion .
Later , Rob sought her out in her bedroom .
" Alex , do you want to go ? "
Alex looked up , flat , as though defeated .
" I want to stay , " she said .
" But the Voice wants me to go . "
It was so honest , it was heartbreaking .
Two days later , we gathered Alex 's belongings , put her suitcase in the car and drove our daughter to her new home .
The peace that descended on our house that evening was the saddest I 'd ever known .
I agonised about what we 'd done and how Alex was coping with rejection for a second time .
Gradually , though , life got back from normal and we began to enjoy life again .
But this was far from the end .
Alex had been with her foster mother almost a year when our lives imploded again .
We 'd been visiting her every 12 weeks and had taken her to a restaurant where we 'd played a silly game where the children had fallen on the floor .
" She was in tears after you left , " her social worker said icily .
According to Social Services , we 'd also " harmed "
Alex by insisting she suffered from RAD and heard voices in her head .
Social Services were seeking a care order which meant Alex could never return to us .
Over the next few months , they marshalled a case against us .
We were dangerous parents who had systematically abused and harmed an innocent child .
I was crushed under the weight of pain and grief .
What had we done to deserve this ?
Could we lose Daniel , too ?
In our different worlds of pain , Rob and I found ourselves torn apart , rowing constantly .
Finally , we decided it was best if Rob moved out to a flat nearby .
Devastated , I was prescribed anti-depressants .
Meanwhile Daniel , then 13 , was suffering nightmares .
We soon discovered we were in a Catch 22 situation .
Our solicitor warned that we stood little chance of successfully contesting the care order - which was the only way to clear our name - because , at that time , Alex was n't displaying enough disturbed behaviour to convince the judge just how damaged she truly was .
Our only option was to consent .
Soon , our daughter for six years was no longer our responsibility .
Meanwhile , Alex 's behaviour had become increasingly bizarre .
She was muttering to herself and threatening to run away - but social workers were still blaming her " learning difficulties " .
Three weeks after the order was granted , Alex grabbed painkillers and matches and locked herself in the bathroom at her foster home .
Police broke down the door to find her cowering under the sink , surrounded by burned out rolls of toilet paper .
Refusing to talk , she was rushed to hospital to check she had not taken an overdose .
She had n't .
A few days later , her foster mother , Janet , left her youngest charge , Maisie , five , in the bath while she answered the phone .
Fired by a jealous rage , Alex burst into the bathroom , pushed one hand over her face and the other on her stomach , and deliberately pushed her under the water .
Only Janet 's return saved the child 's life .
Alex was removed immediately and placed in a small residential unit for disturbed children .
Two years on , the unit serves 15 - year - old Alex well : there are no expectations on her to bond or to love .
She is still legally our daughter but I fear for her future .
I hope one day she will get the treatment she needs .
Alex is a people - lover who , under different circumstances , would have so much to give .
With luck , she might yet be given the chance to love and to feel loved .
Unhappily , Rob and I are still separated , though we remain very close .
Although shaken by the experience and still somewhat fragile , we have at last begun to move on .
Aside from the strain those years put on Daniel , now 17 , we do n't regret our decision to adopt Alex .
She taught us - a normal middle - class family in an ordinary town - so much about the complex makings of a human being .
We considered legal action against Social Services but the idea of embroiling ourselves in an ugly legal battle was as unthinkable as leaping into a snake pit .
Instead , we settled for an apology " for the way things had turned out for us " - and , most of all , for Alex .
We were all horribly let down by Social Services .
Even now , incredible as it might appear , Alex remains untreated .
She has not seen a psychiatrist since the care proceedings .
She has simply been " lost in the system " .
We still visit her every three months - but , sadly , with each visit we see her becoming increasingly withdrawn .
Alex deserved a chance of happiness , but because Social Services are underfunded , understaffed and weighed down by bureaucracy , our family was destroyed .
It 's so tragic .

Russia plans to boost troop numbers in Abkhazia and S Ossetia Russia has warned it will retaliate if Georgia uses force against its breakaway regions .
Moscow has accused Georgia of preparing to invade Abkhazia , and says it is boosting Russian forces there and in the South Ossetia region .
Georgia has reacted angrily to the Russian move , which its prime minister called " irresponsible " .
The EU also urged caution , saying to increase troop numbers would be unwise given current tensions .
Russia 's foreign minister said his country was not preparing for war but would " retaliate " against any attack .
Russia says Georgia is massing 1,500 soldiers and police in the upper Kodori Gorge , the only part of Abkhazia which remains under government control .
' Retaliatory measures '
A statement from the Russian foreign ministry said that " a bridgehead is being prepared for the start of military operations against Abkhazia " .
In response , it said , it was increasing Russian peacekeepers in both Abkhazia and Georgia 's other breakaway region of South Ossetia .
Georgia denies any build - up of its own forces in the area , and says that Russia is taking provocative action .
" We think that this step , if they take it , will cause extreme destabilisation in the region , " said Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze .
" From now on , we consider every [ Russian ] soldier or any unit of military equipment coming in [ to Abkhazia and South Ossetia ] as illegal , potential aggressors and potential generators of destabilisation . "
After meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana called on Russia to show restraint .
" Even if the increase in peacekeepers is within limits , if we want to diminish the perception of tensions , I do n't think it is a wise measure to increase now , " Mr Solana said .
Mr Lavrov said that Russia had to protect Russian - passport holders in the regions and that if Georgia took military action , Russia would have to take " retaliatory measures " .
Mr Solana 's comments reflect a growing concern that Nato 's promise to admit Georgia as a member one day , despite strong Russian opposition , could have unpredictable consequences , says the BBC's European affairs correspondent Oana Lungescu .
Peacekeeping force Russia has kept a peacekeeping force in Abkhazia and South Ossetia under an agreement made following the wars of the 1990s , when the regions broke away from Tbilisi and formed links with Moscow .
Georgia 's president has vowed to reunite the country
There are around 2,000 Russians posted in Abkhazia , and about 1,000 in South Ossetia .
Tensions between Russia and Georgia have flared up recently , despite Russia lifting economic sanctions against Georgia earlier this month .
Last week Georgia accused a Russian plane of shooting down an unmanned Georgian spy plane - which Russian authorities insisted was shot down by Abkhaz rebels .
And on Tuesday Georgia said it was blocking Russia 's entry to the World Trade Organization .
Many in Abkhazia believe that Kosovo 's announcement of independence from Serbia in February provides a precedent for it to be recognised as an individual state .
Although it has its own flag and postage stamps , it is not internationally recognised .
Our correspondent in the area says that with this latest statement the Russian government has pushed the already bellicose rhetoric between the two countries to a new level .

He said taxpayers stand to lose if the $ 6.5 billion Super Hornets contract goes ahead — because too much was paid — or if it was cancelled .
The Defence Material Organisation has warned that the Government would lose over $ 400 million if it was axed .
Mr Fitzgibbon said the former government " ignored the advice of Defence " in deciding to retire the F - 111 jets ahead of the delivery of the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter fleet in about 2015 — and then rushed the Super Hornets acquisition to fill the gap .
" ( Defence ) were told to go out and find one very quickly … there was no comparative analysis with other aircraft , " Mr Fitzgibbon said .
" It was a rushed ad hoc process and sadly the taxpayer now looks like paying the price . "
Mr Minchin responded to Mr Fitzgibbon 's attack , saying he was " reflecting very badly and very unfairly on all those thousands of men and women in the DMO " .
He accused Mr Fitzgibbon of hysterically waving around his red folder but not disclosing its contents other than two projects well known for problems — the Seasprite helicopters and the FFG frigate upgrade .
Neil James , executive director of the Australia Defence Association , accused both sides of point - scoring and asked them to consider the morale of the defence force and DMO .
" There is absolutely no doubt that some very hard working and motivated people in the DMO are getting very pissed off about some of this coverage , " he said .
A senior US defence official defended the sale of the Super Hornets , saying he thought " it was a pretty good deal " .
But he said the contractors involved stood to make a profit , not the US Government .
He said that if Australia succeeded in getting the US to sell it the high - tech F - 22 Raptor jet fighter , an alternative to the Super Hornet , it was possible many of its sensitive capabilities would be removed .
US legislation bans it from being exported .
Mr Minchin released a statement with comments that the DMO 's CEO Stephen Gumley made to a Senate Estimates Committee last week , which said Australia got a standard price for the Super Hornet .
" We get the same unit prices as the US Government .
I know no way of getting better prices than the US Government , " he said .

The tips and techniques explained may be outdated .
I recently completed an experimental personal design project where a piece of digital artwork was created by combining pixel and vector elements .
During the process of it's production I captured screenshots and jotted down notes to present the course of the creation as a full blown walkthrough / tutorial .
There are plenty of useful little tutorials on the net explaining the use of a single tool , but rarely do you find a more complex explanation on how designer 's pull together a completed project .
Here you will find a step by step guide of how MY techniques were put to use to make this Snowboarder artwork .
Due to the length and large number of images the tutorial is split into two sections , the first of which here will cover the manipulation of the base photographs , and introducing the first few vector elements .
Subscribe to the RSS Feed or register for Email Updates to be notified of the second part which will cover the addition of more vector elements and how the finishing touches are added .
The project makes use of both Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator to create and combine the different elements .
Also a collection of resources was gathered which includes stock photography from StockXchng and vector graphics from GoMedia and Vecteezy .
As well as some resources I already had stored in my personal toolbox !
The first step on this project was to sketch out a rough plan , this idea in particular was pretty clear in my head already but a quick drawing was produced to keep as a reference .
Once you have your plan and idea in mind , open up Adobe Photoshop and setup your document .
Here I 'm using a 300dpi CMYK A4 layout with an additional 3 mm bleed just in case I decide to have it professionally printed at a later stage .
Bearing in mind the bleed that the document has , set up guides to accommodate the trim area and enough margin around the edges .
The main background image is of a range of snowy mountains from StockXchng , align this to the bottom of the document .
Select light and dark blue areas from the picture and add a gradient to extend the sky to the top of the document .
Due to the size of the document slight banding is appearing , to remedy this add a 2 - 3 % amount of noise .
After a lot of searching the main subject was also found on StockXchng , the Snowboarder image was downloaded and brought into Photoshop .
Using the Pen Tool zoom right into the subject and draw an outlining path , this is probably the most time consuming method of ' cutting out ' a picture but is also the most accurate .
Make selections from your Paths using a half pixel feather to remove the sharp edges .
Paste the Snowboarder into your main document .
Now is a good opportunity to make any slight correcting adjustments such as Levels , Curves and Sharpness to match the image to it 's surroundings .
Vector Shape One – Radial Lines
Swap over to Adobe Illustrator to create the first of the vector graphics .
These will be a set of radial lines to sit in the background of the main artwork .
Draw a rectangle on the artboard , then using the Direct Selection Tool pull together the bottom two points .
Copy and Paste the shape and rotate slightly using the Rotate Tool with the pivot placed underneath the shape .
Pressing CTRL / CMD +
D will repeat repeat the last action allowing you to quickly paste ( CTRL / CMD + F ) and rotate multiple instances by alternating between the two shortcut keys .
This will eventually make up the set of radial lines as shown .
Paste the radial lines into the document above the mountains layer but underneath the snowboarder .
To remove the overlap over the mountains draw a clipping path with the Pen Tool following the contours of the mountain tops .
Save this Path for later as we will be using it again , double click the Path in the Paths palette and enter a name .
The mountains layer looks quite flat so add some funky halftone texture by duplicating the layer and going to Filter > Pixelate > Halftone .
Enter 30 px minimum diameter and 45 in each of the channels .
Set this layer to Soft Light at 20 % .
Make a selection from the Mountains Path and delete out the section from the halftone layer .
Vector Shape Two – Circular Blobs
Switch over to Adobe Illustrator again to create the next vector element .
Draw a circle whilst holding Shift , then copy and paste this circle multiple times overlapping each to create a large blobby area .
Select all and fill with white , then paste into the Photoshop document .
Make a selection from the Mountains Path once again , and delete out the area .
Change the blending mode to Overlay .
Vector Shape Three – Trendy Circles
In a previous post I presented a selection of Trendy Circles for free download , head over and download the freebie and open up in Adobe Illustrator .
Select a style of Trendy Circle that takes your fancy and copy the group .
Paste in multiple groups of Trendy Circles to fill the area behind the snowboarder .
Go to Image > Adjustments >
Hue / Saturation or shortcut with CTRL / CMD +
U and adjust the colour settings as shown to match the Trendy Circles with the scheme of the artwork .
Add a little extra visual impact by adding a Gradient Overlay in the Layer Styles , ranging from a dark to a light blue vertically across the circles .
Open up a vector splatter from the resources collection , change the fill colour to white and paste into the Photoshop document under the Trendy Circles .
Repeat the Hue and Saturation adjustment to the splatter and add another gradient overlay to the layer .
Delete out the Mountains Path selection from the splatter layer .
Open up the Punk Vector Pack and copy the star shape .
Paste this shape into the Photoshop document multiple times and scale each star down to create a small trail behind the boarder 's hand .
Adjust the Hue and Saturation to add a complementing dark blue colour from the Snowboard .
Vector Shape Four – Whispy Lines
Back into Illustrator again to produce another vector element , draw a small circle on the artboard .
Using the Direct Selection
Tool drag the left and right points individually outwards to create the shape seen in figure 3 .
With this shape still selected click the New icon in the Brushes Palette and select the New Art Brush option .
Ensure the direction is running along the width of the shape in the options window .
Draw a slightly curved Path and apply the new brush .
Copy and paste the path and rotate it slightly and place underneath the previous .
Select both of the paths and go to Object > Blend > Blend Options .
Setup the Spacing to Specified Steps and enter 20 .
Go back into Object >
Blend and select Make .
Convert the shape to white and paste into the Photoshop document , position a couple flaring out from underneath the Snowboarder .
Set the layer style to Soft Light .
Zoom into the bottom of the Trendy Circles and draw a path following their contours , make a selection from this to delete the overlapping Whispy Lines .
END OF PART ONE
That ’s all for now , go back and make any minor adjustments and check back soon or subscribe for the next steps , where we will continue creating and adding vector elements to the design .
Sony and crapware have a special relationship , so much so that it takes over two minutes for its laptops to boot into Windows ( compare that with 30 seconds for a MacBook ) .
The company has even issued press statements explaining its reasoning : “ The programs are carefully selected and provide benefits to many consumers , up to 30 % of whom act on the offers . ”
But apparently Sony figured out that if 70 % of its customers are n’t interested in two dozen icons of offers ( really Sony , 3 to 4 is one thing , but over 20 ? ) , the company should offer a crapware - free version of its laptops .
Sony , in all its branding glory , has decided to trademark the term “ Fresh Start ” but has made the huge mistake of charging $ 50 for it .
Here ’s the description :
“ Opt for a Fresh StartTM and your VAIO PC will undergo a system optimization service where specific VAIO applications , trial software and games are removed from your unit prior to shipment .
Fresh StartTM safely scrubs your PC to free up valuable hard drive space and conserve memory and processing power while maximizing overall system performance right from the start . “
I love the terminology .
“ System optimization service ” is what we ’re calling a computer that comes without crapware .
And by characterizing hard drive space as “ valuable ” and memory in need of conservation , Sony is effectively digging its own grave .
I mean , do they not see that consumers notice this ?
If this new $ 50 feature “ maximizes system performance , ” then what does that imply of all the Sony laptops sold before it ?
Also , it should be noted that no “ Fresh Start ” is available unless you pay the extra $ 100 for Microsoft Windows Vista Business .
Here ’s a list of all the crapware Sony installs :
Two desktop icons for America Online services
At least two dozen icons for random offers
Two desktop icons for Microsoft services
Napster window in the lower right part of the screen
“ Watch Hit Movies Now ! ” icon which requires you to pay to play the movies already taking up space on your computer
Internet Explorer preloaded with AOL toolbar
AOL set as default search engine with Google not even listed as an option
Symantec Internet Security 60 - day trial ( requires multiple rounds of warnings / scans / updates before use )
* Update *
Wired is running a piece claiming that Sony “ wo n’t charge $ 50 to remove bloatware . ”
They even have quotes from Sony spokespeople : “ There will be no charge for Fresh Start . ”
Well , I just went to Sony ’s website to verify this news and … surprise , surprise , the charge of $ 50 is still there .
Maybe it ’ll change soon , but Sony PR and Sony Online apparently need to talk first .
* Update 2 * Gizmodo has a brief post that pulls a Sony quote of nowhere : “ Starting March 22 , Sony will offer Fresh Start free of charge .
We want VAIO users to have the best experience possible with our PCs , and we believe Fresh Start will help ensure that happens right out - of - the - box . ”
It looks like the consumer uprising today may have had an effect .
Here ’s another quote , this one from Sony ’s Mike Abary , Senior Vice President of the VAIO division :
“ We did n’t intend that to happen .
We ’re removing the $ 49 charge .
VAIO is the poster child for negative experiences people had [ with trialware ] .
We recognize that , and we acknowledge it .
We ’ve been really beat up by this issue .
We ’re listening and we ’re taking action . ”
University of Maryland physicists have shown that in graphene the intrinsic limit to the mobility , a measure of how well a material conducts electricity , is higher than any other known material at room temperature .
Graphene , a single - atom - thick sheet of graphite , is a new material which combines aspects of semiconductors and metals .
Their results , published online in the journal Nature Nanotechnology , indicate that graphene holds great promise for replacing conventional semiconductor materials such as silicon in applications ranging from high - speed computer chips to biochemical sensors .
A team of researchers led by physics professor Michael S. Fuhrer of the university 's Center for Nanophysics and Advanced Materials , and the Maryland NanoCenter said the findings are the first measurement of the effect of thermal vibrations on the conduction of electrons in graphene , and show that thermal vibrations have an extraordinarily small effect on the electrons in graphene .
In any material , the energy associated with the temperature of the material causes the atoms of the material to vibrate in place .
As electrons travel through the material , they can bounce off these vibrating atoms , giving rise to electrical resistance .
This electrical resistance is " intrinsic " to the material : it can not be eliminated unless the material is cooled to absolute zero temperature , and hence sets the upper limit to how well a material can conduct electricity .
In graphene , the vibrating atoms at room temperature produce a resistivity of about 1.0 microOhm-cm ( resistivity is a specific measure of resistance ; the resistance of a piece material is its resistivity times its length and divided by its cross- sectional area ) .
This is about 35 percent less than the resistivity of copper , the lowest resistivity material known at room temperature .
" Other extrinsic sources in today 's fairly dirty graphene samples add some extra resistivity to graphene , " explained Fuhrer , " so the overall resistivity is n't quite as low as copper 's at room temperature yet .
However , graphene has far fewer electrons than copper , so in graphene the electrical current is carried by only a few electrons moving much faster than the electrons in copper . "
In semiconductors , a different measure , mobility , is used to quantify how fast electrons move .
The limit to mobility of electrons in graphene is set by thermal vibration of the atoms and is about 200,000 cm2 / Vs at room temperature , compared to about 1,400 cm2 / Vs in silicon , and 77,000 cm2 / Vs in indium antimonide , the highest mobility conventional semiconductor known .

" Interestingly , in semiconducting carbon nanotubes , which may be thought of as graphene rolled into a cylinder , we 've shown that the mobility at room temperature is over 100,000 cm2 / Vs " said Fuhrer ( T. Dürkop , S. A. Getty , Enrique Cobas , and M. S. Fuhrer , Nano Letters 4 , 35 ( 2004 ) ) .
Mobility determines the speed at which an electronic device ( for instance , a field - effect transistor , which forms the basis of modern computer chips ) can turn on and off .
The very high mobility makes graphene promising for applications in which transistors much switch extremely fast , such as in processing extremely high frequency signals .
Mobility can also be expressed as the conductivity of a material per electronic charge carrier , and so high mobility is also advantageous for chemical or bio-chemical sensing applications in which a charge signal from , for instance , a molecule adsorbed on the device , is translated into an electrical signal by changing the conductivity of the device .
Graphene is therefore a very promising material for chemical and bio-chemical sensing applications .
The low resitivity and extremely thin nature of graphene also promises applications in thin , mechanically tough , electrically conducting , transparent films .
Such films are sorely needed in a variety of electronics applications from touch screens to photovoltaic cells .
Fuhrer and co-workers showed that although the room temperature limit of mobility in graphene is as high as 200,000 cm2 / Vs , in present - day samples the actual mobility is lower , around 10,000 cm2 / Vs , leaving significant room for improvement .
Because graphene is only one atom thick , current samples must sit on a substrate , in this case silicon dioxide .
Trapped electrical charges in the silicon dioxide ( a sort of atomic - scale dirt ) can affect the electrons in graphene and reduce the mobility .
Also , vibrations of the silicon dioxide atoms themselves can also have an effect on the graphene which is stronger than the effect of graphene 's own atomic vibrations .
This so - called " remote interfacial phonon scattering " effect is only a small correction to the mobility in a silicon transistor , but because the phonons in graphene itself are so ineffective at scattering electrons , this effect becomes very important in graphene .
" We believe that this work points out the importance of these extrinsic effects , and creates a roadmap for finding better substrates for future graphene devices in order to reduce the effects of charged impurity scattering and remote interfacial phonon scattering . "
Fuhrer said .
Faulty Memory Card Connectors , Undisclosed by the Company or the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission , Discovered in Recent Election
Employee from New England 's Diebold Distributor , LHS Associates , Barred from Work in Connecticut After Alarming Public Comments at The BRAD BLOG ...

Failures in optical - scan voting systems made by Diebold Inc. , as recently revealed in the state of Florida , might have occurred elsewhere across the country .
In fact , any state where Diebold 's optical - scan voting machines are in use might be having the problem , and they may not have been made aware of it --- either by the company , or the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission ( EAC ) which is mandated by law to be a " clearinghouse " for such information .
A faulty connector - pin on Florida 's Diebold optical - scan systems --- affecting some 4.5 % of the state 's machines , and as many as " one in 10 during the November 2006 election " in some Florida counties , according to a recent investigative report by the Daytona Beach News - Journal --- has been identified by the company as a " J40 connector " .
It now appears that Connecticut 's voting machines , made by the same company , are being affected by the same problem .
“ This is Connecticut , not Volusia County , " President of LHS Associates , Connecticut ’s vendor for Diebold AccuVote OS machines , told me during a recent , bizarre late - night phone call .
I felt pretty certain he was right , though his call came in to my home at 1:30 in the morning , so I was still a bit groggy .
LHS 's John Silvestro had picked a strange time to return my call from a week earlier .
We ’d been following LHS ’s role in addressing memory card failures during Connecticut elections since 2006 on Talk Nation Radio , and I wanted to know how many memory cards LHS had to replace before , during , and after the 2007 election .
At that hour , I declined his offer to " do the interview anyway , " though we did touch on the basics of my inquiry .
Did Registrars contact LHS to request replacements for " blown " memory cards as pre-election tests were being run ?
If so , a study currently underway at the University of Connecticut might not have been given the correct data to determine the true number of failing cards .
Silvestro asked me , " What would you say if I said Connecticut 's failure rate was less than one percent ? "
Perplexed , I told him I would say " OK " and we agreed to discuss the matter at a later time when he might have access to his records , as he had said he did n't have numbers in front of him at that late hour .
He would n't be the first LHS official to exhibit bizarre behavior .
After jarringly inappropriate comments left at The BRAD BLOG several months ago , one such official was told he was no longer welcome to work in the state of Connecticut .
Confusion in Connecticut
Diebold , and their New England distributor , LHS , failed to inform Connecticut officials about the J40 problem as found in the state of Florida where the hardware in the voting systems is the same , according to experts we spoke to .
If the same problem is occurring in Connecticut , the company ’s decision to keep quiet about it may have contributed to widespread confusion over just what may have caused recent voting machine failures .
Diebold 's Premier Election Systems has not yet responded to our calls seeking details .
Memory card failures can cause machines to fail outright , but they may also cause strange shifts in the numbers .
Such a scenario may explain variations in results in recent elections in Connecticut .
Audits of voting systems used during the 2006 election found significant variations in machine versus hand recounts and audits , but the problem was kept quiet , according to a report [ pdf ] by George Barnett of election watchdog , True Vote Connecticut .
Similar fluctuating totals during the 2007 election have left town officials puzzled , as a number of memory card failures have been reported .
Diebold , whose elections division has now been renamed " Premier Election Solutions " , had been tracking similar data in Florida and knew about the memory card problems for some time prior to the 2007 election .
Yet , neither they , nor the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission ( EAC ) , established in part as a " clearinghouse " for such information , have warned states using the same equipment about the confirmed problems .
It is a story that smacks of cover - up , possible collusion between manufacturers and any number of vendors , and potentially criminal concealment of problems with voting machine technology in states which use Diebold 's optical - scan voting machines .
News - Journal reporter M.C. Moewe has been tracking this story in Florida , where she 's reported high failure rates for memory cards and where Diebold ultimately replaced cards just prior to the 2007 election in the wake of her report .
Following her initial story , Moewe published an interview on November 12th with Christopher D. Riggall , the communications manger for Diebold Inc. 's Premier Election Solutions .
He said engineers had been able to identify faulty " J40 connectors " in their optical - scan systems , and he admitted Diebold might have to replace the parts in Florida 's machines .
More disturbingly , Riggall told Moewe the company would address problems in other jurisdictions only " on a case by case basis " .
He said they would only respond after customer complaints had " identified ... a concern . "
In other words , if the states using the scanners did n't ask , Diebold would n't tell .
And neither would the EAC .
State Officials Left in the Dark
As the EAC , Diebold and LHS had all failed to notify jurisdictions outside of Florida of the possible problems , the exchange between Moewe and Riggall was a revelation for Connecticut 's Deputy Secretary of State Lesley Mara .
When I asked Mara if Diebold had ever notified her office about potential problems with memory cards on the machines her response was a forceful , " no ! "
She and Democratic Secretary of State Susan Bysiewicz had recently commissioned a top down review of memory cards from the University of Connecticut 's Voting Research Team , as led by computer scientist Alexander Shvartsman .
The team is under contract to provide voting machine security assessments for Connecticut .
The Secretary of the State 's request for research into memory cards was partly due to Talk Nation Radio 's 2006 reports about card failures that came up during last year 's Congressional race .
We had conducted interviews with three LHS staff members who had worked the polls last year in Connecticut with back up memory cards in their pockets and back up voting machines in the trunks of their cars .
That , despite the fact that the state 's voting machine security protocols , under Connecticut Statute 9 , prevents them from even touching the machines .
One by one , the employees filled my radio listeners in with details on how they 'd address voting systems failures by opening machines to make memory card replacements on the spot .
An illegal memory card switch --- swapping out the sensitive cards which store voting data and which can also be used to insert malicious code into the systems --- was made by an LHS staff member in Montville , CT during the recount of the 2nd Congressional District .
The election moderator in Montville , Lorraine Elliot , told us an LHS staff member used a card that had been hand carried to the polls .
From her description , it seems Elliot may have come across an incident which sounds as if it involved the same kind of problems with pin configurations that has been identified in Florida 's machines .
She told us that she " had set up a new machine and we put the memory card in and it did n’t work .
It did n’t print anything out .
So we took that one out and put another one in and the same thing with the second one .
It did n't print .
I do n’t know how the memory card actually works but the little prongs , I guess , sometimes they do n’t actually touch the inside ?
So the third card that we got from LHS worked fine . "
As they prepared security protocols for 2007 , officials from the Secretary of the State 's office and the UConn Voting Research Team team visited LHS Associates in Methuen , MA .
There , according to Deputy Secretary of State Lesley Mara , LHS staff members showed them the company 's rapid response center where LHS staff members rush to replace failing memory cards as elections continue .
They rush the newly programmed cards out to the polls .
Some states allow the practice .
Yet , the same practice may have resulted in an artificially low rate of reported memory card failures .
Hard data from the company is difficult to come by .
Moewe 's initial story for the News - Journal detailed Diebold 's refusal to release data they had collected on memory card failures in Florida , citing it as " proprietary business information . "
My findings during the 2006 election were also revealing .
LHS was in position to keep memory card failures quiet , and there has been conflicting information about whether or not they had informed Secretary of the State Bysiewicz when cards had failed .
Our preliminary information on the 2007 election is that the UConn team has identified memory card failures during their initial testing .
The failures occurred in consistent ways that the team is said to be looking into .
They have yet to produce a report on the memory card research , as cards were still arriving at the lab to be tested as of last Friday afternoon , according to Deputy Secretary Mara .
After Moewe 's revelations in the Daytona Beach paper , we phoned Deputy Secretary Mara to let her know that Florida 's problem could be affecting Connecticut machines as well .
It 's a good thing we did , since neither the vendors , nor the EAC had done so .
The EAC , as reported multiple times by The BRAD BLOG ( eg. here and here ) has refused to send out such alerts themselves .
Two reports by the Government Accountability Office , in 2005 and again in 2006 , have been highly critical of the federal agency for their " continued absence of a national clearinghouse for voting system problems " as mandated by the 2002 Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) .
Per Mara 's request , I remained on the line while sending her the transcript of Moewe 's interview with Diebold 's spokesperson admitting that the company would only respond after customer complaints of problems .
She immediately forwarded it to UConn 's Professor Shvartsman , who quick replied back to say he was aware of " noise about memory connectors on the Internet and non trivial faulty ones , " she said .
Mara explained that " noise " was Shvartsman 's way of describing the type of issues we were talking about .
She added that , at some point , LHS mentioned a problem to the team having to do with " bent pins . "
It was the Deputy Secretary 's impression that Shvartsman is now aware that there could be a problem with Connecticut 's machines .
She said she 'd consider writing to Diebold immediately in order to ask company executives why they had failed to inform Connecticut officials about the problems they had found in Florida .
The State Election Enforcement Commission is already investigating a complaint we filed on October 30 , 2007 .
It has been assigned as docket number 2007 - 385 .
The complaint asks Connecticut officials to investigate LHS Associates and the handling of memory cards , as well as to provide research into Connecticut 's voting machine security protocols .
The complaint points out that the vendor and / or manufacturer have a strong motive to conceal such problems .
Meanwhile we are continuing our own investigation into several reports of memory card failures .
We have done just a handful of interviews so far .
Deputy Secretary Mara said she knew of two card failures during the election .
LHS Official Barred from Work in CT
LHS has proven to be less than agreeable to concerns about the voting systems they distribute across New England .
Recently , their Director of Sales and Marketing , Ken Hajjar left a surprising comment in reply to a BRAD BLOG story about Diebold .
Hajjar 's impolitic comment began " Dear Brad , you are totally full of shit . "
He went on to charge , " You have no idea how elections are conducted and how many safeguards are in place , including human oversight , " before referring to Election Integrity advocates as " paranoid " and " deluded " .
Unfortunately , the comments were not out of character from previous interviews I 'd done with him .
Hajjar 's underlying resentment cropped up during my 2006 interview with him , when he charged that my questions were , " an indication of just how dangerous the Internet has become " .
And when we touched on the UConn team 's reports he blurted out , " I 've read every report in America , some of which are frankly superfluous " .
It was just plain impossible to follow all of Hajjar 's various contradictory , and often confusing statements .
For example , Hajjar admitted he had seen Connecticut 's voting machine security protocols , which had been faxed to LHS in MA .
He said , " I was given one sheet of paper which was the Secretary of State ’s rules and I was just told ' do n’t touch anything just answer questions . '
So I do n’t have that with me , and I ’m not even sure what I did with it .
I might have just thrown it away once I got through " .
A few minutes later , when asked who would be on site , to either repair or replace the machines if there were problems during elections , Hajjar said , " Either a representative of the town or a representative of the vendor . "
He then explained , in some detail , about how they would open machines , in apparent violation of state law , to change memory cards during the elections .
Other LHS staff members we spoke with , including Mike Carlson and Tom Burge , provided similar comments .
They said they would open machines up during an election and swap memory cards as needed .
This is illegal under Connecticut law and Deputy Secretary Mara told us she has since informed LHS that such actions were in violation of Connecticut election laws .
In 2006 , as Hajjar argued in favor of their policy to change cards during elections , I asked him about about the laws which govern chain of custody issues .
His response : " I mean , I do n't pay attention to every little law .
It 's just , it 's up to the Registrars .
All we are is a support organization on Election Day " .
He said he had three memory cards in the trunk of his car and , in the event they had to be used , the chain of custody issues would n't matter since , " once you run the [ pre- election ] test deck through , you 're golden " .
" We would have a whole bunch of machines in the trunk in the car and we hope the phone does n't ring , but if it does somebody tells us where to go , we replace the machine and then we go on our merry way , " he declared .
Hajjar also argued that the first use of the new machines in 2006 " was perfect " .
But LHS President John Silvestro has since admitted that there were failures of memory cards in the state that year and he has offered his interpretation that his staff was confused between laws in Connecticut versus other states where the company provides services .
As I struggled to pin Hajjar down on these matters , he cried , " Madam you 're the reporter I 'm the machine guy !
I do n't tell you how your presses run , do n't try to get me on semantics .
The machine either sees or does not see .
If it sees it counts .
If it does n't see it does n't count . "
Ken Hajjar 's bluntness finally caught up with him this year .
Following his less - than - appropriate comments at The BRAD BLOG , he has informed by Connecticut officials that he is no longer welcome to work in the state .
Just as well .
His patience for dealing with these issues was clearly running thin long ago .
" You cannot ... you wanna go into the booth and tell the voter how to fill in the oval ? , " he asked me in 2006 .
" You wanna slap 'em across the face if they do n't fill it in right ? "
It was his boss , Silvestro , who had called me at 1:30 am recently .
The one who had informed me that " This is Connecticut , not Volusia County . "
He was mostly right .

A U.S. graduate student won second place in a " Greener Gadgets Conference " competition inventing a floor lamp powered by gravity .
Clay Moulton of Springfield , Va. , who received his master 's of science degree last year from Virginia Tech , created the lamp as a part of his master 's thesis .
The LED lamp , named Gravia , is an acrylic column a little more than 4 feet high .
The entire column glows when activated by electricity generated by the slow , silent fall of a mass that spins a rotor .
The light output of 600 - 800 lumens lasts about four hours .
To " turn on " the lamp , the user moves weights from the bottom to the top of the lamp and into a mass sled near the top .
The sled begins its gentle glide down and , within a few seconds , the LEDs are illuminated .
" It 's more complicated than flipping a switch , " said Moulton , " but can be an acceptable , even enjoyable routine , like winding a beautiful clock or making good coffee . "
Moulton estimates Gravia 's mechanisms will last more than 200 years .
A patent is pending on the Gravia lamp .

For those who do n’t know , the game industry ( or at least my chunk of it ) is generally about 10 years behind the rest of the software world .
We ’re still leery of crazy ivory tower concepts like “ memory management ” , “ testing ” , and “ going home at 5:00 PM ” .
Where your hip Web 2.0 company is all aflutter about DSLs , duck typing , and continuations , my company is a little more :
Brown : I have just received a telegraph from Jenkins discussing something he calls , “ the Ess Tee Ell ” .
Watson : Desist your crazy Moon Man talk or I shall be forced to give you a drubbing !
It ’s not that we are n’t trying .
We ’re just a little more East Berlin circa 1950 than the rest of the software world .
One concept that has crossed our Iron Curtain recently is this thing called “ Agile Development ” .
I ca n’t say we really know what it means , but it is very interesting to us .
Games Are Hard
You see , developing a new game is really hard .
On top of the technical reasons ( pushing the graphics hardware , strict quality control ) and the business ones ( cutthroat competition , difficult profitability ) , there ’s this other little thing called “ fun ” .
If you ’re making business software and it ’s a pain to use , you can still be totally successful because people need to use your stuff to get their job done , like it or not .
And your software can be totally unoriginal because people do n’t want to have to learn new things .
Unoriginality is actually a bonus .
Over in Magical Game Land , though , we are n’t so lucky .
We ’re trying to get people to shell out hard - earned cash for something that , by definition , they do n’t need .
So we have to make sure it ’s more fun to play than whatever else they could be doing .
We have to make sure we ’re offering them a new experience , otherwise they ’ll just play an older game .
At the same time , our new game has to be easy enough to learn that it ’s enjoyable within the first 30 seconds .
On top of this , budgets and player expectations continue to rise , so the chance and cost of failure keeps going up .
Because of this , if a game ’s going to suck , we need to know as soon as possible so we can correct course or bail out .
Enter Agile Development
Agile development means a lot of things to different people , but the key part I want to talk about is the idea of building a game incrementally through a series of small changes .
This idea that a month into the cycle you have a fun playable game already and you just build onto that is very appealing because it means we can immediately get feedback on what parts work and what do n’t .
For a micro example , imagine you ’re building a chess - like game .
In a typical waterfall - like model , you wo n’t be able to actually play the game until all the different pieces are designed and implemented .
And then you can play the whole thing .
Sometime in alpha , after you ’ve burned most of your budget .
Better hope the game is fun !
With a more agile method , you ’d be able to play the game early in the cycle with a couple of pieces , and then gradually add in more pieces throughout .
You ’ll be testing some core mechanics early in and can change things if they do n’t work .
Uh-Oh
Even that tiny example hints at the pitfall ahead : games are all about balance .
Chess is unplayable with just two kings and some pawns .
Without the other pieces , it ’s a fundamentally different game .
So now we ’ve gone from “ nothing to play ” to “ playing a totally different game that may or may not reflect the final game ” .
Ouch .
This is where games are different than other software .
If you ’re making a word processor , adding right - justification does n’t somehow “ unbalance ” left - justification .
Features are fairly isolated from each other and do n’t compete .
In a game ( in the game theory sense ) , every feature or capability affects the overall strategy and equilibrium .
Building a game incrementally is like trying to build a hanging mobile by hanging it up first and then hanging successive pieces onto it .
Solutions ?
I suspect this is one of the fundamentally hard parts of designing a new game .
That sense of “ everything works in harmony ” is irreducible to some extent .
I ’ll point out a couple of ideas to at least carve at the problem a bit .
Separate the Core from the Peripheral
If we ’re designing minimal abstract board games , there are n’t a lot of “ peripheral ” features .
In computer / video - games it ’s a bit different .
Non - interactive set decoration , some UI , extra games modes , etc. all surround the core “ mechanics ” of the game .
So , even if you ca n’t do the core mechanics incrementally , you can at least do them in one lump and then tack on the additional stuff afterwards .
Be careful here , though .
Even seemingly trivial things like UI or VFX can have a massive impact on the usability of your game .
Matched Pairs
If you ’re starting with a balanced game and you need to add features while keeping it balanced , one obvious solution is to try to add them in opposing pairs .
For symmetric games like chess , this is fairly simple : implement the same piece for both players .
For other games , it gets trickier .
If you ’re adding speed boosts to a driving game , you might be able to match it by also adding slowdown and damage for hitting the walls at the same time .
For an RPG , giving the player a new attack may require also adding monsters that resist it .
Accepted Retuning
Most games , on top of the feature set itself , have a lot of precise tuning of numbers that happens to make it fun .
Those numbers have to be tuned relative to the current feature set .
Adding a new feature can essentially detune them .
If you give your hero a shotgun , all of the sudden it may be time to double the enemy ’s health .
Make the AI smarter and your hero is toast .
If a fun playable game at all points through the cycle is important , it may be worth accepting that you will need to frequently retune the same values as the feature set changes .
To some degree , this is “ throwaway ” work , but if it gives you a better ability to evaluate your game , it may be worth the effort .
Reduce Innovation
Of course , all of the above assumes you ’re making a game with actually new mechanics .
If you ’re making chess on the other hand , it does n’t matter if the game sucks with just kings and pawns .
You know by the time the rest of the pieces are in it will be cool .
So the safest option is just to rely on the established formula of your game ’s genre , and save your innovation for peripheral features .

Subversion is a revision control system that has superceded CVS .
If you 're writing software of any kind , you shoud be using version control software .
SVN Book
So I could have named one of many , but this is the one I 've liked the most recently .
Jira is a bug / issue tracking software package and can also help with project management in terms of goals and roadmaps .
Most issue trackers link to version control repositories , such as Subversion .
Only downside to Jira is that it costs for non open source projects .
I 'm pleased to say that with a little bit of pushing and persuasion by myself , we are currently using all of these technologies with the exception of Jira , we have a bespoke issue tracker .
What do you think to the list ?

Any alternatives you prefer ?
The latest variants of Kraken have thrown up innovations in black hat stealth technology that are making botnets spawned by the malware harder to detect and dismantle .
Analysis of the source code of the new variant of the Kraken ( AKA Bobax ) bot by Australian anti-virus firm PC Tools has revealed a domain name generation algorithm designed to allow infected machines to search for possible control servers , rather than relying on a single server that can more easily be dismantled by security researchers .
In addition , compromised nodes speak to a control server using HTTP traffic instead of the more traditional approach of using IRC channels .
IRC channel traffic is more obviously suspicious .
Data sent between compromised machines and control servers is encrypted and features randomly generated headers in a bid to further disguise dodgy communications , PC Tools explains .
In order to evade host intrusion prevention systems , such as firewalls , the new variant of Kraken ' talks ' to its control centres via HTTP ( the ' language ' that web browsers use to talk to websites ) , using pseudo - random dynamic DNS names , with a variable length from seven to 12 characters , followed with one of the domain suffixes : dyndns.org , yi.org , mooo.com , dynserv.com , com , cc or net .
The commands and data that the bot exchanges with the control centres is encrypted and also uses randomly generated ' bogus ' headers to stay hidden under the firewall radar .
Using this approach the Kraken bot calculates the likely coordinates of its control server , without knowing where it is .
PC
Tools likens the approach to a lost sheep trying to locate its shepherd .
PC Tools reckons the latest variants of Kraken were distributed via MSN Messenger .
It uses a random word generating engine to vary the name of infectious files prospective marks are invited to open , a feature designed to confuse spam filters .
The Australian information security firm reports that it detected infections by the latest variant Kraken bot across the world over the last week or so .
Further technical analysis of the malware , and its underpinning algorithms , can be found here .
Kraken rose to prominence amid reports earlier this month that it had outstripped the Storm botnet in the number of compromised PCs it controlled .
Security researchers are split over whether the malware agent itself is new on the scene or not , as well as the strength of the zombie army it commands . ®

Honest Questions with Ron Paul
Aired December 18 , 2007 - 19:00:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
GLENN BECK , HOST ( voice - over ) : Presidential candidate Ron Paul .
Veteran , doctor , congressman , and author of books on everything from pregnancy to why our freedom is under siege .
REP .
RON PAUL ( R - TX ) , PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE :
Our national sovereignty is under threat .
BECK : He`s come under fire for his candor on Iraq and his position on America`s foreign policy .
PAUL : Our foreign policy is designed to protect our oil interests .
BECK : Paul`s mantra of personal liberty , small government , and a return to the Constitution have ignited the passions of many .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We love you , Dr. Paul .
BECK : Ron Paul supporters complain that the mainstream media distorts their candidate`s views .
Or worse , ignores him altogether .
Well , that ends tonight .
Presidential contender Ron Paul for a full hour of honest questions .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
BECK : Well , hello America .
I`m sure we have quite a few new people watching the show tonight , but for those of you that have watched or listened to me on the radio for a while , you know that I am actually a libertarian at heart .
I believe so deeply in our Constitution I believe the free market system is the answer .
We , the people , are really the answer to almost every problem we face .
If you watch this program often , you probably also know that I believe our country is in deep , deep trouble .
Our enemies are both foreign and domestic .
And they are circling like sharks just waiting to attack .
Meanwhile , we continue to give up our sovereignty to international treaties and world bodies , talk global warming and higher taxes .
Our constitutional rights are slipping away , and our government seems to be hell - bent on ushering in the Great Depression Deux .
All of that is why I`ve wanted to sit down for so long now with the congressman and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul .
By speaking out on the issues that virtually no one else wants to touch , has struck a nerve with the disenfranchised American who is sick and tired of the same old rhetoric from the same old people .
But he has also struck a nerve with people who believe that a small - government , free - market - at - all - costs approach is impractical , outdated and , in some cases , dangerous .
I`ll have you know on the outset , I`m in both of those camps .
Tonight , we`re going to explore both sides , and it is my hope that Dr. Paul will finally have the time he needs to fully explain his positions on the things that cannot be addressed in 30 - second sound bites like , " Let`s abolish the FBI . "
Congressman Paul , welcome to the program , sir .
PAUL : Thank you , Glenn .
Nice to be with you .
BECK : OK .
You`re on the campaign trail , which is the reason why you`re not in the studio now .
And I want to get to some of your more controversial positions later on in the program .
But I thought we would start on a few of the things that I -- I almost never see anybody talk about with you .
The real things that most conservatives do agree with you on .
I want to start by playing a clip of something you said just last week in the debate in Iowa .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAUL : Re -read the oath of office , take it seriously .
Obey the Constitution .
We can -- we are well - defended against all enemies foreign .
We should be much more careful about defending against the enemies domestic .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : Who , sir , do you ...
PAUL : Yes .
BECK : Who do you believe are the enemies domestic ?
PAUL : I don`t see them as individuals or personalities .
I see it as a philosophic danger endorsed by the status quo .
Most members of Congress , most members who have been in the executive branch over the years , the undermining of our personal economic liberties , our personal liberties , our privacy .
There`s been a special erosion of these privacy issues since 9/11 .
So it is something that`s been engrained in our system .
You know , economic liberty is very , very important , but that`s been undermined , you know , for 70 or 80 years since the Depression .
See I see it as in philosophic terms rather than in personality terms .
BECK : I -- let me go to the U.N.
You say the U.N. shouldn`t even exist .
PAUL : Well , I don`t have any -- any saying about whether they should exist or not .
I just am arguing that it`s not in our best interest to be in the U.N .
The very first thing that the U.N. did after World War II was they took us to war .
I mean , Truman went to war and didn`t even tell the Congress .
And you know , we`re still in Korea .
And you know , the Constitution is very clear .
Only Congress can declare war .
A lot of men died over there .
So I don`t like going to war under the U.N. banner .
BECK : You say the choice is very clear : we either follow the constitution or submit to U.N. global government .
I happen to agree with you , sir .
I mean , I see the LOST treaty , I see the issue of global warming as nothing but trying to entangle us and the rest of the world into one world government .
Would you agree or disagree with that ?
PAUL : No .
No , I agree with it .
I think our trade agreements do the same thing , you know , whether it`s the WTO or , you know , the World Bank or the IMF or NAFTA or CAFTA .
These are taking away our -- our sovereignty .
Even today , the WTO today was telling us that we shouldn`t pass this agricultural bill .
I`ll probably , you know , not go for the agriculture bill , but should I do it because the WTO tells me not to ?
So I don`t -- I don`t like this undermining of our national sovereignty .
BECK : So ...
PAUL : And we`ve allowed this to happen .
BECK : You have said , though , that this is not some , if I may quote you , " It is not as much a sinister conspiracy .
The knowledge is out there .
If you just look for it , you realize that our national sovereignty under threat . "
But I have to tell you , and we`re going to get into economics here in a few minutes .
But when you look at both parties , you will see them .
I mean , look at the budget that has recently come out .
You`ll see that they are almost intentionally sabotaging us every step of the way .
How else could you explain some of the things that are going on at the border , with the LOST treaty , with your budget , our monetary policies .
I mean , how do you say it`s not a sinister conspiracy ?
PAUL : Yes , I guess -- I guess that it may be semantics that we`re dealing with .
What I see is a conspiracy in the sense that some people believe in globalism .
Some people believe in the North American Union .
I don`t .
It used to be more secretive .
You know , the new world order that was talked about 30 , 40 years ago , and nobody would say it out and open .
BECK : Right .
PAUL : Now they`re talking about the new world order .
So it`s not as secretive and it`s not as conspiratorial as it was 50 or 60 years ago .
People believe in internationalism .
And I think people they`re very sincere .
They think the world would be better off if we had one world government .
BECK : Yes .
Right .
PAUL : I don`t .
I mean , I don`t even like the size of our federal government , let alone the one - world government .
I want government to be local .
BECK : I -- I`ve tried to explain this in a chapter , the last chapter of a book that I have out , on Mexico .
And say that I don`t believe that these people are intentionally -- I think if I sat down with the people who are messing with our sovereignty down south of the border , I believe they would tell you , " Glenn , this is in the best interest of the country . "
But they -- but they are not shooting straight .
Let`s talk a little bit about the NAFTA super highway , where you have an opinion that this is part of the , you know , joining of Mexico and Canada and the United States under one kind of E.U. - style government .
They`ll deny it .
They`ll say that`s not true .
You`re crazy if you believe that .
PAUL : I saw a major editorial today against me for being concerned that there could be a North American Union in our future .
I don`t think it`s next month or next year , but you know , they probably talked 50 years about the European Union .
And I think that plans are definitely there .
I think that`s why they`re very weak on border protection and very weak on the immigration issue , because the leadership of both Republicans and Democrats aren`t that concerned about borders .
They`re more interested in a North American Union .
BECK : You say you don`t think that that would happen , yet I find that hard to believe if you`re sincere on this belief .
If you`ve done your homework , you know that the ambassador to the U.N. from Mexico says it has to happen before our Social Security and Baby Boomers start to retire .
That`s just a few years away .
PAUL : Well -- well , let me clarify that .
I`m concerned about it , and I`m fighting it .
I just don`t think it`s going to happen next month or next year .
But I think the plans are being laid there .
Sometimes individuals who promote world government are very , very patient .
And we`re very -- our side is very easy to forget or let our guard down .
And what I`m trying to do is alert the American people that they ought to be alarmed about what`s happening .
And hopefully , we can stop it .
I think we`ve made progress there .
Quite a few states have , you know , written some resolutions and objections .
Texas has done this .
It`s not like we`ve thought this up .
If the -- if everybody in Texas` legislature can vote and say , " Let`s put a moratorium on these plans for a super highway coming through , " there must be something to it .
BECK : The American people , and you must know this , because you are -- you are probably the lightning rod for the most disenfranchised in America .
You are probably the one who -- I know -- I have to tell you .
I listen to your radio commercials .
And I hear your radio commercials and I`m like , yes , that`s how I feel .
I have voted for Ronald Reagan .
I have been a Republican , but I`ve -- you know , I`ve never registered as a Republican .
But generally speaking .
But I think most Americans now say neither side .
They`re both selling us out .
How do you propose to -- how do you propose to stop this ?
And what advice do you give to the American people when they say , " Wait a minute .
Nobody in Washington is listening to me .
If I elected you , how are you going to stop this ? "
PAUL : Well , one person can`t do it .
But the fact that our movement is so big , much bigger than I ever dreamed , you know , the way they raise funds and the way they join us .
And we get 25,000 new supporters in one single day .
So there is a great deal of discontent in the country .
So it takes an army of people who believe a certain way , who`s willing to look at this in an objective manner .
And I think we`re further along .
I think this is the first time in history where a grassroots - type candidate , an independent - minded person , has been able to compete with the special interests .
I think that is the message of what`s happening here .
We`ve been able to raise enough funds .
We don`t have as much money as others , but we get their attention .
You know , raising $ 6 million in one day is a special event .
But now we can compete , and this scares those people who are controlling government for so many years .
Whether it`s the banking interests , the military industrial complex , whether it`s the medical industry .
So many people have so much control in Washington , and yet we`re able to compete with them .
And think that`s very encouraging .
And this invites even more people in , because I`m convinced we`re the majority .
If you take the base of the Republican Party and the base of the Democratic Party , I think you`re down to about 30 percent of the people .
So many people have dropped out or never joined in , and now they`re joining our campaign .
BECK : Ramos and Compean , the border guards .
If you were president of the United States , what would you do ?
PAUL : I`m for pardoning them .
Especially now after , you know , they`ve served one year and they tacked on this ten years of mandatory sentencing , which I disagree with .
As a matter of fact , I`ve joined Bill Delahunt to recommend that as sense of Congress resolution .
So I think -- I think they should be pardoned .
BECK : I`ve only got 30 seconds .
Johnny Sutton , do you believe Johnny Sutton -- something doesn`t smell right there to me .
Would you -- would you investigate what was going on with this administration and Johnny Sutton and everything in between ?
PAUL : Can I confess that you`ll have to tell mea little bit more ?
I hate to have to confess I don`t know .
BECK : That`s all right .
He`s the -- he`s the prosecutor in the -- in the case .
PAUL : Oh , OK .
BECK : It seems pretty -- it seems pretty nefarious .
PAUL : Yes , yes .
And that is part of my reason for wanting the pardon , because I think there are a lot of questions ...
BECK : Right .
PAUL : ... raised on how that case was carried out .
So yes .
Yes , I agree with that .
BECK : We`ll be back in just a second .
I want to talk to Ron Paul and get his thoughts on the real reason he says our economy is in so much trouble .
Next .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAUL : There`s been one main thing that we have done wrong , and one main thing that we do right solves that .
We should just follow the Constitution .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAUL : This is an ideological battle .
Some people believe in globalism .
Others believe in national sovereignty .
And there is a move on towards a North American Union , just like early on , there was a move on for a European Union .
And it eventually ended up .
So we had NAFTA and moving toward a NAFTA highway .
These are real things .
It`s not somebody made these up .
It`s not a conspiracy .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : Back with presidential candidate Dr. Ron Paul .
One of the places that I think you and I agree on probably the most is economy and our government spending .
We`re spending ourselves right back to 1929 , if we`re lucky , I believe .
And , boy , there`s just some bad things that are popping up that nobody seems to want to look at .
Seventy percent of the real gross domestic product in our country , 70 percent , is just from people spending money .
How did we get to this point ?
And more importantly , as president of the United States , what would you do to get us out of it ?
PAUL : Well , we`ve got to -- we have to stop the spending .
We have to bring our budget under control .
We can`t raise taxes to cut the deficit .
We have to cut spending .
Of course , where I want to cut spending might not be where you would like to have cut spending , but I want to cut the spending overseas .
I don`t think we can maintain our empire and we can get control of our budget .
Mainly for political reasons , as much as anything else , because you can`t go after health care here in this country and say you`re going to balance the budget .
But we have to take the pressure off the Fed to create money .
You know , we spend and then we tax and then we borrow , and we still don`t have enough money .
So we have this ridiculous monetary system where we go to the Federal Reserve and say , " Buy these treasury bills , " and they buy the treasury bills out of the clear -- out of the clear blue , out of thin air .
And this is causing the inflation .
The cost of living for our retired people now are going up probably 10 percent a year , and they`re getting cost of living increases of 2 percent .
This is why so many people are unhappy .
So we have to deal with the budget .
To me , it is the most critical thing .
And if we don`t , we`re going to have a financial crisis and a dollar collapse .
It`s going to be a lot worse than it was in 1979 and 1980 when we saved the dollar with interest rates at 21 percent .
BECK : Hang on .
You say that you want to cut it in -- in foreign spending .
And we`re going to get to that here in just a little bit .
But you know and I know in the last four years we had a -- we had a real deficit of $ 26 trillion .
You know , I`m a little loose on the numbers , but it was about $ 26 trillion just in Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid and , I think , the Railroad Union or retirement fund .
PAUL : Right .
BECK : And now just in four years , just because of interest and everything else we`re piling on top , now that real deficit is $ 46 trillion .
Did I hear you right that you would not take that on ?
PAUL : Oh , no .
We have to .
And those are future obligations .
But what I was talking about was tomorrow`s budget .
We have to immediately change the tune , the tone of it so that we don`t have these huge deficits and we continue to increase it .
But , you know , the Republicans were elected to do something about that .
So what did we do ?
We passed doubling the size of the Department of Education and had prescription drug programs increase these entitlements , and they can`t be paid .
And this is why the young people are frightened by what`s happening .
I think it`s one of the reasons young people are coming to our campaign , is that I want them to get out of the system .
I want them to get out of Social Security , if they want .
And I want us to live within our means and cut back .
But we need -- we need to cut these domestic programs .
Ronald Reagan , you recall when he ran on getting rid of the Department of Education .
You know , I still believe that we should do that .
I don`t think it helps education and spends all this money .
Either we have to do something or we will have a crisis .
BECK : You -- you say you want to cut all of these things , and you want people out .
And so do I .
You want to go back to more of a libertarian kind of life , and that`s really where we started .
We were libertarians at the beginning .
But I have to tell you , sir , if you read the Founding Fathers` words , and I know you do , you`ve got to be a religious and moral people .
Well , we`re , generally speaking , not necessarily religious and moral people .
There are people that will not do for themselves .
How do you finally say to people , " You know what ?
You don`t have a right to health care .
You don`t have a right to all of the things that we`ve given " ?
Bloomberg just today is starting to pay people for showing up to go to free school .
How do you get off of that ?
PAUL : Yes -- no .
Well , I think you just deny them the benefits .
And we will be denying the benefits when we run out of money and the system collapses .
All I want to do is make sure we start before we have the financial crisis .
But the -- we are an immoral national , but the immorality is through our government .
You know , Bastiat , when he wrote the law , he made this very clearly the point .
He says , if you and I can`t steal from our neighbors , we don`t have the moral right to ask our neighbor -- our government to do the same thing .
So it is the moral aspect of the law .
And we have become an immoral nation , because we think that , if you transfer wealth through the government force , that it`s legitimate , it`s an entitlement , and they have a right to it .
As long as we have that , no .
There`s no way .
You and I will probably agree with that .
There`s no way we can solve our problem .
But if you feed the system and allow people ...
BECK : Right .
PAUL : ... to get these benefits and perpetuate the welfare state , it never will reverse .
So I stay start reversing it and start cutting the spending .
BECK : Back in a second with presidential candidate Ron Paul .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAUL : We`ve spent too much .
We tax too much .
We borrow too much , and we print too much .
When a country spends way beyond its means , eventually it will destroy the currency , and we`re in the midst of a currency crisis .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : We`re with presidential candidate Ron Paul .
And , boy , there`s something that nobody else says .
Nobody on Wall Street will say that .
And it only makes common sense that we are destroying our own currency .
One of the things that I think attracts me to libertarians is the idea of getting back to the gold standard and abolishing the IRS .
Is it true -- I believe I have read that you say if you don`t pay your taxes , you are in the category of civil disobedience akin with Gandhi and Martin Luther King .
PAUL : Well , I -- I think it`s practicing the same principle , yes , because the income tax , the way it`s collected is unconstitutional .
And if you believe that , and you practice civil disobedience , you to suffer the consequences .
I chose to try to change the law .
I haven`t chosen that method .
But people who sincerely believe that it`s unconstitutional to be guilty until you prove yourself innocent and you be your own -- you have to testify against yourself , I think they have a legitimate cause .
And I think it`s a libertarian principle to practice civil disobedience .
It`s non-violent .
BECK : How do you ...
PAUL : So I think it`s a good way of doing it .
BECK : How do you change the tax code ?
I mean , we`ve been saying -- every American knows this doesn`t work .
I don`t need a book this big to show me how to pay my taxes .
When you`ve got former communist countries going to a flat tax and they`re getting more money , how are you going to change this ?
How are you going to abolish the IRS or go to a flat tax ?
Or what is your proposal ?
PAUL : Well , mine is to get rid of the IRS but not replace it with anything by cutting a lot of spending .
Because we lived without an income tax before 1913 .
So I`m not interested in the flat tax or the -- or the sales tax .
You know ?
Although anything would -- anything would be better .
BECK : Yes .
Just what you`re saying , I mean , you`re speaking -- I mean , you know , if we weren`t both men , you know , I might have to French kiss you on the whole abolishing the IRS thing .
You had me at hello .
You did .
No , you did .
So -- so you want to replace it with -- with a -- with some sort of a sales tax ?
PAUL : No , nothing .
BECK : Nothing .
How ...
PAUL : I want to replace it with freedom .
I want to replace it with freedom and less spending .
BECK : OK .
But wait a minute .
Hang on just a second .
PAUL : But you`re right .
Yes , OK .
BECK : I mean , I love you .
Don`t get me wrong .
How do we pay for the things we do have to pay for ?
PAUL : Well , you know , if you didn`t have the income tax right now , you`d have the same amount of revenue as you had 10 years ago .
So that`s not all that bad .
And we didn`t have an income tax before 1913 .
They used -- they used tariffs and they used user fee types and different things like that .
BECK : But wouldn`t you create the same ...
PAUL : The problem is spending .
BECK : Oh , I agree with you .
But wouldn`t you create the same kind of situation if you had user fees ?
Because then you`d have special interests that were just saying , no , this one should be exempt and this one shouldn`t .
PAUL : Well , I guess so .
But anything would be better than the income tax .
But , you know , if you -- if we do have a user fee , which we abuse , you have a user fee by paying a national gasoline tax .
And that`s supposed to take care of our highways , but they abuse that system , too .
BECK : Yes , yes .
PAUL : They don`t spend it on the highways , and they use it for political boondoggles is what happens .
BECK : Back in a minute with Dr. Paul`s controversial views on foreign policy , the CIA , FBI , the Patriot Act and the war on drugs .
He`ll get more than 30 seconds to explain it all .
Stick around .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
PAUL : It`s our foreign policy that I object to .
We used to be allies with Osama bin Laden .
Now he`s our enemy .
We used to be allies with Saddam Hussein .
Now he`s our enemy .
This on - again , off - again thing is what bothers me .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : We are back with presidential candidate Ron Paul .
He is with us for a full hour .
If you watch my program quite often , or listen to it , for the last year or so I`ve been on a book that I told American to read , " The Five Thousand Year Leap . "
It is the words of the founding fathers .
If we don`t find our way back to the Constitution soon , we are in real , real trouble .
With that being said , we are facing things our founding fathers could have never , ever imagined , even a 727 I don`t think they could have imagined at the time .
I wanted to have Ron Paul on for a full hour because he`s got some pretty controversial things to say on foreign policy , et cetera , et cetera .
But when you state them in 20 - second sound bites , you really -- it looks ridiculous .
It really does .
So I want him to be able to have the time to expand on them .
So , Dr. Paul , let`s start here .
I have a problem with us being in bed with dirt bags .
I think Saudi Arabia is an evil country run by evil people , and I don`t understand why we -- we embrace the enemy of our enemy as our friend .
I think in many ways we`ve taught them we don`t stand for anything .
So why not ?
However , how do we get out ?
Your -- if I understand it , your idea is just unplug from the Middle East .
How do we do that ?
PAUL : We just went in .
We should just leave .
You know who it was that committed us to Saudi Arabia ?
It was FDR during World War II because we wanted to secure the oil .
BECK : Right .
PAUL : But because of that persistence , that was one of the greatest annoyances to Osama bin Laden , our troops in Saudi Arabia .
That is what motivated them to really motivate enough people to commit suicide terrorism .
And we have to understand that .
It`s so important .
BECK : Do you actually believe that if we walk away from the Middle East , that the terrorists will leave us alone ?
That the people in the extremist regime , let`s just say , in Iran is not serious when they call us " The Great Satan , " that we`ll burn in the fire of the Islamic fury ?
That they`ll just leave Israel alone and not -- not destroy and push them into the sea ?
PAUL : Well , yes , I think they will because they`re scared to death of Israel .
Israel , it would be more powerful if we weren`t holding them back .
I mean , nobody is going to touch Israel .
They have 300 nuclear weapons .
And we restrain them when they want to settle their disputes when they`re bored and we have restrained them when they want to have peace treaties or deal with the Arab League .
So I would say they`d be much stronger .
So ...
BECK : So you`re saying that we actually hurt Israel by being their friend ?
We should have no foreign aid to Israel at all ?
If Israel asked for our help , should we be involved ?
PAUL : Not unless the Congress authorizes , you know , for war or something .
But when you say no foreign aid , you say no foreign aid to Israel .
And I say , oh , we give foreign aid to the Arabs three times greater than Israel .
BECK : Oh , no , no , no .
I`m not ...
PAUL : So , we are not only neutralizing things -- so , you know , we really neutralize things much better .
Israel is in better shape by no foreign aid to anybody .
BECK : Yes .
PAUL : And so it`s not anti-Israel .
It `s just neutral .
You know , we treat Israel like a second - class citizen .
You know , you understand the issue at home when you treat people with Welfare , they become dependent on the state .
Israel is dependent on us , you know , for economic means .
We send them these billions of dollars and then they depend on us .
They say , well , you know , we don`t like Iran .
You go fight our battles .
You bomb Iran for us .
And they become dependent on us .
BECK : Oh , I think we`re holding -- I think you`re mistaken there .
I think we`re holding Israel back from bombing Iran .
PAUL : I do .
BECK : I don`t think -- I don`t think ...
PAUL : Well , again , that is my point .
BECK : Oh , OK .
PAUL : If Iran wants to do it -- if Iran wants to -- if Israel wants to do it , we hold them back .
So they lose their sovereignty to us because they become dependent on us .
And just like I don`t like to lose our sovereignty to the United Nations , Israel has become subservient to us , and I think we should protect their sovereignty and respect their sovereignty as much as I want our sovereignty to be respected .
BECK : But there is a -- there is a global movement within Islam that would like to see -- I mean , I`ll show you the pictures of it .
I`ve -- you know , I`ve met with the people here in New York City .
And , you know , I`ve -- I detailed them in a book that I just put out where I show the pictures of the Islamic jihadist flag flying over the White House in , you know , in a Web site .
They have every intention of taking this country and turning it over to Sharia law .
Are you really serious ?
Do you believe that this is just about us being over in Saudi Arabia and in the Middle East ?
PAUL : No .
Yes , I think that`s a motivating factor .
But I think everything you said is true .
But you`ve got to put it in perspective .
You`re talks about several hundred people .
Maybe now thousands since we`ve been over there .
Al Qaeda has been recruiting much better .
BECK : Well , it only took 19 to take two down of the biggest towers in the world .
PAUL : That is the reason , because we have to put that in perspective .
You know , we stood down the Soviets .
They had 40,000 nuclear weapons .
We had Khrushchev pounding on the desk saying we will bury you .
He was capable of doing it .
The al Qaeda does not have an army , they don`t have a Navy , they don`t have intercontinental ballistic missiles , they don`t have weapons of mass destruction , they don`t have a country .
They`re very , very weak people in that sense .
But they have determination .
The determination comes from being provoked .
And they have to have some reason to galvanize enough hatred to come here and do what they have done .
So , no , it`s not going to be -- if I bring the troops home overnight , it`s not going to eliminate what has been going on for quite a few decades .
But I`ll tell you what , it`s going it be a lot better .
And if we think that they only come here because we`re free and prosperous , we will never solve this problem .
We are going to be under threat because if we -- let`s say the fighting quits in Iraq and we keep those 14 bases and an embassy as big as the Vatican and think that won`t annoy people ?
It will be a thorn in their side and we will be under as much threat .
We are an easy target over there and they`re quite satisfied for killing Americans in Iraq .
BECK : OK .
PAUL : But if we`re no longer an easy target , they`ll come back here .
That is what my fear is .
BECK : All right .
So , Dr. Paul , honestly , before September 11th , I didn`t care about the Middle East .
They`ve been fighting for 5,000 years .
They could have fallen into a giant sinkhole .
I don`t care .
However , things are different now because of , honestly , a lot of the -- you know , this ridiculous oil argument that we have that we can`t get the oil and the energy from our own property and take the oil and the energy and make even nuclear power that we need here in the United States .
So we`re finding ourselves dependent on these people .
So if you can`t drill it here , if you can`t find it here , if you can`t , you k now , create your own energy because it`s so bad for the environment , what choice do we have ?
PAUL : Well , do what you think is a good idea .
Become energy - independent by drilling here and taking care of our own fuel problems and have alternative fuels .
BECK : Would you drill in the ...
PAUL : I think ...
BECK : Would you drill in the ANWR ?
PAUL : Sure .
I voted for that .
And I think ...
BECK : Would you drill off shore if we had to ?
PAUL : Yes , but I would do this with cooperation with the States because the States should have something to say about this .
BECK : Sure .
PAUL : And in federal water , along Texas , we drill a lot down there .
And it`s great fishing grounds .
BECK : Would you as the federal government -- because everybody is freaked -- would you say , you know what ?
I`m going to back your -- I`m going to give you a loan guarantee if the United States government starts to make hurdles that you can`t pass ?
If you`re a power company that says I want to build a nuclear power plant , but I don`t trust you guys , I`m going to put all this money out and then you`re going to change all the rules on me and then I`m going to be stuck for the money , would you give a loan guarantee to those power companies so they would be willing to put out all that money ?
PAUL : No , no loan guarantees .
That`s a distortion .
That would cause malinvestment .
What you want to do is get the government out of the way and let the market work .
When the price goes up , alternative fuels will come in .
If you let the bureaucrats give loan guarantees , then you might end up subsidizing some fuel that is not most efficient .
So you`ve got to believe the market will pick and choose .
You know , if oil prices go sky high , well cut back on our usage , but somebody else is going to come up with another fuel .
Maybe we`d use nuclear .
We need to get out of the way for nuclear .
Maybe we`d have electric cars for all we know .
Government and politicians don`t know what the best source is .
BECK : Why do you believe this has happened ?
Why is it ?
Is it -- is it global corporations ?
Is it evil big business ?
Is it evil government ?
What is it ?
Why are we -- why do we find ourselves -- here we are the most powerful nation on the planet when we choose to be , we have done -- we have brought -- we`ve brought the 5,000 - year leap for mankind .
How is it we find ourselves in this situation ?
PAUL : Well , we`ve lost our way .
We don`t believe in the Constitution anymore .
We don`t believe in markets .
We have to have safety nets for the poor , we have to have a safety net for the rich and the corporations and the bankers .
You know , we have a mortgage bubble crash .
We had to bail out the mortgage companies .
Everybody gets bailed out .
So , yes , we just lost our confidence and our understanding .
It`s a remnant of mercantilism , that you have to protect your supplies , your national resources .
And that`s why we`re over in the Middle East .
You know , it has to do with oil .
BECK : Help people understand , because you talk safety nets and everybody will say , well , you`re just evil .
Because I believe true libertarian thought requires people to step over a homeless man , as opposed to having the government bail them out .
And I don`t think most people will do that .
They don`t want to help , but they want somebody else to help .
And if you`re truly free , you have to help .
Not the government .
PAUL : Yes , and it should be more charitable .
But if you`re a humanitarian , you have to be a constitutionalist and believe in the free markets , because if you look at how we`ve eradicated famine off and on , until the government gets back involved again , true famine was eradicated with capitalism and free markets .
So if a person is humanitarian and cares about the poor and the sick , you have to believe in freedom because socialism and welfarism and corporatism , all of this stuff , it doesn`t work .
You create more poor people and more people that are hungry .
It is n`t so much stepping over people , as saying that there will be so few of them .
And we`ll have so much more prosperity .
We`ll have more charity .
We`d go back to the times when the churches ran the hospitals rather than governments .
And then we get government mandates and the hospitals have to close because they have to take care of people by federal government mandates .
So we`ve messed it up because we`ve lost our confidence in the Constitution .
BECK : OK .
Dr. Paul , I`m going to take a break .
And in the break , I`m going to feed something down to your location that I`m not going to show on the air .
My life has been threatened .
I`ve had to wear a vest and have securities .
I`ve had an S.W.A.T. team watch my family because of people who say they support you .
I want to show you something that is out on the Internet about me and from people that say they support you .
And I want to get your thoughts on this , and let`s set to rest some things when we come back .
Shall we ?
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : We`re back with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul , who is joining us tonight for a full hour .
I want to make this very clear .
I believe that Ron Paul , in general , the group of supporters , some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road , are amazing people .
Without any help from the official campaign , Ron Paul supporters have coined the term " The Ron Paul Revolution . "
They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $ 4 million .
They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign .
Last Sunday , they held a tea party , where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $ 6 million .
But the downside is , when you have rabid supporters , some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name .
And I just in the break showed Dr. Paul just a clip , a very small part of a five - minute video that is on the Internet where I am named a traitor and traitors should be executed .
Can you -- would you like to address that at all , sir ?
PAUL : Well , I can only in general .
I have no idea who the people are .
I`ve never heard about this .
I haven`t seen this before .
But all I can do is address the subject of violence .
I`m committed to nonviolence , no initiation of aggression .
These are my political viewpoints .
I believe in political change coming about in the mode of Gandhi and Martin Luther King , through nonviolence .
I happen to believe that we should practice these principles both domestically against individuals , as well as other countries .
This is the reason I don`t use aggression against other countries to bring about changes .
Everyone initiates aggression .
This is what is in our Constitution , and so I reject anybody that would use violence , because , you know , in the same stance , our supporters have coined the words " love " in the revolution and " peace " and " hope . "
So that is the tone that I know about .
That is the tone that I hear .
And that`s the only thing I hear at our rallies .
So I don`t endorse -- I don`t have to endorse what they do and what they -- if they try to get away with attaching my name to what they do , it`s wrong .
BECK : OK .
Here`s what the people who are -- at least the ones that I have met and received tons of mail -- and I could read them to you if you want , sir , where they`re calling for my death -- they say that I am part of a 9/11 conspiracy .
And I have watched the interviews with you .
You don`t leave any room for any doubt on a 9/11 conspiracy .
But I`d just like to make it clear and ask you -- I don`t believe these need explanation unless I`ve read your answers wrong elsewhere .
But may I just run through these 9/11 conspiracies ?
No plane hit the Pentagon on September 11th .
Instead , it was a missile fired by elements from inside the American state apparatus .
Yes or no ?
PAUL : It`s preposterous .
BECK : OK .
The planes that hit the World Trade Center towers were remotely controlled ?
PAUL : I mean , this is just bizarre .
BECK : OK .
PAUL : I`ve not even heard of these challenges before .
BECK : I understand .
I don`t mean to -- sir , these are the people that -- these -- some of these people speak in your name and they actually say that you will be on this program tonight and you will answer the way you`re answering now because you can`t let on .
They believe that you are part of this -- of a -- of another kind of conspiracy to expose the conspiracy of 9/11 and the World Trade Center .
Can you --
I mean , I don`t know how you -- I don`t know how you address people who are so deepy into conspiracy , but can you ?
PAUL : I don`t know what I would be supposed to be doing .
No .
I don`t think there`s any evidence ...
BECK : Is there -- is there any evidence or is there any doubt in your mind that the United States government was not involved in the September 11th attacks ?
That we did not bring down World Trade Center number seven ?
PAUL : Well , yes , I absolutely believe that is true .
They did not .
But the connection may be and where some people get carried away , is if you dig through those $ 40 billion worth of intelligence - gathering apparatus that we had before 9/11 , you know , we dig up information and there was some ineptness .
And sometimes when you find ineptness in government , it`s easy to make this giant leap over into conspiracy , and they do it on purpose .
But , you know , we had an FBI agent on 70 different occasions reported that these individuals were flying airplanes and not learning how to land them .
And he was totally ignored .
BECK : Right .
PAUL : I consider this ineptness on government , not a conspiracy that , oh , yes , we know about it , we can`t wait until the towers come down .
No , I don`t believe that at all .
I think -- I don`t even think I should have to answer questions like that .
BECK : Yes , sir , I do not believe that this is your point of view .
And I don`t believe this is the point of view of most of your supporters , the vast , vast majority .
And it`s just -- you know , Rosie O`Donnell , Charlie Sheen have gone down this road , and it is a growing movement .
And quite honestly , I think it`s a dangerous movement .
Back in just a second .
Final thoughts from Dr. Ron Paul .
I let him control the agenda .
Three minutes , his thoughts coming up .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : We are back with presidential candidate Ron Paul .
Dr. Paul , many of your supporters feel that the mainstream media is not fair to you .
They don`t either let you talk about the issues that you feel are most important , or worse , they distort your words .
That`s why I`ve agreed to let this final segment be up to you .
First of all , fair interview with you tonight , sir ?
PAUL : Yes , very much so .
And I got a much better interview than I`ve gotten from some other interviewers on other stations .
So I am pleased with that .
You allowed me to answer the questions .
BECK : OK .
I want to give you the final -- the final word here .
You`ve got about two minutes .
Is there anything that we didn`t cover that you think is important that you -- that you feel is essential or something you want to go back and correct ?
PAUL : No , I think we`ve covered everything pretty well .
I can just summarize pretty much what we`ve been talking about and why people join us .
And I do talk a lot about the Constitution .
And to me , the Constitution is very libertarian .
So if you`re a constitutionalist , you`re really a libertarian , which means that you want a lot less government .
The Constitution was meant to restrain the government and not restrain the people .
I make a very important point that freedom is a unit .
But about 100 years ago or so , for some reason , our country divided into two pieces -- personal liberty and economic liberty .
And it should be all one thing .
If you have a right to life and a right to your liberty , you can -- you have a right to lead your lifestyle as you choose .
But you also have a right to the fruits of your labor , and that`s why I`m so opposed to the income tax .
You should have control of your economic life as well .
But , the big problem is , is that when you give that much freedom to individuals , they have to assume responsibility .
And you even indicated before that if you`re not a moral society and you don`t assume this responsibility , it causes problems .
And Franklin , Benjamin Franklin , warned us about that .
We have to assume responsibility for ourselves .
But , quite frankly , I`ve been talking to a lot of young people , and I believe that they are ready and welcome -- welcoming this message because they`re sick and tired of what they`re getting .
They`re getting a huge debt , a Social Security system that doesn`t work , a flawed foreign policy , and this endless debt .
And I think that this country is really ready for some significant change .
I think the large majority of the American people are ready for changes , and that the -- the base of the Republican Party and the base of the Democratic Party is pretty small compared to the people who are disgruntled .
BECK : Dr. Paul , thank you very much .
America , goodnight .
PAUL : Thank you .

For our latest mission , 16 agents staged a spontaneous musical in the food court of a Los Angeles shopping mall .
We used wireless microphones to amplify the vocal performances and mix them together with the music through the mall ’s PA system .
We filmed the mission with hidden cameras , mostly behind two - way mirrors .
Apart from our performers , no one in the food court was aware of what was happening .
Enjoy the video first and then go behind the scenes with our report below .
Watch all of our other musicals !
We ’ve had tons of ideas emailed to us over the years .
Out of all of them , one stands out as the absolute most suggested : “ You know how it ’s weird in musicals that people just break out into song for no reason ?
You guys should stage a musical like that in a public place . ”
We ’ve probably gotten over 100 emails just like that .
Well , we finally decided it was time to make it happen .
It should be noted that staging a musical in a public place is not a new idea .
It ’s been done before by several groups , the most popular of which took place in a lecture hall , staged several years ago by the old Columbia University group , Prangstgrup .
We wanted to create an original song for this mission , so I turned to Agents Brown and King , longtime Improv Everywhere Agents and writers of the hit Off - Broadway show , Gutenberg !
The Musical !
Unfortunately there are very few photos from this mission .
It took place in Los Angeles , so our normal photographers were not around .
We decided to focus on getting the best video possible , and photography was sadly left out .
We do have a few photos of our rehearsal process .
Agent Tallaksen leads rehearsal
We met the day before to rehearse the song and learn the choreography .
Agent Tallaksen did an excellent job as the choreographer , bringing the song to life and adding in ridiculously hilarious blocking .
Since we are not based out of LA , and this mission took place before our new global site was launched , we had to do a bit of searching to find the right agents .
A few were personal friends of mine , a few were actors from the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in LA , and some answered a casting call on craigslist .
The mall we chose is in the middle of downtown LA and is very racially diverse .
It was important to us to have an equal amount of diversity in the cast .
Typically Improv Everywhere does not ask for permission from the location where we are staging our mission .
This was a rare exception .
By working with the mall we would gain incredible access and be able to make the experience for the food court patrons all the more awesome .
The mall let us rehearse the song the night before after they had closed .
We were able to test out our blocking and make sure it worked with the food court layout .
The mall let us patch the performers microphones and the music into their PA system , which would make the performance loud and clear for everyone there .
We were also able to install two - way mirrors in several spots to enable us to film the mission with our cameras completely hidden , again making the experience for those who would witness it all the more unique .
There is a hidden camera hiding behind the tinted glass in the door above .
The mall got us in touch with the folks from Hot Dog on a Stick , a west - coast corndog chain that had a location in the food court .
The chain loaned us one of their uniforms for Agent Campbell to wear , and gave her access to behind the counter .
Hilariously , Agent Campbell ended up having to actually help several customers as we were waiting for the mission to begin .
While the management of both the mall and Hot Dog on a Stick were aware of what we were doing , they kept the mission a secret from everyone else .
All of the employees of the other food court establishments had absolutely no idea that our musical was going to take place .
The execution of the mission itself was tons of fun .
It was awesome to watch the reactions of the folks sitting and eating as one by one people started joining in on the song .
The coolest moment happened when Agent Caldwell broke into song .
He was playing the role “ janitor ” and had actually been clearing trash off of people ’s tables for a half - hour leading up to the mission .
It was fun to see people realize that the man who had cleaned up their table five minutes ago was now singing in the middle of a musical .
Agent Caldwell
The security guard moment also worked really well .
Agent Sutton wore a black “ security ” jacket that was identical to the real mall security .
You could feel the tension grow after he entered , with everyone assuming he was there to shut down the performance .
It was a great misdirect .
Agents Brister and Sutton
There were several agents who got cut out of the video ( you can hear their parts in the song included above . )
We had three skater punks skate in and sing , a group of young girls did a cheer about napkins , and several more agents posing as regular folks eating joined in for the finale .
By the end there were shoppers lined up watching us from the second level , and we got a nice round of applause when we finished .
However , there was no bow .
Our agents returned to whatever they were doing before the song broke out , as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened .
Mission Accomplished .

The Musical
It ’s the deadliest conflict since World War II .
More than 5 million people have died in the past decade , yet it goes virtually unnoticed and unreported in the United States .
The conflict is in the Democratic Republic of Congo , in Central Africa .
At its heart are the natural resources found in Congo and multinational corporations that extract them .
The prospects for peace have slightly improved : A peace accord was just signed in Congo ’s eastern Kivu provinces .
But without a comprehensive truth and reconciliation process for the entire country and a renegotiation of all mining contracts , the suffering will undoubtedly continue .
In its latest Congo mortality report , the International Rescue Committee found that a stunning 5.4 million “ excess deaths ” have occurred in Congo since 1998 .
These are deaths beyond those that would normally occur .
In other words , a loss of life on the scale of Sept. 11 occurring every two days , in a country whose population is one - sixth our own .
Just a little history :
After supporting the allies in World War II , Congo gained independence and elected Patrice Lumumba , a progressive Pan-Africanist , as prime minister in 1960 .
He was assassinated soon after in a plot involving the CIA .
The U.S. installed and supported Mobutu Sese Seko , who ruled tyrannically for more than 30 years , plundering the nation .
Since his death , Congo has seen war , from 1996 to 2002 , provoked by invasions by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda , and ongoing conflict since then .
A particularly horrifying aspect of the conflict is the mass sexual violence being used as a weapon of war .
Congolese human - rights activist Christine Schuler Deschryver told me about the hundreds of thousands of women and children subjected to rape :
“ We are not talking about normal rapes anymore .
We are talking about sexual terrorism , because they are destroyed — you cannot imagine what ’s going on in Congo .
We are talking about new surgery to repair the women , because they ’re completely destroyed . ”
She was describing the physical damage done to the women , and to children , one , she said , as young as 10 months old , by acts of rape that involve insertion of sticks , guns and molten plastic .
Deschryver was in the U.S. as a guest of V - Day , Eve Ensler ’s campaign to end violence against women , in an attempt to generate public awareness of this genocide and to support the Panzi Hospital in Deschryver ’s hometown of Bukavu .
Maurice Carney is executive director of Friends of the Congo , in Washington , D.C. : “ Two types of rape , basically , are taking place in the Congo :
One is the rape of the women and children , and the other the rape of the land , natural resources .
The Congo has tremendous natural resources : 30 percent of the world ’s cobalt , 10 percent of the world ’s copper , 80 percent of the world ’s reserves of coltan .
You have to look at the corporate influence on everything that takes place in the Congo . ”
Among the companies Carney blames for fueling the violence are Cleveland - based OM Group , the world ’s leading producer of cobalt - based specialty chemicals and a leading supplier of nickel - based specialty chemicals , as well as Boston - based chemical giant Cabot Corp .
Cabot produces coltan , also known as tantalum , a hard - to - extract but critical component of electronic circuitry , which is used in all cell phones and other consumer electronics .
The massive demand for coltan is credited with fueling the Second Congo War of 1998 - 2002 .
A former CEO of Cabot is none other than the Bush administration ’s current secretary of energy , Samuel Bodman .
Phoenix - based Freeport - McMoRan , which took over the Phelps Dodge company ’s enormous mining concession in the Congo , is also in on the game .
The United Nations has issued several reports that are highly critical of illegal corporate exploitation of the Congo ’s minerals .
A Congolese government review of more than 60 mining contracts call for their renegotiation or outright cancellation .
Says Carney , “ Eighty percent of the population live on 30 cents a day or less , with billions of dollars going out the back door and into the pockets of mining companies . ”
An important question for us in the U.S. is :
How could close to 6 million people die from war and related disease in one country in less than a decade and go virtually unnoticed ?

NEW YORK ( Fortune Magazine ) --
It 's 1900 hours on Veterans Day in Fayetteville , N.C. , a pistol shot from the Fort Bragg military base .
Ten minutes ago a 25 - year - old self - taught engineer named Adam Gettings pulled into the Waffle House parking lot , lifted the hatch of his black SUV , and unveiled what could very well be the future of urban warfare : a toy - like but gun-wielding robot designed to replace human soldiers on the battlefield .
It 's two feet tall , travels ten miles an hour , and spins on a dime .
Remote - controlled over an encrypted frequency that jams nearby radios and cellphones , it 'll blow a ten - inch hole through a steel door with deadly accuracy from 400 meters .
Now Gettings is sitting calmly on the other side of a plate of fried eggs and sliced tomatoes , talking about how his company , Robotex , has teamed up with a wild - eyed Tennessee shotgun designer to rethink the development strategy for military technology . "
The idea that you can use investor money rather than [ government ] research money - that 's a new thing , " says Gettings , who 's in town for SpecOps , a war - fighter technology conference .
Military contractors typically get the funding to build , test , and sell new weapons systems from federal agencies .
It can take forever .
Robotex , based in Palo Alto , is financed by angel investors and went from idea to product in six months .
" This is the new defense , Silicon Valley - style , " says Gettings .
" You build only what 's necessary , iterate quickly , and keep the price low . "
How low ?
Try $ 30,000 to $ 50,000 .
A similar bot , the Talon , which was developed by defense contractor Foster - Miller and is being tested in Iraq , costs six times that amount .
" Our system does all the same things as the Talon , weighs half as much , and costs a fraction , " says Gettings .
An endorsement from Blackwater
Robotex is the brainchild of Terry Izumi , a reclusive filmmaker who comes from a long line of samurai warriors , has trained Secret Service agents , and worked both at DreamWorks ( Charts ) and in Disney 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) Imagineering division .
When Izumi decided to build a better war robot in 2005 , he recruited Nathan Gettings , a former PayPal software engineer and founder of Palantir Technologies , who brought in his brother Adam as well as a fourth ( silent ) partner who hails from both PayPal and YouTube .
They had a prototype in no time .
But they needed a weapon , and that 's how Jerry Baber , his revolutionary shotgun , and a pilotless mini-helicopter come into the picture .
Baber is the fast - talking , white - haired founder of Military Police Systems , an arms manufacturer and ammunition distributor based in the hills of eastern Tennessee .
When his chums at Blackwater , the security contractor , told him that the Robotex guys were the real deal , he invited them for a visit .
" I called Nathan and Adam on a Monday , and on Thursday they were here , " says Baber .
With that meeting , he turned a promising little robot into something both multifunctional and truly scary .
His company 's $ 8,000 Atchisson Assault - 12 shotgun was fresh off the assembly line after a dozen years in development .
It 's made of aircraft - grade stainless steel , never needs lubrication or cleaning , and wo n't rust .
Pour sand through it and it wo n't clog .
It does n't recoil , so it 's accurate even when it 's firing in automatic mode , which it does at a rate of 300 rounds per minute .
" It delivers the lead equivalent of 132 M16s , " says Baber .
" When they start firing from every direction , it 's all over . "
Is the military really ready to deploy robot soldiers ?
And the AA - 12 is versatile .
Along with firing ridiculously powerful FRAG - 12 ammo - a straight - out - of - Terminator shell that contains a whirling miniature grenade - the AA - 12 can handle non-lethal Tasers and even bullets that are deadly up to 120 feet but fall harmlessly by 800 feet .
Limited - range bullets are important in urban combat situations , Baber explains , because once an insurgent gets between the robot and a soldier operating it on the ground , the bot is rendered useless - unless the soldier wants to shoot at himself .
Baber has paired the AH and its smaller sibling , the MH , with a remote - control mini-helicopter called the AutoCopter , which holds two AA - 12s and can carry the bots into battle .
His plan is to buy the robots from Robotex and the helicopter from Neural Robotics in Huntsville , Ala .
Then he 's going to arm them , resell the systems , and split the profits .
It 's a classic Silicon Valley tale of a few engineers who do what they 're best at , team up with some kindred spirits , and together build a product to take on the establishment .
The wild cards here , of course , are Beltway bureaucracy and public sentiment .
Is the military really ready for low - cost killer robots ?
Are you ?
At 72 , Baber says he does n't have a lot of time to wait to see his system deployed .
And the next step is the toughest .
" It 's a bitch , let me tell you , " he says of trying to sell innovative concepts into an entrenched government procurement system .
But he has a plan .
First , the entire armory will go on display in Blackwater 's lobby .
That should get some attention .
If not , he 's counting on a public outcry .
" If moms and dads around the country find out this system is available while their sons are off sopping up bullets in Iraq , they 're going to tear the White House down , " he says .
" This will take the soldiers out of harm 's way . "

America 's Next Top Model Drinks Her Own Breast Milk
Try not to hurl while reading this but it has been reported that Claire , a contestant on America 's Next Top Model , drinks her own breast milk .
I hope you are all as appalled as I am and that this does n't start a new weight loss strategy or something crazy like that .
Tyra Banks , the host of the show chatted about the jug's with her contestant , who said she was wanting to keep them filled so that she can continue breast feeding her child on her return home .
Hmm , wonder if her real motivation was that they might help her chances of winning the reality show ?
This gives new meaning to " Got Milk . "
Crap , if the word gets out there could be a drop in boob jobs .
This is actually very brilliant if you think about it , except for the drinking it part .
Pour the flipping milk down the drain !
I wonder what Christina will do ?

To most Beijingers , the receipt the attendant gives them for the six cents paid to use the public toilets in the subway is a worthless piece of scrap , quickly crumpled up and thrown away .
To Hao Jinsong , that piece of paper is a seed of Chinese democracy .
It took the 35 - year - old law scholar a court battle to force the subway authorities to issue the legally required receipt , and he still treasures the one he sued for .
But the chit itself , he says , is not important .
" Behind this receipt is a law that gives people the right to ask for one , " he explains .
" If nobody respects the dignity of the law , everybody loses his own dignity .
If today you lose your right to a receipt , tomorrow you may lose your right to your land , your house , your freedom , and even your life . "
Hyperbole ?
In a country where the rule of law is very much a work in progress , and where the ruling Communist Party routinely dictates judges ' verdicts in sensitive cases , Mr. Hao 's passionate faith in the law might seem naive .
But it is the very weakness of the rule of law in China that inspires his crusade , he says .
If " people do n't use legal recourse to defend themselves because they think it 's useless ... the law grows even weaker , " he argues .
" When ... people use the law as naturally as they use chopsticks , China will be close to democracy , " he adds .
Hao is a pioneer of public interest lawsuits , a growing trend in a country where they were unknown , or dismissed by judges out of hand , only a few years ago .
He and a swelling band of lawyers like him have attracted less international attention than legal activists whose efforts to defend human rights have earned them beatings , house arrest or jail terms .
But they are achieving prominence in China , and winning plaudits from their peers .
" We need someone to stand up and challenge shortcomings of institutions , " says Wu Ge , a law professor at Beijing 's Tsinghua University .
Hao is best known for lawsuits he has brought against the powerful Ministry of Railroads , challenging its refusal to give tax receipts for goods bought on trains , and its ticket pricing policy .
He won the receipt case , on his third attempt , earning the government $ 2.7 million a year in tax revenue from the railroads .
And though he lost two court battles to stop the railroad management raising ticket prices during the Spring Festival , when 150 million Chinese go home for the holidays , his campaign attracted wide public support .
Management bowed to the pressure , and has left holiday ticket prices untouched for the past two years .
That , says Yiyi Lu , a researcher at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London who has written a study of public interest lawsuits in China , is an example of how " you do n't need to win the case to win the cause . "
Key to such victories has been media coverage and the public debate it provokes .
Though Chinese newspapers do n't dare report court cases involving political dissidents , many of them – including the Communist Party 's mouthpiece the People 's Daily – have written approvingly about Hao 's cases .
This would not happen if Hao confronted the government head on over issues such as free speech .
Instead , he deliberately restricts himself to less political cases , holding the government 's feet to the fire on a goal it has publicly set itself – the rule of law .
" I would like to say the government and I are going forward together , " he explains .
" I do n't want to strip the government of its power , but to curb it . "
Achieving that goal starts with citizens knowing their rights and defending them in court if need be , Hao says .
" Ordinary people have to change into independent - minded citizens before China will be strong , " he argues .
Even independent - minded citizens , however , could be forgiven for steering clear of political action when they see what happens to the few who publicly demand an end to one - party rule in China .
A proponent of gradual change , Hao insists that democracy can only be won " at the right pace .
" It 's like a running track , " he says .
" A few of the elite are leading the pack , but if ordinary people see that the track leads to jail they wo n't dare to get on it .
My way is a way ordinary people can imitate " by going to court to defend their rights as consumers .
" When they realize they have rights , " Hao hopes , " they will call for other rights , like freedom of speech or publication , later . "
Fewer than 20 percent of Chinese public - interest lawsuits end in even partial success for the plaintiffs , according to a 2006 study by legal scholar Huang Jinrong .
But that does not daunt Hao .
The public attention that such cases attract raises public awareness of the uses of the law , he says , and with each case " we change officials ' attitudes . "
Li Heping , a lawyer whose human rights work has earned him a round - the - clock police shadow and who was kidnapped and beaten up last year , also believes the sort of work Hao and his colleagues do is helping to change China .
" Each bit of progress has to be made step by step , " he says .
" It takes a lot of people working from different perspectives . "
Hao is currently engaged in a suit against the National Forestry Agency , which he accuses of refusing to investigate a false claim by the Shaanxi provincial authorities that a South China tiger , thought to be extinct , had been photographed .
The incident drew massive interest on the Chinese Internet , and widespread criticism of the authorities for trying to create a lucrative tourist attraction out of a faked photograph .
The lawsuit , Hao says , is designed " to show people that the government does not have the right to say whatever it likes .
The government cannot lie , and ordinary people have the right to unmask the government 's lies . "
Such cases may not shake the world , but " they have a cumulative effect , " says Dr. Lu .
" When lots of people bring them , they contribute to positive change . "
" Today I am just a butterfly flapping my wings in the Beijing sky , " says Hao .
" But in 20 years there will be a storm in the whole country . "
Members of Canada 's scientific community praised the contributions of the national science adviser and expressed regret over the government 's decision to phase out the position at the end of March .
On Wednesday , Industry Canada confirmed that national science adviser Arthur Carty would be retiring on March 31 , and that the position and office would be phased out .
John Smol , a leading ecology professor and researcher with Queen 's University in Kingston , Ont. , said he found the news " troubling and worrisome . "
" Having someone in a position to advise the prime minister or a cabinet minister gave me more confidence in the process , " Smol said .
" There 's so little of this contact between the scientific community and politicians .
If you remove one of those major contacts , I do n't see it as a positive thing . "
Andrew Miall , the president of the Academy of Science of the Royal Society of Canada , said the society did not wish to comment on the government 's decision .
But the University of Toronto geologist , speaking as an individual fellow of the society , said in an e-mail he thought " it unfortunate that a line of communication between the scientific community and the government is to be closed off . "
Carty was originally appointed to the role of national science adviser by Prime Minister Paul Martin on April 1 , 2004 .
Carty , who previously held positions as president of the National Research Council and dean of research at the University of Waterloo , was tasked with providing advice on global science and technology issues and how government can better support and benefit from science conducted in - house .
Carty is credited with helping the Royal Society of Canada , the Canadian Academy of Engineering and the Canadian Institute of Academic Medicine create a new organization , formerly known as the Canadian Academies of Science but renamed the Council of Canadian Academies in 2006 .
The council 's mandate is to act as a " source of independent , expert assessment of the science underlying pressing issues and matters of public interest . "
Council president Peter Nicholson issued a statement acknowledging the " the tremendous contribution that Dr. Carty has made towards the creation of the Council " and praising his " selfless dedication to scientific research and development . "
" I wish Dr. Carty the best , and hope that we can continue to benefit from his wise advice in the future , " Nicholson said .
In a letter to Industry Minister Jim Prentice , Carty said he would be retiring March 31 , the end of the fiscal year .
Industry Canada said in a statement that with the establishment of the Science , Technology and Innovation Council in May 2007 , the government reviewed a number of federal advisory bodies and decided to phase out the office and the role of national science adviser .
The Science , Technology and Innovation Council is a mix of scientists , private sector executives , government administrators and university chancellors whose mandate is to provide policy advice on science and technology issues and produce " regular national reports that measure Canada 's science and technology performance against international standards of excellence , " Industry Canada said when announcing the council .
Smol said the role of national science adviser served a different purpose and can't simply be replaced .
" All of these groups are different fish , " he said .
" The Council of Canadian Academies is more of a think - tank , an organization to conduct longer assessments of issue , and the new council sounds like a different animal as well . "
The science adviser , on the other hand , was potentially someone who could meet one - on - one with top policy makers , he said .
Smol said since most scientific research in Canada is funded through taxpayer support , the government should be adding more lines of communication between policy makers and researchers , not fewer .
" I do n't think enough science is being involved in decision making and policy making as it is , " Smol said .
I probably get 2 - 3 spam emails a week from some company wanting to sell me new wheels for my car .
It 's getting a little annoying , so to strike back , I 'm going to show you how to duplicate the text effect in their ad ...
It 's a bit of a noobish effect , but it 'll make me feel better so I 'm doing it anyway .

Could a gene be partly responsible for the behaviour of some of the worlds most infamous dictators ?
Selfish dictators may owe their behaviour partly to their genes , according to a study that claims to have found a genetic link to ruthlessness .
The study might help to explain the money - grabbing tendencies of those with a Machiavellian streak — from national dictators down to ' little Hitlers ' found in workplaces the world over .
Researchers at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem found a link between a gene called AVPR1a and ruthless behaviour in an economic exercise called the ' Dictator Game ' .
The exercise allows players to behave selflessly , or like money - grabbing dictators such as former Zaire President Mobutu , who plundered the mineral wealth of his country to become one of the world 's richest men while its citizens suffered in poverty .
The researchers do n't know the mechanism by which the gene influences behaviour .
It may mean that for some , the old adage that " it is better to give than to receive " simply is n't true , says team leader Richard Ebstein .
The reward centres in those brains may derive less pleasure from altruistic acts , he suggests , perhaps causing them to behave more selfishly .
Prosocial hormone
Ebstein and his colleagues decided to look at AVPR1a because it is known to produce receptors in the brain that detect vasopressin , a hormone involved in altruism and ' prosocial ' behaviour .
Studies of prairie voles have previously shown that this hormone is important for binding together these rodents ' tight - knit social groups .
Ebstein's team wondered whether differences in how this receptor is expressed in the human brain may make different people more or less likely to behave generously .
To find out , they tested DNA samples from more than 200 student volunteers , before asking the students to play the dictator game ( volunteers were not told the name of the game , lest it influence their behaviour ) .
Students were divided into two groups : ' dictators ' and ' receivers ' ( called ' A ' and ' B ' to the participants ) .
Each dictator was told that they would receive 50 shekels ( worth about US $ 14 ) , but were free to share as much or as little of this with a receiver , whom they would never have to meet .
The receiver 's fortunes thus depended entirely on the dictator 's generosity .
About 18 % of all dictators kept all of the money , Ebstein and his colleagues report in the journal Genes , Brain and Behavior1 .
About one - third split the money down the middle , and a generous 6 % gave the whole lot away .
Long and short
There was no connection between the participants ' gender and their behaviour , the team reports .
But there was a link to the length of the AVPR1a gene : people were more likely to behave selfishly the shorter their version of this gene .
It is n't clear how the length of AVPR1a affects vasopressin receptors : it is thought that rather than controlling the number of receptors , it may control where in the brain the receptors are distributed .
Ebstein suggests the vasopressin receptors in the brains of people with short AVPR1a may be distributed in such a way to make them less likely to feel rewarded by the act of giving .
Though the mechanism is unclear , Ebstein says , he is fairly sure that selfish , greedy dictatorship has a genetic component .
It would be easier to confirm this if history 's infamous dictators conveniently had living identical twins , he says , so we could see if they were just as ruthless as each other .
Keen players
Researchers should nevertheless be careful about using the relatively blunt tool of the Dictator Game to draw conclusions about human generosity , says Nicholas Bardsley at the University of Southampton , UK , who studies such games .

His research suggests that players who routinely give money away as Dictators are also perfectly happy to steal money off other players in games that involve taking rather than giving .
This suggests that the apparently more altruistic players in Ebstein 's game may in fact be motivated by a desire simply to engage fully with the game , perhaps just because they feel that that is what 's expected of them .
If that is true , then apparently ruthless dictators may be motivated not by out - and - out greed but by a simple lack of social skills , which leaves them unable to sense what 's expected of them .
That certainly fits with the image of a naïve yet arrogant dictator with no sense of the inappropriateness of his actions and attitudes .
Such figures have cropped up with surprising regularity throughout history , all the way from the emperors of Rome , through to Napoleon Bonaparte , Benito Mussolini , Saddam Hussein or Robert Mugabe , now tenaciously clinging to power in the face of uncertain electoral results .

Organic Chemistry for the YouTube Generation

Organic chemistry video

No matter how long they pore over their lab manuals , students feel anxious when they step into a science laboratory .
Now a series of dynamic videos created by undergraduate students at the University of California , San Diego is helping them relax and focus on what really matters — the science behind the experiment .
“ Students ca n’t concentrate on concepts when they are stressed about the technical details of performing an experiment , ” said Haim Weizman , a lecturer in U.C. San Diego ’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , who spearheaded the video project .
“ By helping them prepare for the lab , the videos allow students to concentrate on the molecules and see the beauty of what is happening . ”
Over the last few months , the videos , which can be viewed here have been downloaded more than 15,000 times from YouTube and SciVee , a website where scientists can trade research techniques .
SciVee was developed by Phillip Bourne , a professor of pharmacology at UCSD .
Each video is approximately five to seven minutes long and features a student demonstrating a critical procedure in organic chemistry , such as the purification of a substance by distillation or recrystallization .
Students have difficulty visualizing how to perform such procedures from the instructions in the laboratory manual alone .
UCSD visual arts students produced the videos .
To keep the atmosphere dynamic , they used catchy music and editing that juxtaposed footage filmed from multiple angles .
“ Collaborating with a group of UCSD students to produce these videos was an important part of the philosophy behind this project , ” explained Weizman .
“ They share social characteristics with the target audience , which helps make a more relevant product .
It was exciting to work with the students and watch the picture that I had in my mind be brought to life on the screen . ”
Organic chemistry is a Waterloo for many students .
The video project is one part of Weizman ’s research , which seeks to understand why students find the subject so difficult , and to help fill in the gaps .
Weizman wants students to see how organic chemistry is connected to real life .
Since many of his students are planning to go into medicine or the biological sciences , he makes links to drug development .
“ Chemistry is not their bread and butter , ” he said .
“ So we take something that is close to their hearts — drugs — and show how all the techniques they are learning are related to this . ”

The videos go beyond demonstrating experimental techniques .
They incorporate animations to illustrate what is happening at the molecular level .
For example , as a substance moves from one phase to another during an extraction , an animation shows that this occurs because the molecules of the substance donate hydrogen ions to molecules of a base .
To help hearing - impaired students , Weizman had captions added to the videos .
He discovered that the captions were also useful for English language learners who found it helpful to be able to read and listen to the narration simultaneously .
This autumn was the first time Weizman was able to pilot the videos with his organic chemistry students .
In surveys , students unanimously reported that they found the videos useful in preparing for the laboratory .
They commented that the videos helped them feel “ more comfortable walking into lab , ” and that they were “ well done ” and “ entertaining . ”
Weizman said his former students “ were almost jealous that the videos were not available when they took the course . ”
The difference is very noticeable according to Weizman .
Students who watched the videos were considerably more adept in the laboratory .
“ This quarter , when I walked into lab , I would see all of the students doing things the way they should be done , ” said Weizman .
“ I do n’t remember ever seeing that before . ”
The project was supported by a grant from UCSD ’s Instructional Improvement Program .

That Apple will release a new iPhone this summer seems almost certain .
The rumor mill is grinding , and the evidence is trickling in , and if Apple ’s iPod release schedule is anything to go by , we should expect an updated model 12 months after the last one .
So if we step back for a second and take a look at the collected “ evidence ” so far , what does it point to ?
Radio
IPhone 2.0 will be 3 - G .
If it is to stand any chance in the as - yet - untapped Japanese market , a fast data connection is a must .
The official line from both Apple and AT&T is that a 3 - G iPhone will ship this year , and as two launches in one year are unlikely , we can only assume that there will be one international 3 - G iPhone .
Certainly , the Infineon chipset expected to power the new phone will work on both HSDPA and WCDMA networks , as well as continuing to support EDGE for customers outside of good 3 - G coverage .
Camera
The iPhone ’s camera sucks .
It offers the user no more than the most basic functionality and only captures a measly two megapixels .
It ’s so bad that a range of unofficial software upgrades has already been released , adding new features and even – video .
The Infineon chipset mentioned above supports cameras of up to 5 megapixels and also video capture using Apple ’s codec of choice , h.264 .
So more pixels and video seem very likely , but what of video calls ?
Apple ’s Mac application iChat has had video conferencing for some time .
It would be a perfect match for the iPhone ’s big bright screen , but that would entail a second camera .
I ’d give this one a 50 - 50 chance .
Hardware
The current iPhone is so simple that it can hardly be improved .
Expect the changes to be small , and then only cosmetic .
It looks a little chunky next to the svelte iPod Touch , so the new model will likely be thinner .
There are rumblings on the internet that the body will be black plastic instead of aluminum , which seems very unlikely .
The current iPhone is surprisingly tough , so we ’d expect Apple to stick to glass and metal .
The only sure thing thing is that as soon as you see the new model , your old iPhone will look inexplicably clunky .
Software
Software is arguably the most important part of the iPhone .
Ever since its launch last year , seemingly every cellphone maker has released a touchscreen phone .
None of them comes close in ease of use , because none of them understands that the interface is everything .
The currently beta iPhone SDK shows us that the v2.0 operating system will be an incremental upgrade , adding niceties such as search and , if we ’re lucky , copy - and - paste .
With the iPod , Apple has often held new features back from older models in order to drive sales .
Part of this is the accounting model it uses :
In order to comply with the Sarbanes - Oxley ( or Oxshit ) laws , Apple wo n’t add new features to old hardware .
The iPhone , though , like the Apple TV , is accounted for on a subscription basis .
Expect the v1.0 iPhone to run the exact same software as the new one , exempting features which utilize new hardware .
Now it ’s your turn .
What do you expect to see ?

The Islamic Jihad is running a summer school - to teach boys the benefits of becoming suicide bombers .
A new generation of children , Palestinian boys aged between 12 and 15 years old , is growing up amid conflict and violence .
The militant group has a sworn mission to wage a holy war against Israel .
The boys are told not only that it is good to kill , but also that it is good to die .
They learn that suicide bomb attacks have proved the most deadly way to hit the Israelis .
Part of the revolution
Mohammed , a 14 - year - old boy , draws himself with explosives strapped to his body , ready to blow himself to pieces if it means killing Jews .
" Yes , " he says , when asked if he wants to be a suicide bomber .
" I want to liberate Palestine and be part of the revolution . "
The boys are shown pictures of those who have already died in the conflict with Israel .
They are taught that to give their lives is to be guaranteed a place in heaven .
And to be a suicide bomber is one of the highest forms of martyrdom .
They will be greeted in paradise by 70 virgins .
" We are teaching the children that suicide bombing is the only thing that make the Israeli people very frightened .
Furthermore , we are teaching them that we have the right to do it , " said Islamic Jihad member Mohammed el Hattab , one of the teachers on the programme .
" We are teaching them that after the suicide attacks , the man who makes it goes to the highest state in paradise , " he said .
Israelis appalled
For the Israelis all of this is appalling .
They say it is clear evidence that a new generation is being brought up to hate and to kill and they are demanding that it must stop .
Israeli Education Minister Limor Livnat told the BBC : " Poisoned pens make poisoned minds , and poisoned minds lead to violence , to terror attacks , to the killing of Israelis . "
But the people in Gaza insist that this is a direct response to the Israeli occupation and if and when the Israelis leave Palestinian territory , the children will no longer be taught violence or dream of becoming suicide bombers .
Senator John McCain , who drew criticism last month after he warned against broad government intervention to solve the deepening mortgage crisis , pivoted Thursday and called for the federal government to aid some homeowners in danger of losing their homes , by helping them to refinance and get federally guaranteed 30 - year mortgages .
“ There is nothing more important than keeping alive the American dream to own your home , and priority No. 1 is to keep well - meaning , deserving homeowners who are facing foreclosure in their homes , ” Mr. McCain said in a speech on economic themes that he gave at a window company in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn .
Mr. McCain , an Arizona Republican , had been painted as uncaring by Democrats , and drew murmurs of concern from some Republicans , after a speech in California last month in which he cautioned that “ it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers , ” and noted that the crisis had been brought on by both lenders and borrowers .
Since then , he has gone out of his way to try to signal that he understands that times are tough and that people are hurting .
His speech in Brooklyn  which is to be followed by what aides are billing as a major economic address next week  was a shift in tone , and part of a new effort to communicate that as president he would act to help Americans in financial distress .
My goal was to archive and display my internet lifestream .
My first approach was writing a client for each API of the social networks that I 'm in .
This turned out to be a complete waste of time and effort .
All that I needed after all was a FriendFeed account that would centralize all my feeds .
Archiving and displaying your entries with Django is quite simple .
First of all , you need to download the Python FriendFeed API client .
Then start a new application in your project , lets call it lifestream :
./manage.py startapp lifestream
On the settings.py add the lifestream project to the INSTALLED_APPS and a variable to store your FriendFeed username :
FRIENDFEED_USERNAME = ' your_username '
In the models .py add a model named Entry :
from django.db import models class Entry ( models .
Model ) : id = models .
CharField(max_length=255 , primary_key =True ) service_id = models .
CharField(max_length=50 , null=True , blank = True ) service_name = models .
CharField(max_length=50 , null=True , blank =True ) service_icon = models .
URLField(max_length=255 , verify_exists =False , null= True , blank = True ) service_profile = models.URLField(max_length=255 , verify_exists =False , null=True , blank =True ) title = models .
CharField( max_length=255 , null=True , blank =True ) link = models .
URLField(max_length=255 , verify_exists =False , null= True , blank= True ) updated = models .
DateTimeField( null=True , blank=True ) published = models .
DateTimeField( null=True , blank=True ) media_title = models .
CharField( max_length=255 , null=True , blank =True ) media_link = models .
URLField(max_length=255 , verify_exists =False , null= True , blank = True ) media_thumbnail = models.URLField(max_length=255 , verify_exists =False , null= True , blank= True ) created = models .
DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True ) def __unicode__( self ) : return self .
title class Meta : ordering = [ ' - published ' ] verbose_name = ' Entry ' verbose_name_plural = ' Entries ' class Admin : list_display = [ ' title ' , ' service_name ' , ' published ' ] list_filter = [ ' service_name ' ] date_hierarchy = ' published '
Create an url.py on the lifestream folder :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from lifestream.models import Entry entry_list_dict = { ' queryset ' : Entry.objects.all( ) , ' paginate_by ' : 30 , } urlpatterns = patterns ('' , ( r'^$ ' , ' django.views.generic.list_detail.object_list ' , entry_list_dict ) , )
As you can see , I 've used a generic view .
You can also use the date based generic views and pagination to build an archive like mine .
Add to your project root urls.py :
( r' ^lifestream / ' , include (' lifestream.urls ' ) )
Create a template lifestream / entry_list.html :
{ % for entry in object_list %} < div class = " source " > < a href= " {{ entry.service_profile }} " title= " {{ entry.service_name }} " >< img src= " {{ entry.service_icon }} " alt = " {{ entry.service_name }} " alt= " {{ entry.service_name }} " /></a> </div> < div class =" details " > < ul > < li >< a href= " {{ entry.
link }} " >{{ entry.
title }}</a></li> < li>{{ entry.published|timesince }} ago </ li > { % if entry.media_thumbnail %} < li >< a href= " {{ entry.media_link }} " >< img src= " {{ entry.media_thumbnail }} " alt = " {{ entry.media_title }} " /></a></li>{ % endif %} </ul > </div > { % endfor %}
Finally , create a script to synchronize your feeds :
#!/usr/bin/env python # -*- coding : utf-8 -*- import sys import os ROOT_PATH = os.path.realpath(os.path.dirname(__file__ ) ) PROJECT_PATH , PROJECT_DIR = os.path.split( ROOT_PATH ) sys.path.insert(0 , ROOT_PATH ) sys.path.insert(1 , PROJECT_PATH ) os.environ [ ' DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE '] = '% s.settings ' % PROJECT_DIR from friendfeed import FriendFeed from django.conf import settings from lifestream.
models import Entry ff = FriendFeed ( ) feed = ff.fetch_user_feed(settings.FRIENDFEED_USERNAME ) for e in feed .
get ( ' entries ' ) : entry , created = Entry.objects.get_or_create(id=e.get ( 'id ' ) ) if created : service = e.get ( ' service ' ) entry.service_id = service.get ( 'id ' ) entry.service_name = service.get ( ' name ' ) entry.service_icon = service.get ('iconUrl' ) entry.service_profile = service.get ( ' profileUrl ' ) entry. title = e.get ( ' title ' ) entry.
link = e.get ( ' link ' ) entry.updated = e.get ( ' updated ' ) entry .
published = e.get ( ' published ') media = e.get ( ' media ' ) if media : entry.media_title = media [ 0 ] . get ( ' title ' ) entry.media_link = media [ 0 ] . get ( ' player ' ) or entry .
link thumbnails = media [ 0 ] . get ( ' thumbnails ' ) entry.media_thumbnail = thumbnails [ 0 ] . get ( 'url ' ) entry.save ( )
If you want , you can add a job in your crontab :
# synchronize every 15 mins */15 * * * * root / path / to/your/application/lifestream_cron.py
See my lifestream as the working example .
UPDATE : Friendfeed sends the time in UTC , if you want to use your timezone you have do some hacking :
Install pytz :
easy_install pytz
Import and assign your timezone to a variable :
import pytz tz = pytz.timezone(settings .TIME_ZONE )
And replace entry.updated and entry .
published with :
updated = e.get ( ' updated ' ) updated = updated.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc).astimezone( tz ) published = e.get ( ' published ') published = published.replace(tzinfo=pytz.utc).astimezone( tz ) if settings .
DATABASE_ENGINE == ' mysql ' : # http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/5304 updated = updated.replace(tzinfo=None ) published = published.replace( tzinfo=None ) entry.updated = updated entry .
published = published
Thanks to Chris Kelly that send me an email reporting this .
Mr. Pipes is perhaps best known for Campus Watch , a national initiative he created to scrutinize Middle Eastern programs at colleges and universities .
The drive has accused professors of , among other things , being soft on militant Islam and sympathetic to the Palestinian cause .
It has stirred widespread controversy and , in some cases , may have undermined professors ’ bids for tenure .
Mr. Pipes was joined in the monitoring effort by other self - declared watchdogs of militant Islam .
Their Web sites are often linked to one another and their messages interwoven .
One critic , David Horowitz , founded Islamo - Fascism Awareness Week , a campaign aimed at college campuses .
He noted in an interview that monitors of radical Islam have increasingly trained their sights on nonviolent Muslim - Americans .
“ They do n’t throw bombs , but they create political cover for ideological support of this jihadi movement , ” he said .
Mr. Pipes places
Muslims in three categories , he said : those who are violent , those who are moderate and those in the middle .
It is this middle group , he argued , that now poses the greatest threat to American values .
“ Are these people who are not using violence but who are not fully enthusiastic about this country and its mores , its culture — are they on our side or are they on the other side ? ” he asked .
Ms. Almontaser never considered herself unenthusiastic about America , she said .
But as the conflict over the Khalil Gibran school intensified , she came to be seen by many through Mr. Pipes ’s lens .
In his article in The Sun , he referred to Ms. Almontaser by her birth name , Dhabah , and called her views “ extremist . ”
He cited an article in which she was quoted as saying about 9/11 , “ I do n’t recognize the people who committed the attacks as either Arabs or Muslims . ”
( As The Jewish Week later reported , Mr. Pipes left out the second half of the quote : “ Those people who did it have stolen my identity as an Arab and have stolen my religion . ” )
The Stop the Madrassa Coalition focused primarily on Ms. Almontaser as a strategy , said Mr. Pipes , because the group could get little information about the school itself .
The coalition quickly publicized several discoveries .
Ms. Almontaser had accepted an award from the Council on American - Islamic Relations , a national Muslim organization that critics claim has ties to terrorist groups ( an assertion the group adamantly denies ) .
In news articles , Ms. Almontaser had been critical of American foreign policy and police tactics in fighting terrorism .
She also gave $ 2,000 to Representative Cynthia A. McKinney of Georgia , whom Mr. Pipes and others have characterized as an Islamist sympathizer .
( Ms. McKinney , who is no longer in office and did not respond to requests for an interview , has had a strong following among Arab - Americans in part because of her criticism of the Patriot Act . )
It 's bad enough that the Director of National Intelligence is trotting out a bogus threat so the government can snoop on all Internet traffic .
What 's worse is that this kind of mass surveillance is a pretty lame way to catch the honest - to - God bad guys .
Of more interest to observers of intelligence activities is the issue of quality vs. quantity and the slow creep towards doom that these efforts foretell .
The fact that we are essentially attempting to gill - net bad guys is a fairly strong indicator that the intelligence community has yet to come up with an effective strategy against information - age threats .
This image is why the government is arguing that it needs more insight into what flows across the wires and cables and airwaves of this country .
Its not a question of listening in to you whispering sweet nothings into the ear to your significant other , it is simply a case of – as the late Sam
Kinison joked – going where the food is .
That our intelligence agencies can intercept adversary communications is largely a given , they just want to do it from the convenience of the homeland , not some remote switch in the darkest hinterlands .
And quite a lot of data there is too .
This is not a needle in a haystack problem ; it ’s a needle somewhere in an unidentified field in the western portion of Nebraska .
The problem with vacuuming up data wholesale is that even with a lot of machine - based filtering , an intelligence analyst is left with a massive pile of rock in which may lay a speck of gold .
Intelligence does not want , need , look at or even retain the VAST majority of what passes through the ‘ Net , which is something privacy mavens conveniently leave out of their angrily worded press releases .
A more appropriate strategy in the long war – an intelligence war –
is to put more feet on the ground in the world ’s dangerous places .
For the uninitiated it does n’t necessarily follow that more human intelligence ( HUMINT ) will help solve a signals intelligence ( SIGINT )
problem , but that ’s the dirty little secret here : this is n’t a SIGINT problem .
Widespread surveillance is n’t usually what catches evil doers : tip - offs from informants , investigations and other methodologies do .
Once you catch of whiff of what might be your prey , that ’s when you should turn your surveillance capabilities on and determine if you found your quarry or are chasing a snipe .
If this sounds like déjà vu all over again it is because it is a variation on the theme that played out over the last few decades as the community degraded HUMINT in favor of satellites .
This is not to say that SIGINT does not produce good intelligence – it most certainly can – but SIGINT today is in many ways much easier than just a decade ago .
You do n’t have to find a suitable physical location in a foreign land , you do n’t have to build a facility , you do n’t have to secure the facility , you do n’t have to pay to relocate and house people to work in the facility : all you have to do is drive down the road , find a quiet closet and tap the line .
It follows then , at least to some , that generally technical problem begets a technical solution , but as recent history has shown , the last people you seem to be able to trust to get a successful technical solution off the ground is an intelligence or security agency .
A whole planet ’s data is useless if there is precious little chance of actually making use of it .
My brief stint in HUMINT was not the world ’s most dangerous mission , but neither was it a cake walk .
I know the hazards associated with putting boots on the ground as well as the reluctance to undertake “ diarrhea missions . ”
But unless we start taking the grunt work of intelligence more seriously , and yes , risk adding names to the memorials of our intelligence agency memorials , the only course left to us is broader and deeper technical surveillance that only may result in a meaningful tip - off but will undoubtedly result in more political and legal battles that in the end will nullify the best laid plans of technical surveillance advocates .
This is no way to win the intelligence war .

Prices of staples such as pork have soared in recent months
China 's inflation hit 8.7 % in February , the highest rate in over 11 years , the National Statistics Bureau said .
Soaring food prices were driving inflation , up 23.3 % in February against the previous year , the bureau said .
It attributed the jump to snow storms last month that caused widespread disruption and to seasonal price rises over the Lunar New Year holiday .
Analysts had predicted a rise of 8.0 % but the figure , up from 7.1 % in January , was higher than forecast .
In recent months inflation has continued to rise despite higher interest rates and other measures by Beijing to keep the economy from overheating .
This is a serious concern for the government , which fears higher food prices could trigger social unrest .
Last week in a report to the National People 's Congress , Premier Wen Jiabao said tackling inflation was " the biggest concern of the people " .
Subsidies
February 's inflation rate of 8.7 % was the highest figure since May 1996 .
The price of pork rose 63.4 % , fresh vegetables were up 46 % and cooking oil was up 41 % compared to February 2007 , the statistics bureau said .
Premier Wen Jiabao says controlling inflation is a key task
Non -food inflation rose only slowly , hitting an annual rate of 1.6 % , the figures showed .
The jump followed severe winter weather that paralysed parts of China , delaying food and fuel deliveries and devastating crops and livestock .
But food prices have been rising since last year , partly because of supply problems .
Officials are working to tackle the problem by freezing prices of key commodities and expanding production of basic necessities .
Curbs have been placed on grain exports and farmers are being given subsidies to rear more pigs .
Last year , the government also raised interest rates six times in an attempt to keep inflation under control .
Analysts said in light of the latest figures they expected further interest rate rises .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
It took about 40 years to find it , but scientists at Hewlett - Packard said on Wednesday they discovered a fourth basic type of electrical circuit that could lead to a computer you never have to boot up .
The finding proves what until now had only been theory -- but could save millions from the tedium of waiting for a computer to find its “ place , ” the researchers said .
Basic electronics theory teaches that there are three fundamental elements of a passive circuit -- resistors , capacitors and inductors .
But in the 1970s , Leon Chua of the University of California at Berkeley , theorized there should be a fourth called a memory resistor , or memristor , for short , and he worked out the mathematical equations to prove it .
Now , a team at Hewlett - Packard led by Stanley Williams has proven that ‘ memristance ’ exists .
They developed a mathematical model and a physical example of a memristor , which they describe in the journal Nature .
“ It ’s very different from any other electrical device , ” Williams said of his memristor in a telephone interview .
“ No combination of resistor , capacitor or inductor will give you that property . ”
Williams likens the property to water flowing through a garden hose .
In a regular circuit , the water flows from more than one direction .
But in a memory resistor , the hose remembers what direction the water ( or current ) is flowing from , and it expands in that direction to improve the flow .
If water or current flows from the other direction , the hose shrinks .
“ It remembers both the direction and the amount of charge that flows through it .
...
That is the memory , ” Williams said .
The discovery is more than an academic pursuit for Williams , who said the finding could lead a new kind of computer memory that would never need booting up .
Conventional computers use dynamic random access memory or DRAM , which is lost when the power is turned off , and must be accessed from the hard drive when the computer goes back on .
But a computer that incorporates this new kind of memory circuit would never lose it place , even when the power is turned off .
“ If you turn on your computer it will come up instantly where it was when you turned it off .
That is a very interesting potential application , and one that is very realistic , ” Williams said .
But he said understanding this new circuit element could be critical as companies attempt to build ever smaller devices .
“ It ’s essential that people understand this to be able to go further into the world of nanoelectronics , ” referring to electronics on the nano scale -- objects tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair .
“ It turns out that memristance , this property , gets more important as the device gets smaller .
That is another major reason it took so long to find , ” Williams said .

I posted about finding a very pregnant cat the other day .
I received numerous e-mails of concern and suggestions .
Thank you to all who responded .
I spent most of last night rubbing her belly and feeling the babies move and telling her it was okay that she was a slut .
My mother came over and we decided that she must have 4 or 5 babies cooking in there .
When she stood up , her hoo - ha looked swollen so we decided that she was almost ready to blow .
I put up flyers and patiently waited and hoped that someone would claim their precious little girl .
Hmmm Precious is a good name .
Yes , I shall call her Precious .
I dedided that she should go to the vet as she looks kind of beat up -- wow I am such a good person .
I feel awfully good about myself for taking in this poor creature .
So as it turns out -- according to the incredible people at Timonium Animal Hospital , she has a split eyelid , a broken tooth , fleas , a puncture hole in her tail , and her tail is broken .
Poor baby !
Now here is the best part , I excitedly ask about her babies and when they think she might give birth .
This is when the vet begins to laugh , then the tech begins to laugh .
The vet turns the cat around and pushes something out .
Well me oh my , it was a penis sans testicles .
My pregnant girl , that I was so upset that someone would put out , is just a really fat boy .
So I apologize to everyone who responded and hoped for a kitten .
There will be none .
Also , I have adopted HIM and put him on a diet , flea control , and antibiotics .
HE is on the mend .
I am currently taking suggestions for names though as PRECIOUS is not quite fitting and TUBBY BASTARD might give him a complex .
Thanks again , I am an idiot .
This is a no- brainer , or so I thought .
Before asking my extended family this question at a family gathering this weekend , I assumed that everyone would agree to my hypothetical proposal .
As distasteful as it might seem at first , I assumed that everyone in the room would ( if given the opportunity ) agree that they would eat nothing but dog food for one year in return for $ 1 million .
I write this post having tasted dog food on two occasions in past years .
On those two occasions , I ’d chomped on a nugget of dry dog food , the kind that comes in a 40 pound bag .
I thought it tasted like cardboard , but it was not disgusting .
On the other hand , it was not food I would be inclined to eat again unless given an incentive .
Note : I have smelled canned dog food before , and I would not be inclined to eat that stuff .
The canned dog food I smelled had a strong disgusting odor to it .
It looked and smelled like it was no longer safe to eat .
So there I stood with various members of my family in my mother ’s kitchen when I raised the question : who would be willing to eat nothing but dog food for the next year in return for $ 1 million ?
To my surprise , the rejections and objections started pouring in , even though I went first and even though I proudly stated that my answer was absolutely “ yes . ”
Two of my sisters and my mother each rejected the idea out of hand .
I listened to their excuses and I thought that I addressed all their objections , but they continued to reject the hypothetical offer .
One sister was concerned that if she went to all that work eating dog food for one year , they would n’t actually pay her the $ 1 million .
Therefore I changed the hypothetical so that it included an escrow account held by a person or institution she trusted .
Still , she refused to buy into the program .
Another concern ( raised by a brother - in - law ) was that even if dog food might provide most of the nutrition needed by a human being , it might not provide all of the vitamins and nutrients needed by humans .
Therefore , it might be dangerous over the course of the year .
Fair enough .
In response , I agreed that anyone engaging in this endeavor could take any vitamins or supplements that one might need ( but that dog food might not provide ) .
That same brother in law then indicated that he might be willing to join the program , but only for $ 2 million .
I urged everyone to be honest .
We were talking about $ 1 million .
This is enough money to allow people to retire .
I reminded everyone that they could buy their dog food at any supermarket or any pet store .
Their dog food could include any commercially available product labeled “ dog food , ” and this could include any type of dog food , dry or canned food , entrées or dog treats ( I was hoping that the phrase “ dog treats ” would get everyone more excited about signing up for this hypothetical deal , but it did n’t ) .
I was n’t suggesting that they would have to eat their dog food on the floor or that they would have to eat it out of a doggie dish .
They would merely have to agree to eat dog food , in any position .
They could light candles before dinner if that ambiance made the difference .
The main rule is that all of the food that they ate would have to be actual dog food .
The only fluid that they would be able to drink would be water , since that ’s the only liquid that most people give to their dogs .
In the course of discussing the issue , I told my family that a good friend of mine fed his son some dry dog food when the boy was three , with no ill consequences .
One of my brothers - in - law indicated that when he was small , he offered a neighbor kid ( “ Kurt ” ) 25 - cents if Kurt would eat two soggy chunks of dry dog food that had fallen in the dog ’s water .
“ Kurt ” accepted the offer and ate the dog food .
Again , there were no ambulances or any untoward circumstances .
I reminded my family that they should consider the wonderful - sounding advertisements for dog food .
For instance , Purina ’s Pro Plan Dog Food purports to give your dog everything your dog needs to be a happy and healthy dog :
Dogs bring companionship , love , and more to our lives .
Give more to your dog when you choose Pro Plan® dog food .
Meet all of your dog ’s nutritional needs with premium food ; with real protein and healthy nutritional extras .
With Pro Plan® , you are providing the building blocks of good health and a delicious selection of choices .
As often happens in my mother ’s kitchen , the topic veered toward weightier moral issues .
This injection of morality into this frivolous hypothetical reminded me of a conclusion once announced by a philosopher friend ( “ Tim ” ) : “ Morality starts with what you are willing to put into your mouth . ”
One basic moral angle was this :
Should n’t one be willing to eat anything that one make one ’s dog eat ?
That objection did n’t seem to have much traction .
But then my mother modified the hypothetical .
What if you were offered the chance to magically achieve world peace if you ate dog food for one year ?
That question drew some affirmative head nodding .
Same result for this question that I raised : “ What if someone agreed to fund medical treatment to cure 1,000 children who are dying of malaria if only you would eat dog food for one year ?
The elephant in the room is that there are millions of people starving to death who would jump at the opportunity to eat any food at all , even dog food ( Starvation .net suggests that on September 11 , 2001 , 35,000 people died of starvation–a comparable number of people die every single day ) .
Back in my mother ’s kitchen , the conversation turned back to one of fairness to the dog .
Can you really have it both ways ?
Should n’t the rule be that if you are n’t willing to eat dog food neither should your dog ?
This fairness issue did n’t seem to change any votes .
In the end , I was the only clear and strong “ yes ” vote : I was the only one in the room who expressed that I was willing to eat nothing but dog food for one year in return for $ 1 million .
Perhaps everyone else was too focused on recent reports on the kinds of things that manufacturers put into pet food .
All I will need to do now is find someone willing to pay me $ 1 million so I can get started .
—
I would add one more item to this hypothetical .
I would agree that if you wanted to quit partway through the year ( e.g. , if you just could n’t stand it anymore–or if it was making you sick ) , you could , but you would n’t receive any money unless you eat dog food for the entire year .
Questions to consider :
1 . Would you sign up for this arrangement if it were offered to you :
Would you be willing to eat nothing but dog food for one year , in exchange for $ 1 million ?
2 . If you would not sign up , name your price if you have one .
How much would someone have to pay you so that you would eat nothing but dog food for an entire year ?
For those of you who find this entire topic of eating dog food distressing , I am reminded of an old joke sometimes attributed to Winston Churchill :
What is permaculture ?
Permaculture is a creative design process based on whole - systems thinking informed by ethics and design principles that feature on this site .
This approach guides us to mimic the patterns and relationships we can find in nature and can be applied to all aspects of human habitation , from agriculture to ecological building , from appropriate technology to education and even economics .
By adopting the ethics and applying these principles in our daily life we can make the transition from being dependent consumers to becoming responsible producers .
This journey builds skills and resilience at home and in our local communities that will help us prepare for an uncertain future with less available energy .
The techniques and strategies used to apply these principles vary widely depending on the location , climatic conditions and resources that are available .
The methods may differ , but the foundations to this wholistic approach remain constant .
By learning these principles you can acquire valuable thinking tools that help you become more resilient in an era of change .

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has denounced the opposition and former colonial power Britain in his first speech since the disputed elections .
" Down with thieves who want to steal our country , " he told crowds marking 28 years of independence .
The outcome of the presidential poll is unclear but the high court has rejected an opposition bid to stop a recount .
Meanwhile , a Chinese ship carrying arms to Zimbabwe is reported to have left South Africa after failing to unload .
Dock workers had refused to remove the arms aboard the An Yue Jiang , which had been forced to anchor off the port of Durban for four days .
The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union said it did " not agree with the position of the government not to intervene " .
Reports say the An Yue Jiang is carrying 3 m rounds of ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and 2,500 mortar rounds .
On Thursday , Morgan Tsvangirai , the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , said South African President Thabo Mbeki needed to be " relieved of his duties " as a mediator in the crisis caused by the presidential poll , for which results have not been released .
This is the saddest independence day since our liberation from colonial rule
Morgan Tsvangirai
Movement for Democratic Change
Lots of laughs , no answers Zimbabwe victim : ' I wailed in pain '
Arms ship ' on the move '
Press split on anniversary
He also told the BBC that his party had come close to an agreement with the ruling Zanu - PF to remove Mr Mugabe from power .
Mr Tsvangirai is adamant he won the presidential election outright .
But the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission says it cannot release the results until it investigates anomalies .
On Friday , the high court rejected an application by the MDC to stop a partial recount taking place this weekend .
" I find no merit in the application , " said Justice Antonia Guvava .
" Accordingly , the application is dismissed with costs . "
The ruling paves the way for all presidential , parliamentary , senate and council votes cast in 23 out of 210 constituencies to be recounted .
A change in the parliamentary result by nine seats could see the Zanu - PF party regain its lost majority in the assembly .
In the presidential poll , government ministers suggest that a run-off may be needed , and the MDC says its activists in rural areas are being attacked ahead of that possible poll .
The independent Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights has said at least 200 people have been treated for severe injuries as a result of political violence since last month 's election .
' British machinations '
Thousands of people gathered at the Gwanzura Stadium in Highfield , a suburb of Harare , to hear Mr Mugabe speak at a rally celebrating the anniversary of Zimbabwe 's independence from Britain and the end of white minority rule .
The 84 - year - old played a key role in the 1970s war of independence and took power as Zimbabwe 's first prime minister in 1980 on a wave of popular support .
We , not the British , established democracy , based on one person , one vote
President Robert Mugabe
Why Mugabe is deaf to the West Spreading fear in Zimbabwe Many of those in the crowd wore T - shirts decorated with Mr Mugabe 's portrait or held banners showing their support for his government 's policies .
" Defending our land from imperialists , " said one poster , while another claimed " Zimbabwe has no place for sell - outs . "
Mr Mugabe took to the stage to rapturous applause to celebrate what he described as the day on which the " nation finally shook off the chains of British racist settler colonialism " .
" Our political history is well known , yet with time , we feel more challenged to recall it , especially for those who appear ignorant of it or are deliberately engaged in reversing the gains of our liberation struggle , " he said .
Mr Mugabe brushed aside criticism by the British government of Zimbabwe 's human rights record and political system , saying democracy had only been established there after independence .
" We , not the British , established democracy based on one person , one vote - democracy which rejected racial or gender discrimination and upheld human rights and religious freedom , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY I predict that the situation will end up like Kenya .
Mugabe will be encouraged by the African Union to form a national unity government Frank Hartry , South Africa
The president called on Zimbabweans " to maintain utmost vigilance in the face of vicious British machinations and the machinations of our other detractors , who are allies of Britain " .
" Whereas yesterday they relied on brute force to subjugate our people and plunder our resources , today they have perfected their tactics to more subtle forms , " he warned .
Mr Mugabe also said the government was attempting to deal with the hardships facing Zimbabweans , such as the shortage of food and high unemployment , which have been compounded by hyper-inflation .
' Saddest day '
On Thursday , Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa accused Mr Tsvangirai of treason and working with the UK to bring about " regime change " .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The state - controlled Herald newspaper paper said the details were contained in a " memorandum of understanding " between the MDC leader and " various right - wing groups " in Zimbabwe and South Africa .
The UK embassy in Harare said the correspondence was " a forgery " .
Mr Tsvangirai also rejected the treason allegations , describing Mr Chinamasa as an " injustice minister " because he had lost his seat in parliament .
At a news conference in Johannesburg , Mr Tsvangirai said Zimbabwe was facing " the saddest independence day since our liberation from colonial rule " and that people were literally starving .
Later , Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC of the near - agreement between the MDC and Zanu - PF that would have removed President Mugabe .
" We were prepared to consider the issue of an inclusive government including some members of Zanu - PF , " he said .
" In fact they were suggesting how many and they were talking about a panel from which we were going to choose . "
The government talks failed when it became clear there were " others in the establishment who did not want to accept that " , he said .

Improving your ability to present takes practice .
But it also takes study .
Start with Presentation Zen .
Presentation Zen is not about how to make slides .
It ’s about how to think deeply about your ideas and how to transform them into a presentation .
And that ’s why it matters :
Thinking deeply about your ideas from a new perspective engages your brain and makes you smarter .
Here is what to do today to shorten the line between where you are and where you need to be : Volunteer to give a presentation that you can entirely control , and invest the time and effort to do the best possible job .
That would be a “ deck of slides . ”
Nowadays it ’s a keynote , open office , or that - other - thing file , but once upon a time it was a set of 35 mm transparencies you would load into a carousel .
Stacked up , they looked a little like a deck of cards , thus the nickname “ deck . ”
You can probably find one ( and someone old enough to remember when they were called decks ) in a museum somewhere .

Yes , I said improve your programming career , not your programming prowess .
And by career , I mean all of it in any form , whether your career is working for BigCo , launching a start up , consulting , whatever .
Let ’s assume you ’re already as smart as Steve Wozniak , the über - engineer .
Do you want to hack part - time for the rest of your life or do you want to change the world ?
To change the world , you must create the new , but you must also show people why it matters .
And that ’s why … To program , you must elicit ideas from other people and share your ideas with them .
Sharing ideas comes in many forms : explaining how you did something .
Suggesting a new practice for the team .
Demonstrating how something works .
Convincing everyone to switch programming languages .
Persuading a brilliant engineer to join your team .
Persuading your manager to get out of the way and let you do your thing .
Advancing your career is entirely about communicating .
Getting a job .
Turning down a job .
Asking for a promotion .
Turning down a promotion .
Getting onto a good team .
Politely extricating yourself from a good team .
Persuading a brilliant engineer to co-found a company .
Helping a brilliant engineer understand why co-founding a company is n’t the right thing to do .
Asking for funding .
Turning down funding .
Getting clients .
Turning down clients .
It ’s all communication .
Now you know , I have a background in Sales and Marketing .
So I worry that I am holding a Golden Hammer and suggesting to you that your career is all about nailing things .
But here is the short and obvious truth : Human beings are all about physical communication .
It ’s a huge , huge part of what makes us human , this talking and listening jibber - jabbering thing .
Frankly , there is no substitute for actual speech with visible body language .
We do not react to the written word the same way that we react to a speech where we can see the speaker .
So let ’s skip right past learning to write well .
It ’s phenomenally important , but learning to speak well trumps everything .
At Mobile Commons we talk about technical things all the time , and the remote members of the team switch out of Campfire into iChat or Skype to hear each other ’s voices and see each other ’s faces at least once a day .
If you take just one thing from this post , let it be this :
To improve your programming career , the single most important thing you must do is improve your ability to communicate your ideas face to face .
Would you like to improve ?
I have deliberately avoided suggesting what specifically you might want to improve : My Latin teacher said we crave the three Ps : Power , Prestige , and Pecuniam .
But the nuänces of aspiration are many .
You have ideas you want us to understand .
You have people you want to associate with .
You have things you want to build and you need to harness other people ’s efforts to build them .
Here is what to do today to shorten the line between where you are and where you need to be : Volunteer to give a presentation that you can entirely control , and invest the time and effort to do the best possible job .
Now , you may already be giving presentations .
Maybe it ’s part of your job already .
But I am still recommending you add one to your workload , one that you entirely control .
This is crucial : if you do n’t control the subject , the content , the audience , everything , it may not be the very best way for you to improve .
I recommend you find a venue that is begging for presentations — local programming users groups are ideal — and sign up to give a talk .
Pick a topic .
If you do n’t have a burning desire to shout something across the roof tops , you can always fall back on giving an “ Experience Report . ”
That ’s where you discuss something you did or tried to do and how it worked out .
Or go with one of the ideas I suggested for blog posts :
“ What I learned from Language X that makes me a better programmer when I use Language Y , ” “ Something surprising that you probably would n’t guess about Language X from reading blog posts , ” or “ My personal transformation about Idea X .
” By the way :
If you already have a certain degree of comfort with presenting to an audience and you really want to ignite your career , try doing a “ Fish out of Water ” presentation : Present to a group with whom you have very little in common .
For example , give a presentation about how to work with programmers to a business networking breakfast club .
Learning to present ideas to people who are not just like you will make you a superstar .
Now put together a presentation deckfor your talk .
Do not give a talk without a deck , you will lose valuable experience giving presentations and this is about your experience .
Furthermore , presentations are tougher than speeches because the presentation medium gives you many , many opportunities to screw it up ( like having what you say and what ’s on the screen be the same thing ) .
Then give the talk .
And then give another one .
And keep going .
And never stop , because presenting well is a skill that helps you from where you are now right up to when you are presenting the numbers to the Board of Directors or presenting a new product to a hall full of cheering customers or , or , or anything and everything .
See you there !
The folks playing with quantum computers have been claiming for years that their gadgets will one day make today ’s supercomputers look like quivering lumps of jelly .
But so far , their computers have yet to match the calculating prowess of a 10 - year old with ADHD .
The most exciting work so far has been on universal quantum logic gates , the building blocks of any computer .
A number of groups have built and demonstrated these and one team even took their gates for the computing equivalent of a run round the block by factorising the number 15 .
The trouble is that , to do anything useful with universal quantum gates , you need at least dozens and preferably hundreds of them , all joined together .
And because of various errors and problems that creep in , that ’s more or less impossible with today ’s technology .
Which is why a breakthrough by an Australian group led by Andrew White at the University of Queensland is so exciting .
They have built and tested quantum logic gates that are vastly more powerful than those that have gone before by exploiting the higher dimensions available in in quantum mechanics .
For example , a qubit can be encoded in a photon ’s polarisation .
But a photon has other dimensions which can also be used to carry information , such as its arrival time , photon number or frequency .
By exploiting these , a photon can easily be used as a much more powerful three level system called a qutrit .
This is how the Ozzie team have exploited the idea : during a computation , their gates convert qubits into qutrits , process the quantum information in this more powerful form and then convert it back into qubits .
All using plain old vanilla optics .
That allows a dramatic reduction in the number of gates necessary to perform a specific task .
Using only three of the higher dimension logic gates , the team has built and tested a Toffoli logic gate that could only have been constructed using 6 conventional logic gates .
And they say that a computer made up of 50 conventional quantum logic gates could be built using only 9 of theirs .
That ’s a significant reduction .
What ’s more , they reckon that these kinds of numbers are possible with today ’s linear optics technology .
That means these guys are right now bent over an optical bench with screwdrivers and lens cloths at the ready , attempting to build the world ’s most powerful quantum computer .
We may see the results–a decent factorisation perhaps –within months .
Could it be that Australia is about to become the center of the quantum computing world ?

Dangerous levels of radiation in space could bar astronauts from a mission to Mars and limit prolonged activity on the moon , experts now caution .
However , more research could reveal ways to handle the risks that radiation poses to space missions .
The magnetic field of Earth protects humanity from radiation in space that can damage or kill cells .
Once beyond this shield , people become far more vulnerable .
Astronauts have long seen white flashes while in space due to cosmic rays , or extremely high - energy particles , passing through their heads .
A return to the moon or a mission to Mars that NASA and other space agencies are planning would place astronauts at continued risk from cosmic rays or dangerous bursts of solar radiation .
Several reports in the past have outlined the potential risks .
To further investigate the risks that space radiation currently pose , the National Research Council assembled experts in space and biology together .
At the present time , given current knowledge , the level of radiation astronauts would encounter " would not allow a human crew to undertake a Mars mission and might also seriously limit long - term Moon activity , " this committee notes in their new report today .
Uncertainties remain
Still , much remains uncertain regarding the actual risks that space radiation poses for the body , explained committee member Walter Schimmerling , a scientist now retired from NASA 's space radiation program .
All these uncertainties mean that safety margins have to remain high , limiting how long astronauts can stay in space .
This in turn could rule out a mission to Mars , as well as long - term or multiple missions to the moon .
" The way to deal with that problem is to reduce the margins of uncertainty , " Schimmerling told SPACE.com .
To enable at the very least lunar missions with astronauts , the committee stressed that radiation biology research deserved the highest priority .
However , the experts noted that NASA 's space radiation biology research has been significantly compromised by recent cuts in funding , leading to major gaps in our knowledge of the health risks of radiation , such as cancer , neurological damage and degenerative tissue disease .
NASA 's entire space radiation biology research program is critically dependent on the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory , which in turn relies on the U.S. Department of Energy 's heavy ion physics program .
The committee strongly recommended that NASA do as much research at this lab as it could , in case Department of Energy 's priorities shift and dramatically reduce the availability of the lab .
" No one knows how long the window of opportunity is for how long this laboratory is available — 10 or 15 years seems a reasonable guess , " Schimmerling said .
Possible solutions
When it comes to shielding astronauts from radiation , spacecraft designers and mission planners have to consider trading off a safe amount of protective material — say , high density plastic — with cutting weight in order to enter space practically .
Crafts that are too heavy simply can't carry enough fuel to make flight practical .
Further research could not only look into better shielding materials , but also spacecraft designs that put electronics and machinery in the periphery between astronauts and harm 's way .
" Lava tubes on the moon might also be useful as habitats from a shielding point of view , " Schimmerling said .
" I do n't know how realistic the idea is , but they would have the advantage of reduced exposure to radiation . "
The sun is a major source of dangerous radiation astronauts might encounter especially during solar storms that can erupt with little notice .
The committee also recommended further research into forecasting these outbursts .
“ In October 2002 , the U.S. Army War College ’s Strategic Studies Institute , in coordination with the Office of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff / G - 3 , initiated a study to analyze how American and coalition forces can best address the requirements that will necessarily follow operational victory in a war with Iraq . ”
Thus says the foreward of the monograph that is available from the Strategic Studies Institute of the the U.S. Army War College .
Reconstructing Iraq : Insights , Challenges , and Missions for Military Forces in a Post - Conflict Scenario , February 2003 , by Dr. Conrad C. Crane and Dr. W. Andrew Terrill .
There is an excerpt and a bit more about the authors at :
The Army Monograph that Predicted Just About Everything that ’s Happened in Iraq , History News Network , March 10 , 2008 .
From the foreward of the monograph :
In October 2002 , the U.S. Army War College ’s Strategic Studies Institute , in coordination with the Office of the Army Deputy Chief of Staff / G - 3 , initiated a study to analyze how American and coalition forces can best address the requirements that will necessarily follow operational victory in a war with Iraq .
The objectives of the project were to determine and analyze probable missions for military forces in a post - Saddam Iraq ; examine associated challenges ; and formulate strategic recommendations for transferring responsibilities to coalition partners or civilian organizations , mitigating local animosity , and facilitating overall mission accomplishment in the war against terrorism .
The Strategic Studies Institute organized an interdisciplinary team under the leadership of Dr. Conrad C. Crane and Dr. W. Andrew Terrill .
The team ’s initial findings were vetted at a joint and interagency workshop conducted in December .
The final report of the project consists of three parts : a discussion of historical insights from 20th century postwar occupations and post - conflict operations ; an analysis of the unique challenges Iraq will present for an occupying power ; and a mission matrix that lists 135 specific tasks that must be performed to build and sustain a state .
The matrix arrays those tasks across four phases of occupation and designates whether coalition military forces or civilian agencies should perform them .

It was soon obvious that Mr. Kunchikuy had a first - rate mind , so Mr. McMeekin sponsored his education and a home - stay visit to Boston , where in the winter he encountered a puzzling white substance that was very cold .
His tribal language , Shiwiar , has no word for snow , ice , freezing or even anything very cold .
So after his return , it was tough to describe to his friends how his host family had taken him ice skating and snow - boarding .
Mr. Kunchikuy now speaks fluent English , on top of his other languages 
Shiwiar , Spanish , Quichua , Achuar and Shuar , not to mention his mastery at calling monkeys and birds in the jungle .
He became a naturalist and guide at the Yachana Foundation ’s 18 - room eco-lodge , which tourists reach by riding in a canoe for nearly three hours .
Now 30 , Mr. Kunchikuy points wildlife out to American tourists and demonstrates that grubs can be tasty .
He also displays his impressive collection of scars , from vampire bats , a piranha , a caiman , a stingray , and a shaman who operated on his chest to block another shaman ’s black magic .
In his spare time , he demonstrates how to shoot a blowgun .
“ It has a range of up to 150 feet , ” he explained .
“ It ’s better than a shotgun , because it ’s silent .
You can shoot repeatedly if you miss the first time . ”
( Keep an eye on nytimes.com in the coming days for a video of Mr. Kunchikuy using his blowgun to spear a papaya balanced on my head  but do n’t tell my wife . )
Yet the traditions he grew up with are eroding , much like the rain forest .
Loggers are chipping inexorably away at the Amazon , robbing the planet of biodiversity and of a great carbon sink that absorbs our greenhouse gas emissions .
On top of that , the deforestation itself , including slash - and - burn clearing , accounts for 20 percent of global carbon emissions , the same amount as that produced by the United States or China .
Several studies declare that the low - hanging fruit in the war against climate change is keeping these forests alive .
In my next column , on Thursday , I ’ll tell you how Mr. McMeekin and Mr. Kunchikuy are doing just that .
Update : A victory !
On Thursday , the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the State Secrets Protection Act .
Thanks to everyone who contacted their Senator .
Stay tuned to Deeplinks for more info as the bill moves through the Senate .
This week presents an opportunity to put a stop to one of the main tactics in the Bush administration 's bag of sketchy legal tricks .
The State Secrets Privilege allows the White House to hide evidence of wrongdoing , and even to try to dismiss important lawsuits , with a unilateral claim that " State Secrets " are endangered .
This doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court in the McCarthy era , and was originally meant to be used only in exceptional circumstances .
However , since 2001 , the Bush Administration has repeatedly abused the Privilege in attempts to cover up potentially embarrassing or illegal activities .
For instance , when the ACLU sued the NSA in 2006 , asserting that domestic spying activities were unconstitutional , the Justice Department misused the privilege to keep the court from deciding the case on its merits .
And , right now , the Bush administration is trying to do the same thing to the EFF 's lawsuit against AT&T and other lawbreaking phone companies .
Now , Congress may finally be ready to act to stop these abuses .
On Thursday , the Senate Judiciary Committee will consider S.2533 , the State Secrets Protection Act , which would bring much - needed judicial supervision that could help eliminate bogus state secrets claims , while carefully protecting legitimate interests in national security .
In the wake of the Act 's introduction , there 's been important media attention to SSP abuse .
National Journal detailed how " the government has shown , time and time again , that it cannot be trusted not to use bogus national security claims to avoid exposure of misconduct or embarrassment . "
On Friday , The New York Times editorial board asked " Whose Privilege ? , " writing that the bill " would go a long way toward restoring the balance and the accountability and openness that are essential for a democracy . "

Ok , today sucked in a major way .
Here ’s the scoop !
At approximately 2:30 pm PST , San Mateo County Sheriffs
Dept raids our home game ( it was the season ending freeroll tourney ) .
10 + armed ( and some heavily protected ) officers stormed into the home where we play a majority of our home games – with guns drawn .
[ UPDATE : it was NOT a SWAT team as some publications seem to have misinterpreted / inferred .
Simply a mix of some heavily protected and some standard issue patrol gear wearing officers … including the presence one door smasher / battering - ram which was NOT used . ] 20 of us were there for the freeroll tourney .
They asked if anyone had weapons , instructed us to keep our hands on the table where they could be seen , immediately asked for specific individuals , told us that we ’d each be interviewed separately , and then would be free to leave .
Mind you , this has become a tight group with over 100 friends who meet regularly to play low - stakes Hold ’em ( 6 to 25 at a time typically ) .
Each of the 20 present was interviewed separately .
Questions asked of us covered topics such as : who was present in the past , were there rebuys , did we suspect cheating , did we suspect marked cards , did we suspect anyone was taking money from the prize pool , did I ever win , was there any kind of secret code or code name or code word ( WTF ???? ) , and a few others I ca n’t remember off the top of my head .
The AMAZING thing to me was that all of us were completely calm during the whole ordeal .
Why ?
We ’re all good citizens .
We all believed that we were n’t doing anything wrong .
There was no lip service to the officers … only cooperation .
In fact , after just a few minutes we were bantering with each other ( with hands on the table where they could be seen , of course ) as if we were still playing .
This group has become more than just good GREAT poker players – we ’ve become friends .
We had a fantastic Holiday party together in December , and tonight we were going to celebrate the end of the season by going out to dinner together at a local restaurant .
Several of our players had enjoyed participating in the US Poker Bowl with well - known professionals this past October ( as the San Francisco Kings ) and were looking forward to their 15 minutes of fame on Fox Sports this spring when the event was to be televised .
We were excited about the recent growth of the group and were going to invest in chips and cards in order to accomodate the growth .
The feedback from players ( newbies and long - timers ) was always positive and everything seemed to be on the up - and - up with a concerted effort to ensure that player comfort and safety was priority # 1 .
Evidently the San Mateo County Sheriff ’s Dept thought otherwise .
Anyway , after my “ interview ” I stuck around long enough to observe 3 things that I think are relevant :
1 ) One of the officers with helmet and full - on riot gear looked familiar .
As I left , I realized that I recognized him as a person who ’d played with our group before .
He played recently , and perhaps only once or twice .
2 ) When I was outside heading to my car , I noticed another officer going through the car of the organizer of the day ’s event .
He ’d played with us several times .
As a side note , I ’d nicknamed him “ Moolah Muerta ” ( dead money ) because he was such a horrible poker player , yet seemed to be quite happy to reach into his pocket to rebuy as much as possible during rebuy tourney .
I even remember thinking to myself that it seemed as if this guy was so reckless that he could n’t have been playing with his own money …or that he had TONS of it for some reason .
Turns out it was the Sheriff ’s money !
He claimed he ’d recently moved to the area and joined the group to make new friends .
On his second visit , this guy shows up with a very attractive female companion ( way out of his league ) – who , I ’m assuming was also involved in the sting .
For someone who just moved here , he sure seemed to be bringing lots of friends into the group ( officer from # 1 above as well as the female companion / spectator ) .
That , plus the whole “ Moolah Muerta ” thing should have been setting off the alarm bells , but he was a pretty friendly guy who I assumed was no different than most of us who watched the neverending WSOP coverage on ESPN , and hoped to learn to play better … which was always my impression of what this group was about ( all skill levels welcome … open feedback environment , etc ) .
Anyway , in retrospect nobody could be that unskilled , yet that willing to keep reaching into his / her pocket .
It seemed weird , but I figured he was new and just wanted to make friends – maybe he was willing to buy friends …
I ’ve seen it in the movies , so it was n’t too far fetched of an idea .
To make things more interesting , there ’s a slight possibility that [ ie , this is speculation …as the name in the email was spelled “ Mark ” instead of “ Marc ” ] this is the person who sent an email to the whole group saying that he would be there to watch the freeroll and play in any side - tourney / ring game AND that he’d be bringing a few friends along .
In retrospect , a delicous touch to the whole afternoon I thought .
Bringing “ friends ” … how clever .
[ the author has reason to doubt the accuracy of the previous statement at this time based on new information ]
Anyway …on to # 3
3 ) Several neighbors approached me as I got my dog into the car .
They asked me if I knew what was happening ( 10 +- squad cars lined up in the street seemed to attract a few lookie - lou’s ) .
I told them we played poker there regularly .
The few people I talked to , said , “ is that all ?
How much did you play for ? ” .
When I told them the stakes , they were shocked ( at how low ) .
They all wished they knew because they said they would have been there playing too !
An older gentleman asked if we played 7 - card - stud … I said , “ no … pretty much just Hold ‘ Em ” .
He said , “ figures ” and added something to the tune of ( ie , not the exact quote ) , “ these guys should be out dealing with a real crime , not messing with you guys .
I never heard a tire squeal , a voice raised , a loud radio , or noticed people coming and going … everyone parked legally and stayed for 3 - 5 hours …
I never had any reason to suspect something dangerous was going on ” .
Hello !!!!
Does that not sum it up ?
One person even said , “ Is n’t there a meth lab somewhere that they could be shutting down instead ? ” … which I thought was spectacular !
In my opinion , the officers did have 2 valid comments while they were there scaring the crap out of us :
1 ) We were lucky that it was them that barged in , and not a couple of people wearing ski-masks making us lay on the floor at gunpoint with the intention of robbing us
2 ) “ We do n’t think you ’re doing anything wrong . ” and “ We play poker too ” … those were my personal favorites .
( Tsk , tsk , tsk … ” anything you say can , and will , be used against you in a court of law ” )
As for their intentions , I do n’t know .
The undercover guys know for a fact that they could have sent a single officer to the door , armed only with a kitten for protection , and gotten the same amount of cooperation from our group .
So their tactics seem a bit overkill .
If they were “ protecting and serving ” the players because of some kind of wrong - doings … if myself ( and others ) were in some kind of physical danger , then I ’m ok with what went down today .
That ’s what we pay them to do .
Way cool with that .
Protect me , serve me …sometimes I am a complete idiot and cannot make my own decisions – in which case , I ’ll take all the help I can get to avoid bodily harm and / or financial ruin !
However , if there ’s something else going on here ( or NOT going on here ) , and the 2 or 3 people who were involved in the sting operation carried out this whole endeavor under false or incorrect beliefs , then I truly hope their careers and reputations are affected accordingly irreparably .
I ’m uncertain of the validity of some of the allegations that two of the officers made regarding the character of the game organizer – but suffice it to say , they were defamatory if they turn out to be untrue .
With my somewhat limted knowledge at this point , I personally DON ’T believe what they said about the organizer .
I may be wrong … I may be a sucker … but I ’ve NEVER had a reason to suspect any wrong - doing .
That may be because I ’m naieve to the law regarding home games , but I ’ve NEVER felt that I was cheated .
I hope this blows over , turns out to be unfounded , and that the San Mateo County Sheriff ’s Dept has made a mistake .
Accountability is # 1 to me .
If the SMCSD is wrong , they must be held accountable .
If there ’s been any intentional wrongdoing on the part of the group organizer , they must be held accountable .
Fair is fair !
In the meantime , I ’d like to thank all of the regular home game players for their friendship , their passion , their honesty , and for the way those present today carried themselves during this whole debacle … totally professional , totally cooperative , and a true testament to the character of your typical poker player across the globe .
Top - notch people in my book … people I ’d welcome to my home any time … any day !
Poker players can be good at reading people at times , and I do n’t think I ’m alone when I say that the faces on some ( though not all ) of the officers present was one of embarrassment and sheer wonder as to what they were doing there .
Some of the things a few of them said backed that feeling up .
I genuinely feel that more than one of them felt very hypocritical about their involvement in the raid .
Anyway , as I alluded earlier – I just hope everyone is accountable for their actions and statements … including the SMCSD .
I hope I ’m not a sucker .
I hope you ’re not a sucker .

About a year ago , I put together a listing 30 or 40 free podcasts of lectures from Universities .
When I started putting together another list , I was amazed at how many more lectures are available .
The lectures in this list are all free and do n’t require any type of authentication –you do n’t have to be a student to download them .
The links are to the rss feed of class lectures .
If you copy the URL and in iTunes click on Advanced > Subscribe to Podcast it will automatically download the lectures and new ones as they become available .
I was hoping to find the Physics of Superheros in the list or a Pottery lecture .
Maybe next year .
Also be sure to checkout our study tips for students and our simple memorization technique .
Here is the complete list of 145 podcasts for your educational pleasure :
So , I went for a run in the cemetery this weekend .
That might sound a little odd , but it 's a very park - like cemetery with a big pond and geese and ducks .
People bring little kids to feed the ducks all of the time and there are always couples walking their dogs and whatnot .
Also , it 's an old cemetery with some really interesting tombstones and mausoleums " “ think of a smaller version of PÃ¨re Lachaise .
Plus , I always feel a little bit like Nate Fisher from Six Feet Under when I run in the cemetery .
Anyway , because this is such a big cemetery I always find something new when I 'm running or walking the dogs .
This weekend I found a labyrinth .
I 'll be the first to admit , I did n't know there was a difference between a labyrinth and a maze .
In a maze , you 're offered different options .
You can go this way or that way , left or right , stumble upon dead ends , etc .
In a labyrinth you only ever have one option .
You enter the labyrinth at the mouth of the path and follow that path until you get to the center .
Then you turn around and follow the path back out .
" Uh , so , what 's the point ? " you might be thinking .
A lot of people walk labyrinths for prayer or meditation .
It 's said to have a very calming effect .
Continue reading ...
In very ancient times , ( Pliny 's Natural History , written somewhere around 77 AD , mentions four ancient labyrinths ) it 's believed that labyrinths were n't necessarily used for prayer purposes " “ instead , they were intended to trap evil spirits .
But by medieval times , the design had expanded to include religious motifs such as the path to God ( the entrance to the labyrinth was birth and the middle " goal " was God ) .
Another misconception about labyrinths , at least for me , is that they have " walls " " “ you might be visualizing a hedge maze ( I was ) .
And they can , but that 's not necessarily the norm .
That 's why I was a little confused when I happened upon the labyrinth in the cemetery " “ there was a sign explaining the labyrinth , but when I looked to where it pointed , I saw nothing but grass .
But when I looked a little closer , there were bricks set level with the grass that marked the path of the labyrinth .
That seems to be more typical of labyrinths .
And they do n't have to be made of grass or hedges at all " “ lots of labyrinths are painted on a floor or inlaid out of marble or something along those lines .
After my run this weekend I became very intrigued by the whole labyrinth concept and did a little research , so I 'm sharing the most interesting tidbits with you guys .
The First Labyrinth ( we think )
There 's an ancient Greek myth about labyrinths that goes something like this :
Theseus was trying to save the Greeks from the Minotaur ( a half - human , half - bull kind of a thing ) .
The Minotaur was lurking at the heart of the Labyrinth at King Minos ' palace at Knosses on the Isle of Crete .
To find his way through the Labyrinth , Theseus used a ball of twine to get in , kill the beast and find his way back out ( sounds more like a maze then a labyrinth to me , but I 'm just relaying the story here ) .
To honor Theseus and recognize that he saved all of Greece from this horrible monster , the labyrinth was put on coins that date back to three centuries before Christ .
The coins are still around " “ that 's them in the picture .
But interestingly , no bits of the actual palace labyrinth at Knossos have ever been found .
Saffron Walden
Apparently England used to be rampant with labyrinths " “ although there are a bunch around today , only eight of them are considered " old " .
The Saffron Walden labyrinth is one of them .
It 's the largest of the eight and has been around at least since 1699 .
An ash tree used to stand in the center , but now it 's just open space .
Nazca Lines
Could the mysterious Nazca Lines in Peru actually be a form of a labyrinth ?
There 's definitely a labyrinth incorporated in the designs " “ but there is also a theory that the lines themselves were walked just as a labyrinth would be walked .
Hmm .
I do n't know about that , but it sounds just as plausible as any of the other theories surrounding the mysterious Nazca Lines .
Chartres Cathedral
The labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in Paris is a good example of a non -turf maze ( I know , I know , it 's technically not a maze but I 'm getting tired of writing ' labyrinth ' ) and a good example of the medieval labyrinth revival .
They fell out of fashion for a while , but during the Middle Ages people became interested in them again and labyrinths were often incorporated into church floors or gardens .
This one was built in 1200 AD - ish and is an 11 - circuit design divided into four quadrants .
3 - D Labyrinth
Have you heard of Glastonbury Tor ?
I had n't .
But I have heard of the mythical ( ? )
Avalon " “ according to some theories , the two places are one and the same .
Avalon is where King Arthur was supposedly taken after his last battle at Camlann and also where the legendary Excalibur was forged .
Avalon is kind of like Atlantis " “ no one can prove it existed , really , but no one can prove that it did n't exist , either .
Some monks reportedly found the bones of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere there in 1191 .
Some people think it might also be the final resting place of the Holy Grail .
But what does all of this have to do with labyrinths ?
Well , some theories say that Glastonbury Tor / Avalon is really one giant , 3 - D labyrinth .
Carved into the Tor " “ the WHOLE hillside " “ are seven deep , mostly symmetrical terraces .
A person walking the terraces will eventually end up in the same place they started " “ just like a labyrinth .
This is pretty hard to prove , though , so for now it 's just a theory .
Another ( outlandish ? ) theory is that the Tor was shaped into a spiral maze for religious purposes and that the Tor was where the underworld king 's spiral castle was located .
Scandinavian
Northern European countries such as Denmark have embraced the effects of the labyrinth as well .
Stone labyrinths along the Baltic coast have been dated as far back as the 13th century .
There used to be thousands of labyrinths in this area alone , many of them close to the sea .
Some think these were done by fishermen and other seafarers ; they were used to trap evil spirits who brought bad luck and shipwrecks .
If the spirits were trapped at the center of the labyrinth , they would not be free to wreak havoc on the seas .
I have to say , all of this talk of labyrinths plus the warm weather that seems to have FINALLY hit Iowa this weekend has me wanting to go in our ( miniscule ) backyard and build my own labyrinth .
Maybe this summer .
Do you guys know of any labyrinths in your areas ?
If not , check out the world - wide Labyrinth Locator .
It does n't have my tiny little cemetery labyrinth on there , but maybe you 'll have better luck than I did !
Let us know if you 've discovered any in your town or on your travels .
ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkish warplanes fired on a group of Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq on Wednesday as they tried to cross into Turkey , the army said on Thursday .
Turkish soldiers patrol along a road in the southeastern Turkish province of Sirnak , bordering Iraq , February 28 , 2008 .
Turkish warplanes fired on a group of Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq on Wednesday as they tried to cross into Turkey , the army said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Fatih Saribas
The army statement came a day after a military source said at least four Turkish military jets bombed Kurdish separatist targets inside northern Iraq .
“ A group of armed PKK / KONGRA - GEL terror organization members , who were trying to cross into Turkey from northern Iraq ’s Hakurk region , were spotted and neutralized by fire from aircraft of the Air Forces , ” the statement said .
It gave no further details , but “ neutralized ” generally means killed .
On Wednesday , a spokesman for the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrilla group said Turkish planes bombed a remote part of northern Iraq but no one was hurt .
A PKK spokesman denied the Turkish army statement and said the Turkish bombing had caused no casualties among the rebels .
“ The Turkish news is false .
There was a fierce battle between Turkish forces and the PKK in the area of Sirnak ( in southeastern Turkey ) yesterday .
It lasted for hours , ” Ahmed Danees , PKK spokesman in northern Iraq , said .
“ There were killed and wounded on the Turkish side , ” he said .
The Turkish military staged an eight - day incursion in northern Iraq in February against the PKK , which uses northern Iraq as a base to launch attacks on targets inside Turkey .
Ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of 40,000 since 1984 , when the group took up arms to carve out an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey .
The United States and the European Union , along with Turkey , consider the PKK a terrorist organization .
The TSA endangered the life of child who has a surgical feeding tube in his stomach by opening up his backup tube , contaminating it .
The child pleaded with the TSA officer , who said that she had to open it or refuse to allow the child to board the plane .
After an Orlando television station investigated the story , the TSA agreed to look into the incident :
James Hoyne , 14 , has a feeding tube in his stomach and carries a back - up in a sealed clear plastic bag .
Hoyne said two weeks ago a TSA officer insisted on opening the sterile equipment , contaminating his back - up feeding up tube which he later needed .
" I said ' Please do n't open it ' and she said ' I have to open it whether you like it or not .
If I can't open it , I ca n't let you on the plane , ' " Hoyne said of his conversation with the TSA screener .
This creature was found by Russian soldiers on Sakhalin shoreline .
Sakhalin area is situated near to Japan , it ’s the most eastern part of Russia , almost 5000 miles to East from Moscow ( Russia is huge ) .
People do n’t know who is it .
According to the bones and teeth – it is not a fish .
According to its skeleton – it ’s not a crocodile or alligator .
It has a skin with hair or fur .
It has been said that it was taken by Russian special services for in - depth studies , and we are lucky that people who encountered it first made those photos before it was brought away .
The Pope has sought to improve ties since his Regensburg speech
The announcement was made in a joint statement after a two - day meeting between senior Vatican and Muslim leaders in Rome .
Catholic - Muslim relations soured after a 2006 speech in Germany in which the Pope quoted a 14th Century Byzantine emperor 's criticisms of Islam .
The Regensburg speech provoked Muslim fury and triggered protests worldwide .
But it also prompted 138 Muslim scholars from 43 countries to launch an appeal to the Pope for greater theological dialogue , called the Common Word .
Since then the number of signatories to the appeal has grown to more than 200 .
Wider dialogue
The joint statement said the first Catholic - Muslim summit would be held in Rome on 4 - 6 November and would involve 24 religious leaders and scholars from each side .
It said the Pope would address the meeting on the themes of " Love of God , Love of Neighbour " , " Theological and Spiritual Foundation " and " Human Dignity and Mutual Respect " .
Catholic and Muslim leaders hope the forum will start a regular official dialogue between the two religions .
The conference will take place just over a year after the Regensburg speech .
Although the pontiff has repeatedly expressed regret for the reaction to his comments , he stopped short of the clear apology sought by Muslims .
But the BBC's Frances Kennedy in Rome says the Vatican is now clearly convinced of the need for a wider , if more difficult , dialogue with Islam .

People , actual human people who presumably have self - awareness , are using devices called variously Powerbocks , Powerizers , Powerisers , Jumping Stilts or " Those Spring Shoes Wile E. Coyote Used Sometimes . "
Now , I want to make something clear here .
There are those who think that when I refer to something as dorky , nerdriffic or engeekerated , that I 'm somehow putting myself above it .
Nothing could be further from the truth unless you equipped it with a reliable GPS and very specific instructions .
No , I know that something has the Nerd Nature because when I see it I feel a pull from somewhere deep in my chest , the same general area that gets tickly when my allergies flare up .
My first reaction upon seeing a Powerbocking video was , " Who said they could do that ? "
My second reaction was , " I gots to get one o' them ! "
I do n't have an angel and a devil on my shoulder , I have Rocky and Bullwinkle .
One may be more skeptical than the other , but neither of them is what you 'd call a fashionista .
If you 're the sort to use the word fashionista .
( I wish you would n't . )
Further evidence :
My current main form of exercise is playing Warcraft while walking on a treadmill .
Usually in my boxer shorts .
And Crocs .
Yes , yes , now you begin to see .
So , bocking , and the power thereof .
Powerbocks are devices that you strap to your feet because you feel that it 's been way too long since you fell down .
They 're like stilts , in that they make you a bit taller .
They 're like springs , in that they help you jump higher .
And they 're like replica swords , in that they prove you have more money than sense .
Looking at the various Powerbock videos on YouTube , there are a number of tricks , or vranks in Powerbock jargon , you can perform , or sido .
Jump
Jump and flip
Jump up on something
Jump down on something
Jump over something
Jump and flip over something
Be naked
Fall down
Once you 've learned to sido these vranks , you can go onto the advanced stunt levels , of which there are none .
I 'm not seeing the " slide down the railings at the local library that 's only open until noon " move that skateboarders have , nor the " sweep up a wall of snow , fly into the air , spin around like a tail - chasing kitten , land next to a huffy skier " move that snowboarders have .
Clearly someone needs to make up some better Powerbock moves .
Someone who 's never been on the things .
Someone like me , down to the cellular level .
First off , LARPing .
That 's live - action role - playing for those of you blissfully unaware .
Who would n't want to add that extra level of verisimilitude to playing an Elandian Double - Elf or a Yuppie Vulcan ?
Secondly , you could do a thing on a picnic table where you hop on one bench , then jump over the table and hop on the other .
There could be chicken on the table , which would make it more memorable .
Thirdly , there 's absolutely no reason not to buy another set of the things and strap them to your hands .
I wo n't tell your mom .
Then you could kind of do this thing where you spring back and forth onto your hands and feet , back and forth , back and forth , like one of those things , I forget what they 're called .
Lemurs with post - traumatic stress disorder , I think .
Fourth , ride a bike in them .
Let me watch you try .
Born helpless , nude and unable to provide for himself , Lore Sjöberg eventually overcame these handicaps to totally make up the words sido and vrank .
Sun Microsystems is trying to do for computing what all the king ’s horses and men failed to do for Humpty Dumpty .
For decades , the semiconductor industry has broken silicon wafers into smaller chips to improve manufacturing yields .
Now Sun has found a way to reconnect the chips so they can communicate with each other at such high speeds that computer designers can build a new generation of computers that are faster , more energy - efficient and more compact .
The computer maker , which is based in Santa Clara , Calif. , plans to announce on Monday that it has received a $ 44 million contract from the Pentagon to explore the high - risk idea of replacing the wires between computer chips with laser beams .
The technology , part of a field of computer science known as silicon photonics , would eradicate the most daunting bottleneck facing today ’s supercomputer designers : moving information rapidly to solve problems that require hundreds or thousands of processors .
On the Congressional level , Cole says that he believes that this election will be contested across a map just about as broad as the last one , with at least 75 seats in play , and that McCain contributes to opening up that map .
“ Let ’s break it down , ” he said .
“ Obviously in the Southwest , he ’s going to make us much stronger .
In Arizona , we have a couple of opportunities where he ’ll help us , but also in New Mexico .
Frankly , while some people have problems with his stand on immigration , he probably keeps Hispanics in play at the presidential level in a way no one else could .
He really helps us in the Northeast and upper Midwest  Illinois and Pennsylvania .
Then , anywhere where there ’s a veterans population or military bases .
Think of Jim Marshall ’s seat in Georgia .
That ’s a huge advantage for us .
Florida , big military presence .
We have a couple of opportunities in Texas .
But I think the biggest thing is he ’s seen as an authentic American hero , someone who can take on and shake up Washington . ”
Cole ’s strategy is not complicated , but it does contain an essential difficulty : at a moment when Washington is deeply unpopular , he wants his candidates to run as insurgents , but voters still identify Republicans with what they do n’t like about Washington  they prefer a generic Democratic Congressional candidate by a margin of 49 percent to 35 percent , according to a March 7 - 10 NBC / Wall Street Journal poll ; in an ABC / Washington Post poll released in early February , they preferred Democrats to Republicans on seven out of seven issues .
Cole ’s basic challenge is to try to flip the popular perception of the capital so that more voters identify Washington with the Democrats than with the Republicans .
He says he wants to use his party ’s resources to define Nancy Pelosi as a national character , the face of a Democratic Congress that is once again too liberal for the country .
( “ Those three little words  ‘ San Francisco liberal ’  are just magic for fund - raising , ” one of Cole ’s staff members told me . )
He has tried , when possible , to choose candidates whose biographies can reinforce the anti-Washington theme , even if they have no real political experience .
And he is counting on McCain ’s emergence to permit the party to distance its image from that of Bush .
Cole might have come up with a grand and unifying policy vision for his insurgents to run on .
But Cole is not an ideologue .
And with Rove and the party ’s other grand strategists having abandoned the field  five of the six members of the Republican Congressional leadership in 2006 have now retired 
Cole is now turning to practical answers , to process , and deferring to the politically moderate geography of the battleground areas .
“ I still think most Americans want their government to be smaller , not bigger , and their taxes to be lower , not higher , ” Cole says .
“ And I still think most Democrats in office think that America is not a force for good in the world , and I think most voters have a different perspective . ”
In the euphoria of 2006 , Cole believes , Democrats made promises that were too grand to deliver : “ Nancy Pelosi said , Put the Democrats in Congress and we ’ll get you out of Iraq , and they did n’t do it .
They ran against the culture of corruption , and they ’re absolutely killing us in raising money from PACs .
The president would have signed any bill the Democrats would have handed him on immigration , and I think they could have got S - Chip [ the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program ] done too .
But they had the same problem with George Bush we had with Bill Clinton .
They hated him too much to get it done . ”
Part of the problem , for a Republican Party that wants to get back to basics , is that George Bush and Karl Rove ’s party was not theirs alone but a pretty precise articulation of decades of post - ’60s Republican strategy .
“ You go back to the Reagan years , and even before that , and we always had a three - legged stool : anti-Communism , anti-abortion and tax and spend , ” Dan Mattoon , the Republican lobbyist and former deputy chairman of Cole ’s committee , told me .
“ The first leg dropped off when the Berlin Wall fell , and after 9/11 we ’ve tried to do the same thing with terrorism , but it ’s not as strong .
The second leg , tax and spend , was pretty strong until George Bush .
Then we had just one leg of the stool , which was social issues , and I think that you look at the makeup of the younger generation and there ’s more of a libertarian view on social issues . ”
Cole says that the party ’s rhetoric on issues like gay marriage has cast Republicans as too reactionary for many suburban districts .
“ My problem on social issues is the tone  sometimes we have been too shrill , and that has alienated voters who might otherwise have joined us , ” he told me .
The challenge , then , is finding a new generation of candidates who are n’t .
If Cole has a final argument , a closer to convince his preferred candidates that they should run for office , it is the briefing delivered by the consultants John Morgan Sr. and John Morgan Jr .
They cover two conservative generations : John Morgan Jr. is a former executive director of Gopac , and his father worked in the Reagan White House ’s political shop .
Late in September , Cole brought a millionaire businessman named Steve Greenberg , a moderate Republican from the Chicago suburbs , into Washington to woo him  to meet the House minority leader , John Boehner , to visit the White House and to meet the Morgans .
Cole wanted Greenberg to run against a Democrat named Melissa Bean , who had managed to hang on to a Republican - leaning seat , Illinois ’s Eighth District , through two competitive elections .
Greenberg was so attractive to national Republican recruiters that he was weighing two bids for his candidacy , one from Cole and one to challenge Senator Dick Durbin .
“ He ’s undoubtedly a top recruit , ” Cole said .
The Morgans are geographic essentialists ; they are working on an encyclopedia of American elections that will trace in minute detail the results of every election since the Constitutional Convention .
They began to show Greenberg slides detailing the ways each township in Bean ’s district had voted over time .
They had broken the township down by religion , income and ethnicity 
Americans of German descent are solid Republican voters in the Chicago suburbs , controlling for income and hometown , while Polish - and Italian - Americans are iffier propositions .
Through all of this a few townships in the center of the district kept flipping their colors , from blue to red and back again .
“ There are five townships here , and that ’s the whole race , ” Morgan Sr. said .
“ Those are the only votes that flip in this district , and they decide every election . ”
Cole ’s staff did n’t know all that much about Greenberg ideologically , but then they do n’t make it their business to know .
I once asked Cole about the positions his candidates were taking on immigration and the war .
“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever asked a candidate what he believes , ” he said .
“ We ’re just looking for winning candidates . ”
But one of the things they did know , and do make it their business to know , was geography .
Greenberg was from one of the towns that tended to flip back and forth , the wealthy suburb of Long Grove .
If he could simply prevail upon his neighbors to vote for him , Greenberg would have gone a long way toward winning back the seat .
“ There ’s a head start already , ” Morgan Sr. said .

The German Family Ministry is pushing for the children 's book " How Do I Get to God , Asked the Small Piglet , " by written by Michael Schmidt - Salomon and illustrated by Helge Nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people .
" The three large religions of the world , Christianity , Islam and Judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a December memo .
" The distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . "
The search for God
" The God Delusion " for kids ?
The book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " If you do not know God , you are missing something ! "
This frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
Thus they set out to look for " God . "
Along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats .
The rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930's Germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
He reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that God had set out to destroy all life on Earth at the time of Noah and chases them away .
The mufti fares little better .
While he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
He assembles a baying Islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly - looking beard .
The insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate .
Animals reject religion
The three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant
The bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives .
" I think that God does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .
" And if He does , than he definitely does n't live in [ a synagogue , cathedral or mosque ] . "
Published in October 2007 , the 20 - page book 's publisher , Alibri , said it was aware it was risking a political battle when it published the book .
" It 's clear to me that putting a critique of religion in children 's bedrooms is a hot political topic , " Alibri head Gunnar Schedel said .
Children 's " right to enlightenment "
The bishop comes with obvious connotations
Calling the ministry 's accusations an " attack on freedom of expression , " the publisher said the book answers the question of whether a nonreligious child is missing part of life " from the perspective of secular humanism . "
Schedel added that the book is intended for nonreligious parents looking to provide their children with a critical view of religion .
" All three religions are treated equally in the book , " he said .
" No one is negatively singled out . "
Author Schmidt - Salomon said the book was " desperately needed considering the enormous mass of religious children 's stories . "
He added that he the book offers children and their parents the opportunity to read about agnostic beliefs if they choose .
" Children also have a right to enlightenment , " he wrote on a Web site set up dedicated to the book .
" They should not be left defenseless to the scientifically untenable and ethically problematic stories of religion . "
The German department responsible for reviewing children 's literature is scheduled to discuss whether the book presents a danger to children 's upbringing in a March meeting .

For years I 've assumed that Japan is not a big contributor to open source .
My first real open source - related job was in embedded Linux , which saw plenty of big electronics OEMs using Linux ( e.g. , Sony , Matsushita , etc. ) , but not really doing anything in the way of contributing to open - source software .
It 's perhaps time to rethink that notion .
I talked with Jesse Casman and Craig Oda of PageOne PR upon their return from Japan and got a very different picture on the Japanese open - source market .
There 's Takashi Iwai , for example , currently one of the top - 10 contributors to the Linux kernel .
And then there 's Yukihiro ( " Matz " ) Matsumoto , the chief designer of the Ruby programming language , of course .
There 's Plat 'Home , the company that introduced Linux in Japan in 1993 ( yes , 1993 ! ) , did a successful IPO in Japan in 2000 , and currently ships microservers based on their own mix of Linux and BSD that fit in the palm of your hand .
There 's Turbolinux and Miracle Linux , as well .
But there 's even more , more that I never would have guessed .
At the Open Source Conference 2008 , held in Tokyo February 29 - March 1 this year , there were about 100 sponsors , publications and open - source projects and companies enthusiastically hawking their wares .
Yes , some of these were the local teams of open - source projects in the West like the Ubuntu Japan Team , The Japan MySQL User Group , and others .
But many were young kids , with a smart team , building up companies around great technologies and ideas .
As just one example , SecureVM is an interesting open - source virtual machine project that is designed for Japanese government use with involvement from the Japan National Information Security Center ( NISC ) .
It was just open sourced this month as a work in progress .
The project involves Tsukuba University , Intel , Tokyo Institute of Technology , Keio University , Nara Institute of Science and Technology , Toyota National College of Technology , Fujitsu , NEC , Hitachi , NTT , NTT DATA , and SoftEther .
The Japanese government , never fully trusting Smith 's " invisible hand , " is doing its part as well .
In this past two weeks two different Japan External Trade Organization ( JETRO ) events in Silicon Valley showcased Japan 's " super creators , " young engineers , utilizing a lot of open - source software , coming up with great ideas , great teams .
One of those companies , DTS , did a demo of its PlatinumHDD product , a flash - based hybrid hard disk with RAM and UPS built onto the disk , running Linux .
Their incredible transaction performance speeds are very green , requiring significantly fewer servers for comparable tasks , and are already in use by NTT , Japan 's largest company , the Japan Post Office , The Genome Linux cluster , and many others .
All of which has me thinking .... I 've long ignored the Japanese market , despite the fact that my first job out of my Masters program was with Japan 's Mitsui & Co. , one of the world 's oldest companies .
I just figured Japan was n't buying into open source ; that it was n't growing much open source .
After hearing from Jesse and Craig , I wonder if they 're right : " In open source , if you 're not paying attention to Japan , you 're just not paying attention . "
Indeed .
Perhaps the Japanese market is much more mature in open source than I had thought .
Do you have any experience selling open source into Japan ?
There ’s something undiscriminating about change .
Regardless of age , social status , education , or upbringing , most people ’s first reaction to change is usually one of resistance .
It does n’t seem to matter if the change is positive or even if the change is backed up by substantial evidence , it takes a while before we are willing to fully embrace it .
This train of thought started when I heard about Murray Straus ’ most recent findings .
Straus ’ area of expertise is spanking .
Over the years numerous studies have come out showing the dangers of spanking or other methods of corporal punishment .
From a greater chance of having depression to slower rates of mental growth to increased aggression , there ’s no shortage of evidence backing up the belief that corporal punishment is a harmful method of discipline .
Straus recently presented even more evidence against corporal punishment from a study that is the first to show a correlation between sexual behaviour and corporal punishment .
He found that adults who were spanked ( or experienced other forms of corporal punishment ) have ,
an increased probability of verbally and physically coercing a dating partner to have sex ; risky sex such as premarital sex without using a condom ; and masochistic sex such as spanking during sex .
Let ’s consider for a second that Straus ’ collective body of research is the most substantial and most valid of corporal punishment research available .
Would this new information convince those die - hard spankers to change their beliefs ?
Now that the list of negatives associated with spanking has grown , will the number of people who spank , shrink ?
I wish I could answer that question but I can’t ; there are many theories regarding people and change .
But I believe that this topic highlights just how complicated the human mind is .
After all , on the surface it seems as if the issue of spanking would be a done deal .
After all , parents do n’t want their children to have all the problems that corporal punishment seems to cause ; yet a huge percentage of people still spank their children .
There seems to be a disconnect .
Therein lies the problem inherent throughout society .
When new research or theories provide insights that will improve efficiency or motivation or marital happiness , etc. it does n’t mean too much .
Not at first .
Because people must buy into this new information .
They must buy into it enough so that they become willing to accept change .
Therefore , the ability to create change is quite powerful .
In the end , I appreciate the work of Straus and his colleagues .
Unfortunately , I know that their information is just the first step .
Now the real work begins .
How do you convince people that spanking is n’t a good method of discipline â€ “- ever ?
If someone has the answer , let me know ; I know a number of people who will insist , in spite of Straus ’ discovery , that a little spanking never hurt anyone .

ON the first Wednesday in June , the morning after the last day of voting in the 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination , the long , drawn - out battle that began with Gary Hart ’s stunning victory in New Hampshire ended  but only after one last plot twist .
I was Walter Mondale ’s delegate counter , and I had stayed up all night to estimate the delegates won and lost in the five states , including California and New Jersey , that had voted the day before .
I realized we were in big trouble .
Mr. Mondale was not going to deliver on his pledge to be over the top in the delegate count by noon on the day after the last primary .
He fell 40 delegates short of a majority .
We began a frantic morning of telephone calls to superdelegates , the party leaders and elected officials who only two years earlier had been given 15 percent of the vote in the Democratic nominating process .
By noon , the former vice president had persuaded enough delegates to ensure himself the nomination .
The superdelegates did the work they were created to do : they provided the margin of victory to the candidate who had won the most support from primary and caucus voters .
Now , a quarter - century later , the Democratic Party is once again engaged in a nominating process  this time between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama  in which the margin of victory will be achieved only with broad support from the superdelegates , the nearly 800 party leaders and elected officials who become delegates not on the basis of votes cast in primaries and caucuses , but because of their status under party rules .
Democrats created these superdelegates after the 1980 election with several purposes in mind .
Party leaders had been underrepresented on the floor of the 1980 convention , which was the culmination of a bitter contest for the nomination between President Jimmy Carter and Senator Ted Kennedy that left our party deeply divided and contributed to the party ’s loss of the presidency that year .

The uncertain origins of a foolish day
by David Johnson and Shmuel Ross
April Fools ' Day , sometimes called All Fools ' Day , is one of the most light - hearted days of the year .
Its origins are uncertain .
Some see it as a celebration related to the turn of the seasons , while others believe it stems from the adoption of a new calendar .
New Year 's Day Moves
Ancient cultures , including those of the Romans and Hindus , celebrated New Year 's Day on or around April 1 .
It closely follows the vernal equinox ( March 20th or March 21st . )
In medieval times , much of Europe celebrated March 25 , the Feast of Annunciation , as the beginning of the new year .
In 1582 , Pope Gregory XIII ordered a new calendar ( the Gregorian Calendar ) to replace the old Julian Calendar .
The new calendar called for New Year 's Day to be celebrated Jan .
1 . That year , France adopted the reformed calendar and shifted New Year 's day to Jan .
1 . According to a popular explanation , many people either refused to accept the new date , or did not learn about it , and continued to celebrate New Year 's Day on April 1 .
Other people began to make fun of these traditionalists , sending them on " fool 's errands " or trying to trick them into believing something false .
Eventually , the practice spread throughout Europe .
Problems With This Explanation
There are at least two difficulties with this explanation .
The first is that it does n't fully account for the spread of April Fools ' Day to other European countries .
The Gregorian calendar was not adopted by England until 1752 , for example , but April Fools '
Day was already well established there by that point .
The second is that we have no direct historical evidence for this explanation , only conjecture , and that conjecture appears to have been made more recently .
Constantine and Kugel
Another explanation of the origins of April Fools ' Day was provided by Joseph Boskin , a professor of history at Boston University .
He explained that the practice began during the reign of Constantine , when a group of court jesters and fools told the Roman emperor that they could do a better job of running the empire .
Constantine , amused , allowed a jester named Kugel to be king for one day .
Kugel passed an edict calling for absurdity on that day , and the custom became an annual event .
" In a way , " explained Prof .
Boskin , " it was a very serious day .
In those times fools were really wise men .
It was the role of jesters to put things in perspective with humor . "
This explanation was brought to the public 's attention in an Associated Press article printed by many newspapers in 1983 .
There was only one catch : Boskin made the whole thing up .
It took a couple of weeks for the AP to realize that they 'd been victims of an April Fools ' joke themselves .
Spring Fever
It is worth noting that many different cultures have had days of foolishness around the start of April , give or take a couple of weeks .
The Romans had a festival named Hilaria on March 25 , rejoicing in the resurrection of Attis .
The Hindu calendar has Holi , and the Jewish calendar has Purim .
Perhaps there 's something about the time of year , with its turn from winter to spring , that lends itself to lighthearted celebrations .
Observances Around the World
April Fools '
Day is observed throughout the Western world .
Practices include sending someone on a " fool 's errand , " looking for things that do n't exist ; playing pranks ; and trying to get people to believe ridiculous things .
The French call April 1 Poisson d'Avril , or " April Fish . "
French children sometimes tape a picture of a fish on the back of their schoolmates , crying " Poisson d'Avril " when the prank is discovered .

もちろん現代的なサーバプログラムでは、CPU
のマルチコア化を背景にマルチスレッドのプログラムを書くことが多いです。しかし、例えばチャットサーバのようにコネクション間の情報交換が多い場合は、今でもこのようなシングルスレッドによるステートマシンによる実装の方が現実的な場合も多いでしょう。
また、上の ProxyConn クラスでは、OnClientRead と OnServerWrite、OnServerRead と OnClientWrite という２つのメンバ関数の組み合わせで、双方向のストリームを実装していますが、このようなフレームワークではストリームの本数を増やすことも容易です。たとえばｘ本のサーバ接続を重畳して１本のクライアントに接続する、といったことも簡単にできます。
そして、そのようなモデルの高速なサーバを容易に、かつ型安全に書ける、という点において、C++ は優れた言語であると思います。

The new study suggests that the universe that came before our own universe was its identical twin .
Image credit : NASA and ESA .
Until very recently , asking what happened at or before the Big Bang was considered by physicists to be a religious question .
General relativity theory just does n’t go there – at T=0 , it spews out zeros , infinities , and errors – and so the question did n’t make sense from a scientific view .
But in the past few years , a new theory called Loop Quantum Gravity ( LQG ) has emerged .
The theory suggests the possibility of a “ quantum bounce , ” where our universe stems from the collapse of a previous universe .
Yet what that previous universe looked like was still beyond answering .
Now , physicists Alejandro Corichi from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and Parampreet Singh from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario have developed a simplified LQG model that gives an intriguing answer : a pre-Big Bang universe might have looked a lot like ours .
Their study will appear in an upcoming issue of Physical Review Letters .
“ The significance of this concept is that it answers what happened to the universe before the Big Bang , ” Singh told PhysOrg.com .
“ It has remained a mystery , for models that could resolve the Big Bang singularity , whether it is a quantum foam or a classical space - time on the other side .
For instance , if it were a quantum foam , we could not speak about a space - time , a notion of time , etc .
Our study shows that the universe on the other side is very classical as ours . ”
The finding builds on previous research , with some important differences .
Last year , Penn State physicist Martin Bojowald used a simplified version of LQG to show that a universe “ on the other side ” of the bounce could have existed .
However , although that model produced valid math , no observations of our current universe could have lead to any understanding of the state of the pre-bounce universe , as nothing was preserved across the bounce .
Bojowald described this as a sort of “ cosmic amnesia . ”
But Corichi and Singh have modified the simplified LQG theory further by approximating a key equation called the quantum constraint .
Using their version , called sLQG , the researchers show that the relative fluctuations of volume and momentum in the pre-bounce universe are conserved across the bounce .
“ This means that the twin universe will have the same laws of physics and , in particular , the same notion of time as in ours , ” Singh said .
“ The laws of physics will not change because the evolution is always unitary , which is the nicest way a quantum system can evolve .
In our analogy , it will look identical to its twin when seen from afar ; one could not distinguish them . ”
That means that our universe today , roughly 13.7 billion years after the bounce , would share many of the same properties of the pre-bounce universe at 13.7 billion years before the bounce .
In a sense , our universe has a mirror image of itself , with the Big Bang ( or bounce ) as the line of symmetry .
“ In the universe before the bounce , all the general features will be the same , ” said Singh .
“ It will follow the same dynamical equations , the Einstein ’s equations when the universe is large .
Our model predicts that this happens when the universe becomes of the order 100 times larger than the Planck size .
Further , the matter content will be the same , and it will have the same evolution .
Since the pre-bounce universe is contracting , it will look as if we were looking at ours backward in time . ”
Specifically , Corichi and Singh calculate that the change in relative fluctuations across the bounce is less than 10 - 56 , a number which becomes even smaller for universes that grow larger than 1 megaparsec ( our universe is somewhere between 3,000 and 6,000 megaparsecs ) .
As the researchers explain , having an identical twin universe would not necessarily mean that every single feature of both universes would be identical .
For instance , it does n’t imply that there was another you that existed at some point , a person who has already lived your life .
“ If one were able to look at certain microscopic properties with a very strong microscope – a very high - energy experiment probing the Planck scale – one might see differences in some quantities , just as one might see that twins have different fingerprints or one has a mole and the other does not , or a different DNA , ” Singh said .
As Singh explained , there are still many questions regarding the details of the possible pre-bounce universe .
“ The biggest question is whether these features survive when we consider more complex situations , ” he said .
“ For example , one would like to know whether some structures present in the previous universe – like galaxies – will leave some imprint in the new expanding one that will give rise to identical structure or just ' similar . '
For instance , it could happen that , in the previous universe , galaxies formed in a different way , so one might have a different distribution of galaxies on the other side .
We will be able to answer this question when we understand these models . ”
Ultimately , Corichi and Singh ’s model might even tell us what a future universe would look like .
Depending on how fast our present universe is accelerating – which will ultimately determine its fate – there ’s a possibility that a generalization of the model would predict a re-collapse of our own universe .
“ Such a universe will have many bounces from one branch to another , ” Singh said .
“ It is also possible that universes in different branches will be identical . ”

Tacoma Narrows Bridge is Falling Down
Tacoma , Washington , 1940
While buildings and bridges are made to bend in the wind , the engineers behind the Tacoma Narrows Bridge might have benefited from heeding a different aphorism : everything in moderation .
Stretching 2,800 feet above the riverbed , the Tacoma Narrows Bridge was ( at the time ) the third - longest suspension bridge in the world , behind the Golden Gate in San Francisco and the George Washington in New York City .
Its sleek design incorporated a roadbed only 39 feet wide , making the bridge far more slender and light than its contemporaries .
But it was also a lot more flexible .
The simple fact is that any structure built without enough " give "  is more likely to break in a strong wind .
There 's no shortage of mathematical formulas for calculating how flexible a structure should be .
But there was a problem .
The Tacoma Narrows Bridge was only one - third as stiff as common engineering rules dictated .
Even in modest winds , the roadway oscillated up and down several feet , quickly earning it the nickname Galloping Gertie .
Continue reading to see video of the collapse and learn about more engineering embarrassments .
While drivers found the undulations unsettling , the bridge seemed steady enough from the outset — at least to everyone except University of Washington engineering professor Bert Farquharson .
Worried that it was far too flexible , Farquharson began studying the bridge in an attempt to uncover what sort of retrofits might improve its stability .
As part of his investigation , he showed up at Tacoma Narrows on the morning of November 7 , 1940 , to film the movement of the bridge .
His timing was eerily coincidental .
As he was shooting , the Tacoma Narrows Bridge began heaving , and soon collapsed .
The Moral : It 's OK to be a stiff .
Materials like wood , metal , and concrete vibrate when they 're struck — whether it 's your fork hitting a wine glass ( causing it to ring ) or wind pushing across the roadbed of a bridge .
If sustained , the vibrations can build to dangerous levels .
It 's like pushing someone on a swing ; when they reach the back - most point in the oscillation , the same light push over and over will make the swing go higher and higher .
You do n't have to push harder each time ; you just have to push repeatedly at the right moment .
Similarly , if wind pushes a roadbed steadily for long enough , it can oscillate higher and higher , creating what 's known as resonance .
The antidote is torsional rigidity , which is just a fancy way of saying a resistance to twisting .
In the case of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge , the undulating roadbed caused alternating tension and slack in the support cables , creating a twisting motion .
The action eventually became so violent that the cables snapped , and enormous sections of the bridge fell into the water below .
To prevent this , Farquharson had suggested the addition of stiffeners along the roadbed .
Indeed , had this retrofit been made , the collapse might have been avoided .
Citicorp Center 's Close Call
New York City , 1978
Talk about narrowly averting disaster .
When the Citicorp Center in New York was completed in 1977 , it added a dramatic , sloping peak to the city 's skyline .
But less than a year later , the building 's chief engineer , William LeMessurier , helped it avoid destruction by razor - thin margins .
LeMessurier faced a unique situation when it came to designing the Citicorp Center .
In the early 1970's , the banking behemoth was looking for a new headquarters and had its eye on a vibrant square block in midtown Manhattan .
There was just one small problem : the historic St. Peter 's church sat on the block 's northwest corner .
While the clergy would n't let Citicorp tear down the church , after a little negotiating , they did agree to let the bank use the airspace above it .
This allowed the engineering team to form a novel architectural plan : build the 59 - story rectangular tower atop four massive , nine - story - high pillars so that it actually hovered over the church .
Here 's a contemporary photo of the pillars , courtesy of Wikipedia :
Having positioned the building on what essentially amounted to stilts , LeMessurier knew he would have to make the structure especially resistant to strong winds .
To help stabilize it , he embedded special braces in the Center 's frame every eight stories or so to prevent the skyscraper from bending too far .
What 's more , LeMessurier devised an additional ( and unique ) way to counter any swaying that might occur .
At the base of the building 's steeply angled roof , he placed a giant pendulum - like mechanism called a tuned mass damper — a 400 - ton block of concrete resting on a film of oil and held in place by huge springs .
If winds rocked the tower left or right , the block would slip in the opposite direction , counteracting the sway .
The skyscraper was the first in the United States to sport such a device .
When the Citicorp Center opened , all seemed well .
But less than a year later , LeMessurier got a phone call from an engineering student in New Jersey claiming that the building 's four columns ( positioned at the center of the sides instead of at the corners to avoid the church ) were improperly placed , making it susceptible to what sailors call quartering winds — winds that would hit the building across its vertical corners , pushing on two sides at once .
LeMessurier assured him they were fine , but it prompted him to review details of the design for his own students at Harvard — and thankfully so .
That 's when LeMessurier got some bad news .
The skyscraper 's builders broke it to him that they had n't welded the wind braces ' joints together , as LeMessurier had prescribed , but simply bolted them .
This met code and saved a good deal of money , but it would n't allow the joints to hold in winds above 85 mph — like those that accompany , oh , say , a hurricane .
True ; hurricanes are n't exactly common in New York City , but LeMessurier was n't going to take any chances .
During what had to be a rather humiliating meeting with Citicorp , LeMessurier informed the bank that it needed to make additional retrofits to the building .
As not to scare the employees ( or let the building 's problems leak to the press ) , they launched a plan to make the adjustments in a more , shall we say , subtle fashion .
An army of welders worked the graveyard shift seven days a week and bound two - inch - thick steel plates over all 200 joints .
The Moral : Own up to your mistakes .
Roughly a month before the welding project was completed , weather forecasters predicted that Hurricane Ella was headed directly for the Big Apple .
The welders tried frantically to finish the retrofits early , but ultimately , the bank had to go to city authorities and warn them of the possible catastrophe they were facing .
Emergency officials secretly formed a massive evacuation plan for midtown and crossed their fingers .
LeMessurier ( and Manhattan ) finally caught a break as Ella veered out to sea .
By the time the welders and carpenters finished , the building was one of the strongest in the country .
Though justifiably annoyed , Citicorp executives commended LeMessurier for coming forward with his concerns , even though his initial work had met all code requirements .
And fortunately for all the engineers involved , the entire fiasco was kept under wraps thanks to a newspaper strike that coincided with the events .
Virtually no one knew about it for more than a decade , until LeMessurier released a report about the ordeal titled , " Project SERENE , "  an acronym for Special Engineering Review of Events Nobody Envisioned .
The Millennium Bridge 's Not-So - Grand Opening
London , June 10 , 2000
The world might have avoided a Y2 K disaster at the dawn of the new millennium , but it was n't immune to the follies of bad engineering .
On the morning of June 10 , 2000 , the Millennium Bridge in London opened with great fanfare .
Only two days later , it closed with a sigh of relief from hundreds of nauseated pedestrians .
Intended as a high - profile commemoration of the 21st century , the Millennium footbridge was meant to convey a new , innovative spirit .
It was given a prime location smack in the middle of downtown , connecting St. Paul 's Cathedral on the north bank of the River Thames to the Tate Modern Gallery on the south .
Its cutting - edge design included an aluminum deck supported from underneath by two Y - shaped frames , rather than the more common overhanging arches .
The final product was sleek , futuristic — and a wee bit wobbly .
As with all bridges , the Millennium engineers designed the span to sway slightly in the wind so that it would n't snap .
But even the light breeze blowing on the morning of June 10 was enough to make the $ 26 million bridge swing like a ride in a carnival funhouse .
In an attempt to keep their balance , the thousands of inaugural pedestrians began to do what anybody on a rocking platform does : step in time with the rhythm of the swaying , shifting their weight from side to side to counter the motion .
The result was something engineers call synchronized footfall .
As more people moved in unison , more force was added to the lateral motion , and the rocking increased .
Eventually , the sway was so strong that it threatened to loft people overboard .
Police quickly restricted access , and only two days later , city officials closed the bridge indefinitely .
The following year , at a cost of more than $ 7 million , the bridge 's engineering firm and a New York - based contractor fixed the problem .
Underneath the deck , they installed some 87 dampers — huge shock absorbers — to reduce the forces of synchronized footfall .
The bridge reopened on January 30 , 2002 , but this time around , getting people to cross was going to take some convincing .
City officials offered walkers free sandwiches , and even had a Southwick mayor and a London town crier dressed in Victorian garb lead the way .
Still , just to be on the safe side , numerous British Coast Guard rescue vessels were placed downstream .
Fortunately , the bridge proved rock solid .
The Moral : Beware of people .
By the time it reopened , the Millennium Bridge ( albeit inappropriately named by this point ) was safe , but its engineers were roundly criticized for not having heeded the lesson of synchronized footfall .
After all , even Napoleon 's troops knew about its dangers .
His armies always marched in unison , but whenever they came upon a footbridge , all the soldiers would alternate their stepping cadence precisely to keep the bridge from breaking .
If that were n't enough , the Millennium Bridge engineers had a much more recent call to warning .
On May 24 , 1987 , a major " pedestrian jam "  occurred on the Golden Gate Bridge , when more than 250,000 people swarmed up the ramps as part of the bridge 's 50th anniversary celebration .
The sheer weight of the crowd flattened the roadway ( more than motor vehicles could have ) , putting enough slack in the suspension cables to allow the roadbed to swing .
The pedestrians began stepping in time with the motion and the sway increased .
Police managed to calmly dispurse the crowd , but the incident was an eye - opening reminder for engineers that even one of the most stable roadway bridges in the world is n't necessarily secure enough for people .
Kansai International Airport Learns to Sink or Swim
Osaka Bay , Japan ; 1987 to present
Never mind the two - dimensional cell phones and microscopic digital cameras .
If you 're talking mind - boggling Japanese inventions , think floating airport .
In a country where open land is pretty hard to come by , the Japanese government commissioned the construction of an airport for the growing cities of Kobe and Osaka in the only available space around them : the clear , blue sea .
In 1987 , builders started construction on a manmade island a mile and a half offshore in Osaka Bay .
To build the 2.5 mile - long , half - mile - wide piece of land , they erected a giant box of rock and concrete in the water and filled it with even more rock , gravel , and sand .
The idea was simple , but the process of carrying it out was anything but .
It took three years , 10,000 workers and 80 barges to level two mountains and shuttle the material to sea before the box was filled .
Geologists knew the soft clay seabed would compress from the weight of the " island , "  but they allowed for settlement and filled the box high enough above water to negate the effect .
Unfortunately , their calculations were way off .
What they did n't anticipate was the amount of water in the clay bed that would ooze out , as if seeping from a sponge .
By 1990 , the island had already sunk 27 feet .
In an attempt to counter that sinking feeling ( and heighten the island surface ) , workers leveled a third mountain to come up with the amount of earth needed .
Complicating matters even more were the builders ' plans to erect a mile - long terminal alongside the runway .
Engineers knew that if the ends or middle of the span sank at different rates , it would tear the terminal apart .
To compensate for the varying rates of sinkage , they decided to rest the terminal 's glass sides on 900 cement columns sitting atop two foundation walls .
As parts of the walls sank , maintenance crews could jack up certain columns , slip a hefty steel plate beneath them , and level out the terminal as needed .
The Moral : Make sure to overbudget .
Thanks largely to the steel - plate system , the Kansai International Airport has proved shockingly stable .
Since opening in 1994 , the single - terminal marvel has survived the 1995 Kobe earthquake ( centered only 18 miles away ) and a 1998 typhoon packing 200 - mph winds .
Nevertheless , the island continues to sink about six inches per year , which means engineers are still stuffing plates beneath columns .
All in all , it 's a pricey project .
Kansai Airport cost more than $ 15 billion ( almost $ 5 billion over budget ) and is deeply in debt , losing more than $ 500 million a year in interest payments alone .
Some airlines wo n't use the facility because of high landing fees , and air traffic remains below profitable levels .
Amazingly , the regional government is already busy building another nearby island of even larger proportions to support a second runway for the airport .
Humans live and die by approximations .
We are seldom as perfector as accurate as we would like to be .
And as we contemplate what we might sayto an advanced extraterrestrial civilization , maybe that 's a point we shouldemphasize .
If SETI succeeds , then it 's very likely the civilization wediscover will be much older than our own .
The reasoning is simple .
The only waywe are likely to detect ET is if alien civilizations are much older than weare .
If the typical civilization has the capacity to communicate by radio foronly a few decades before it self - destructs , then it 's very unlikely that weand they will happen to co-exist in the long lifetime of our galaxy .
Thatdisparity of age explains why current SETI programs merely listen for signalsfrom other civilizations , rather than transmit .
Transmitting requires greaterpatience and more resources than listening , so should n't we expect ourcosmic elders to shoulder the burden ?
Besides , what could a young civilization possibly have tooffer in an intellectual exchange across interstellar space ?
Surely advancedaliens would have little to gain from our understanding of astronomy orphysics , chemistry or mathematics .
What then might we say to hold up our endof an interstellar conversation ?
First Impressions
One of our natural tendencies , when we make contact withstrangers , is to try to impress them .
Otherwise sloppy dressers might polishtheir shoes for a job interview , hopeful suitors will wash their cars for afirst date , and prospective children - in - law will be on their best behavior inthe presence of the parents of their intended .
And sometimes such carefulself - presentation works — as my wife will readily attest .
Would n't we want to do the same in our first contact withET ?
Lewis Thomas , in his book Lives of a Cell , suggests that if we wantto impress an alien civilization , we should send " Bach , all of Bach , streamed out into space , over and over again . "
Thomas defends his choiceby noting that " it is surely excusable for us to put the best possibleface on at the beginning of such an acquaintance . "
And in fact when musicalselections were chosen for the interstellar recording borne by two of the Voyagerspacecraft , three of the 27 pieces were by Bach .
But perhaps even more impressive to an advanced civilizationwould be a more balanced presentation that reflects honestly on our foibles andshows a certain self - awareness of our imperfections .
When looked at in thislight , perhaps even a description of our somewhat primitive science , mathematicsand technology could be illuminating to extraterrestrials .
For example , at a workshop on The Art and Science of InterstellarMessage Composition sponsored by the SETI Institute and the LeonardoNetwork , artist Richard Clar emphasized the ways that the process ofconstructing messages could be instructive to ET .
According to Clar , we mightuse technologies developed for other purposes to compose interstellar messages .
For instance , if we wish to tell ET about the three - dimensional structure ofthe human body , we might create messages using medical imaging technologieslike Computerized Axial Tomography — more commonly known as CAT - scans .
Themessages would also , indirectly , contain information about the level of ourdevelopment as a species .
Though our technologies may be crude byextraterrestrial standards , the rudimentary level of our accomplishments mayitself be of interest to an advanced civilization , which might long since haveforgotten the details of its own struggle to develop a stable , enduringsociety .
A Measured Response
Indeed , even a brief review of the history of terrestrialmathematics might prove of interest to an alien .
As all high school geometrystudents can tell you , if we know the radius of a circle , we can easilycalculate its circumference .
Presumably , extraterrestrials would also know thatc = 2 pr , where " c " is the circumferenceof the circle and " r " is its radius .
What might surprise ET is how well humans get by , even whenwe are a bit inaccurate .
Though we now know that the value of p is 3.14159 ?
( and on it goes into infinity ) , earliermathematicians used much cruder estimates of p .
For example , when wise King Solomon was planning a bathing area in thegreat temple he was constructing , its specifications indicated that the poolwould have a radius of 5 units and a circumference of 30 units .
If you plugthese numbers into the equation for calculating the circumference of a circle , you 'll see that the value of p was estimatedto be 3 .
While this number underestimates p byabout 5 % , by all accounts , the temple turned out to be quite spectacular .
Perhaps the most important message that ET could gain from this example is thatin spite of our imperfections and miscalculations , we humans are capable ofmoving forward , sometimes with a fair amount of style .
Embracing Imperfection
Indeed , rather than continually focusing on ways that we asa species are superior beings , perhaps as we attempt to make contact with ET , we should take the opposite approach .
As a species we are , to put it bluntly , quite imperfect .
More often than our egos would like to admit , we snap at ourspouses , forget appointments , pay our bills late and round off importantmathematical constants to the nearest integer .
Perhaps somewhere out there , circlinga distant star , is an extraterrestrial civilization a million years oursenior .
Having long ago conquered war , poverty , and disease , having formed astable society capable of enduring on timescales that stagger our imaginations , what would they think of our human flaws and imperfections ?
If some day we sendthem a message of our own , signaling our interest in joining the Galactic Club , would our application simply be laughed off ?
Who knows ?
They might be surprised , perhaps even pleasantlyso , to discover a young civilization that would initiate a conversation inwhich each exchange could take hundreds or thousands of years .
Wise oldextraterrestrials might even admire our audacity for believing that , in spiteof our shortcomings , humans may continue to exist in the coming centuries — perhapseven long enough to receive a reply from ET .
A week or so ago I made an Easter egg in Mathematica and emailed around a bit to see if I could get other people to try it , too .
I consulted with my family , dared readers of my blog to send me Mathematica eggs and mentioned my egg to my friend science - fiction writer Cory Doctorow , who blogged it on BoingBoing .
I also spread the idea around Wolfram Research .
As someone with a small collection of ornamental eggs in a glass case in my living room , I am quite pleased with the results .
Here ’s how it came about :
My kids are enthusiastic celebrators of holidays .
They want to start decorating for Halloween in August , and decorating for Christmas as soon as the pumpkins and spider webs come down .
Last week , I had bought a carton of eggs and a package of egg dye , and kept finding my kindergartner getting out the eggs or the dye without permission .
So I ’d promised that Thursday , absolutely , we would begin work on eggs .
I have a copy of Michael Trott ’s The Mathematica GuideBook for Graphics , and on Thursday afternoon , my fifth - grader was flipping through it , looking at the pretty pictures .
He saw a picture in it and asked if I could scan in and print out a picture like that on a sticker for him to put on an Easter egg .
I decided he had a point there : that one could and should decorate eggs with Mathematica .
The example he ’d chosen was more elaborate than I was willing to take on in 3D , but I decided to see what I could do while we boiled the eggs .
I looked for something to work from and found the Ellipsoid Demonstration on the Wolfram Demonstrations Site .
I adapted from that , using the mathematical description of an egg shape from Jürgen Köller ’s website as my guide to egginess .
I had the basic egg by the time my kids got home from school Friday .
I showed it to them and they were wildly enthusiastic .
The instructions demanded that the eggs be cool for dyeing , and I had let them cool overnight so we could dye our eggs that afternoon .
Dyeing eggs actually takes a while , so I was modifying the Mathematica egg notebook according to child requests while we let the eggs sit in their dye baths .
I tinkered with it and showed it to my dad , physicist John G. Cramer , who has been a Mathematica user since the beginning .
He emailed me a notebook with some other ways to color the eggs .
( My kids like their grandpa ’s even better than mine . )
Over the next few days he sent me a couple more , to rave reviews by my kids .
I ’d colored my eggs using Mathematica 6 ’s built - in color gradients .
My dad used sinusoids , polynomials and the Riemann zeta function to generate his color patterns .
My daughter demanded printouts and made a little book that now runs about 25 pages , to which she has added her own annotations — some of our eggs now have fluorescent pink chicks hatching out of them .
She has decorated the corner of the living room that she calls her clubhouse with cut-outs of the eggs and she used them as bait for her St. Patrick ’s Day leprechaun trap .
So this was essentially a child - driven family art project that ultimately involved three generations .
By now others have had a crack at it , as it were , and there are a number of delightful methods of digital egg decorating and construction available on the Demonstrations site .
Some are quite elaborate .
My kids and I have spent an hour or two investigating possibilities , and there is still more to explore .
Additionally , bringing things full circle , Michael Trott — whose book inspired my son to ask for mathematical patterns on eggs in the first place — has created a really elaborate Mathematica notebook for making various types of traditional Eastern European eggs , which is available for download on his Mathematica GuideBook site .
He says that the egg notebook will be expanded and included in the Version 6 edition of the Graphics volume .

I can’t believe I ’m going to do this , but I ’m going to do it .
Yesterday , Dave Winer ranted about how blogs have become an ecosystem of recycled conversations about an original thought that happened long ago .
Even so , I am going to talk about a post that Dave Winer wrote this weekend .
No , not that post , the one about the pig in Walnut Creek .
Winer stops at a traffic light and a pig tells him ( I know , that part makes no sense to me either — if you get it , please fill me in ) that Google is going to move into the kinds of web services on which Amazon built its amazing turnaround .
Only for free .
Maybe this talking pig thing is some uncharted territory in deep backgrounding , or maybe it ’s a very useful hallucination .
Either way , Winer is really onto something .
And if Google wants to secure its dominance of all things Internet , even in the face of flat clickthrough rates or a brain drain , it had better find that pig — fast .
The real juice of the idea is n’t in the post itself , but in something that Winer went in and wrote in the comments .
“ Google until they came up with their text ads had no business model other than VC , and they managed to take over an industry with that approach .
I do n’t see why Amazon charges me for my use of AWS …
I ’d use their services for new things if there was no cost to it .
I think perhaps that ’s what Google is thinking , acquisitions .
How much would it be worth it to them to buy companies without having to transition their technology to their cloud ?
I think if that ’s how they ’re thinking they ’re smart to approach it that way . “
When I read that , my mind flashed back to an interview I conducted last year with an executive at Amazon ’s web services .
In the interview I speculated aloud that what Amazon was doing was a lot like what corporate VC arms like Intel Capital do — invest in startups with which they will work — or buy — later on .
Only instead of using hard cash , they were using infrastructure .
Very shrewd , I said .
The executive ’s response was that Amazon was not doing that at all , and that it would never do that with web services .
I thought but did n’t say :
Well , if you do n’t do it someone else will .
Now some pig is saying that Google is doing it .
As valued Google workers pack up their desks and launch new startups , this is the single best strategy for Google to bring them back into the fold .
And it ’s a great way to pull the rug out from under Amazon , strategy - wise and profit - wise .
While not exactly an original thought , it may be something for blog superdelegates to chew on .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A nationwide alert system will use cell phones or other mobile devices to send text messages to Americans when an emergency occurs , the Federal Communications Commission will announce Wednesday , according to an FCC representative .
The representative said cell phone companies that voluntarily opt into the system would send text - based alert messages to subscribers in response to three types of events :
- A disaster that could jeopardize the health and safety of Americans , such as a terrorist attack ; these would trigger a national alert from the president of the United States .
- Imminent or ongoing threats such as hurricanes , tornadoes or earthquakes .
- Child abductions or Amber alerts .
T- Mobile , Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) , Sprint Nextel ( S , Fortune 500 ) and AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) all stated that they would be likely to opt into the alert system if it is passed by the FCC .
" While we obviously need to review the details of the FCC 's decision , we look forward to offering mobile emergency alerts to our customers , " AT&T said in a written statement .
A Sprint representative said the company would participate if the FCC adopts the plan exactly as it was recommended by an advisory group .
A federal agency , yet to be appointed , would create the messages and information that would go to the participating cell phone companies , the FCC representative said .
Once that agency is named , all carriers who opt into the system will have to meet the requirements of the system within 10 months .
Subscribers would be able to opt out of receiving the messages , according to the current plan , and carriers would be required to provide vibration or audio attention signals with a distinct sound for people with disabilities .
The alert system plan was generated out of an act Congress passed in 2006 that looked at emergency communications .
The act directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration , the Department of Homeland Security , and FCC and other agencies to work together to enhance and expand the capabilities of emergency communications in the United States .

We ask so little of you ; to keep us informed on the custody status of Britney 's kids , to let us know , assuming she 's white and pretty enough , that somewhere a young woman was tragically killed , and of course , updates on just how often Roger Clemens used steroids .
And to your credit , you are all over these vital stories that affect millions of Americans , so kudos for that .
But just one small quibble ; could you take some of the journalistic zeal and attention to detail that you invest in those stories and use them in your reporting of the 2008 presidential primary race ?
This morning , MSNBC 's political reporter John Yang was asked what was next for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , following Obama 's victory in Wyoming .
Said Yang :
And what happened in Wyoming means that Barack Obama is again adding to his delegate lead , his lead in the delegate count , and erasing at least some of the gains that Hillary Clinton made in Ohio , Texas and Rhode Island last week .
And that means this see - saw battle is going to go on .
First of all , Obama gained more delegates in Texas than did Hillary .
Second , a see - saw battle would imply that the lead keeps changing hands .
It has n't .
Obama remains ahead in the pledged delegate count by approximately 100 delegates .
Third , the only way Hillary will be able to overcome that deficit is if Obama falls victim to the old , " found in bed with a live boy or a dead woman . "
So please , get over your dream of an epic battle to the convention and report the facts .
Oh , and by the way , John W. McCain is not a straight talker .
FYI .
I knew that election season was in full swing the day my 8 - year - old son came down to breakfast wearing a bathrobe to which he had affixed his entire collection of historic campaign buttons .
He sat at the table sleepily , eating Cocoa Krispies and strawberries while his hair rippled in the breeze from the overhead fan .
From his lapel , a light - up " Dole in ' 96 ! " pin blinked at irregular intervals , its ancient battery almost exhausted .
" So , Daniel , " I said , " who are you supporting ? "
He inspected his memorabilia as if looking for inspiration .
Then he pointed to a small button that I think is his favorite .
" Al Smith 's not running this year , " I said .
He finished his cereal , then drank the milk from his bowl .
He looked up and gave me this pitying stare he gets , as if he 's Tim Russert and he 's about to roll incriminating video .
" Obama , " he said .
" I got his button when we went to Union Station .
Plus I collect state quarters , and he says he supports change . "
That 's my son – the third - grade pundit .
As I 've mentioned previously in this space , it is n't always easy living with a politically inclined elementary student .
Other kids at bedtime want their parents to read them a story .
Daniel will look up from one of his almanacs , lean over the railing of his bunk , and say , " Dad , what can you tell me about the Progressive Era ? "
He even scares his teachers .
The other day , his class had to do this complicated math sheet / acrostic , where they multiplied numbers , then matched their answers to letters , then used the letters to spell out the name of the president whose face is on the $ 100,000 bill .
Daniel wrote down the answer in about two seconds .
( It 's Woodrow Wilson , in case you 're interested . )
He did n't have to bother with the math .
We got a note home about that one .
( " DID HE JUST KNOW THIS ???!! " wrote Ms. Phillips . )
On the other hand , it 's been interesting to watch an actual presidential campaign play out through the eyes of someone who thinks Hannah Montana is old .
First of all , Daniel does n't care a whit about ideology .
Republicans and Democrats are just teams , like the Washington Nationals and his beloved Tampa Bay Devil Rays .
But he does n't quite get that sports and politics are n't the same .
No , I tell him , Hillary Clinton cannot trade Bill to the Republicans for Mitt Romney and a state to be named later .
John Edwards is n't a free agent about to sign with the GOP .
Daniel views candidates through the lens of what he knows – history .
So he likes Obama , because Obama reminds him of John F. Kennedy .
He likes John McCain , because McCain looks like someone who maybe knew John F. Kennedy .
( He can't figure out the modern Kennedys .
Too many of them .
For some reason , he thinks Ted Kennedy is Arnold Schwarzenegger 's father . )
So , anyway , after breakfast Daniel stood up , buttons clanking like chain mail , and started to wander toward the living room .
" Where are you going ? " I said .
" You have n't even read the comics . "
" Upstairs to see Andrew , " he said , referring to his older brother .
" We 're gonna play cable news .
And it 's my turn to be Wolf Blitzer . "

" Mission : To encourage citizen ownership of transparent , participatory democracy . "
- Creekside Declaration , 3/21/08
Along these lines , I believe Instant Runoff Voting will aid in encouraging citizen ownership by eliminating the spoiler factor and giving citizens a broader choice ( more freedom ) in whom they vote for .
It will also reduce having worst candidates win elections .
I wonder what the implications of this mission statement might have on the electoral college system , in addition to electronic voting , election fraud , etc. - Tom

And does IRV offer / allow for the transparency required for a successful democracy ?
Or , would it require still more less - than - transparent voting technology to make such a scheme workable ?
My concern remains that we have a difficult enough time adding 1 + 1 + 1 , and have determined , somehow , that computer systems akin to those needed to get to the moon are someone needed for that .
It seems to me that until we can get that right , even more complicated and / or un-transparent technology is needed to pull off IRV ( never mind the problems that can occur with the gaming of such systems , which would make something like Approval Voting more palatable , less game - able , requiring of nothing more complicated technically than we already employ , and yet achieve the same ends that IRV is meant to accomplish . )

And , by the way
These are just words unless you sign on with your life .
is pretty much exactly what I have been saying to everyone about everything for quite some time .
It still freaks people out , but I keep saying it .
Nothing will change until we stake our lives on it .
There is utterly no way around that , and it appalls me just how few do n't try to wiggle out of it in their heads , in exchanges with others , on whatever bit of perfidy is subject .
I loved Koehler 's piece , but he 's speaking as if all is not lost already , as though there is something to preserve .
It 's more accurately described now as something we must gain at all costs .

Brad -
Could you tell us who all of the people in the picture are - the signers of " The Creekside Declaration " ?
Just curious .

Brad , I believe the following voting system proposal meets the Creekside Declaration .
Let me know what you think .
Vote By Mail Plan
In an ideal democracy , citizens are responsible for voting and then assuring their vote is recorded and counted correctly .
In order to create and sustain such a democracy , the system of voting must be transparent to its citizens .
An outline of such a system follows .
This proposed system allows voters to vote in the convenience and privacy of their home and to verify that their vote was received and recorded correctly .
Additionally , it allows individual citizens , community groups , and political parties to verify that only legally registered voters in each precinct vote and have their vote counted .
Everybody can be an auditor .
Finally , this system may reduce the cost of holding an election by seventy - five percent .
This proposal is for all Americans to VOTE BY MAIL .
Details of this system are : 1 . Paper ballots would be created and distributed in much the same manner as our current Absentee Ballots .
The following control information must be included on each ballot : a ) a unique ballot number , and b ) a randomly generated verification number would be printed on the back of each ballot ( this prevents others from creating “ copies ” of ballots and using them to challenge votes . ) .
Additionally the local precinct number must be included on the return envelope along with the voters name , address and signature .
Ballots would be mailed to all registered voters at least one month before each “ Election Day ” .
Voters , for whatever reason , may request that their ballot package be held at the Supervisor of Elections office so that they can pick it up personally or vote ( just like absentee ballots are voted ) at the SOE office .
2 . When the Supervisor of Elections receives the sealed ballot , the unopened ballot envelope would be scanned and the voters name , address and precinct would be placed in an on - line “ Voted ” database available to all citizens in a read - only format .
The sealed ballot would then be filed by name and precinct , in a secured location .
3 . A Vote Count day would be established – the day after the final “ Election Day ” .
4 . On Vote Count Day , the sealed ballots would be opened and counted by an optical scanner and totals would be maintained by precinct as they are now .
All ballots for a precinct would be removed from their envelopes in a manner that conceals and protects the name and address of each voter .
This precinct batch of ballots would then be run through the optical scanner and counted .
This vote count would be open to the public .
5 . These votes would then be placed in a “ Counted Ballots ” on - line database by precinct and ballot number and the paper ballots would be filed in the same order in a secure location .
Again , this database would be available to all citizens in a read - only format .
This system protects the privacy of every voters vote and provides the opportunity for all citizens to verify :
• Only registered voters in each precinct actually voted in the precinct .
Any citizen can challenge voters and the Supervisor of Elections must be able to overcome the challenge and prove the voter is a legally registered voter in that precinct .
• Voters can verify that their vote was recorded correctly .
This can be done directly on - line or by phone to the Supervisor of Elections office .
If their vote is recorded incorrectly , they can show proof of their actual vote with a copy of the ballot and the ballot verification number .
Obviously , this requires exposure of their “ secret ” ballot ( to the Election Board only ) .
At least one month must be allowed to challenge voters , vote recording and vote counts .
The election cannot be certified until all challenges are resolved .
This system eliminates the need for actual voting precincts and all their associated costs and controversy .
No more turned away voters , long lines , faulty equipment and corrupt ballot handling .
According to Oregon , their Vote By Mail system saves 75 % of their election costs .
Currently , Oregon is the only State to use a Vote By Mail System .
This voting system is transparent and allows all citizens and citizen groups to verify that all voters are legally registered and that all votes are recorded and counted correctly .
This is the responsibility of citizens in a Democratic society and must not be passed off to government officials , committees or elected officials .

“ Ownership ” is an unfortunate use of language .
That term invokes proprietary meanings .
Should n’t we be seeking to free our elections system and democratic institutions from proprietary interests ?
Rather than shackling it with the “ ownership ” of millions of citizens ?

we all should be watching the SOS web sites
earlier while i was listening to brad and vicki on votersrescue i went to tx sos site
the state report shows dems early votes 1,284,009
then i scrolled to back and added the presidential senate districts early vote totals together 31 outta 31 that number was 1,259,739 so thats 24,270 votes less than reported on front page of report
they dont get the numbers to match from the front of the report to the back of report so how r we suppose to trust the " boxes "
btw great show brad ... rock on

Thanks for sharing your thoughts , and for testing them against the Creekside Declaration .
While there are some good thoughts , and motivations behind your proposed scheme , I see a number of problems with the plan .
The biggest issue is that Vote by Mail is NOT transparent .
When the ballot is dropped into the mailbox , it 's " gone " essentially , and may or may not make it through the post office and may or may not be counted if it arrives at the election office .
What if it does n't ?
Then what ?
Once it 's there , it 's counted by op - scanners in secret which may or may not be accurate .
As well , there are privacy concerns , and vote - buying / selling concerns with VBM .
Your scheme , as described , would allow me to sell my vote when I log on and prove to the " buyer " that I 've voted as they wished .
I realize that 's a prob w/ all absentee voting , and it's one of the reasons I believe the move towards VBM in so many places is a dangerous one .
I 've been meaning ( for the longest time ) to do an article called " What 's Wrong with Vote - by - Mail ? " in order to detail some of these concerns .
Yes , I realize that Oregon does it with some success , though EI folks in the state tell me the success of the program has more to do with the good procedural oversight of SoS Bradbury .
They are concerned what would come of the system once he leaves the job .
As said , I think the move to VBM across the country is a very dangerous one , for some of those reasons as described and no , I do n't personally believe it to be a transparent system .
But that 's just me , and the trick here is to ask yourselves --- everyone --- as decisions and policies are made for elections .
If we had more folks thinking it through , we likely would n't be in the disastrous state that we 've come to .

Anon anonymously said # 7 : “ Ownership ” is an unfortunate use of language .

That 's correct .
Our government is OWNED by the people .
" Of the people , by the people , for the people , " as some old quaint document states in no uncertain terms .
Should n’t we be seeking to free our elections system and democratic institutions from proprietary interests ?
Not if the " proprietary interests " are the citizens .
The declaration says " citizen ownership , " not " corporate ownership " or " Diebold ownership " , but " citizen ownership " .
I 'm quite comfortable with that .
Rather than shackling it with the “ ownership ” of millions of citizens ?
I probably would have chosen control , direction , etc .
You 'll have to take that one up with the founders .
I 'm standing with them on this one .
Hope you 'll stand with me .

Brad ,
The plan I proposed is TRANSPARENT .
Every voter can verify that their vote was recorded and counted correctly .
If their vote is " lost " or modified they will know .
They can also verify other voters in their neighborhood , to assure that only legitimate voters actually vote .
This is not JUST a vote - by - mail - it is fully verifiable and controlled by the voter .
Please read and give me specific cases where fraud and / or mistakes can be made without the voter knowing about it .
Thanks for commenting .

Ray Padgett -
In your scheme , as I understand it , voters may verify that their own vote arrived and was counted accurately ( which , as mentioned , could lead to easy vote buying / selling , ) but they could not assure that anybody elses votes were counted accurately , as they could with a precinct - based paper ballot system .
Eg .
When voting at the precinct , I ( as a random voter / citizen ) can learn that 214 voters cast votes that day , I can then look at those 214 ballots to determine how they all voted , and if the precinct vote tally was correct .
In your system , while I can find out that X mail - in ballots were counted , there would be no way for me personally to know that ALL votes arrived and were counted at all , much less that they were counted accurately , unless I checked with * every * citizen to see if * they * checked their own personal vote and found it to be accurate .
There 's a lot of murk inside the blackness there , requiring faith in the Voting Gods and Results Fairies at the end of the day , when I 'll largely have to presume that all ballots made it to the county and were counted as cast .
The vote buying / selling issue , as mentioned , is no small problem / downside in your scheme , but the loss of 100 % transparency , as described , is also far less than we need to be able to expect from our elections , in my opinion .
I have seen many proposed schemes where a * voter * can try and determine if his / her vote is counted is counted accurately .
But we ALL need to be able to determine if ALL of the votes are counted accurately in order to have a fully citizen - owned and overseen election in which we can all have confidence .
As I see it , in any case .

Brad , I really appreciate your comments on my voting plan .
As to vote buying / selling , your comments are correct , but I believe small cameras and cell phones also work and are just as easy .
All citizens can verify the total vote count on - line in my scheme and I have seen no other system were that is possible .
NO , I cannot verify that my neighbor 's vote was recorded correctly - only he can do that .
I believe the number of people who verify that their vote was recorded and counted correctly would be much greater than any certified audit would verify .
In fact no audit could verify that my vote was recorded correctly without exposing my " secret " ballot .
I know of no other voting system that allows " me " to verify my vote , verify that my neighbor voted , and verify the actual vote count .
This is voter transparency and I would be happy to support such a system .
Again , thank you for reading and commenting .
I appreciate it .

This declaration goes a long way in creating a system where we know who we voted for and can verify that our vote was tabulated correctly .
A great step forward .
I heartily applaud your efforts .
However , is the voting process really free and fair ?
I am not asking if the person with the most votes wins which is what the Creekside Declaration is addressing .
I am wondering about how people ’s ideas , thought processes and decisions are influenced by TV , radio , newspapers , advertisements and endorsements .
Because is n’t the media partial to the economic and political powers that support or control them ?
And are n't many people 's ideas heavily influenced by those media ?
In some ways I think that voting gives us the impression or perception that we can get what we want when we are really just being screwed over .
Sometimes I think that the voting process keeps us believing that we participate in an open democratic process and that our resulting government is free and fair .
But in our bottom - line economically controlled world maybe voting has unfortunately become largely ineffectual .
It seems as if to make the voting process free and fair we must turn our attention to the economic giants that control governments , media and policies around the globe .
And to do that we must come together outside of the processes that they control .

In response to Brad 's take on IRV : --------
A hand count also is possible under IRV and was the method used in the Cary , North Carolina pilot program in October 2007 [ 24 ] ( after initially counting first choices on optical scan equipment at the polls ) and in most non-U.S. jurisdictions ; however it is usually more time - consuming than a plurality count , and may need to occur over a number of rounds .
In Australia , a simplified count is sent to a central location on the night with the actual ballot papers transported there , securely , for the final count .
In Ireland 's presidential race , there are several dozen counting centers around the nation .
Each center reports its totals for each candidate and receives instructions from the central office about which candidate or candidates to eliminate in the next round of counting .
...
The intention of IRV is to find one candidate acceptable to a majority of voters .
It is intended as an improvement on the ' First Past the Post ' ( plurality ) voting system .
Under ' First Past the Post ' the candidate with most votes ( a plurality ) wins , even if they do not have a majority ( more than half ) of votes ( unless election rules require a runoff under that condition ) .
IRV is most suited to elections in which there can be only one winner , such as a mayor or governor .
http://en.wikipedia.org/...ki/Instant-runoff_voting
--------
So , in conclusion , IRV is more complicated , but does n't require electronic counting .
I disagree with IRV advocates who want to use electronic counting .
IRV better represents the will of the citizenry and furthers the goal of encouraging citizen ownership of transparent , participatory democracy .

It 's called a piece of paper , a pen and an open , publicly counted ballot .
I know it 's not rocket science , and even a little old lady could understand and oversee it , and I know that no corporation stands to make billions of dollars in marketing such a system , but it works , it 's verifiable by ALL , and it 's 100 % transparent .
I have heard , with all due respect , of other schemes that work somewhat similarly to the one you suggest , wherein voters can try to verify * their own * vote .
Maybe .
( And the same vote / buying selling issues general come up with those as well ) .
Unfortunately , if I can't verify --- to my personal satisfaction --- that an election was held honestly , cleanly and accurately , then democracy is headed down a very dangerous and slippery slope .
We 're currently on that slope .

Once back at the central location , the ballots are in a black hole .
It becomes faith - based voting .
If you wish to rethink the plurality voting we use now , I 'd suggest focusing on a scheme which could be done transparently at the polling place , while everything is in plain site .
You added : IRV is more complicated , but does n't require electronic counting .
I disagree with IRV advocates who want to use electronic counting .
IRV better represents the will of the citizenry and furthers the goal of encouraging citizen ownership of transparent , participatory democracy .
I applaud your opposition to IRV schemes which require non-transparent electronic vote counting .
That said , why would not Approval Voting ( click to check it out if you do n't what it is ) , which can easily be counted at the precinct by the very same methods we now use , not be better than IRV ?
And yet still , accomplish the same goals you mention above ?
I am not advocating for Approval Voting .
I 'm largely agnostic here .
But for those who want to find something better than the Plurality Voting we currently use , so far , it seems Approval Voting fits the bill much easier , safer and reliably than IRV or Range Voting or the other various alternatives I 've seen presented out there .
So would welcome your thoughts in reply .

Yes , paper ballots are the answer .
If standardized tests can be tabulated without a problem , there 's no reason why our elections can't too .
Then with legitemate exit polls and recountable ballots , there would be a 99.99 % chance for any people getting away with election fraud .
For classes on civil government , students could then learn why we legalised pen and paper ballots , and why we all have an obligation to help ensure the quality of exit polls .

From Kim Alexander at CalVoter :
The company that processes SAT tests , Pearson Educational Measurement , had at least a one percent error rate in its October 2005 test results .
The company claims that the scanning errors were the result of humidity , which it says caused the test paper to expand and the scanning devices to incorrectly read the answers .
Overall , of the 495,000 students who took the October test , 4,411 were awarded lower scores than they deserved , and 600 got higher scores .
As you might expect , the lawsuits are flying , since many students were adversely impacted by the incorrect test scores and did not apply to schools they preferred .

Brad , Normally I am in complete agreement with you , but here I agree with Anon .
Words matter , as you well know , and the precise words chosen in our Declaration of Independence was a matter of some debate .
Your claim that the phrase " of , by and for the people " connotes " ownership " is incorrect .
If ownership were intended , then it would have been " government of the people " and " by " and " for " would not have been needed -- for these additional words clearly imply that the government is also directed or controlled by the people , and that it exists for their benefit .
" Ownership " does not always confer control , participation , direction or benefit -- take for example our " public " airways -- we may " own " them but we most assuredly do NOT control them nor even participate in them .
And it could certainly be argued that they do not exist currently for our benefit -- for that we rely on the Internet , which exists as a private service for which we each pay .
We the people need to do more than own our voting system , we need also to operate and direct it ourselves to ensure that it is for the benefit of our democracy .

The thing I like about vote by mail ballots though is that when you receive it , there always seems to be a race or an initiative on the ballot that I 've heard little about .
Getting the ballot by mail gives me time to study the issue or candidate before voting on it .
Also you receive the ballot a couple of weeks ahead of time ( 4 weeks here ) if you do not receive it , you have time to rectify the mistake .
Basically , it helps out the people too busy to study the issues / candidate beforehand Plus , BVM increases voter participation due to long lines , not enough ballots and / or broken machines at the polls .

Carol # 33 - Actually , your agreement seems to agree with my belief that " ownership " is the right word here .
You said : " Ownership " does not always confer control , participation , direction or benefit -- take for example our " public " airways -- we may " own " them but we most assuredly do NOT control them nor even participate in them .
Unfortunately , you are correct .
And that is the problem .
We have given up control , and even participation , of the airwaves to the corporations who have leased them from us .
But , as with any lease , it comes with certain responsibilities to the owner of the property .
You can't lease and then burn down a house or destroy a leased car ( at least without having to pay for the property that you damaged , that you did n't own ) .
We do participate in the ownership of those airwaves , via the FCC and public oversight thereof , though the FCC has abdicated their role in that regard .
A similar thing has happened with our elections , and thus the citizens need to reassert their ownership of them , which is the mission described in the Creekside Declaration , and which I believe we should all stand by .
BTW , not agreeing with me 100 % on all issues is always just fine .
I encourage the conversation and debate ( otherwise known as democracy ) .

Ray - after the optical scanner reads your VBM ballot and software sends the image , along with your sercet random number , to the website you use to verify your vote how do you know the software did n't modify your vote ?
It seem to me that there is nothing to prevent or detect modification after the ballot is posted and before it is is tallied .
The only thing you can verify is that the ballot was recieved and read correctly by the optical scanner .
Beyond that point it is " trust us " .

WASHINGTON 
For much of the year , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s campaign has struggled to find a way to attack Senator Barack Obama .
Even for a campaign so adept at attacking , Mr. Obama proved a daunting target .
He was extremely popular with Democrats , did not have an extensive voting record and , in fact , held many of the same views as Mrs. Clinton .
The fact that he was African - American made the Clinton campaign wary  as happened more than once  that they would be accused of injecting racism into the campaign .
As much as anything , the Clinton campaign was concerned about launching an attack that could provide ammunition to Republicans should Mr. Obama become the party ’s nominee .
Bad enough that Mrs. Clinton should fail in her bid to become the second Clinton and first woman to be president .
Worse if she should end up being blamed for the failure of Mr. Obama ’s attempt to become the first African - American president .
But has the Clinton campaign crossed a line ?
Attacks that once seemed off - limits suddenly were pushed to the front of the stage .
Embroiled in an increasingly tough fight and frustrated at Mr. Obama ’s success and what the Clinton campaign claimed was coddling of him by the media , she began launching the very kind of attacks that will almost certainly be raised in a fall campaign should Mr. Obama win the nomination .
She attacked his ethics and suggested that Mr. McCain would do a better job of protecting the country in a time of danger .
The economy is tanking , banks are scrambling for cover , the Fed is repeatedly cutting interest rates . . . and business is booming at pawn shop Crown City Loan & Jewelry in Old Pasadena .
Standing behind a display case brimming with hocked watches and jewelry , owner Doug Robinson can only smile when asked how things are going .
“ Business is very good , ” he said .
“ The loan business is very good . ”
These are n’t just any loans , of course .
Robinson said the money he hands out -- no questions asked -- in return for people ’s collateral typically comes with an annual interest rate of about 60 % .
Advertisement
He declined to say how much his loan balance was .
But Robinson said it ’s risen about 40 % in the last year and he expected to do even better this year .
“ We ’ve been on a continuous uphill run for a number of months , ” he said .
“ I do n’t see anything that will stop it . ”
For all the reassurance from the Bush administration and Federal Reserve that steps are being taken to keep the U.S. economy from going down the toilet , the harsh reality from the consumer ’s perspective is that times are tough and getting tougher .
Last week the Fed cut rates for a sixth time since September and assisted in JPMorgan Chase ’s bargain - basement purchase of stricken investment bank Bear Stearns .
President Bush tried to put a brave face on an economic outlook that most prognosticators say will be increasingly chilly .
Advertisement
Hi , Mr. Recession !
“ I understand there ’s short - term difficulty , ” Bush said .
“ But I want people to understand that in the long term we ’re going to be just fine . ”
I conveyed that sentiment to numerous people in and around Old Pasadena the other day , and none seemed convinced that fineness was just around the corner .
“ They say they ’re going to turn things around and help people , ” said Pasadena resident Darryl Austin , 41 , who works as a security guard after serving 12 years in the Marine Corps .
“ I ’m still waiting .
I feel like a stepchild in my own country . ”

Burbank resident Saul Powell , 45 , said that no matter how hard he worked , he was having a hard time keeping his fiscal head above water because of rising gas and food costs .
“ Prices just keep going up , ” he said .
“ Why did the government get so aggressive helping Wall Street but is n’t doing anything for Main Street ? ”
There it is .
Many consumers might think that a series of aggressive rate cuts would be helpful for things like mortgages and credit cards .
But that ’s apparently wishful thinking .
After the latest cut of 0.75 of a percentage point was announced Tuesday , the average for 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages fell after weeks of increases , but not as much as might have been expected , considering how much interest rates for 10 - year Treasury notes -- a benchmark for mortgages -- have come down .
Advertisement
Analysts say the spread between mortgages and Treasuries is increasing because banks are reluctant to reopen the credit spigot that got them into so much trouble with the sub - prime mortgage mess .
The average rate for a 30 - year fixed loan was 5.98 % last week , according to a national survey by Bankrate.com .
This compares with 6.19 % a year ago .
Similarly , credit card rates are budging very little .
Six months ago , the average piece of plastic was costing users about 14 % in interest for revolving balances .
Now it ’s about 13 % .
Things also are n’t getting any better for people who believe in squirreling away cash for a rainy day .
All those rate cuts are taking their toll on savings accounts , money - market accounts and certificates of deposit .

That ’s not to say your money is going to disappear , even if your bank goes belly - up .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. insures ordinary accounts up to $ 100,000 and retirement accounts up to $ 250,000 .
On the other hand , six - month CDs and money - market accounts are currently paying an annual rate of less than 3 % .
The cost of living , by contrast , was up 4 % last month from a year earlier .
That does n’t bode well for savers like 19 - year - old Brittany Green , who attends Pasadena City College while also raising an 8 - month - old daughter .
She told me she had about $ 1,500 in savings and was n’t sure what to do with it .
I told her that by slashing interest rates , the government basically wanted her to do one of two things : go out and spend it or invest it in the stock market .
Either one would give the economy a little boost .

Green shook her head .
“ I ’m not spending it , ” she said .
“ And I would n’t put it in the stock market .
That ’s like playing the lottery . ”
Back at the Crown City pawn shop , Robinson , the owner , said his vantage point on the economy suggests that people need money just to get by , but they ’re having a hard time getting it from banks .
“ People have used up their available cash and credit , ” he said .
“ We loan to people that the banks do not .
If you bring in something worthy of a loan , we ’ll make the loan . ”
Robinson said about 89 % of his loans last year were eventually redeemed by customers , despite the sky - high interest rate .
He said he was n’t so sure about this year .
People just might not have the money .

In that case , though , Robinson said , he ’d just sell off whatever was left as collateral -- a Rolex watch , say , or a pair of diamond earrings .
The government can be doing more to cushion people from the economic downturn .
For one thing , why are n’t lower rates for banks to borrow money being passed down the financial food chain in the form of lower rates for consumers ?
Whether that takes a gentle nudge from the Fed or more overt regulatory action , it would help convey that we ’re all in this together .
It ’d also be nice to see more concrete measures to help people who are either losing their homes or in danger of being turned out on the street .
The government did this during the Great Depression and it could certainly provide a helping hand now .

Bush may be right -- things will be fine over the long haul .
But for the moment , things seem quite grim .
Down the street from Crown City , I encountered Chad Pratt , a 44 - year - old lawyer , who said his business was also thriving , thanks mainly to the desperation of many of his clients .
“ There are more evictions , more divorces , ” he observed .
“ People are losing their homes , their jobs .
You can feel how scared people are . ”
I replied that it was kind of sad that Pratt was doing so well off of other people ’s misery .
He nodded his agreement .

“ I ’m a bottom feeder , ” he said with a what ’re - you - gonna - do shrug .
“ I ’m a predator .
This is how it is . ”
And no rate cut ’s going to change that .

North American buildings release more than 2,200 megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere - 35 percent of the continent ’s total - according to a new report issued by the trinational Commission for Environmental Cooperation ( CEC ) .
The report says rapid market uptake of energy - saving technologies could result in over 1,700 fewer megatons of CO2 emissions by 2030 - a cut nearly equal to the CO2 emitted by the entire US transportation sector in 2000 .
Promoting the green design , construction , renovation and operation of advanced energy - saving buildings could cut North American greenhouse gas emissions more deeply and cheaply than any other available measure , the report advises .
It is common now for more advanced green buildings to routinely reduce energy usage by 30 , 40 , or even 50 percent over conventional buildings , with the most efficient buildings now performing more than 70 percent better than conventional properties , according to the report .
Green building today accounts for a only small fraction of new home and commercial building construction — just 2 % of the new non-residential building market , less than 0.5 % of the residential market in the United States and Canada , and even less than that in Mexico .
“ Improving our built environment is probably the single greatest opportunity to protect and enhance the natural environment .
This report is a blueprint for dramatic environmental progress throughout North America — mostly using the tools and technology we have on hand today , ” says CEC Executive Director Adrián Vázquez .
“ Green building represents some of the ripest ‘ low - hanging fruit ’ for achieving significant reductions in climate change emissions . ”
Even with rapid growth projected in the green building market across all three countries , the report says public and private sectors must embrace substantial changes to the planning , development and financing of commercial and residential buildings to overcome what it says are significant barriers to the widespread adoption of high - performance buildings throughout North America .
Report authors describe a number of disincentives to green building to be overcome .
For example , how to encourage developers to incur the marginal cost of green building features when the long - term energy - saving benefits will be passed on to the new owners or tenants .
They recommend ways to accelerate the market uptake of green building and make it the standard practice for all new construction and renovation of existing buildings in North America .
Among its recommendations , the report calls upon North American government , industry and nongovernmental leaders to :
Create national , multi- stakeholder task forces charged with achieving a vision for green building in North America ;
Support the creation of a North American set of principles and planning tools for green building ;
Set clear targets to achieve the most rapid possible adoption of green building in North America , including aggressive targets for carbon - neutral or net zero-energy buildings , together with performance monitoring to track progress towards these targets ;
Enhance ongoing or new support for green building , including efforts to promote private sector investment and proper valuation methods ; and
Increase knowledge of green building through research and development , capacity building , and the use of labels and disclosures on green building performance .
The recommendations complement ongoing efforts by federal , state / provincial and local governments as well as industry and trade associations and nongovernmental organizations .
The CEC study notes several government and industry initiatives that promote aggressive energy performance improvements in the building sector .
One study completed for the report signals the potential of green building to yield tremendous energy improvements and greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the building sector by 2030 , and suggests a path toward zero net - energy and carbon - neutral buildings .
According to the report :
In Canada , buildings are responsible for :
33 percent of total energy use ;
12 percent of non-industrial water consumption ;
50 percent of natural resource consumption ;
35 percent of greenhouse gas emissions ;
10 percent of airborne particulate production ; and
25 percent of landfill waste generation .
In Mexico , buildings are responsible for :
17 percent of total energy use ;
5 percent of potable water consumption ;
25 percent of total electricity consumption ;
20 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions ; and
20 percent of the waste generated .
In the United States , buildings account for :
Ex-prosecutor : Deputy lacked authority in search Deputy lacked authority in search , ex-prosecutor says
A Harris County sheriff 's deputy did not have the authority to go to the home of a man who had photographed an officer at a drug raid or to destroy film in that man 's camera , a former local prosecutor testified Thursday .
The testimony surfaced in U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt 's court , where a jury is considering a civil rights lawsuit filed by brothers Sean and Erik Ibarra , who were taken to jail six years ago on charges of resisting arrest , but later cleared of any wrongdoing .
The Ibarras are suing the four deputies involved in their arrests , Sheriff Tommy Thomas and Harris County for $ 5 million .
The brothers were arrested at their southeast Houston home on Jan. 4 , 2002 , when Sean Ibarra took pictures of an officer during a drug raid at their next - door neighbor 's house after a neighbor asked him to document how deputies were treating the children there .
The Ibarras allege the deputies then burst into their home without a warrant and arrested them without probable cause , destroying film in their camera and yanking the memory stick out of a videocamera .
An attorney defending the deputies told jurors the undercover officers feared such pictures could expose their faces to the public and endanger their lives .
Former Harris County prosecutor Jennifer Cook , one of two assistant district attorneys who prosecuted the Ibarras six years ago , told jurors Thursday she did not refer the officers ' actions to the Harris County District Attorney 's police or public integrity bureaus for investigation after learning one of them had destroyed film that could potentially be used as evidence in her case .
But during repeated questioning by the Ibarras ' attorney , Lloyd Kelley , Cook agreed the deputies did not have " reasonable suspicion " to pursue Sean Ibarra that day or lawful authority to destroy film in his camera .
Still , she stopped short of calling the deputies ' actions criminal .
" This is more from the standpoint of a Fourth Amendment violation ...
It 's an unlawful seizure , " Cook said .
" I would n't call it a theft . "
Cook , who now works for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Del Rio , is expected to return to the witness stand again on Friday .
In earlier testimony , the former commander of the multiagency task force conducting the drug raid that day agreed it is not illegal to take pictures of undercover officers .
" I think it was a mistake in judgment and that 's what it was , " Baytown police Capt .
Roger Clifford said reluctantly of the deputies ' actions at the Ibarras ' home .
Clifford denied the task force had a policy of seizing film from citizens .
He could not recall hearing about any other incidents where bystanders took pictures of the task force 's officers .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - About 15 percent of U.S. adults have driven under the influence of alcohol in the past year and in some states as many as 25 percent did , according to a government study released on Wednesday .
Another 4.7 percent drove under the influence of illegal drugs , the survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found .
Utah had the fewest drunk drivers , with 9.5 percent of drivers 18 and older admitting to it .
Wisconsin had the most , with 26.4 percent , followed by 24.9 percent in North Dakota and 23.5 percent in Minnesota .
“ Combined data from 2004 to 2006 indicate that 15.1 percent of current drivers aged 18 or older drove under the influence of alcohol in the past year , ” reads the report , complied from national surveys .
It cites National Highway Traffic Safety Administration findings that show 16,700 people died in accidents related to driving under the influence of alcohol in 2004 .
“ This report highlights the enormous public health risk posed by this problem -- one threatening the lives of many Americans every day , ” SAMHSA Administrator Terry Cline said in a statement .
" In 2006 , an estimated 30.5 million persons aged 12 or older drove under the influence of alcohol at least once in the past 12 months , and 10.2 million persons aged 12 or older reported driving under the influence of illicit drugs during the past year , " reads the report , availablehere .
Firefox 3 is not even out the door , but work has started on the next refactoring of the Mozilla platform .
Dubbed Mozilla 2 ( FF3 is built on Mozilla 1.9 ) , it is a chance to make lots of interesting , even scary , changes to the platform .
For some background on Mozilla 2 go back and read Brendan ’s post .
Also , read the Mozilla 2 wiki pages .
Actually , lots of work has already been completed and lots more work is underway .
Checkout the notes from the status meetings .
You can call in every Wednesday to hear what ’s happening .
The work on ActionMonkey and XPCOMGC is pretty exciting stuff ( for geeks , I know ) .
Another of the more exciting goals of Mozilla 2 is the move to use more JavaScript and less C++.
Yes , C++ is great for those times you really need it ( performance & native APIs ) , but JavaScript can handle many things better , easier and without a compiler .
Mozilla 2 is adding a lot of improvements to JavaScript as well , making it faster too .
Less C++ is really part of the “ Less Binary Code ” theme of Mozilla 2 .
Another part of that theme is reducing our XPCOM footprint .
Benjamin Smedberg recently posted some information about goals for XPCOM in Mozilla 2 to the Wiki and Newsgroup .
See Benjamin ’s older post on XPCOM changes too .
I encourage any extension , embedders and XUL application developers who use binary code to go and read the information .
It was shocking , hearing CIA director Michael Hayden tell Tim Russert on Sunday morning that we ’re wide open to another 9/11 - style terrorist attack .
Al - Qaeda , he said , is turning to operatives who “ look Western ” and “ would n’t attract your attention if they were going through the customs line at Dulles with you . ”
These new recruits , he averred , “ would be able to come into this country without attracting the kind of attention that others might . ”
Let ’s see if I understand this correctly : all one has to do in order to get into the U.S. is to “ look Western ” and not stand out too much in the line at Dulles .
Seven years after 9/11 , we ’re still just as vulnerable as ever to another devastating blow such as the one Osama bin Laden delivered on that fateful September morning .
I ’ve often joked that the sheer force of the explosions in New York and Washington tore a hole in the space - time continuum and hurtled us into a Bizarro World alternate universe , where up is down and the laws of reason and logic are similarly inverted .
Nothing else explains our present course , our crazed foreign policy , and our utter helplessness in the face of a very real threat to the continental United States .
Four years after the 9/11 Commission issued its recommendations of preventive measures to be taken , the report molders on the shelf , its laundry list of urgent action items not even close to being implemented .
One key passage from the report :
“ The U.S. border security system should be integrated into a larger network of screening points that includes our transportation system and access to vital facilities , such as nuclear reactors .
The president should direct the Department of Homeland Security to lead the effort to design a comprehensive screening system , addressing common problems and setting common standards with system - wide goals in mind .
Extending those standards among other governments could dramatically strengthen America and the world ’s collective ability to intercept individuals who pose catastrophic threats . ”
Our borders are more porous than ever , and not the slightest effort has been made to repair this rather large chink in America ’s armor .
The commission ’s recommendation that we institute “ a biometric entry - exit screening system , including a single system for speeding qualified travelers , ” has been completely ignored .
As the commissioners pointed out ,
“ No one can hide his or her debt by acquiring a credit card with a slightly different name .
Yet today , a terrorist can defeat the link to electronic records by tossing away an old passport and slightly altering the name in the new one . ”
That has n’t changed .
Indeed , very little has changed .
Instead of building a biometric barrier to terrorism , the Transportation Security Administration is busy strip - searching little old ladies from Kansas and devising new ways to deal with passengers who have body piercings .
The Department of Homeland Security is a mess  instead of streamlining the bureaucracy it has merely added on another layer of inefficiency .
Homeland Security has never passed a government audit .
No , not even once .
Homeland Security funding , instead of going to defend the most likely terrorist targets , is sent to states like Wyoming , which , as Michael O’Hanlon , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution , noted , gets “ 5 to 10 times as many homeland security dollars per capita as many high - risk states . ”
It ’s small wonder these funds are distributed according to a predictable political formula instead of addressing the real security needs of a nation at war with a deadly enemy .
Yet such vindication of my libertarian views on the nature and purpose of government does nothing to reassure me  or to lessen the very real ( and increasing ) danger .
The United States has chosen to fight an offensive war , but this has boomeranged , and badly .
The Iraq war not only diverts us from our task of rooting out al - Qaeda , it also empowers and enables the terrorists in their efforts to wreak havoc on the American mainland .
Bin Laden ’s legions are more numerous and better strategically placed than they were before 9/11 : they ’re not only in Afghanistan , they ’ve also infiltrated “ liberated ” Iraq and entered Pakistan .
In the latter location they ’ve carved out a safe haven , where they continue to plot their war against America  while Gen.
Pervez Musharraf , our chosen strongman , and the recipient of billions in U.S. aid , gets weak in the knees in the face of bin Laden ’s tribal protectors .
Furthermore  and more importantly  we ’re losing the ideological battle against the jihadists , whose view of the U.S. as the main enemy of Islam is seemingly confirmed by U.S. government actions since 9/11 .
America ’s standing across the Middle East has plummeted .
Our Israeli - centric Middle Eastern policy continues to outrage even our allies in the region , making it harder to gain the cooperation of Arab governments and security services to pursue the task we should have accomplished  or , at least , attempted  in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 : rounding up the leadership of this terrorist cabal and eliminating them once and for all .
The Bush administration ’s response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington was predicated on the principle that the best defense is a good offense  with the result that we are now bogged down in both Afghanistan and Iraq with our soft underbelly exposed to the enemy .
They invaded Iraq because it was “ doable , ” as Paul Wolfowitz so memorably put it .
Yet , as we spend $ 12 billion per month in Iraq , the biometric system the 9/11 Commission called for , and Congress agreed was necessary , is apparently not doable , at least by our government .
Also not doable : the traditional low - tech approach to border security .
Two years ago , the GAO pointed out that investigators had “ successfully entered the United States using fictitious driver ’s licenses and other bogus documentation through nine land ports of entry on the northern and southern borders ” between February and May 2005 .
Counterfeit identification ?
Our intrepid Customs and Border Patrol officers did n’t notice the fakes , and , in too many cases , did n’t even bother to check identification documents .
I wonder what happened to the border guards who messed up so badly .
Ten to one they ’re still working for the same government agencies , albeit with a stern wrist - slapping note appended to their official records .
The TSA makes us take off our shoes at every airport but does n’t bother inspecting cargo in planes for explosives .
Our president is telling us that the central theater of the war on terrorism is in Iraq  while , in America , our ports are wide open to a nuclear device masquerading as a shipment of coconuts .
We were attacked on 9/11 , and the administration , instead of fighting back , essentially surrendered  or , at least , gave up entirely the concept of defending the continental United States from another horrific assault .
Instead , they went charging around the world on a wild goose chase that has exhausted our resources and the patience of the American people .
What ’s scary is that these are the folks charged with defending us  a realization that would imbue Pollyanna with a sense of impending doom .
Yes , we are at war with the network of groups and individuals who planned and executed the 9/11 terrorist attacks  not with the Mahdi Army , the Iranians , the Syrians , and / or anyone who looks cross-eyed at the Israelis .
As we bray and posture , asserting our right to preemptively attack any nation on earth , glorying in our role as the global hegemon , the reality is that we are for all intents and purposes utterly defenseless .
What this means is that another terrorist attack on the scale of 9/11  or worse  is practically inevitable .
Which is what our very own government officials , both here and in Britain , have been telling us since 2001 .
It ’s called covering your ass  and it ’s the only job governments everywhere are very good at .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Get your morning links at Taki ’s Magazine  where ( practically ) every morning I ’m saying all the stuff that ’s far too naughty for Antiwar.com .
Come and get it !
Same day , two federal courts , two different rulings on " making available . "
As we mentioned yesterday , a New York court in Elektra v. Barker gave a boost to the recording industry by ruling that an offer to distribute a file on a P2P network can infringe the distribution right , even if no one ever actually downloaded it from you .
Well , on the same day , a Massachusetts court in London - Sire v.
Doe ruled just the opposite , holding that " merely exposing music files to the internet is not copyright infringement " ( we just received the ruling today ) .
EFF filed an amicus brief in this case ( formerly known as Atlantic v. Does 1 - 21 ) , and our arguments appear to have found a more receptive audience in Boston that they did in New York City ( the judge thanks us for our participation on page 11 ) .
The 52 - page ruling is the most extensive analysis yet of the recording industry 's " making available " argument , which claims that you infringe copyright merely by having a song in your shared folder , even if no one ever downloads it .
As we discussed yesterday , a key issue is whether a mere " offer to distribute " is enough to infringe the distribution right , in light of the fact that a mere offer can be enough to constitute " publication . "
Unlike the court in Elektra v. Barker , the judge in London - Sire v. Doe concludes that " distribution " and " publication " are not identical -- " even a cursory examination of the statute suggests that the terms are not synonymous . "
If you are interested in the details , the court 's analysis is highly illuminating ( p. 24 - 27 ) , touching on a number of earlier rulings , such as Hotaling v. Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints and A & M v. Napster ( copyright nerds will recognize those as pivotal decisions in this area ) .
While this is an important victory , the decision may not change much for most individuals targeted for RIAA lawsuits .
The judge concludes that evidence of an " offer to distribute " is enough to permit a lawsuit to move forward , even if it 's not enough to decide the matter .
That means that the RIAA will keep filing lawsuits based on the investigations of MediaSentry .
Moreover , the court rejected EFF 's argument that the distribution right does not reach digital networks at all .
In light of the disagreement between these two rulings , it 's likely that these issues are headed for more consideration by other courts .
But we 're grateful that these judges ( in both Elektra and London - Sire ) are doing a thorough job considering these important questions , instead of just taking the RIAA 's word on what the law is .
" Much dreaming and many words are meaningless .
Therefore stand in awe of God . " ( Ecclesiates 5:7 )
Legal Threats from Sequoia Voting Systems Force County to Cancel Plans for Independent Analysis of the State 's Own Voting System
Livermore Labs Scientist Urges Readers to Contact NJ AG to Ask for Technical Review of Same Flawed Machines Set to be Used Next Month in PA ...

3/18/2008 , 2:17 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman
Sequoia Voting Systems ' legal threats against Princeton computer science professors and New Jersey election officials , as we reported in exclusive detail last night , have apparently had their intended effect .
The strong - arm email sent to professors Ed Felten and Andrew Appel was apparently accompanied by a two - page letter to Union County , New Jersey , Clerk Joanne Rajoppi , who originally discovered a tally failure in Sequoia 's AVC Advantage touch - screen voting machines after the February 5th Super Tuesday election .
The same error was subsequently discovered in at least five other counties .
Mercer County Clerk Paula Sollami-Covello tells the New Jersey Times that Sequoia 's decision to block an independent analysis of its touch - screen voting machines makes no sense if the firm is confident that they work properly .
" I think it 's unfortunate that they 're not letting an independent investigation take place , " Sollami - Covello tells the paper this morning .
" They should have no problem with having a third party investigate the product if they are confident in their product . "
Another Mercer County , NJ , official sent a letter to the state Attorney General criticizing Sequoia 's bizarre explanation for failures discovered in the systems following state 's recent Primary Election , characterizing what he describes as the company 's " strange , confusing solution . "
He said the company 's explanation for the problem , which succeeded in blaming voters and poll workers as usual , was based on a " bizarre scenario , with no cited evidence or testimony " to back it up .
While NJ 's state clerks association had voted unanimously to recommend that the Attorney General commission an independent study of the machines --- the same ones which will be used across the state of Pennsylvania in next month 's key Democratic Primary Election ---
Union County 's plan to move forward with their own study has been nixed due to the legal threats sent from Sequoia 's VP of " Compliance / Quality / Certification " Edwin Smith , according to a number of New Jersey papers today .
Amazingly ( or perhaps , not so much at this point ) , Union County 's attorneys folded to the pressure from the company , which claimed that Election Officials in NJ --- who spent millions on the voting systems --- are not legally allowed to examine them independently because " the voting machine software is a Sequoia ' trade secret ' and cannot be handed over to any third - party . "
Fear of a lawsuit from Sequoia , which will also control the state 's elections in an upcoming June primary , as well as the November general election , has led to county attorneys backing down from their plans for the time being , unless the state AG jumps in to take action .
In the threatening email from Smith to the Princeton professors sent last Friday , as posted here in full last night , the company executive threatened legal action if a " non-compliant analysis " of their voting systems was carried out .
" We will also take appropriate steps to protect against any publication of Sequoia software , its behavior , reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property , " Smith warned .
The Star - Ledger reports the latest , almost mind - numbingly incredible , developments in your democracy , now fully and completely in the hands of privatized corporate America , this morning ...
A Sequoia executive , Edwin Smith , put Union County Clerk Joanne Rajoppi on notice that an independent analysis would violate the licensing agreement between his firm and the county .
In a terse two - page letter , Smith also argued the voting machine software is a Sequoia " trade secret " and cannot be handed over to any third - party .
Last week , Rajoppi had persuaded the statewide clerks ' association to hire Felten , who made national headlines two years ago when he demonstrated how a computer virus could alter the result on Diebold voting machines .
The Constitutional Officers Association of New Jersey called for the independent review to insure the integrity of the election process .
Sequoia maintained the errors , which were documented in at least five counties , occurred due to mistakes by poll workers .
...
On the advice of the county 's attorneys , however , Rajoppi said she must forgo all plans for independent analysis .
" We 're not going to proceed and invite a lawsuit , " said Norman Albert , first deputy counsel in Union County .
It would n't be the first time an election official expressed fear of facing a voting machine vendor in court .
A number of them have expressed both publicly and privately to The BRAD BLOG their concern about holding these companies legally accountable , given that they must rely on the same companies to run their next election .
Rutgers University law professor Penny Venetis stated what should be quite obvious in the Star - Ledger article today ...
" We should n't have a corporation dictating how elections are run in the state , " Venetis said .
" If an elected official believes there was an anomaly and the matter has to be investigated , then the official should be able to consult with computer experts without interference . "
Union County Clerk Rajoppi said she was " disappointed we cannot go forward with some type of independent study . "
John Carbone , an attorney representing the state clerks association , summed up the sorry situation : " We do n't have access to the machines , so we can't do anything . "
Livermore Laboratory 's computer scientist David Jefferson jumped in to comment on our story yesterday , which included the full threatening email sent to the Princeton Professors , in order to note the importance of such a test being carried out on New Jersey 's Sequoia machines prior to the use of the very same systems next month in Pennsylvania .
" We have only a matter of weeks before the Pennsylvania primary in which the same machines will be used in Philadelphia , and only a few months more until the general election , " Jefferson wrote .
" This bug ( and any others discovered ) must be fixed . "
He went on to point out that New Jersey 's Attorney General Ann Milgram " currently holds certification authority comparable to [ Secretaries of State ] in other states , " and that she could order such an independent technical review , but that she has not done so to date .
She " seems disinclined to , " according to the scientist who has worked on a number of state e-voting studies across the country .
" If BradBlog readers want to help , " he writes , " they could write Ms. Milgram and politely impress upon her the seriousness of the problem ... and ask her to support the Princeton review or commission her own independent technical review . "
Milgram 's office can be counted a number of ways , via this web page .

Virginians created and may end the right of impeachment
By David Swanson , Fredericksburg Free Lance - Star
CHARLOTTESVILLE --
A recent national poll on impeachment , conducted by the American Research Group last November , found that 52 percent of Americans believed Vice President Dick Cheney had committed impeachable offenses .
The numbers for President George W. Bush were only slightly lower .
The governor of Virginia has spoken up for impeachment , saying " Guilt wherever found ought to be punished . "
Sadly , that was Gov. Edmund Randolph in 1787 , arguing for making impeachment central to the system of checks and balances in the new U.S. Constitution .
Our current governor has not said a word about impeaching our current president .
Two other Virginians , George Mason and James Madison , worked out the language for what would constitute an impeachable offense : " treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors . "
" No point is of more importance , " Mason said of the Constitution , " than that the right of impeachment should be continued . "
Jefferson 's fear was of " elected despotism . "
Leaving an impeachable president in place for months or years because eventually there would be another election ( the plan openly advocated by some members of Congress today ) would have seemed to Jefferson to mean the end of the republic .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers has published a book on Bush and Cheney 's alleged impeachable offenses , but refuses to hold impeachment hearings .
The Richmond City Democratic Committee , the Virginia Antiwar Network , and activist groups all over the state have been holding rallies for impeachment for years now .
Planes have flown impeachment banners back and forth over Virginia Beach .
Larry Wilkerson , a William & Mary professor and former chief of staff to Colin Powell , has spoken up for impeachment at events in Virginia .
Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul spoke in support of impeaching Bush up until he became a candidate , and many of his supporters believe he would support impeachment if Democrats led the way .
Paul 's campaign advisor and former Justice Department official under President Reagan , Bruce Fein , has been a leading advocate for impeachment .
Dennis Kucinich , at the time a Democratic presidential candidate , packed a large hall in Charlottesville in December to speak on the need for impeachment .
And candidates for Congress across the commonwealth this year are using the failure of the Congress to impeach as a talking point in their campaigns , including Andrea Miller in the 4th District , Sam Rasoul ( 6th ) , and Matthew Famiglietti and Ron Fisher ( both in the 8th ) .
The movement to impeach Cheney and Bush has almost no support from Virginians now in Congress .
Since Rep. Kucinich , D - Ohio , introduced a resolution to impeach Cheney in April 2007 , 24 members of Congress have signed on , only one from Virginia : Jim Moran , D - 8th .
Since Judiciary Committee member Robert Wexler , D - Fla. , drafted a letter to Conyers last month urging him to begin impeachment hearings ; 14 members of Congress have signed on , with only Moran from Virginia .
Of the 35 members of Congress either co-sponsoring articles of impeachment or expressing support for impeachment hearings , Moran is the only one from Virginia .
Within the House Judiciary Committee , nine members led by Wexler are urging the initiation of hearings on the possible impeachment of Cheney .
Among the alleged offenses mentioned are : misleading the public and Congress about Iraq and Iran , outing a CIA agent , torture , spying programs that violate the Fourth Amendment , refusing to comply with subpoenas , and promoting the use of signing statements to unconstitutionally claim the right to violate laws .
Virginia 's four members of the Judiciary Committee , including two Democrats , all oppose impeachment hearings .
The two Democrats , Bobby Scott ( 3rd ) and Rick Boucher ( 9th ) , support non-impeachment hearings into some of the same abuses .
One drawback to that approach is that witnesses now routinely refuse to comply with subpoenas .
Another is that several of these hearings have been conducted over the past 12 months , with no consequences .
If Scott , Boucher , and one more were to join their nine colleagues , there would then be a majority of Democrats on the committee in favor of impeachment hearings .
Bead curtains are like , so 1950 's huh ?
Artist Devorah Sperber does n't think so .
Her amazing Star Trek bead curtains are much more likely to be adorning gallery walls than the front door of your local grocery store .
Kind of like pixel - art in 3D , she slides tens of thousands of beads onto threads to create these detailed portraits .
Check out the holodeck door , Enterprise - D's bridge , and my favorite : the " beaming down " series , which looks spookily like the " real " special effect .

Deborah must have the kind of patience and concentration skills that I can only dream of to thread so many beads to make these works of art .
She also uses stacked colored cotton reels in her creations , and her portfolio includes re-creations of classical paintings , including the Mona Lisa .
But if you want to see her Star Trek works , they 're on display in various New York locations including the PULSE NY Art Fair ( Booth E13 ) from March 27th to 30th .

Photons are easy to produce , at least en masse .
But making them one at a time in a controlled fashion is much harder .
Until recently the only trick physicists had for this was to reduce the brightness of a beam until it contained only one photon at a time , on average .
Of course , the “ on average ” clause allows for any manner of multiphoton sin : the photons may be produced in pairs or bunches or not at all .
That ’s a serious problem for techniques such as quantum cryptography because any extra photons are equivalent to a leak of information that an eavesdropper can use to crack the code .
Enter the photon gun brigade , a growing band of physicists attempting to build devices that can fire identical , single photons on demand .
The single photon part of this problem has been cracked by a number of groups who have built guns that work by inducing atoms , ions , molecules or quantum dots to fluoresce in a cavity .
What has turned out to be more difficult , but just as important , is making each of these single photons identical .
What tends to happen is that the cavites vibrate in various ways and this subtly distorts the wavelength of the photons they produce .
The result is that each photon is very slightly different , which spoils their ability to interfere and become entangled with each other .
Here ’s the breakthrough : Andrew Shields , at Toshiba ’s research labs in Cambridge , UK , plus a few pals from a nearby university , say they can create the photons using a quantum dot that they zap with two precisely timed voltage pulses .
The first pulse injects charge carriers into the diode while the second suddenly shifts the quantum dot ’s emission characteristics so that it can emit light .
When that happens , the dot emits a photon of a specific energy .
But the key is to use such short voltage pulses that the photon does n’t have time to be influenced by its surroundings .
And that means the quantum dot always emits photons of precisely the same wavelength .
So it looks as if Shields and co have a neat new trick up their sleeves , albeit one that has to be performed at 4 K .
But it ’s also an entirely new mechanism for producing photons of this kind so improvements are gonna be forthcoming .
How long before we see a commercial version ?

Sometimes it is the choice 10 - cent word or two , a spot - on sublime or consummate , that is the giveaway .
Maybe it is a series of suspiciously skilled turns of phrase , syntax the envy of Strunk and White , or some pitch - perfect metaphors that raise the red flags .
As college admissions officers sift through thousands of application essays penned by eager - to - please high school seniors , they increasingly encounter writing that sparkles a bit too brightly or shows a poise and polish beyond the years of a typical teenager .
With the scramble to get into elite colleges at a fever pitch and with a rising number of educational consultants and college essay specialists ready to give students a competitive edge , admissions officers are keeping a sharp lookout for essays that might have had an undue adult influence .
In some admissions offices , such submissions receive the dubious distinction DDI , short for " Daddy Did It . "
Colleges are now cross-referencing student essays against the SAT writing sample , and , if doubts linger , will ask for a graded writing sample or raise their concern with the student 's high school guidance counselor .
Harvard even passes along suspiciously strong essays to professors for a scholarly opinion .
" There 's an awful lot of talk in the admissions profession about this , " said William R. Fitzsimmons , Harvard 's dean of admissions and financial aid .
" It 's very difficult to know how much of it is the student 's own work .
It 's just very hard to spot . "
The concern over heavy - handed adult involvement is mounting as the admissions essay has become a pivotal part of the application , a key way for students to stand out from the throngs of applicants with top grades and SAT scores .
In the past five years , the percentage of colleges attributing " considerable importance " to the college essay has risen from 19 to 28 , behind grades , strength of classes , and standardized test scores , according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling .
Admissions officers say they would almost never deny admission solely over a suspicious essay , unless they could prove it was plagiarized .
There are many talented writers , and it would be a shame to misjudge them , they say .
But at competitive schools that reject the vast majority of students , a hint of doubt can tilt the balance .
" The essay has over time become more important to the admission decisions , and that 's trickling down to students , " said Melissa E. Clinedinst , assistant director of research for the National Association for College Admission Counseling .
College administrators say that intense pressure to gain acceptance to selective schools has compelled parents to turn to high - priced essay editors and coaches .
" The euphemism we use is polished , " said Parke Muth , an admissions dean at the University of Virginia .
" If you 're paying someone that much money , there should n't be fingerprints .
But some essays have that sheen , that lemony - fresh smell that makes you wonder . "
Browse column I n this post-election issue , while the righteous American editorialists wag their fingers at Russia 's farcical elections , we want to hold up a giant mirror ( with loudspeaker attached ) across the Atlantic and scream what every sane American has been thinking for nearly a decade now : We 're Embarrassed To Be Americans .
Do n't get us wrong .
We 're ashamed not just because America is hypocritical or imperialistic or militaristic or bloodthirsty .
Would that we were !
If only it were still true , we 'd shut our mouths and strut around the world , seizing our rightful booty the way booty - seeking citizens of " the most powerful empire in mankind 's history " ( to use one neocon 's description in 2002 ) oughtta do .
It 's not that America is so evil and bloodthirsty , though it tries hard to be ... it's that America has become the world 's laughingstock , a flash - in - the - pan hyperpower , the Sigue Sigue Sputnik of empires , the Charles Bovary of Great Civilizations .
The Bush years have made us so embarrassed to be Americans that even the shameful Carter Years look downright Roman by comparison .
We can already hear you hicks whining , " If yer so darned ashamed of bein ' Amer 'can , why n ' tchoo just tern in yer passport then , yuh darned traitor . "
To which we reply , " Nope , we 're gonna keep our passports .
We like the idea of wiping our asses on our passports , while at the same time enjoying all of the advantages that U.S. citizenship still affords us , few though they may be . "
Nothing gives us more pleasure than hearing you pigs squeal " git the fugg outta my cuntree " cuz the thing is , we are out of your cuntree , and the other thing is , we 'll come back when we damn well feel like it , thanks to our passports , just because we wanna watch you idiots grow giant swarming ulcers at the sight of our ungrateful asses .
So folks — since Americans are all " folks " these days — hold on to your beta - blockers and your ACE inhibitors , because you 're about to face the unpleasant reality of Why You Should Be Ashamed Of Being American Too :
Canadian dollar surpasses greenback
Those silly Canadians , remember how Americans used to laugh at them ?
How cute they looked when they 'd resentfully mumble to visiting American tourists , " we 're American , too — you do n't own the name of our continent ! "
We did own it , though , which is why they were so cute , why they were so funny in all those South Park jokes .
Canada was an almost - nation of almost - Americans with an almost currency called a " Canadian dollar , " which was cute , and always worth about 50 American cents .
Then , on September 20 , 2007 , a day that will live in shamefamy , the Canadian dollar passed up the U.S. dollar .
People from the United States officially lost their right to call themselves " Americans . "
Now when we visit Canada we just say , " We 're from south of the border " — if we can afford to visit Canada , that is .
Shame Factor : Baptist birthrate .
According to recent stats , the U.S. birthrate is rising , and it 's rising fastest among Baptists and Mormons .
It 's actually falling for Asians , the most promising demographic .
But the dumbest , ugliest , meanest hicks on the planet are breeding like walking catfish , wriggling to new townhouse developments in the nastiest parts of the country like Nevada and Florida .
We 'll end with Vegas and Fort Lauderdale shaking hands over the corpse of the last decent American , the pounding of the Tin Spike into the American cadaver .
Jimmy Swaggert Factor :
Fat is the new normal .
Last year a Newsweek cover story asked the question , " Is Fat the New Normal ? "
At least the Nazi 's truth - inversions had a poetic evil about them .
America 's truth inversions are just plain depressing .
You people are gross , man .
John Reed Factor .
The fattists are reason enough to defect to Russia and glorify the " stability revolution , " which to us means , " A country where ‘ thin ' is still ‘ in . ' "
The Iran War Puss - Out .
No country has fucked with America more brazenly than Iran has .
They took dozens of American hostages in 1979 , funded Hezbollah 's suicide bombing that killed 241 Marines , and now kill American soldiers in Iraq .
The whole point of invading Iraq was to put Iran in a vise .
But guess what ?
America does n't have enough military power to attack anymore .
So we issued a National Intelligence Report saying Iran is n't really such a big threat …
Just like when Kim Jong
Il set off his nukes and fired his missiles , we also pretended it was really not such a big deal .
What we really said was , " White flag a - risin ' ! "
Yup , " the world 's only superpower " is too weak , too broke , and too afraid to go to war against a primitive third - rate enemy that literally lives in the Dark Ages .
The war against the Axis of Evil is over : two bullshit countries caused America to flinch and scream " Uncle ! " without ever having to fire a shot .
Adam Gadhan Factor : Real Americans like winners , which is why we 're growing out our beards and practicing our Farsi …
Losing two wars at once .
" Vietnam Syndrome " meant one thing : America suffered its first and only defeat in its 200 - year history , and it did n't know how to deal or what it meant .
Then in the 90s , America got its George Foreman on , headed back into the war ring , and racked up some wins against , admittedly , a bunch of second - stringers .
Enter the 21st - century , a new season , and America is heading into the final rounds of two concurrent defeats , against the two most laughable opponents on planet earth !
We 're now the basement team , the doormat of the war league , the Glass Jawed white giant whose only purpose is to launch the careers of new up - and - comers !
At least Germany 's 0 - 2 record came against worthy enemies …
But to lose to Iraq and Afghanistan ?
With America pussing out of another two wars against Iran and North Korea , which we 've all but forfeited with a default , our loss record is on the verge of a 0 - 4 .
We need to double - paper bag our heads over this one .
Jane Fonda Factor : Our inner Hanoi Jane says , " Show us a fearsome Taliban mule that we can sit on for the Al Jazeera cameras , and we 'll be there with bells on ! "
Wes Anderson .
No one should trigger a healthy nation 's gag reflex as often or as intensely as quirky - moment - machine Wes Anderson .
For years we 've fantasized about the ultimate slo-mo outro to a documentary called Wes Anderson & The Life Arctic : Anderson is placed on a small dinghy with the Wilson brothers ( all three of ‘ em ) and Angelica Huston , then slowly descended from a pastel - colored Finnish ice - breaker .
Just as the tears appear in Anderson 's horrified , frost - encrusted eyes , Abba 's " So Long " kicks in , drowning the group 's slow - motion screams for mercy .
Anderson went from ass - clown status to the he -must - die list with 2007's Darjeeling Limited , a vapid film even by his standards that doubled as an effortless insult to India .
It 's the film equivalent of a frat boy carving his initials in the Taj Mahal .
Anderson had the gall to dedicate the film to Satyajit Ray , who would have spat in Anderson 's face had he lived to enjoy the honor .
Bernadine Dohrne Factor : Bring the War Home to Hollywood Populism .
This is what America does in lieu of actually helping ordinary fuckin ' people : hugs on camera .
No cash , but all the hugs you can eat , you lovable fat suckers .
From the spread of fake Texas dialect like " you folks " to the comedy of plutocrats defending the middle class on TV while earning sums that the middle class can't even fathom , populist sentimentality is the all - purpose lubricant , the WD - 40 , of winner - take - all capitalism .
Engels ' remark that anti-Semitism is " the socialism of fools " needs to be updated to apply to American populist sentimentality .
A million foreclosures and one televised barn - raising , aka Extreme Makeover , for the most pathetic telegenic family of losers the producers auditioned .
There 's a bitter old saying , " They 'd cut your head and give you a bandage . "
That 's us , baby !
Shame Factor : Seth McFarlane .
It is n't just that McFarlane 's Family Guy shamelessly plagiarizes from The Simpsons , nor is it just the endless cheap references to bad pop culture icons .
Family
Guy is much worse and much more evil than that : an anti-Simpsons antidote for zombies who want to get rid of the annoying buzz of vestigial decency in their rotting heads .
They want that decency removed , and Family Guy does it non-stop , scene by scene , undoing the unwanted education all those Simpson episodes forced down their throats with a spoonful of sugar .
McFarlane 's show reinforces their meanest , dumbest instincts .
And it 's a huge hit .
Nicholas Berg Factor :
We would seriously consider converting to Islam if someone would slowly saw McFarlane 's head off while forcing him to sing the theme song to " Three 's Company , " complete with laugh track .
Dodge / Chrysler .
This company is like the android morph of the millions of fat dumb hick boys infesting America .
Like them , it needed special help just to continue its bloated , destructive life .
Chrysler has been on welfare since buyers noticed they could actually buy a decent car at a decent price by going Japanese .
But instead of getting in shape and actually trying to produce decent cars , Chrysler bet everything it had that Americans are so utterly stupid and childish that they 'd come back for huge shiny junkers that would look cool for a few thousand miles , then fall apart .
And they were right .
Seeing a pattern here ?
Shame Factor : Lame assassins .
You hear a lot of stupid things these days .
Take , for example , the truism that " Assassination does n't work . "
Bullshit .
It worked so well nobody even remembers .
Un - kill Bobby Kennedy , and America 's entire history changes .
Except you can't un - kill people .
All you can do is kill some of the monsters .
It 's not that hard to do .
Two bullets in the chest , one in the head , and Nixon will die , Attila the Hun will die , any damn human will die .
The only problem is that all our assassins are idiots .
The Unabomber came close ; if he'd only killed more timber company lobbyists and left the useless professors to their dull fates , he'd have been a true hero .
Will no one rid us of these lice ?
Is there a single Leftist with balls in this country ?
Sara Jane Moore Factor :
The patron saint of inept assassins , Sara Jane Moore paved the way for slapstick morons like John Hinckley and a host of suicide - light - plane divers .
The Loss of Latin America .
So who 's the idiot that forgot to pay off the Palace Guards in Caracas in 2002 ?
America is so inept that we can't even pull off a coup in what FDR called " our little neighborhood down there . "
Yeah , we managed to get Aristide out of there without breaking a sweat , but Haiti does n't count .
It 's been our practice field for a century now , where we warmed up for the real coups .
Ike and the Dulles brothers used to knock off Iranian and Central American regimes over slices of morning cantaloupe .
Just eight years ago , the entire hemisphere save one pesky island was America 's to squeeze , and squeeze we did , while they begged for IMF handouts that only pulled them deeper into serfdom on our manor .
Then Bush came to power and launched the most inept coup in American history against Chavez .
And now all of Latin America has turned into a bunch of Castro - loving fags , welching on our IMF loans , and even inviting Ahmadinejad over for siestas and nationalization ceremonies .
The title of a recent McClatchy article says it all : " Farewell to the Monroe Doctrine ? "
They might as well drop the question mark and fess up .
There went the neighborhood a long time ago .
Jimmy Carter Factor : Addiction Memoirs .
No literary genre is more degraded and mawkish than the rehab memoir .
No surprise then that no genre is more popular in today 's American than the rehab memoir .
It 's a very reactionary , unimaginative genre in the contemporary American version , focusing on the big three crosses : drugs , drink and divorce .
The only thing more idiotic than these rehab memoirs are the gullible idiots who buy them , as witnessed by the con jobs that half - assed hucksters like " JT LeRoy " and James Frey pulled off .
Why are these books so popular ?
Simple : everyone wants to be a victim these days .
Especially white middle - class urbanites .
By becoming a drunk or an addict , you can become a temporary victim .
If you 've got a " sexual abuse " tale to throw in , then you 've hit the victim jackpot — which is why all these rehab memoirs have to have a sex abuse episode .
If you 're really clever , you can use your connections to get the thing published .
If you do n't have connections but you want to sob with someone who supposedly understands your pain , then curl up with an Augusten Burroughs or David Sheff or some other wealthy well - connected pig , and let the sobbing flow .
Jimmy Carters Factor : Ellen !
Look , ladies !
It 's wacky , upbeat , afternoon Ellen , the human Wellbutrin XL .
There she is on the counter - mounted kitchen tv , dressed in Florida hospice colors , pushing her audience to applaud for musicians — not because of their music , but because they have cancer !
And there she is making Barack Obama dance to James Brown on national tv—twice !
And Ellen 's dancing too !
She 's so wacky and happy !
And cancer - free !
Unlike her guests , speaking of whom , give them another round ! …
Ellen Degeneres sucked as a second - rate comedian doing routines about " What If God Was a Woman ? "
Now she 's reinvented herself as a third - rate Oprah , a human plague on the body televique , with no cure in sight .
Patty Hearst Factor : Benizir Bhutto- philia .
She was n't Musharraf ; she was a chic - dressed , porcelain - complexioned go - getter woman in a land teeming with wife - stoning darkies , and she spoke pro-American gibberish with an aristocratic Brit accent .
She went to Oxford , and so does her son .
To contemporary America , this means she must be Ghandi with tits , Mandela in a salwar kameez .
So we encouraged her to return to take back Pakistan and rid it of all the dark - skinned non-English - speaking terrorists .
We told her that we had back - side covered , and sent her off to Karachi where she got murdered faster than you can say " Mission Accomplished . "
Bad for American geopolitics ( but could they get worse ? ) ; however , great for Bhutto's Gandhi-creds , creating a mini-Diana media boomlet that sent Bhutto 's quickie autobiography into the bestseller charts .
It took a cool and collected Brit , William Dalrymple , to disturb the cocktail party with a Times op - ed that reminded mourners of Benizir 's very un - Gandhi - like death squads , her longtime role as Pakistan 's Jihadi paymaster , and her crushing of any opposition to her rule .
Angelina Jolie Factor : Four adopted dark kids .
Jolie 's a shoe - in to play Bhutto in the upcoming biopic .
While filming , Jolie will also adopt a Pakistani orphan , and name him " Benizira . "
CNN .
American news has become so shamelessly propagandistic and idiotic that today , a blatant White House propaganda tool like CNN is considered " liberal " simply because it 's gotten a wee bit squeamish over the whole Iraq debacle , as compared to FOX , which , like the gang in Hitler 's bunker , is still issuing cheerful dispatches about inevitable victory in Iraq .
Then there 's Lou Dobbs , the guy with the freakish child molester face who transformed himself from neoliberal " New Economy " tool into a sleazy Mexican - bashing rat .
This is what passes for a " liberal media " in the United Embarrassment of America .
Susan Sarandon's Breasts Factor :
We suckle the anti-American milk out of 3 of Sarandon 's breasts as an antidote to CNN 's toxins .
Cheap American Corruption .
In Russia , if you want to buy a vote , you 've got to pay a Duma politician about a million bucks .
In America , if you want a Congressman to legislate a $ 5 billion tax break for your company , all you have to do is fly him to a golf course in some damp shithole like Scotland , and those $ 5 billion tax payer dollars are yours .
Shame Factor : Trendy pseudo - hyper - self - consciousness .
How many times have you heard an American use this preface : " I know it 's a cliche to say this .
And I know it 's a cliche to say that it 's a cliche to say this … but [ ENTER CLICHE HERE ] . "
Translated : " I know I am a waste of this planet 's limited oxygen supply , but I 'm going to suck in a few more lungfulls of your precious air than usual in order to lull you into a false sense of hope before I expel a lethal cloud of hokey idiocies , flooring you once again . "
Adam Gadhan Factor :
There 's only one way to shut up a pseudo - self - conscious reference - dropping David Eggers type , and that 's to cut off their preface with a big loud " Allahu Akhbar ! "
The Ongoing Insane Southwest Building Boom .
Exactly how many more years of extended drought and water / electricity shortages do Americans need before they stop building in the doomed Southwest ?
14 ? 27 ?
Will it take total Civilizational collapse like the kind Jim Kunstler sees right around the corner from the latest Scottsville condo project ?
The Dust Bowl is the new normal ; the Colorado River is shrinking .
Already states are fighting each other in court for access to dwindling water supplies , mirroring intra-state conflicts between agriculture and the cities .
But still they keep building air - conditioned houses with lawns , even though the grids are already snapping during 110 + degree nights , killing all the old people who keep retiring there like it 's 1966 .
The slow death of golf wo n't come soon enough to save the desert states .
Vegas will make one hell of a ruin .
Shame Factor : A plague of knit - capped hippies on all of you swine !
World 's Largest Prison Population .
The dollar may be crashing below even joke currencies like the Kazakh tenge , but when it comes to jailing our poor , we 're still # 1 with a bullet .
More than two and a quarter million Americans — one out of every 100 — are doing some form of time .
Yup , when it comes to putting our citizens in prison , we kick the authoritarian crap out of repression stars like Russia and China .
The U.S. also is riding high in the state - murder competition saddle , lagging only behind Pakistan , Sudan , China , and a few other beacons of liberty in the capital punishment competition .
But hey , it 's working !
Americans do n't kill each other in Wendy 's restaurants or college campuses anymore , no siree !
Welcome to the United States of Visiting Hours .
Please keep your hands away from the plexiglass .
Monkey - Country Political Nepotism .
Bullshit countries with bullshit currencies elect wives and sons to run their countries simply because the population has n't developed beyond medieval monarchy thinking .
The Philippines elected the widowed wife of a slain democracy leader .
Argentina elected the wife of a former president ( and hailed the wife of a former dictator ) .
America came late to the " we 're medieval - brained morons and we 're proud of it ! " parade , starting in 2000 , when America annointed the recessive - gene - damaged son of a failed one - term president into the White House .
It was so great that he was reelected , while in Congress , at least 18 senators , dozens of House members and several administration officials were family legacies , leading the Washington Post to declare that the US government " resembles the court of Louis XIV without the powdered wigs . "
This year , Americans are working on electing the wife of the president before the recessive - gene son .
She may fail , but Americans are a hard - working lot , so do n't be surprised if by 2020 America finally catches up to the Philippines and Argentina and other third - world shitholes by electing the first ex-leader 's wife to lead them Michelle Obama Factor :
Three and a half .
Fox and CNN should be forced to loop 2 weeks straight of Michelle Obama 's " for the first time in my life I was proud to be an American " speech into every American 's living room .
BONUS
EMBARRASSMENTS !
William Kristol .
We 're not sure what we 're most ashamed of : the systemic nepotism responsible for the retardocon 's success ; the major newspaper that recently hired him in the alleged spirit of " balance " ; or the small amount of pleasure we derive from reading his atrocious prose and lame - ass attempts at " high " cultured diction to Manhattan - up his hard - hitting conservatism ?
Kristol 's last Times column saw him take a break from massaging John McCain 's nipples to gently stroke the fresh corpse of William F. Buckley .
After plugging his prep school in the first line ( Collegiate , 1970 ) Kristol falls back on the use of Latin phrases and Victorian poets to escape from his troubles with English and sound better educated than he is .
How ashamed does it make us that moron like Kristol is taken seriously ?
Put it this way : he makes us appreciate the wit and genius of William Safire .
Alan Berg Factor :
Three shots ring out in the capitol 's cool dark night .
American women 's voices .
The anchor - lady monotone all American women have spent the last 20 years perfecting , so that all American women , no matter what they 're saying , sound like they 're reading the 10 p.m. newscast at a Midwestern midsize TV station summing up the day 's stock market activity .
Is there any other nation on earth infested with 150 million women who talk like transvestites with back hair ?
Shame Factor : Paul Thomas Anderson .
The other Anderson in the " Axis of Hackdom , " Paul 3 - Names wowed the Beigeocracy by -- get this -- holding extra-long shots on his actors as they have internal moments .
Yup , in a country gone totally stupid , all you gotta do is walk out of the edit room for 10 minutes , and suddenly Rolling Stone stands and cheers your " rule - busting experimentation " while Roger Ebert creams that PTA 's film is a , " A force beyond categories . "
Of course , Ebert also raved about Anderson 's Punch Drunk Love , " [ Adam ] Sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .
Watching this film , you can imagine him in Dennis Hopper roles .
He has darkness , obsession and power . "
Jimmy Carter Factor : The War on Drugs .
The shame here is mitigated only slightly by the fact that public support is finally crumbling for the Prohibition gravy train .
But you can still see anti-pot ads on American television cut from the same hemp cloth as the original Reefer Madness campaign that made shitty Mexican weed the gateway to Negro jazz musicians bending America 's innocent daughters over a snare drum .
The funny - sad thing is these ads are crammed between plugs for pharmaceutical drugs featuring animated butterflies and permanent sunsets on the beach .
If the Office of National Drug Control Policy had a gram for every lie it ever told to justify WoD budgets , they 'd make the Medellin cartel look like the BookMobile .
Shame Factor : America 's " Post - Racist " Delusion .
Barak Obama may have a lot of detractors both among Republicans and Democrats , but if there 's one thing all Americans can agree on , it 's that Obama 's rise to political stardom means that Americans are no longer racist .
Yeah , right , and Uzbek jet pilots might fly out of our butts .
When one of America 's most painful issues , its racist history , is allegedly solved because white people vote for a moderate - conservative Wall Street black guy with male - magazine looks and a CNN voice which utters words carefully steering away from anything about the whole race issue that might upset people -- in other words , every white American 's Dream Negro - - then all we can say is , like the midget lady in Poltergeist , " This house is clean . "
CUT TO : thunder , lightening , and suddenly the earth shakes as hundreds of millions of ghosts rise from the Red States , shocking pollsters , who were sure Obama was going to win !

Finally , a Pure Bailout By Arnold Kling
The Washington Post headline reads Housing Accord Puts Builders First but waits until the last paragraph to explain .
Both parties wanted to help home builders and other businesses .
Under the agreement , corporations that lose money in 2008 and 2009 would be permitted to apply their losses to tax returns from as far back as 2004 , making them eligible , according to a bill summary , to “ receive any applicable refunds . ”
Some comments .
1. Homebuilders lost money by speculating on rising home prices .
So did other people .
After all of the talk about bailouts , this is the first big policy move enacted that is a pure bailout .
2 . Of all the forms of tax breaks , the ones least likely to stimulate any economic activity are those that are retroactive .
3 . The level of public clamor for giving taxpayer money to homebuilders has not been particularly high , but this bill is being lauded as a response to popular demand .
Pundits have been braying that the subprime mortgage crisis demonstrates the failure of private markets and the need for more regulation .
They say that the crisis is a reminder of why we need more government intervention , not less .
The housing bill is a reminder of the opposite .
Tale of Tales , the Belgian indie developers currently hard at work on the very intriguing experimental game The Path , released a brief but very interesting little game today .
Called The Graveyard , it 's a ten - minute scene that they describe as " more like an explorable painting than an actual game . "
The gameplay , if you can call it that , is simple :
You walk an old woman up a graveyard path to a bench in the distance .
She sits .
A scene takes place .
When it 's over , you lead her out of the graveyard .
The value here is n't the gameplay , it 's the carefully crafted aesthetic experience and its ( successful , in my case ) attempt to draw an emotional response from the player .
You can download it for free ( PC and Mac ) and try it for yourself if you like .
When you 're finished , my thoughts are below .
Interactivity is a powerful thing .
The Graveyard could have been a short film on YouTube and lost none of its presentational qualities , or its message .
But the very limited interaction you have with the character – you can walk her forward and backward , or turn – instantly makes the connection deeper and more powerful than it would have been if you were simply watching .
One very specific reason for this is that by controlling the woman , you immediately understand how old and frail she is .
She hobbles convincingly toward the bench , which seems very far away .
After a few steps , she can't keep up the pace on her bad leg , so she starts limping , leaning on her cane for support .
By the time she makes it to the bench , you 're glad to be able to just sit down and rest .
Soon after you do , the scene starts up – it's a song , with lyrics in some European language that I do not know and subtitles in English .
At first the lyrics seem a bit ridiculous , maybe something lost in the translation .
But after a few seconds it 's clear that it 's a melancholy song about death and dying .
The woman 's face comes into clear view and we see the deep wrinkles , the roughly chopped hair .
She listens to the song playing in her mind , looking over the gravestones , thinking about all the different ways that she 's seen people die .
Much like how the close - up of her face is superimposed over the shot , images of the gravestones you 've passed by start appearing .
When the song is over , it repeats again without subtitles .
At any time , you can end your morbid reminiscence , get up , and walk out of the graveyard .
When she ambles back through the front gate , the game ends .
This alone had been a solid use of my ten minutes .
Tale of Tales is doing an excellent job at pushing the envelope in regards to game design .
I 've played the first level of The Path , which has the same economical style of character design and storytelling , giving you an intentionally vague idea of what 's going on and encouraging you to fill in the blanks yourself .
But then , one more twist .
For $ 5 , I could buy the " full version " of The Graveyard .
It would be identical to the trial version , they promised , but with one more feature :
The woman might die .
What could I do ?
I spent the five bucks .
I played it again – no death .
I played it again – and was sitting there , listening to the song , wondering if I was maybe doing something wrong , or if perhaps despite all appearances this woman was actually in robust health and it was going to take a while .
Then , without warning , her head snapped forward and lolled lifelessly in front of her as her shoulders slumped .
She sat on the bench , dead .
The closeup of her face was still superimposed , but now it was a closeup of the back of her neck as it craned grotesquely forward
The song kept playing .
Once I was over the sudden shock of the death scene , and come to terms with the fact that nothing else was going to happen , it felt like the proper ending .
She 'd been traveling long enough , lost everyone dear to her , and had nothing left but to visit the graveyard and count all the headstones of those she had lost .
Death was a release .
It was a release of five bucks from my Paypal account , too , but that 's neither here nor there .
The idea of a videogame about an old woman pondering death , and then ( maybe ) anticlimactically dying herself , randomly , in the middle of a cut scene ?
Somehow I doubt they could even get this onto WiiWare .
But Tale of Tales continues to show that they 're filled with very clever ideas about how to use games to get an emotional response from players .
" ( Designers ) Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn are determined to explore the potential of interactive media .
They believe that for the medium to grow ( up ) , designers need to have the courage to abandon the game format and dare to explore other types of interaction , other types of emotions , stories , etc. , " writes Tale of Tales in their press release for the game .
Indeed .
I do n't know if it 's going to happen en masse anytime soon , but for now it 's great to see some very talented people make a point of trying .
The Graveyard [ Tale of Tales ]
We also learn that Jim Bath , a former reserve pilot with the Texas Air National Guard who used to carouse with George W. Bush , later became a business partner in Houston with Salem bin Laden , Osama ’s half - brother .
The ultimate self - made man , the family patriarch Muhammad bin Laden left an impoverished and deeply religious canyon village to seek his fortune ( during an early interlude in the pilgrim city of Jeddah , he was so poor that he reportedly slept in a ditch he dug in the sand ) and through a combination of skill , acumen and the assiduous cultivation of the royal family , became the king ’s principal builder , overseeing renovations of sacred sites in Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem .
He would bequeath to his children not just a fortune , but also what Mr. Coll calls a “ transforming vision of ambition and religious faith in a borderless world . ”
His British - educated son , Salem , who took over the company after his death , would expand its international reach , and he would also embrace a Westernized , jet - set existence that allowed him to indulge his eccentricities to the fullest .
In fact , Salem emerges from this volume as a compelling , larger - than - life figure , a picaresque playboy , at once guileless , brilliant and self - indulgent , who held together the increasingly fractious bin Laden clan through sheer force of will and charisma .
Salem , who dressed in jeans , loved airplanes and liked to play the harmonica , reportedly “ paid a bandleader at an Academy Awards party in Los Angeles hundreds of dollars to let him sing ‘ House of the Rising Sun ’ in seven languages . ”
Mr. Coll reports that Salem organized family expeditions to Las Vegas , shipped thousands of cases of Tabasco sauce back to Saudi Arabia and dreamed of marrying four women from four Western nations : his estate , he imagined , would resemble the United Nations , with four houses , one flying an American flag , one a German flag , one a French flag and one the Union Jack .
Salem died in 1988 in a plane accident in Texas .

As for Osama bin Laden , Mr. Coll , like Mr. Wright in “ The Looming Tower , ” suggests that the Qaeda founder ’s turn to international war against the United States was not inevitable .
Mr. Coll writes that when the Saudi royal family agreed in the summer of 1990 to the arrival of American troops in response to Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait , Mr. bin Laden “ offered no public dissent ” at the time , but “ moved quickly with the rest of his family to protect his personal fortune against the possibility that the Al - Saud regime might collapse . ”
Although he had come to see himself as an “ international Islamic guerrilla leader , ” his views at the time , Mr. Coll writes , were still “ nuanced , changeable and laced with contradictions . ”
Increasingly at odds with the Saudi royal family , Mr. bin Laden left the kingdom in 1991 for the Sudan , where he bought a farm and raised horses and sunflowers while training jihadis ( whom he sent to places like Bosnia ) .
“ Osama seemed to believe during this period , ” Mr. Coll writes , “ that he could have it all in Sudan  wives , children , business , horticulture , horse breeding , leisure , pious devotion and jihad  all of it buoyed by the deference and public reputation due a proper sheikh .
He did not yet seem to grasp that his enterprise , particularly in its support for violence against governments friendly to or dependent upon the Al - Saud , might prove difficult to reconcile with the interests of his family in Jeddah . ”

Stephen Colbert — who announced plans to run for the presidency , though only in South Carolina , on his Comedy Central show Tuesday night — is serious enough about the stunt that his staff reached out to the state ’s Democratic and Republican committees in advance of his declaration .
Joe Werner , executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party , said that a representative for Mr. Colbert , who was raised in Charleston , called three weeks ago asking about filing dates and other requirements .
Mr. Werner added , “ From what I understand , he does have credible people down here , working to have him placed on the ballot . ”
Katon Dawson , the chairman of the state Republican Party , said his office had also received a call from Mr. Colbert ’s staff — on Tuesday .
The call came just hours before Mr. Colbert taped his own show ( in which he said he hoped to run as both a Democrat and a Republican ) as well as a teaser to his announcement that appeared on “ The Daily Show With Jon Stewart , ” which leads into “ The Colbert Report . ”
Mr. Dawson , though , was far more dismissive of Mr. Colbert ’s apparent intentions than his Democratic counterparts .
“ My advice , ” he said in an interview , “ is that he could probably have more fun buying a sports car and getting a girlfriend . ”
A draft textbook by Theodore Sider aimed at philsophy graduate students that while not as technical as computer scientists are used to , may be of interest due to the explicit discussion of extensions ( e.g. , modal operators ) , deviations ( e.g. , multi- valued logic ) and variations ( such as the Sheffer Stroke ) on basic propositional logic .
The book includes chapters on counterfactuals and two - dimensional modal logic that may include material new to PLT wonks .

The Shawnee County Sheriff 's Office on Tuesday released the identity of a Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. employee who died Sunday after being tased by a sheriff 's deputy .
The man who died was Walter E. Haake Jr. , 59 , of Lawrence .
However , the sheriff 's office released no other details about what led to the tasing at the Topeka Goodyear plant .
Early reports indicated Haake had been suffering from a medical condition and had resisted emergency personnel 's efforts to subdue him .
The sheriff 's office said after several attempts to control Haake , a deputy used a Taser on him .
Haake was taken by ambulance to a Topeka hospital and later pronounced dead .

Here we go again .
We 've covered some of the recent incidents involving tasers , and just last week an 11 year old girl was tased in school to " stop a violent temper tantrum . "
This one ranks right up there with the worst of them and is sure to reignite the taser debate .
I realize that all the facts of this incident have n't been released , but it was known that this man suffered from a medical condition that was serious enough that his employer was trying to keep him from driving himself home -- this should have been a no - brainer and the deputies should have found a better way to handle this situation .
* Update : New details have been released and it appears Haake had fallen down some stairs at home before going to work that day and he was actually tased 3 times before being thrown to the ground and handcuffed .
He quickly became unresponsive and they performed CPR for 20 minutes before they removed his handcuffs .
Hybrid buses are nothing new but this one in particular is special .
Toyota ’s
Hino division is responsible of building this hybrid electric bus with a diesel engine and a set of batteries ( here comes the nice part ) that apparently wo n’t use a plug to charge but will use a wireless charging system built on the road .
The system is supposed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 percent but the first thing I could think of , is that the wireless transfer of energy may not be efficient .
Probably less than half the energy is going to be actually transmitted and stored .
The system uses a series of inductive coils .
One is installed on the bottom of the bus while the others are built in the concrete and resonate energy at a certain frequency and the buses will probably have to follow a certain path in order to recharge .
The system has potential and Hino will probably build a fully electric vehicle that will have zero emissions , when they solve the efficiency problems ( if there are any ) .
Meanwhile the buses are being tested for two weeks on a 4.2 km route at Tokyo ’s Haneda Airport .

Study of instant messaging shows worldwide personal links .
How close are you to any other online chatter ?
Inspirestock
Yet more evidence has turned up to show that we are only six steps removed from almost anyone else on the planet .
Eric Horvitz , at Microsoft Research in Redmond , Washington , and Jure Leskovec , who was an intern at the time , crunched through masses of data , logging a month 's worth of global ' instant messaging ' conversations using Microsoft Messenger — software that facilitates chat , in a similar way to e-mail , but in a more instantaneous and less formal fashion .
The researchers then counted how many messages were sent and from where : in total they tallied up a whopping 255 billion messages sent in the course of 30 billion conversations among 240 million people during June 2006 .
No personal or identifiable data could be seen , and the researchers had no access to message content , although they could correlate messages with information about age and gender logged by users when they registered for the service .
“ We did n’t probe individuals , ” says Horvitz , “ we were looking at patterns . ”
The resulting figures produced a neat map of communication hotspots across the world , and allowed Horvitz and Leskovec to trace the extent of separation between Microsoft Messenger users .
They found that the average shortest number of jumps to get from one random user to another was 6.6 ; spookily close to the infamous six degrees of separation demonstrated practically in a group of 64 people by Stanley Milgram , at Harvard University , in the 1960s .
Horvitz says he was surprised that their analysis so closely matched the 1967 result .
He wonders whether the number six is a basic constant for social interactions .
“ Do we have a natural harmonic for social communication ? ” he asks .
“ This is my conjecture — more work needs to be done on that . ”
They will present their findings at the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web , in Beijing in April1 .
Scaled up
In 2003 Duncan Watts , then at Columbia University and now at Yahoo !
Research in New York , did a large email experiment that also confirmed the six degrees of separation idea2 .
His study involved 61,000 volunteers , compared to Leskovec and Horvitz ’s 240 - million sample .
Watts is impressed that the trend that both he and Milgram saw has now been confirmed on such a large scale , and without having to set up a specific experiment :
“ They are using communication data , so the links do represent something real , ” says Watts .
Horvitz and Leskovec saw a number of other trends in their data .
Over long distances instant messenging between just two people , rather than groups , is more popular ( the application allows up to 20 people to chat at once ) .
People prefer to chat to the opposite sex , and tend to stick to talking with people in the same age group , especially when they are young .
Just for kids ?
There are obvious biases in the data , with 15 - to 30 - year - olds being by far the biggest groups of users .
Geographically , the majority of users were in North America , Europe and Japan ; large areas of the developing world provided no data at all .
In Africa , most users were located around coastal areas , and North Korea was completely ' dark ' .
ADVERTISEMENT
Adding to the analysis people from these ' dark ' areas , and people who do n't use computers , might be expected to produce a larger number for the shortest separation between people .
But the team points out that there are other connections , such as those between grandchildren and grandparents that do n’t show up in their map of instant messenger interactions .
It is difficult to say what would happen if the data truly covered the Earth 's complete social network , but both Horvitz and Leskovec expect the numbers to stand up : “ I can only speculate , but I think we would see something very similar , maybe a small increase in average path length , ” says Leskovec , “ something more towards seven degrees of separation . ”
The institution of marriage took another knock yesterday when government statisticians reported that the number of weddings in 2006 were the lowest for 110 years .
Marriages made a significant comeback between 2002 and 2004 , but fell by 9 % in 2005 in England and Wales , when the long - term trend towards cohabitation out of wedlock resumed .
Provisional figures released yesterday for 2006 showed there were 236,980 marriages , a further 4 % decline , the Office for National Statistics said .
The Conservatives blamed the decline on the government 's social and fiscal policies .
The shadow home secretary , David Davis , said : " This is a sad indictment of policies which have penalised families and fuelled family breakdown .
Stable families are the best formula for bringing up children and preventing delinquency , antisocial behaviour and crime , so a failed family policy is itself a major cause of crime . "
The Church of England attributed the fall in marriages to a " continued trend of couples delaying marriage or avoiding it altogether , not least the mistaken idea that cohabitation is a form of marriage " .
A spokesman for the church said marriage remained the best option .
" Marriage affirms the goodness and rightness of love between a man and woman , affirms this in the public sphere , beyond private arrangements , and is the best option for couples to grow together in mutual support . "
The ONS suggested that the decrease in marriages was partly due to a change in the law in February 2005 , designed to crack down on " sham " marriages for purposes such as securing a visa .
There may also have been more people getting married abroad , escaping the recording system .
It added that the raw figures understated the shift from matrimony and suggested that the true picture was reflected by the marriage rate , a calculation showing the proportion of unmarried adults getting hitched in any given year .
For every 1,000 unmarried men , only 22.8 got married in 2006 , compared with 24.5 in 2005 .
The 2006 figure was the lowest since records began in 1862 .
Jill Kirby , director of centre - right thinktank , the Centre for Policy Studies , said the figures were not surprising " in view of the lack of government policy over the last 10 years encouraging marriage " .
The Department for Children , Schools and Families said : " This government supports marriage as it is a sound foundation for raising children .
But we want to support all children and families , whether or not their parents are married .
The family unit is changing , but this does n't mean it is breaking down . "
The ONS said the average age for people to marry for the first time in 2006 was 31.8 for men and 29.7 for women .
In 1991 , it was nearly five years less for men and just over four and a half less for women .
デスクトップ用オペレーティングシステムともなると、選択の幅はかなり狭い。Windowsを動かすか、なんらかのUNIX的なOSを使うかだ。Linuxには1万2000もの異なるディストリビューションが存在する。また、フィンランド風味ではないUNIXがが好みなら、FreeBSDを使うのもいいだろう。ベンダに頼って、AIXかHP-UXを使ってもいい。SunはSolarisを持っており、忘れたくても忘れられないSCOもある。そしてもちろん、Mac OS Xがある。こう聞くと非常に多様なOSがあるようだが、結局これはWindows対UNIXの構図だ。他にも選択肢がある。いや、少なくとも以前はあった。ここでは、おそらく読者が使ったことのないオペレーティングシステムのベスト5を挙げる。
OS /2
Microsoftの対抗馬となり得るOSを挙げるとすれば、OS/2を挙げないわけにはいかない。MicrosoftがWindows 2000 Professionalを出荷する以前であれば、私はデスクトップのOSにおそらくOS/2 4.0を選ぶだろう。ここではOS/2 2.0以降を参照することとし、IBMとMicrosoftが共同で開発していた不運なOS/2 1.xシリーズは除くものとする。
IBMはOS/2を「 DOS よりもよ いDOS 」そして「 Windowsよりも よ いWindows」であると宣伝していた。OS/2を使ったことのある人は、IBMが大部分においてこれに成功していたことを知っている。技術的な観点から言えば、OS/2はDOSやWindows 3.xよりも、そしてWindows 9xよりも確かなものだった。
OS/2には、今日のOSでは標準装備と考えられるようになっている、多くのイノベーションがあった。OS/2は最初の主要な32ビット用オペレーティングシステムだった。また、OS/2は完全にマルチスレッド化されていた。このOSのHPFSファイルシステムは、フラグテメンテーションに強く、最初から長いファイル名をサポートしていた。OS/2はウェブブラウザを統合した最初の主要なOSだった。また、音声制御を提供した最初のOSでもある。
OS/2が失敗に終わった理由は多くある。Windows 95が登場し、OS/2の方が安定していたにもかかわらず、Win32 APIを使ったプログラムを実行できなかったことが運の尽きだった。Windows 95はDOS やWindows 3.1のプログラムを非常にうまく実行できたため、独立ソフトウェアベンダはOS/2専用のプログラムを作るインセンティブを持たなかった。MicrosoftのOEMに関するライセンスが、IBM自体を含むハードウェアベンダーにOS/2をバンドルする気をなくさせた。IBMがOS/2を売り込めなかったことも響いた。
OS/2の最後のバージョンの出荷は1996年だったにも関わらず、IBMは2006年12月31日までOS/2のサポートを続けた。多くのOS/2支持者は、IBMにオープンソース開発のためにOS/2のソースコードを解放させようとしたが、IBMは拒否した。おそらくこれは、IBMが独占権を持つMicrosoftのコードがOS/2の中に一部存在するためだと考えられる。ただし同時に、IBMはOS/2のライセンスをSerenity Systemsに与え、同社はeComStationと呼ばれる製品の中でOS/2のサポート、アップグレード、拡張を続けている。以下に、私のテスト環境でのeCSのスクリーンショットを示す。
最後にOS/2のトリビアを1つ。MicrosoftはOS/2 1.xをIBMと共同開発した。IBMとMicrosoftは80年代の終わりに「離婚」し、MicrosoftはIBM/Microsoftの製品計画表ではOS/2 3.0になるはずだったものの自社のコードを持ち帰り、Windows NT 3.1を作り、それが今 のWindows Vistaおよ びWindows Server 2008 の糧になっている。
すべてのOS/2ユーザーのお気に入りの引用文は、もちろん次のBill Gates氏の言葉だ。「われわれは、OS/2が90年代のプラットフォームだと信じている」
The face of war is never pretty , but this time war showed us images we have never seen before .
We saw pictures of mothers being sent to Iraq to fight one of the cruelest regimes in the world .
What is the matter with the men of this country -- our political and military leaders -- that they acquiesce in the policy of sending mothers of infants out to fight Saddam Hussein ?
Are they the kind of man who , on hearing a noise at 2 a.m. , would send his wife or daughter downstairs to confront an intruder ?
Three young women were part of the maintenance crew that took a wrong turn and was ambushed by the Iraqis .
Shoshana Johnson , fortunately , has been rescued , thanks to an Iraqi who told the Americans where the U.S. POWs were hidden .
In the joy of reconciliation , let 's not forget the shame on our country that this single mother of a two - year - old baby was assigned to a position where she could be captured .
She did n't volunteer to serve in combat ; she volunteered to be an Army cook .
Jessica Lynch did n't volunteer for combat either .
She wanted to be a kindergarten teacher and joined the Army because jobs were scarce in West Virginia .
Jessica was rescued by U.S. troops thanks to an Iraqi who was disgusted by the way his fellow Iraqis were slapping her around as a wounded prisoner .
Even that Iraqi understood that a female POW is different from a male POW .
The third woman , Lori Piestewa of Arizona , did n't make it back alive .
Her body was discovered by our troops in a shallow grave .
Lori was the single mother of a 4 - year - old son and a 3 - year - old daughter .
Did the Iraqi threat to U.S. national security really require those two children to sacrifice their only parent ?
The reason these sorry things have happened is that the men in our government and in our military lack the courage to stand down the feminists and repudiate their assault on family and motherhood .
Shoshana , Jessica and Lori were the victims of trickle - down feminism .
The female officers ( plus the militant feminists who would never serve in the military ) demand the " career opportunities " of combat roles , and claim that a servicewoman is fully deployable six months after giving birth , while the privates get the really dangerous assignments .
STEVE TRAYNOR / KILLEEN ( TX ) DAILY HERALD ( used by permission )
The pictures of a terrified Shoshana being interrogated by her Iraqi captors and of Jessica carried on a stretcher show the toll on the mothers .
How about the costs to the little ones left behind ?
The war picture that graphically shows this side of the problem was of an apprehensive two - year - old , Teresa Garcia , hanging on for dear life to the legs of her mother , Army Captain Dorota Garcia , as she stood suited up with rifle and gear , ready to depart for Iraq from Fort Hood , Texas .
Despite 24 - hour - a- day front - line coverage of the war in Iraq from imbedded and non-imbedded journalists , some key statistics are missing from their otherwise comprehensive reports .
How many mothers of infants and toddlers ( among the 212,000 women in the U.S. military today ) were sent over to the war in Iraq ?
How many are single mothers , and how many are married mothers whose husbands are already serving in Iraq , leaving their children parentless at home ?
How many are like Army Spc. Tamekia Lavalais , leaving behind her 21 - month - old baby whose father is already in Iraq .
She said she would n't have joined the Army " if I 'd known this was going to happen . "
The government wo n't give us the count on mothers , and reporters seem afraid to ask .
Is it because that statistic is classified information that would be harmful to national security if the enemy knew it , or because that statistic would be harmful to the reputations of U.S. politicians and generals if the American public knew about our military 's anti-motherhood policy ?
Or is it because reporters are chicken in the face of the militant feminists ?
Bernard Goldberg tells in his best - selling book Bias that even tough Sam Donaldson " turns into a sniveling wimp when it comes to challenging feminists . "
The politicians have brought this embarrassment on our nation because they allowed themselves to be henpecked by the militant feminists .
The whole idea of men sending women , including mothers , out to fight the enemy is contrary to our belief in the importance of the family and motherhood and , furthermore , no one respects a man who would let a woman do his fighting for him .
Women serve our country admirably , both on the home front and in many positions in the U.S. Armed Forces .
But there is no evidence in history for the proposition that the assignment of women to military combat jobs is the way to advance women 's rights , promote national security , improve combat readiness , or win wars .
America is alone in this extraordinary social experimentation to send mothers to war .
We hope , when the war is over , that the President and the military will change these shameful feminist policies .
When Feminists Make the Rules
There are two ways of looking at the spectacle of women coming home from Iraq as rescued prisoners of war and in body bags .
Some of us are shocked that these courageous young women , who joined the Army to serve in non-combat roles ( such as a cook ) , were deliberately placed in mortal danger .
We see these events as a humiliation for America and a step backward for civilization because no military threat required our government to send mothers of infants across the seas to fight the most brutal terrorists in the world .
The feminists , however , view these same events as proof that women are advancing toward equality with men on the battlefield .
A New York Times editorial bragged that Shoshana 's capture shows how the American military has " evolved " and " the case for equal footing is gaining ground . "
But , the Times bemoans , the military is " a laggard on the topic of women in combat " and still retains " glass ceilings " that bar women from direct combat .
In other words , the feminists want more women put in more fighting roles .
The fate suffered by Shoshana , Jessica and Lori at the hands of the Iraqis is the kind of equality the feminist movement has always sought and why they remain far outside of the mainstream ( although they do control the Democratic Party ) .
The feminists ' legal oracle in the years before Ruth Bader Ginsburg emerged , Yale Law School Professor Thomas I. Emerson , described the goal of gender equality in his famous 100 - page explanation of the Equal Rights Amendment in the Yale Law Journal in 1971 : " As between brutalizing our young men and brutalizing our young women , there is little to choose . "
U.S. Army regulations traditionally exempted women from direct ground combat , but the feminists in Bill Clinton 's Pentagon opened up more " career opportunities " for women in 1994 by eliminating the then - existing " Risk Rule , " a regulation that had exempted women in non-combat positions from assignment where they faced the " inherent risk of capture . "
The abolition of the Risk Rule is what put Shoshana , Jessica and Lori in a combat zone .
The feminists ' callous attitude toward enlisted women in the military ( contrasted with their warm - and - fuzzy silence about Bill Clinton 's treatment of women ) was illustrated by one of the feminists ' favorite fantasy flicks , G.I. Jane , in which Demi Moore proves she can take it like a man by getting herself savagely beaten and almost raped .
Her fellow servicemen are required to watch this travesty as part of sensitivity training to accustom them to abuse of women by the enemy .
Where are the male politicians and military commanders who will stand up and say out loud that feminist ideology , like G.I .
Jane who showered naked in front of her male sergeant , is an empress who has no clothes ?
The sufferings of Shoshana , Jessica and Lori illustrate how the feminist agenda is an attack on the family , marriage , motherhood , and even common sense .
The feminists applaud the mistreatment of servicewomen by ruthless enemy men as progress toward the goal of a gender - neutral military , but loudly complain about sexual harassment by American men .
The feminists ' goal is not to protect women from sexual assault , but to force America , including our military , into a gender - neutral society .
The feminists ' tantrums about alleged date - rape at the Air Force Academy again exposed their double standards and hypocrisies .
They intimidated the senior officers from stating the obvious : that the problem stemmed from housing cadets in coed dorms and refusing to enforce strict moral standards .
If we had n't had a war going on in Iraq , the biggest news story this spring would have been Martha Burk 's media - generated campaign to force the Augusta National Golf Club to admit women as members .
When the Masters Golf tournament opened in April , her much ballyhooed demonstration attracted only 24 feminist protesters , but 150 media people and 92 police cars .
Jesse Jackson had announced his support , but he does n't do rallies that draw only two dozen people .
If Burk is successful , the only beneficiaries will be a couple of rich women who can afford to pay a $ 100,000 initiation fee .
Burk 's campaign shows how little American women have to complain about .
If feminists were really about rescuing women from oppression , they would speak up loud and clear against the treatment of women in the Islamic world .
But for the most part , feminists are AWOL on Islam .
( For an analysis of their motives , see Kay Hymowitz 's article in City Journal , Winter 2003 . )
A Gender - Neutral Military ?
A new study by the Army 's Training and Doctrine Command reported that mixed - sex recruit training is " not efficient " and leads to a " disproportionate " number of injuries to women .
But the Army 's top brass decided to keep coed boot camp anyway .
Politicians and generals continue to retreat when the militant feminists go on the warpath to demand a gender - neutral military .
A peacetime Armed Services offers great opportunities to women , but it 's very different when a real war comes along .
A New York Times front - page article ( 4 - 18-03 ) about this year 's upcoming West Point Commencement describes the dilemma of female graduates who will soon be Second Lieutenants likely to be sent to the Middle East .
They thought that West Point was " an obvious way to get a first - class education at government expense , " and now say that war is more than they bargained for .
Maybe they failed to study General Douglas MacArthur 's great Duty , Honor , Country speech , wherein he told the cadets that , when " slogging ankle deep through mire of shell - pocked roads ... covered with sludge and mud ... in the stench of ghostly trenches , ... in loneliness and utter desolation , " their duty is to muster the strength and courage to kill the enemy .
Weapons have changed , but the mission of the U.S. Armed Services remains the same .
Wars still demand tough , tenacious and courageous men who can endure the most primitive and uncivilized circumstances and pain in order to survive in combat against enemies who are just as tough , tenacious and courageous , and often vicious and sadistic , too .
Our Marines and special forces who blasted into Baghdad had to carry 200 pounds of gear in 100 - degree heat and blinding sandstorms , and go without a shower for 50 days .
The armies of every potential enemy are exclusively male .
Every country that has experimented with women in combat has abandoned the idea , and the notion that Israel uses women in combat is a feminist myth .
Commenting on the sex- integration practices of the U.S. Armed Services , one Israeli general said , " We do not do what you do in the United States because , unfortunately , we have to take war seriously . "
The feminist push to repeal all the regulations that exempt women from military combat must be the strangest of all aberrations indulged in by the feminist movement .
The very idea is so unnatural that it almost sounds like a death wish for our species .
My new book Feminist Fantasies includes a major section on the feminization of the military .
The Movie that Explains the Feminists
Some feminist academics tell their Women 's Studies students that feminism has moved away from the radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s toward a more moderate style of feminism .
Do n't believe it .
The words may be more artful , but their reaction to mothers fighting in Iraq proves that their goals are just as radical as ever .
Those who seek to understand the peculiar ideology and goals of the feminists would find it instructive to watch the feminists ' current favorite movie called The Hours .
It 's a dreary and depressing tale that makes heroines out of three women who cynically put their own self - fulfillment above every other goal .
They betray their marital promises , abandon a faithful husband , flout moral standards , and walk out on the duties of motherhood .
The feminists like this movie , which exalts selfishness , because they admire a woman who seeks her own identity apart from any man .
But The Hours actually dramatizes the folly of feminist ideology .
The movie shows that the narcissistic pursuit of personal happiness by the three female leads , Virginia Woolf , Laura and Clarissa , produces only loneliness and suicide .
The anti-family , anti-marriage , anti-motherhood , anti-fulltime - homemaker ideology of feminists was articulated again by their icon Gloria Steinem in an ABC radio interview on January 16 , 2003 .
She continues to assert that married women are not " whole people [ who ] have their own names , have their own lives . "
She still spouts the 1960s feminist line that wives pay " the price of marriage " by giving up their own identity and adopting " their husbands ' identity . "
The feminists ' goal is to remake us into a gender - neutral society by eradicating from our culture everything that is masculine .
The feminists despise macho men , such as the brave firefighters who charged up the World Trade Towers and our Special Forces who dared to enter the caves in Afghanistan .
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 's court ruling to sex- integrate Virginia Military Institute was not to achieve sex equality but to diminish the macho in men .
We see manifestations of this feminist goal in the implementation of Title IX ; it is used as a vehicle to abolish wrestling teams and other masculine sports .
We see this in the war on boys through forbidding boys to play cops and robbers and overprescribing Ritalin .
We see the feminists ' handiwork in textbook revision and in the constant haranguing by the language gestapo to persuade us to use such gender - neutral idiocies as he / she .
Feminism does n't have anything to do with whether a woman is single or married , a homemaker or a business executive .
The feminists ' goal is not about achievement for women , or else they would be lauding Condoleezza Rice and Elizabeth Dole as role models , which they do not .
Feminism has to do with the attitude that a woman must put her own self - fulfillment above every other value .
That attitude is not compatible with marriage and motherhood , and it does n't produce happiness .
My new book Feminist Fantasies ( Spence Publishing Co. , 2003 ) contains many examples of how the feminists ' attitude toward life destroys even their own happiness .
Zero Tolerance or Zero Common Sense
Parents are laughing at the intolerance of the zero tolerance rules that have been instituted in so many public schools .
Laughing , that is , unless their own sons are victimized by policies that lack common sense .
It 's a serious matter when a good kid is expelled from school , suspended , or sent to a detention facility to take classes with real delinquents .
Almost all zero tolerance rulings punish boys .
Boys are also the victims of the current fad to eliminate recess and build new schools without playgrounds .
It 's beginning to look as though these fads can't be mere stupidity .
By banning games boys like to play and preventing them from running off their excess energy during recess , this nonsense supports the feminist agenda to try to make little boys behave like little girls .
Here are some recent examples of how the zero tolerance hatchet is wielded in public schools .
Four kindergartners at Wilson Elementary School in Sayreville , NJ , were suspended for three days for playing a make - believe game of cops and robbers during recess , using their fingers as guns .
This case is now before the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals .
( Garrick v. Sayreville Board of Education )
When seven 4th - grade boys ( who had never previously been in trouble ) at Dry Creek Elementary School in Colorado were discovered pointing " finger guns " at each other while playing a game of soldiers and aliens during recess , the principal found them in violation of the school 's zero tolerance policy .
After quizzing them about whether their parents owned guns , she required them to serve a one - week detention during lunchtime , sitting in the hall where they were teased and taunted by other students .
An eight - year - old at South Elementary School in Jonesboro , AR , was punished with detention for pointing a chicken strip at another student in the cafeteria while saying " pow , pow , pow . "
A first grader at Struthers Elementary School in Youngstown , OH , was suspended for ten days for taking a plastic knife home from the school cafeteria in his book bag .
The six - year - old was n't threatening anyone ; he just wanted to show his mother he had learned how to spread butter on his bread .
A third grader at O'Rourke Elementary School in Mobile , AL , was given a five - day suspension for violating the substance abuse policy after classmates reported that he took a " purple pill . "
His offense was taking a multivitamin with his lunch .
At LaSalle Middle School in Greeley , CO , three 13 - year - old boys were given one - year suspensions because one of the students brought to school a key chain from which dangled a 2 - 1/ 2 - inch laser pointer .
The school called it a " firearm facsimile " and sent one of the boys ( a good student who had never before been in trouble ) to an alternative program where he is taking classes with young criminals and juvenile delinquents in " anger management , " " conflict resolution " and gangs .
A seven - year - old at the Edgewood Independent School District in San Antonio , TX , was banished for eleven days to an " alternative school " for troubled students when he was caught bringing a pocket knife to school .
For three days , he was the only first grader at the facility among older students guilty of serious offenses .
A 12 - year - old at Magoffin Middle School in El Paso stuck out his tongue at a girl who declined his invitation to be his girlfriend .
School administrators called this sexual harassment and suspended him for three days .
When the Fred A. Anderson Elementary School in Bayboro , NC , held a Camouflage Day , a nine - year - old proudly came in his new duck - hunting outfit .
His joy was smashed when the teacher discovered an empty shotgun shell in his pocket left over from a weekend outing with his father , and punished the straight - A kid with a five - day suspension .
In Hurst , Texas , a 16 - year - old honor student was expelled from high school after a security guard found a butter knife in the bed of his pickup truck parked on the school grounds .
The knife apparently fell out of a box of household items he and his father had transported the previous day from his grandmother 's home to a local Goodwill store .
School officials claimed that the butter knife was a danger to other students and placed him in a disciplinary alternative school for five days .
Two eight - year - old boys who pointed paper guns at classmates in Irvington , NJ were charged with " making terrorist threats . "
A judge ultimately dismissed their case , but the incident may remain on court records until the boys are 18 .
In a North Carolina pre-school called Kids Gym Schoolhouse , the state evaluator deducted five points from its high rating because plastic soldiers were found in the play area .
The toys were said to " reflect stereotyping and violence and can be potentially dangerous if children use them to act out violent themes . "
Zero tolerance is not protecting us from terrorists or criminals .
Instead , it encourages senseless abuse of power by school authorities .

and it 's brilliant — and always with deceptively - innocent titles like " Hugbot , " " Colonel Sweeto , " or " Weeaboo . "
Nicholas Gurewitch finally agreed to pull back the red curtains of his mind and share some secrets ( and some unpublished art ) with his beguiled fans .
The 25 - year - old cartoonist created a web phenomenon with his comic strip The Perry Bible Fellowship , where there 's always a new storyline , and often even a new style .
I spoke with Gurewitch about his work and his forthcoming book , The Trial of Colonel Sweeto and Other Stories .
LOU CABRON : Can you explain some of the mystery away ?
Tell me something I do n't know about The Perry Bible Fellowship .
NICHOLAS GUREWITCH : I hide a lot of things in the comic — details that I hope resonate with people when they read things for the second and third time .
I do love planting things like that ...
LC : I was just proud that I 'd spotted that same curly line in the Masculator strip last week that was in your first strip six years ago , Stiff Breeze .
NG : It might be the same breeze in all these strips !
I think it might be God messing with people .
Your first comic also had a hidden phallic shape in the clouds ... That may have been a very formative one — the comic that determined the persona of The Perry Bible Fellowship .
That one was kind of created by accident , but most of the comics that followed seemed to get their power by hiding something .
I got high off the fact that some people noticed it and some people did n't .
It almost made the people who noticed it feel more privileged .
I think I 've been trying to appeal to that ever since ... Now I have to know — what else have you hidden in the strips ?
I like hiding characters from one comic in another comic , or objects from one comic in another comic .
Or people in a comic .
I tried to put the author Charles Bukowski in the comic strip Gamblin ' Man .
I think it may have been successful , because I noticed that a Charles Bukowski web site had mentioned his presence in the comic .
Wow !
Can you give me any other examples ?
I think you can see in the comic strip The Other Girls — with the vampires ...
I might rather avoid giving too many clues .
I do n't generally do celebrities , but I 've had a lot of people accuse me of planting ex-girlfriends in the comics .
( Laughs ) So what do you say to that ?
I think you 've got to shrug it off .
So you 're not drawing your ex-girlfriends into your comics ?
That 's my official answer .
Your strip No Survivors had a weird backstory .
It shows a man spelling out " Marry Me " with the corpses from a plane crash .
You told Esquire that you 'd ended a relationship with " a very gorgeous girl , " and were trying to convey your sadness to her !
I just found my situation very comical .
I do n't think it 's a coincidence .
So could the Perry Bible Fellowship cartoonist ever dream up a strip that was just too strange ?
Ever have an idea that was too far out to publish ?
Occasionally , but it 's usually because it 's too far out for me .
It 's never because its too far out for my audience .
Sometimes I do n't really want to see them .
But in your FAQ you 've also said some strips are n't online because they 're " not meant for the internet .
" Occasionally I 'll just outgrow my appreciation for an old strip , and I 'll remove it from the internet .
Or there 's one that I never thought was funny that got published that I never bothered putting online .
Or there 's one that 's just too offensive ... I put a bunch of these lost strips in the book that 's coming out .
There 's a whole section of the book devoted to comics that have been supressed from public view .
There are a couple that are overly offensive that are in the book .
I 've hidden a few things in there ... Can we see one ?
Sure - here 's the first frame .
One of my favorite strips is Cave Explorer — where a man builds a couch - cushion " cave " to trick his son into getting on the school bus .
That 's something that eveyone does , every day , in small little ways .
I do n't think everyone does it that literally , but we 're constantly manipulating children .
So to see it done very visibly , and in an enjoyable way , is almost kind of — it throws a wrench in our conception of ourselves .
Does this mean your parents tried to trick you like that ?
I do n't think we ever set up " Cave Explorer . "
But any parent that tries to outsmart their child to get them to do something is kind of engaging in this activity .
If they try to get the kid to think about a new topic or they mention something advantageous about school that day — any time they cut a corner when they 're parenting .
Laughing Squid spotted something apparently based on another of your comic strips , Nice T - Shirt .
Someone 's selling " Avenging Unicorn " action figures , " with four interchangeable horns that can be used to impale a mime , a new age / hippie girl and a business man .
" I always thought that was really bothersome .
Really ?!
What I took from what it was that person had probably seen the " avenging unicorn " comic that I did .
And I think the giveaway is that there was no reason to think that the unicorn was extracting vengeance on any of the people he was supposed to impale .
Also , the fact that a mime actually has something go through his chest seems reminiscent of The Perry Bible Fellowship archive again .
I did one where a mime gets hit in the chest with a bullet .
( There 's also their " Unicorn Power " chewing gum , which is even more bothersome because it looks so tasty . ) I had some people telling me — wondering if I was getting a cut of the profits from them .
So if it 's not licensed by you — what did you do ?
I think I just got a little sad for a day , and left it at that .
Sad ?
Was it that far from the original comic strip ?
I thought they missed it entirely .
The toy almost comes off as mean - spirited .
What bothers me about the toy is that there 's no reason to think that any of those people should be punished .
The comeuppance in the comic is entirely appropriate .
I think the beauty of the strip is that there are unlikely protectors out there .
The boy wearing the shirt does n't even bid them to do it .
I think it 's just the nature of the unicorn to protect the person who wears their mantra .
And I adore the fact that the bully absolutely deserves what he gets .
Do your strips get any other weird reactions from readers ?
This one kid thought I was enjoying the guy who yells " food fight ! " in the Food Fight comic strip .
I despise that man !
I do n't think he realized that .
I hate him with all my heart .
Seeing him in action is something I find extremely amusing ... There 's almost always a punishment element to these terrible people in the comics .
It 's not just badness for badness 's sake .
People do n't see the bigger picture a lot of times .
They see something bad and they think it 's automatically endorsed .
I condemn a lot of the characters in my comic strips .
Do you ever get people complaining that " This strip was n't as funny as that strip ?
" That 's a really common review .
I think a lot of people think the comic is slipping lately .
But I think people have been saying that since the first six strips came out in college my freshman year .
I had my roommate saying , " These new ones are okay , but you 'll never get back to that first semester . "
It 's been that way every step of the way .
I laugh at it just as much as I always have .
Wikipedia says you almost never receive hate mail .
I 've learned to make really quick and vague replies that make them sorry for asking .
I had a really long dialogue with someone who wrote in who was quite disgusted .
He said he could n't figure out how I thought certain things were funny — that there was no excuse for thinking that someone 's death could be funny .
He was particularly disturbed by the comic Hey Goat , where the last frame indicates an avalanche and a skeletonized couple next to the goat .
He said there was no reason that could ever be funny .
What did you say ?
I basically apologized and let him know where I was coming from .
I think my explanation to him was that in that case , I thought it was very funny that his downfall — his fate — was determined by something absolutely unnecessary .
It 's pretty frivolous to yell at a goat and let him know that you 're in love .
I really like the idea that that was his undoing .
By the end of it , we were pretty friendly .
We realized it 's impossible to know anyone 's intentions without meeting them in person .
It was something really nice like that .
I have to ask you — where did the title come from ?
My buddy and I were just looking around his room and he had a poster on his wall of this traveling singing group .
And they were performing at the Perry Bible Fellowship .
They were called the Hyssongs .
He actually framed it and gave it to me as an apartment warming present a few months ago .
The poster — it would be embarrassing to anyone who owned it .
That 's them — but not the same image .
So when people ask you about the title , what do you think ?
I think , a mental sigh .
And then I proceed to try to cover up the fact that I 'm not sure that there is a very good reason why the comic strip is called that .... How many emails do you get , anyways ?
It varies quite a bit .
But there 's one instance that really gave me an idea about the crowd that was waiting for each update .
I 'd published online The Throbblefoot Aquarium .
I was blown away with the fact that within five minutes of posting , I had received 20 similar emails — appreciating the parody of Edward Gorey .
It 's tough to figure out .
I get the impression that people think I get a lot more email than I get .
Do you want more ?
Everyone says , " I 'm sorry for loading up your inbox .
You must have a thousand of these . "
I do probably get more email than I 'm comfortable with .
I think I have a few from last May that I need to respond to ... I want to respond to all of them .
Sometimes I just do n't know what to say , so I put it off for another day .
What 's the strangest reaction you 've ever gotten from a fan ?
Every once in a while , I 'll get a piece of fan mail that touches my heart .
The other day a young lady sent me an envelope full of grass .
It had little to no explanation along with it , but it was nice to receive .
It was strange encouragement .
Did you write back ?
There was n't a return address .
So after six years of strangeness , do you have a message for all your fans ?
We 're in this together
Vowing to make New York City the center of the scientific universe  as it is for commerce , art and expensive dining  a panel of university presidents , Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein of New York , the actor Alan Alda , the Columbia physicist Brian Greene and a Muppet announced plans on Wednesday for a World Science Festival to be held here at the end of May .
“ The most exciting city in the world is going to be a little more exciting , ” Mr. Alda said at a news conference at New York University .
From May 28 through June 1 , festival organizers say , the canyons of the city will be alive with the sound of science .
Biologists will discuss the perils and promises of humans ’ knowing their own genetic codes .
Quantum physicists will debate the nature of reality .
Neuroscientists will ponder the mysteries of creativity .
The Abyssinian Baptist Church Sanctuary Choir will serenade scientists to demonstrate the effects of music on the brain .
The festival , the first of what is expected to be an annual event , is the brainchild of Dr. Greene , and his wife , Tracy Day , a former Emmy Award - winning television producer .
They said they were concerned that the public was missing out on the excitement and relevance of science .

JP Morgan is going to devour Bear Stearns for $ 2.00 per share ( another article ) .
That ’s a meal folks not a rescue .
After the steroid and credit crack - rush wore off the end came suddenly in the last year of the 85 year old bank ’s history .
But this is only the beginning of the big bank failures , we surmise .
At the time of implosion , we had $ 2.7B for Bear ’s total writedowns in this crisis .
2008-03 -15 :
Make no mistake Bear Sterns has IMPLODED .
The discussions now involve only when to remove the life support and where to transfer the body .
Sources in the US say talks with potential suitors have already begun , with Royal Bank of Scotland and JC Flowers , the private equity firm , named among the interested parties .
A spokesman for RBS vigorously denied any involvement .
The funeral could be as early as Monday .
S&P lowered its long - term counterparty credit rating on Bear to “ BBB ” from “ A , ” and it placed long - and short term ratings on credit watch with negative implications .
Because of that S&P downgrade , bankers have now come to the conclusion that a deal must be done by Monday morning because no one on the street will trade or lend to Bear Stearns , which is rated a notch above junk bond levels .
Unlike the subprime crisis there are no initial claims of containment as the fear abroad is palpable .
To those who argue that Bear ’s problems are self - contained , think again .
The counterparty risks and labyrinthine links to hedge fund trades are tentacles that reach far beyond the confines of the US mortgage market .
Bear Sterns goes the merry way of Northern Rock , but as the global economy enters the end of days of ponzi finance the rest of us ask who ’s next and how much .
2008-03 - 14 :
For Bear Stearns the accuracy of our write - down / distress tally may be moot and the count may come to an abrupt end as the bleeding behemoth , dazed and distressed is breathing it ’s last breaths .
Alan Schwartz , Bear Stearns ’ chief executive admitted it was forced to seek funding following a sudden spike in demand from investors wanting to withdraw their cash .
Mr Schwartz said today : “ The company can make no assurance that any strategic alternatives ” to fund itself in the long term “ will be successfully completed ” .
WOW that beats the Hell outta the Too Big To Fail ( TBTF ) theory and is ominous for the remaining money center banks –all banks .
There has been blood on the street for days , but just 24 hours ago Bear Stearns said it :
“ denied market rumors regarding the firm ’s liquidity .
The company stated that there is absolutely no truth to the rumors of liquidity problems that circulated today in the market . ”
adding today that
… it had only experienced funding difficulties in the last 24 hours .
But they were n’t buying it in the options pit , down there they buying Bear Sterns puts , hand over fists full of them .
This past Tuesday , when Bear Stearns was trading around $ 65 a share , there was huge put volume in the March $ 30 strike .
And so it was that the shares sold for exactly $ 30.00 at the market close Friday .
It was an overnight drop of $ 27.00 ; volume was huge .
The options activity undoubtedly represents not only some insiders protecting themselves , but an active feeding frenzy on their part as well as the active option traders .
It seems on behalf of the implied volatility of more than 100 % that money in the know , knows the gig is up .
And today came news that several banks , including Goldman Sachs , would no longer act as a counterparty to any transactions with Bear .
The inability to execute trades would essentially put Bear Stearns out of business .
It was the collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds last summer that brought credit markets to a roil and an economy to the brink .
The ensuing frenzied concocting of bail out remedies , whether of housing , hedge funds , SIVs , asset backed commercial paper , and any sundry of credit crap has failed as this will fail and so too Bear Sterns .
2008-03 -13 :
Well someone in the options pit sure knew something or works for someone who does .
With options expiring tomorrow and put activity as far down as the 40 strike price just look at what happened today .
Even with the market recovering from the early sell off Bear is showing severe relative weakness .
The FED may pull another expirations day hail Mary play , but on the street they are talking about Bear Sterns and Bankruptcy in the same hushed breath .
Whispers that the New York - based bank is in trouble dragged the company ’s stock to its cheapest price since just after the September 11th terrorist attacks .
Any bets on who fails first — Bear or Citi ?
2008-03 -11 :
Is Bear Sterns going to be the first American money center bank to bust ?
Judging by the action in the options market someone is betting big that way .
From WSJ
Options activity is heavily tilted toward bearish bets , with aggressive players buying put options on March options contracts at the $ 50 and $ 40 strike prices – which would be an enormous move in the shares , currently trading at about $ 62.50 a share .
Officials at Bear Stearns were unavailable for comment .
There may not be a Bear Sterns in a week as the spreads on the it ’s one year credit default swaps have gapped open 250 basis points wider from 550 to 800 along with ever spreading five - year CDS spreads which are up at least 100 basis points from 450 basis points last Friday .
That spells blood in the water for Bear Sterns and if you think this is contained consider this from Mish land .
Bear were told by regulators to sell its ‘ hard to price ’ assets ?
I find it highly doubtful it would be able to sell them and hence , this leads me to question their solvency .
What about the other $ 600 billion of assets on Bear ’s balance sheet ?
Could it sell them ?
Doubtful .
The reason is that everyone else owns the same type of securities and the company is being instructed to sell , yet cannot .
So the ‘ daisy chain ‘ has started whereby when one firm is forced to sell , it must ‘ mark to market ’ which means everyone else who owns the same security has to mark theirs down as well .
Does the concept of too big to fail ( TBTF ) hold if all banks fail ?
We soon will see .
2008-02-20 :
Investment banks now face around $ 197 billion in exposure to leveraged loans used to back big buyouts in 2007 , adding inestimable stress to their efforts to extricate themselves from the credit crunch .
Was it worth it ?
Not for Bear Sterns .
The bank has an estimated Leveraged Lending exposure of $ 2.5 billion .
In addition some fuzzy math has crept up in Bear Sterns 2007 profits
Bear Stearns booked ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) a $ 225 million gain from its “ structured note portfolio ” in its third quarter .
Without it , the firm would have been in the red .
Add it to the $ 2.7B the 2.5B + 225 M .
The only question is how the bank will account it eventually , write - downs , charge offs , ect .
2008-01 - 29 :
Bear Stearns notoriously suffered the implosion of two subprime - related hedge funds in August 2007 , documented at the Hedge Fund Implode - o- Meter :
Two Bear Stearns hedge funds that together managed some $ 20 billion , High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund ( or “ SELF ” ) and High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund ( or “ SF ” ) , found themselves on the losing side of their subprime bets ( Made in the form of investments in CDOs ) .
Bear Stearns made an attempt to console SELF ’s creditors by suggesting a plan whereby they contributed some $ 1.5 billion in capital to the funds .
However , major drama unfolded on Wall Street as Merrill Lynch rejected Bear Stearns plan choosing instead to seize control of its collateral ( Nominally around $ 800 million ) .
When the market was only offering 30 % or less for these assets , that plan was scuttled quickly .
Bear Stearns took at least the SF fund back in - house , and we ’re unclear on what if any write - downs related to this ( or the other fund ) have migrated to the balance sheet .
The credit markets have not recovered .
As for Bear , we do know the company wrote off $ 1.9B in the fourth quarter on bum subprime assets in general ( earlier guidance was $ 1.2B ) ; however these may not have been assets from the two hedge funds in question .
As far as remaining exposure , Deutsche Bank estimates prior to Q4-07 had $ 884 M in subprime CDO exposure , $ 9.6B in MBS , and $ 2.4B in direct subprime loans for the Bear , for a total of $ 12.8B ( ex. SIVs and conduits ) .
Reportedly Bear also has $ 2.5B in derivatives exposure to counterparties rated at AA or below .
That amounts to 19 % of the company ’s tangible equity ( Dec. 2007 data ) .
We have no data yet on the bank ’s exposure to Alt - A , second lien , Pay Option , or other sorts of questionable mortgage securities .
Regarding write - downs , it appears almost certain that more lie ahead than behind , at this point .
This article , written by Barack Obama some twenty years ago as he worked as a community organizer in Chicago ’s poor neighborhoods , gives us a real insight into the man and his beliefs .
Why Organize ?
Problems and Promise in the Inner City
By Barack Obama
( c ) 1990 Illinois Issues , Springfield , Illinois
For five years Barack Obama was the director of Developing Communities Project , a community organization on Chicago 's far south side .
He also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation , an organizing institute working throughout the Midwest .
" Why Organize ?
Problems and Promise in the Inner City " was first published in the August / September 1988 Illinois Issues [ published by then - Sangamon State University , which is now the University of Illinois at Springfield ] .
Over the past five years , I 've often had a difficult time explaining my profession to folks .
Typical is a remark a public school administrative aide made to me one bleak January morning , while I waited to deliver some flyers to a group of confused and angry parents who had discovered the presence of asbestos in their school .
" Listen , Obama , " she began .
" You 're a bright young man , Obama .
You went to college , did n't you ? "
I nodded .
" I just cannot understand why a bright young man like you would go to college , get that degree and become a community organizer . "
" Why 's that ? "
" ' Cause the pay is low , the hours is long , and do n't nobody appreciate you . "
She shook her head in puzzlement as she wandered back to attend to her duties .
I 've thought back on that conversation more than once during the time I 've organized with the Developing Communities Project , based in Chicago 's far south side .
Unfortunately , the answers that come to mind have n't been as simple as her question .
Probably the shortest one is this :
It needs to be done , and not enough folks are doing it .
The debate as to how black and other dispossessed people can forward their lot in America is not new .
From W.E.B. DuBois to Booker T. Washington to Marcus Garvey to Malcolm X to Martin Luther King , this internal debate has raged between integration and nationalism , between accommodation and militancy , between sit - down strikes and boardroom negotiations .
The lines between these strategies have never been simply drawn , and the most successful black leadership has recognized the need to bridge these seemingly divergent approaches .
During the early years of the Civil Rights movement , many of these issues became submerged in the face of the clear oppression of segregation .
The debate was no longer whether to protest , but how militant must that protest be to win full citizenship for blacks .
Twenty years later , the tensions between strategies have reemerged , in part due to the recognition that for all the accomplishments of the 1960s , the majority of blacks continue to suffer from second - class citizenship .
Related to this are the failures — real , perceived and fabricated — of the Great Society programs initiated by Lyndon Johnson .
Facing these realities , at least three major strands of earlier movements are apparent .
First , and most publicized , has been the surge of political empowerment around the country .
Harold Washington and Jesse Jackson are but two striking examples of how the energy and passion of the Civil Rights movement have been channeled into bids for more traditional political power .
Second , there has been a resurgence in attempts to foster economic development in the black community , whether through local entrepre¬neurial efforts , increased hiring of black contractors and corporate managers , or Buy Black campaigns .
Third , and perhaps least publicized , has been grass - roots community organizing , which builds on indigenous leadership and direct action .
Proponents of electoral politics and economic development strategies can point to substantial accomplishments in the past 10 years .
An increase in the number of black public officials offers at least the hope that government will be more responsive to inner-city constituents .
Economic development programs can provide structural improvements and jobs to blighted communities .
In my view , however , neither approach offers lasting hope of real change for the inner city unless undergirded by a systematic approach to community organization .
This is because the issues of the inner city are more complex and deeply rooted than ever before .
Blatant discrimination has been replaced by institutional racism ; problems like teen pregnancy , gang involvement and drug abuse cannot be solved by money alone .
At the same time , as Professor William Julius Wilson of the University of Chicago has pointed out , the inner city 's economy and its government support have declined , and middle - class blacks are leaving the neighbor ¬hoods they once helped to sustain .

WASHINGTON --
Slowly but steadily , a string of Democratic Party figures is taking Barack Obama 's side in the presidential nominating race and raising the pressure on Hillary Clinton to give up .
Sen .
Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota is expected to endorse Sen. Obama Monday , according to a Democrat familiar with her plans .
Meanwhile , North Carolina 's seven Democratic House members are poised to endorse Sen. Obama as a group -- just one has so far -- before that state 's May 6 primary , several Democrats say .
Helping ...
Weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the Bush administration declared the military exempt from a major plank of the US Constitution 's bill of rights , according to a legal memorandum uncovered this week .
The fourth amendment protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures .
The military exemption , crafted in October 2001 by the justice department lawyers who give legal advice to the president , was cited in a footnote to a 2003 brief on interrogation tactics .
That later brief emerged for the first time late Tuesday .
In the 2003 footnote , Bush lawyer John Yoo writes : " Our office recently concluded that the fourth amendment had no application to domestic military operations . "
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , which won release of the 2003 brief following a prolonged court battle , argues that the fourth amendment exemption provided legal cover for the administration 's programme of eavesdropping on calls without a warrant .
That spying was conducted by the US national security agency , a military affiliate .
The White House denied that the October 2001 brief was legally linked to Bush - approved surveillance and said the fourth amendment exemption was later revoked .
" We disagree with the proposition that the fourth amendment has no application to domestic military operations , '' justice department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse told the Associated Press .
" Whether a particular search or seizure is reasonable under the fourth amendment requires consideration of the particular context and circumstances of the search . "
Roehrkasse did not provide the date that the administration ended its freedom from the fourth amendment .
Still , the administration had freed itself from part of the US bill of rights for at least 16 months after 9/11 .
The March 2003 legal brief referred to the fourth amendment exemption as still in place .
The ACLU first noticed the 37 - page fourth amendment brief on a list of justice department documents that the Bush administration said were relevant to a lawsuit over government surveillance .
The group plans to continue fighting in court for total de-classification of the brief .
" The administration 's lawyers believe the president should be permitted to violate statutory law , to violate international treaties , and even to violate the fourth amendment inside the US , " Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU 's national security project , said .
" They believe that the president should be above the law . "
" In C , " writes Keith Lucas , " literal floating point number are interpreted as double precision floating point numbers .
For example , if you have ' 0.0 ' in your code , the compiler will determine the type of ' 0.0 ' to be ' double ' .
In some compilers , such as the Visual C++ 6 compiler that we use , if a literal ' double ' is used for a function with a ' float ' parameter , a compiler warning is issued because the literal could be less accurate . "
Keith continued , " My former coworker thought of an ingenious way to fix this problem .
He defined a constant with a manual cast for double he intended to use ... "
/** * Various numeric constants for the UI library , used to * avoid the " truncation from const double " compiler warning **/ # define HMI_0P0 ( ( float ) 0.00 ) # define HMI_P05 ( ( float ) 0.05 ) # define HMI_P07 ( ( float ) 0.07 ) # define HMI_P10 ( ( float ) 0.10 ) # define HMI_P14 ( ( float ) 0.14 ) # define HMI_P15 ( ( float ) 0.15 ) # define HMI_P20 ( ( float ) 0.20 ) # define HMI_P25 ( ( float ) 0.25 ) # define HMI_P26 ( ( float ) 0.26 ) # define HMI_P30 ( ( float ) 0.30 ) # define HMI_P40 ( ( float ) 0.40 ) # define HMI_P50 ( ( float ) 0.50 ) # define HMI_P60 ( ( float ) 0.60 ) # define HMI_P65 ( ( float ) 0.65 ) # define HMI_P70 ( ( float ) 0.70 ) # define HMI_P75 ( ( float ) 0.75 ) # define HMI_P80 ( ( float ) 0.80 ) # define HMI_P90 ( ( float ) 0.90 ) # define HMI_1P0 ( ( float ) 1.00 )
" Along with the obvious benefit of fixing the compiler warning , " Keith added , " this also eliminates the dreaded use of ' magic numbers , ' thereby making code more readable .
For example , if I wanted to use 100 % , I could use ' 1.0 F ' , and no one would understand what that meant .
However , if I use ' HMI_1P0 ' it is blatantly obvious what it means because of the well thought out constant . "
Standard ML and Objective Caml , Side by Side
This page gives a quick side by side comparison of program fragments in the two ML dialects Standard ML ( ' 97 revision ) and Objective Caml ( version 3.12 ) .
It is primarily targetted at people who need to convert code between the two dialects .
Where suitable we also mention common extensions to SML , or recent extensions of Ocaml .
The comparison does not cover features that do not have an appropriate counter part in the sibling dialect ( e.g . Ocaml 's object sublanguage , SML's user - defined operator fixity , or advanced library issues ) .
The first section is an interaction with the respective toplevel system , in order to show the built - in types .
The rest just consists of example expressions and definitions .
Keywords and other reserved symbols are type - set in blue .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Eighteen pork plant workers in Minnesota , at least five in Indiana and one in Nebraska have come down with a mysterious neurological condition they appear to have contracted while removing brains from slaughtered pigs , U.S. researchers and health officials said on Wednesday .
They said the illness is a new disorder that causes a range of symptoms , from inflammation of the spinal cord to mild weakness , fatigue , numbness and tingling in the arms and legs .
“ As far as we are aware it is a brand new disorder , ” said Dr. Daniel Lachance of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , who presented his findings at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in Chicago .
Lachance has been following the 18 Minnesota patients , all of whom have evidence of nerve involvement , typically affecting the legs .
He said tests showed patients had damage to the nerves at the root level near the spinal cord , and at the far reaches of their motor nerves , where the nerves connect with muscle .
The first cases of the condition were reported in November of last year at Quality Pork Processors Inc in Austin , Minnesota , where workers had been using compressed air to blow pork brains out of the skull cavity .
Lachance said this process appears to be triggering some sort of inflammatory response .
So far , no infectious agent has been found that could explain the illness .
‘ STRONG ASSOCIATION ’
Lachance said it is possible that bits of pig brain stimulated an immune response in the bodies of the workers , causing their immune systems to improperly attack their own nerve tissue .
“ It is a very strong association -- the fact that we are talking about harvesting ( pig brains ) and potentially exposing workers to nervous system tissue and then they are coming down with a neurological syndrome , ” he said in a telephone interview .
Dr. James Sejvar of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said it is unlikely the condition could be passed from person to person .
“ It does n’t appear this is in any way a foodborne illness , ” Sejvar told a media briefing .
He said the processing technique used appears to be very uncommon .
“ We canvassed 25 of the largest pork processors in the United States , ” Sejvar said .
“ We have identified only these three plants that use this process . ”
All three plants have suspended the processing practice as a precaution .
While symptoms range in severity , most of the cases are mild .
“ Most of these patients have relatively mild weakness on their examinations or in fact no weakness , but have a predominance of sensory symptoms .
They could be walking around and not have the appearance of being ill , ” Lachance said .
He said those who were mildly affected received drugs that address numbness and pain , and those who were more severely affected were treated with drugs that suppress or modulate the immune system .
“ No one has completely recovered , ” Lachance said , adding , “ Most have improved to a very modest degree , mainly in terms of their fatigue and sensory symptoms . ”

Rove involved in attempt to remove US Attorney Fitzgerald from Rezko trial , witness may testify Mike Sheehan

This A potential witness in the federal trial of Democratic fundraiser Tony Rezko is prepared to testify that former Bush aide Karl Rove worked behind the scenes with Illinois political insiders to oust U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald from the growing case against Rezko , trial prosecutors said today .
" With federal investigators closing in , " writes Joseph Ryan for the Daily Herald , " insiders hoped to avoid prosecution by tapping [ Rove ] . "
The key named insider is Bob Kjellander , described by Ryan as a " longtime friend " to Rove .
Rezko associate Ali Ata , the potential witness prosecutors want to testify , allegedly discussed with Rezko " that Rove was working with Rezko ally and GOP heavyweight Kjellander to get Fitzgerald taken off the case , " reports ABC News .
An attorney for Rove denied the accusations , saying , " Karl has known Kjellander for many years , but does not recall him or anyone else arguing for Fitzgerald 's removal .
And [ Rove ] is very certain that he did n't take any steps to do that , or have any conversations with anyone in the White House -- or in the Justice Department -- about doing anything like that . "
Presiding U.S. District Judge Amy St. Eve has yet to issue a ruling on whether Ata will testify , reports the Chicago Tribune .
Fitzgerald directed the prosecution in the " Plamegate " CIA leak trial which led to the conviction of former Cheney chief of staff Lewis " Scooter " Libby .
Rove was rumored to be the main target of that investigation , but an indictment never materialized , and Fitzgerald has had little comment on the matter in the time since .
Rezko , who is accused of bribery and attempted extortion among other charges , is a onetime Democratic fundraiser in Illinois with ties to many area politicians , including Gov. Rod Blagojevich - - a central figure in trial testimony -- and Sen. Barack Obama .
Obama , the current Democratic presidential frontrunner , has not been implicated in any wrongdoing .
It 's the French paradox redux :
Why do n't the French get as fat as Americans , considering all the baguettes , wine , cheese , pate and pastries they eat ?
Because they use internal cues -- such as no longer feeling hungry -- to stop eating , reports a new Cornell study .
Americans , on the other hand , tend to use external cues -- such as whether their plate is clean , they have run out of their beverage or the TV show they 're watching is over .
" Furthermore , we have found that the heavier a person is -- French or American -- the more they rely on external cues to tell them to stop eating and the less they rely on whether they felt full , " said senior author Brian Wansink , the John S. Dyson Professor of Marketing and director of the Cornell Food and Brand Lab in the Department of Applied Economics and Management , now on leave to serve as executive director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion until January 2009 .
The new study , an analysis of questionnaires from 133 Parisians and 145 Chicagoans about how they decide when to stop eating , is being published in the journal Obesity and is being presented this later month at an the Winter Marketing Educators conference .
" Over - relying on external cues to stop eating a meal may prove useful in offering a partial explanation of why body mass index [ a calculation based on the relationship of weight to height ] varies across people and potentially across cultures , " said co-author Collin Payne , a Cornell postdoctoral researcher .
He stressed that further studies should following up with smoking behavior and socio-economic differences as well .
" Relying on internal cues for meal cessation , rather than on external cues , may improve eating patterns in the long term .
###
Wansink , author of " Mindless Eating : Why We Eat More Than We Think , " also conducted the study with Pierre Chandon , a marketing professor at INSEAD , an international business school in France .

21 Interesting Facts About Reptiles
© 2019 , Brandon Cornett |
All rights reserved
Reptiles are one of the most diverse groups in the animal kingdom .
Their behaviors and physical attributes cover a broad spectrum , which is one of the reasons we humans find them so fascinating .
There are a lot of myths and misunderstandings about reptiles these days , but ( thankfully ) not nearly as many as in the past .
Today , we know more about reptiles than we ever have , and this knowledge has brought to light many interesting facts about these creatures and their lives .
This article is a good example of the amazing diversity of reptiles .
Below , I have compiled what I feel are some of the most interesting facts about the reptiles of the world .
Some of these are facts about reptiles in general , while other are facts about particular species within the class Reptilia .
Interesting Reptile Facts
1 . There are more than 8,000 species of reptiles on the planet , and the live on every continent except Antarctica ( where it is too cold ) .
2. " Cold - blooded " is not the best way to describe reptiles .
Their blood is not necessarily cold by itself .
But they are ectothermic , which means they get their body heat from external sources .
Reptiles cannot regulate their body temperature internally as humans do .
3. Reptiles are among the longest - lived species on the planet .
For example , large tortoises such as the Aldabra tortoise can live for more than 150 years .
Alligators can live nearly 70 years .
Ball pythons , a popular type of pet snake , can live up to 40 years ( consider that before getting one as a pet ) .
4 . Most of the world 's snakes ( nearly two - thirds ) are non-venomous .
Only about 500 snake species are venomous , and of those only 30 - 40 are considered harmful to humans .
In other words , less than 2 percent of all snakes are considered harmful to humans .
5 . With regard to reptile fact # 4 above , the opposite is true in Australia .
There are actually more venomous snakes in Australia than non-venomous snakes .
The inland taipan is one of the most popular of these venomous Australian snakes .
Australia is the only continent where venomous snakes outnumber non-venomous snakes .
6 . It is a fact that more Americans die each year from bee stings than from snake bites .
7. Certain types of snakes can go months without eating .
This is especially true of the big constrictors , such as the Anaconda and the reticulated python .
Snakes eat large meals ( relative to their body size ) , and they have much slower metabolisms than we humans have .
This partly explains how they can go so long between meals .

Okay , let 's continue !
8 . Most kinds of reptiles do not tolerate the cold very well .
But the Blanding 's turtle ( Emydoidea blandingii ) is sometimes found swimming under the ice in the Great Lakes region of the United States .
9 . Snakes and lizards flick their tongues in the air to capture scent particles .
They do n't smell through their noses like you and I .
Instead , the use their tongues to collect scent particles and then pass the particles over something called a Jacobson 's organ to decipher the air around them .
This is partly how reptiles hunt for food .
10 .
True to its name , the African egg- eating snake ( of the genus Dasypeltis ) prefers to dine on the eggs of other animals .
It will swallow the egg whole , and then use tiny " spikes " extending internally from its spine to crack the egg open and swallow the nutritious contents .
Lastly , it will regurgitate the unneeded egg shell in a neatly folded piece .
11 . Contrary to popular belief , chameleons do not change their color to blend in with different backgrounds .
Chameleons are naturally camouflaged with their surroundings ( most are predominantly green to match their treetop environment ) .
The fact is that chameleons change their color in limited ways , usually by brightening or darkening their skin .
But these color changes are related to temperature regulation and emotional changes .
A frightened or angry chameleon , for example , will become extremely bright in color .
12 . The skulls of snakes are made up of many small bones that are interconnected in a flexible fashion .
This is entirely different from a human skull , which is one solid piece .
This allows snakes to expand their jaws and heads in order to eat prey items larger than their heads .
A common garter snake , for example , could swallow a frog more than twice the size of its head .
Large constrictors such as the anaconda can expand their jaws to an almost alarming degree !
There are so many neat facts about reptiles that it 's hard to write just one article on the subject .
But let 's continue anyway with our list of 21 interesting reptile facts ...
13 .
Many people think that reptiles are slimy .
But the fact is that reptiles do not have sweat glands like you and I have , so their skin is usually cool and dry .
I have several pet snakes for example , and people who touch them for the first time always say the same thing : " Oh wow , they 're not slimy at all . "
14 .
The scales of all snakes ( and many lizard species ) are made of keratin , which is the same substance that makes up the hair and fingernails of humans .
15 . Snakes shed their skin in relation to their growth rate .
A young snake will shed more often because they typically grow fastest during the first two years of their lives .
An older snake will shed less often as its rate of growth slows down .
16 .
The world 's longest snake species is the reticulated python , which can exceed 30 feet ( 10 meters ) in length .
While reticulated pythons typically grow longer , the anaconda could be considered the largest snake by overall size and weight .
The anaconda is a heavy - bodied snake and can weigh well over 300 pounds .
Learn more about types of big snakes .
17 .
While the reticulated python and anaconda are the largest snakes in general , the king cobra is by far largest of the venomous snakes .
It can grow to lengths of more than 18 feet ( 6 meters ) can weigh in excess of 20 pounds .
I told you there were a lot of cool facts about reptiles worth knowing .
And this only scratches this surface .
Let 's continue ...
18 . Some species of gecko use their tails as a defensive tool .
When attacked , the gecko will wiggle its tail to lure the attacking creature .
When the animal bites onto the tail , the gecko can detach the tail and make its escape .
In most cases , a new tail will grow in place of the old one .
19 .
Most snake species lay eggs .
But about one - fifth of all snakes bear live young instead .
Rattlesnakes and boa constrictors are examples of snakes that bear live young .
20 .
Many states such as Georgia and Texas still engage in " rattlesnake roundups , " in which rattlesnakes are gathered from the wild and slaughtered by the hundreds .
These activities are mostly practiced by ignorant rednecks who think that rattlesnakes are somehow evil or malicious .
Eventually ( one can hope ) , such practices will be outlawed ... ideally before yet another species of animal goes extinct on this planet .
21 . Reptiles are the oldest type of animal on the planet .
Turtles , for example , have been on the planet for more than 200 million years , in basically the same form as we see them today .
For this reason and many more , reptiles deserve respect from us humans .
They do not deserve fear or persecution !
These 21 interesting facts about reptiles merely scratch the surface .
I could just as easily have expanded this list to be 50 interesting facts or even 100 .
But the point of this article is merely to give you a glimpse into the fascinating world of reptiles and , hopefully , pique your curiosity that you conduct further research into the subject .
Deceased Do Not Contact Registration
DMA sometimes receives calls from family members , friends or caretakers seeking to remove the names of deceased individuals from commercial marketing lists .
We understand how difficult this process can be .
To assist those who are managing this process , DMA created ( in October 2005 ) a Deceased Do Not Contact List ( DDNC ) which all DMA members are required to honor .
The Deceased Do Not Contact List is available to companies and nonprofit organizations for the sole purpose of removing names and addresses from their marketing lists .
What are the expected results ?
When you register a name with DDNC , the person 's name , address , phone number and e-mail address is placed on a special do not contact file .
All DMA members are required to eliminate these individuals from their prospecting campaigns .
The service is also available to non-members of DMA so that all marketers may take advantage of this service to eliminate names .
A new , updated file is distributed to our members every month .
Therefore the number of commercial contacts from DMA members should begin to decrease within three months .
How to Register
Friends , relatives and caregivers are encouraged to register the information about deceased individuals as soon as possible .
We encourage funeral directors , hospitals , doctors ' offices and others to provide this Internet link to the bereaved , as well .
Verification Fee
There is no charge to register for the Deceased Do Not Contact List .
Consumers will be asked for an email address when registering .
An email will be sent to this address which will have a link to verify registration .
The DMA will not keep personal , identifiable information and will not use the information for marketing purposes .

Flat piano
Like many musicians , I enjoy watching live music because it gives me a chance to see how the performers play .
For most instruments , this works well -- but keyboard players ' hands are generally hidden from the audience by their instrument .
Classical pianists usually get around this by facing away from the audience when they play ; a few rock keyboardists solve the problem by using a keytar , or a keyboard on a stand tilted away from them .
I 'd like to solve this by building a keyboard that does n't obscure the player 's hands : the key mechanism would be designed so that no counterweight would be used at the back of the key , meaning that the keyboard casing could be completely flat at the level of the keys .
If a counterweight is necessary , it could be coupled to the key using gears from beneath .
I think it'd be particularly neat if this could be made to work with a real acoustic piano -- but even for a MIDI keyboard , this would allow a weighted keyboard to be built with an unusually minimal appearance .
SpamAssassin rule scheduling Several machines I run spend most of their CPU time doing SpamAssassin analysis .
SpamAssassin applies a very large set of rules to incoming messages in order to decide whether they 're spam .
Each rule has a positive or negative score , and the sum of all the scores for the rules that fired is compared against a threshold .
When filtering mail , once you 've passed the score needed to tell a message is junk , there 's no point in running rules that will increase the score more .
You can therefore limit yourself to only the rules that may reduce the score .
If it drops below the threshold again , you can go back to trying positive - score rules .
In order to prove a message is spam , you only have to make sure you 've run all the rules that might help to prove it is n't .
If we use this approach , where the positive - score rules do n't always get used , then it would also make sense to keep track of which rules are most likely to fire , and try those first .
Relative mouse movement
User interfaces do n't make much use of relative mouse movement at the moment -- other than the odd knob - like adjustment tool , or gestures ( which I 've never been terribly convinced about as a UI concept ) .
Given that laptop users are often forced to use an inherently - relative trackpad ( or occasionally a stick ) instead of a real mouse , it'd be useful to minimise the amount of fiddly absolute positioning necessary in mouse - based interfaces .
A mostly - keyboard - controlled window manager could use relative movement to shuffle windows around : you press a number key to select a window , then drag it to its new location using the mouse .
This more than halves the distance you have to move the mouse , which would be a great advantage on a trackpad .
A text editor could use mouse or scrollwheel movement to adjust numbers in text , using a logarithmic scale so that it would n't matter how big they were to start with .
( Or log vertical and linear horizontal , or similar . )
This 'd be great for a live - feedback TeX editor .
Chime reverb
Players of stringed or tuned - percussion instruments will be familiar with the concept of sympathetic resonance : if I play a C on the piano with the damper lifted , all the other Cs ( and , to a lesser extent , the Gs , and so on ) will resonate along with it -- and continue to do so even if I damp the original C .
It would be possible to construct a " tuned reverb " system , based on the same principle as a plate reverb , but seeking to maximise rather than minimise tuned resonance .
( Imagine clamping a speaker and contact microphone to a piano frame . )
This could be used to provide a resonant backing behind a solo instrument -- although the player would probably want a damper pedal to stop the resonance when changing chords , in the same way a pianist does .
I 've seen this done to great effect when using a MIDI - equipped guitar and a synthesiser , but this would work with any sound , including the human voice .
Of course , you probably would n't build this in real life ; you 'd simulate it using something like Pd ...
A touch of real physics for Oolite Oolite is an open - source game set in the Elite universe .
I spent far too much time playing the Amiga version of Elite many years ago , and I think Oolite 's great ; they 've struck just the right balance between the playability of the original Elite and the realism of Frontier and FFE .
One way in which they 've chosen to stick with Elite 's behaviour is in how the ship handles : there 's no momentum .
This is fine by me , since my major problem with Frontier was that I kept flying into planets by accident .
However , they 've implemented Frontier 's engine plume animation , and the faster you move forwards , the bigger your engine plume gets -- which makes no sense , unless they 're claiming that the ship really does have no momentum .
I do n't think this is the case ; by the time of Oolite , navigation systems are smart enough that they 're just providing the illusion to the pilot that the ship is momentumless .
The pilot does n't control the engines directly ; the navigation system does whatever 's necessary to make the real ship do what the pilot wants .
It 's therefore fairly straightforward to make the plume animation match reality : just have Oolite figure out what direction the navigation system must be accelerating in , and point the engine plume that way .
The result should be quite pretty to look at .
This clears up some of the oddities of the game world .
The ship has a speed limit because the thrusters can only maintain the illusion up to a certain speed -- for example , pulling up in a smooth curve only works if you limit the forward velocity .
( The fuel injectors do n't break this rule , since if you 're going faster forwards you need more thrust to compensate . )
It also explains why in - system fuel is essentially free -- you are n't using any except when you change direction .
On the other hand , it would also be nice to be able to disable the momentumless interface when necessary ( i.e. toggle between the Elite and Frontier control modes ) .
This would let you get a better top speed at the cost of maneuverability , or accelerate to a high speed and then rotate to shoot backwards with your forward weaponry .
( Perhaps " advanced flight controls " should be a high tech - level -- or perhaps illegal -- upgrade . )
In - car surround sound Nearly every car stereo system has four speakers situated roughly at the corners of the car , so it 's an obvious environment for surround sound -- and , indeed , back in the 8 - track era , several manufacturers produced in - car Quad - 8 players .
I think it 's time for a quad revival .
These days , most car stereos have CD players , some kind of digital audio processing engine , and four separate power amplifiers , which means it should cost next to nothing to add support for decoding surround sound .
There are a number of formats that could be supported .
SQ and QS are simple matrixed encodings , used on many quadraphonic LPs in the 1970s .
In some cases , the CD releases of these recordings kept the surround information intact ; Mike Oldfield 's " Hergest Ridge " is one example .
Dolby Surround and Pro Logic are more recent matrix systems , and have already been implemented in some car stereos .
Compressed surround sound , using DTS , AC3 and similar codecs , has been available in various consumer products for years .
The " 5.1 Music Disc " format from the late 90s used standard audio CDs containing DTS rather than PCM audio ; few titles are available in the format , but since they 're as cheap to produce as a normal CD they 're still available and relatively inexpensive .
The compressed - audio decoders present in many car stereos present a new option for " compatible surround " CDs : store the front channels as regular CD audio tracks , and the rear channels as MP3 or similar files on data tracks .
You 'd have to read the surround data into a buffer first , but you can probably get away with relatively low bitrates for the rear speakers .
There are also a number of schemes for simulating surround sound from a two - channel recording .
The classic Hafler circuit ( feeding the back speakers with the difference between the front speakers ) is trivial to implement .
Many surround amps use delays or reverbs to synthesise a rear channel .
Automatic redirect creator I 'm currently looking at changing the mail - archive - to - HTML system I use -- which is largely painless , but has the disadvantage that all the URLs to individual messages will change .
I could reverse - engineer both systems and figure out how it 's generating filenames based on the messages , but I think there 's probably an easier approach .
I 'm imagining a " make - redirects " tool .
Given two trees of documents , this program should identify pairs of similar documents in the " old " and " new " trees , and emit an Apache config file with Redirect directives in .
The documents do n't need to be identical , just as close as possible ( containing the largest percentage of identical text ) -- it seems unlikely to me that this would n't work for mail archives .
The same approach could be used to deal in a mostly automatic way with web content moving around on any site -- and even with smaller documents being merged into one larger one .
( The other way around would require generation of a stub page , and would be a bit harder to detect automatically . )
LED - backed LCD
One of the major problems with backlit LCDs is that the backlight must be on all the time -- meaning that a lot of power is wasted as heat from absorbed light , and it 's not possible to get a true black on the display .
To solve a different problem ( motion portrayal ) , people have recently suggested using a grid of LEDs as a backlight which are scanned like a CRT beam .
This would be useful for moving video , but scanning is irritating for mostly - still images ( such as computer screens ) .
The grid of LEDs could be used in a different way -- as a smart backlight that only generated as much light as was necessary in each bit of the screen , using the LCD elements to add fine detail .
Essentially , you 'd display a low - resolution black - and - white version of the desired image on the LEDs , and the difference between that and the desired image on the LCD .
This would significantly reduce power usage from the backlight , and would allow dark areas to be truly dark .
You would end up with not - quite - dark artefacts in the shape of LED grid cells around single light pixels , though ; it might be best to low - pass filter ( and then brighten ) the backlight image to avoid sharp transitions in the backlight intensity between cells .
Daniel Drucker pointed out that this is remarkably similar to the display being developed for the One Laptop Per Child project , which includes a number of interesting new display technologies .
Instant completion
The completion facilities offered by readline and similar libraries are very useful for command - line users , but they are n't very easy to discover -- particularly when the completion rules are complicated , and the user may not know that their shell is able to completion what they 're currently typing .
I 'd like it if readline would show the current completion in a pale colour after what I 'm currently typing -- so I can see instantly what would get completed if I hit Tab .
This would invariably add some extra overhead , but in many cases ( such as completing filenames in a directory , or command - line options from a parsed -- help message ) caching the results of the lookup the first time would get around this , and the completion lookup could start running in the background as soon as a completable word is detected .
