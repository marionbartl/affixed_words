The political realities of “ democratic ” Georgia
By Tom Eley
18 August 2008
One of the constant themes in the US government and media presentation of the conflict in the Caucasus is the depiction of Georgia as a bastion of democracy .
The Bush administration has increasingly invoked the terminology of the Cold War by referring to “ democratic Georgia ” as a symbol of the “ free world ” and its struggle against authoritarian Russia .
The reality of political life in Georgia is far different than the media image .
Only last November , in the midst of mounting protests against his regime , Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili employed dictatorial methods against his opponents .
On November 2 , opposition demonstrations began in Tbilisi , demanding democratic reforms and the ouster of Saakashvili .
These protests , while organized by billionaire media tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili , gave vent to grievances against government repression and the desperate living conditions of the population .
They attracted tens of thousands to the streets of Georgia ’s capital city .
The demonstrations continued until November 7 , when the state police , acting on orders from Saakashvili , used tear gas , rubber bullets , water cannons and truncheons to disperse the protesters .
More than 600 required medical attention after the crackdown .
On the same day , Special Forces raided Patarkatsishvili ’s broadcasting corporation Imeldi , beating journalists and disabling equipment .
Saakashvili declared a state of emergency , suspending democratic rights such as freedom of expression and assembly .
Independent broadcasting was halted even before the state of emergency was declared , and only the state - controlled television station was allowed to broadcast for a period of fifteen days .
Imeldi was taken off the air indefinitely .
During the crackdown , Saakashivli called for snap elections to be held less than two months later , on January 5 .
The elections , held under conditions of political intimidation and repression , placed the opposition at an enormous disadvantage .
All media were under the de facto control of Saakashivli .
In addition , two opposition leaders , Konstantin Gamsakhurdia and Shalva Natelashvili , were declared “ wanted for treason . ”
The government accused them of conspiring with Russia to overthrow the government .
Patarkatsishvili , who likewise faced a government investigation for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government , began his campaign from Israel .
He withdrew from the elections after the government released a recording of him attempting to bribe a police officer .
Patarkatsishvili died suddenly last February in London at the age of 52 .
Authorities attributed the death to a massive heart attack , but Patarkatsishvili believed the Georgian authorities were targeting him for assassination .
The early elections eliminated two other serious rivals for the presidency — former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili and lawyer Tinatin Khidasheli — both of whom were just shy of 35 years of age , the minimum , at the time of the vote .
Okruashvili fled the country shortly after the crackdown in what ABC News called “ mysterious circumstances . ”
He had accused Saakashvili of corruption , but after being placed under arrest he was apparently forced to retract the allegations .
During the campaign , election observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported that the credibility of the election had been placed in doubt by allegations that Saakashvili had used state money , blackmail and vote - buying .
With rivals under arrest , under police investigation , in exile or legally barred from running for office , it is little surprise that Saakashvili won reelection .
After his victory , the opposition claimed that the vote had been manipulated .
His vote total surpassed by 20 percent that which had been projected by an opinion poll released one week earlier .
The Saakashvili regime faced international criticism from foreign capitals and human rights organizations for its assumption of dictatorial powers .
Though the level of repression Saakashvili employed exceeded the measures that had been taken by his predecessor , Eduard Shevardnadze , against the so - called “ Rose Revolution ” that brought Saakashvili to power in early 2004 , criticism from the United States was much more muted .
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew J. Bryza , a close ally and personal friend of the US - educated Saakashvili , acknowledged that the State Department was “ hearing more and more reports that people were grabbed from stores or that passers - by were beaten , ” but concluded merely that “ Things got out of control . ”
NATO head Jaap de Hoop Scheffer responded with little more than a wrist slap against the Georgian government , which was seeking NATO membership .
He limited himself to the observation that “ the imposition of emergency rule and the closure of media outlets ” were not in line with “ Euro - Atlantic values . ”
In fact , the “ excesses ” of Saakashvili in putting down peaceful protests were not mere aberrations .
The US State Department , in its 2008 “ Country Reports in Human Rights , ” listed the following in relation to the Georgian government : “ at least one reported death due to excessive use of force by law enforcement officers , cases of torture and mistreatment of detainees , abuse of prisoners , excessive use of force to disperse demonstrations , poor conditions in prisons and pretrial detention facilities , impunity of police officers , continued overuse of pretrial detention for less serious offenses , lack of access for average citizens to defense attorneys , lack of due process in some cases , and reports of government pressure on the judiciary . ”
The report went on to state : “ Respect for freedom of speech , the press , assembly and political participation worsened , especially during the fall crisis .
Other problems included reports of government pressure on the judiciary and the media , restrictions on freedom of assembly and freedom of speech , and corruption among senior - level officials .
Despite government efforts , trafficking - in - persons continued to occur . ”
The so - called “ color revolutions ” in Georgia ( 2003 ) and Ukraine ( 2004 - 2005 ) did not represent the spontaneous will of the masses .
They were political coups orchestrated from Washington , with the aide of non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) subsidized by the US government and private foundations .
Chief among the NGOs involved in Georgia ’s “ Rose Revolution ” was the Liberty Institute , which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development ’s Eurasia Foundation as well as billionaire financier George Soros ’s Open Society Institute .
The Liberty Institute ’s co-founder , Giga Bokeria , took a Soros Foundation - funded tour of Serbia in February 2002 to learn how the Otpor , or “ Resistance , ” student opposition had ousted Slobodan Milosevic following a disputed election in the autumn of 2000 .
Another US government outfit involved in the ouster of Shevardnadze was the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , a center of international intrigue and subversion set up under the Reagan administration and relying heavily on the services of the AFL - CIO trade union bureaucracy .
The Democratic Party wing of the NED , known as the National Democratic Institute , in the words of Wall Street Journal columnist George Melloan , “ helped introduce Mr. Saakashvili to the methods insurgents in Serbia used to depose dictator Slobodan Milosevic . ”
Saakashvili ’s reelection last January was based politically on an appeal to rabid Georgian nationalism .
The central plank of his campaign was a pledge to restore Tbilisi ’s authority over the pro-Russian breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
They had established de facto independence as a result of bloody fighting with Georgian government forces that followed the revocation in March 1991 of the autonomy guaranteed them under the Soviet constitution .
Within months of his reelection , Saaskashvili was assuming unprecedented powers in what the Manila Times called “ a distinctly undemocratic one - party state . ”
Saakashvili is the representative of one faction of the Georgian ruling elite .
Including in its ranks former officials of the old Stalinist regime , the new financial oligarchy emerged from the breakup of the Soviet Union , amassing its wealth by plundering the formerly nationalized economy .
In contrast to Western tributes to the economic growth and modernization of Georgia under Saakashvili , his government oversees a miserably poor and highly polarized society .
Formerly one of the wealthiest Soviet republics , in 2007 Georgia ranked 108th in the world in per capita gross domestic product ( GDP ) , below countries like Bhutan , Ecuador and Guatemala .
Its GDP ranks 114th in the world , below that of Equatorial Guinea .
If it were a US state , Georgia ’s GDP would rank at the bottom , equaling about one - third of Vermont ’s .
The official unemployment rate in Georgia stands at nearly 13 percent .
More than one half of the population lives below the official poverty level .
Over one quarter lives on less than $ 2 per day .
Last year the average monthly pension was $ 30 .
But Saakashvili ’s pro-Western , “ free market ” economic policies have fostered the growth of a small but growing wealthy elite .
Georgia earned the World Bank ’s 2008 designation as “ the number one economic reformer in the world ” because it improved in one year from 112th to 18th in creating what is euphemistically called “ a friendly business environment . ”
What this means in practice is the scrapping of all regulations and encumbrances limiting the exploitation of the working class and the accumulation of personal wealth by a rapacious financial elite .
In 2004 , Saakashvili ’s first year in power , his government abolished the progressive income tax and replaced it with a 12 percent flat tax .

Executive introduction
Exceptions are important
This article is mainly intended for my own consumption , so take it with a grain of salt
The examples are in Python , but the ideas apply to most languages
Exceptions vs. error status codes
Exceptions are better than returning error status codes .
Some languages ( like Python ) leave you with no choice but to handle exceptions , as the whole language core and standard libraries throw them .
But even in languages where this is not so , you should prefer exceptions to error codes .
In the Python world this is sometimes called the EAFP ( Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission ) versus LBYL ( Look Before You Leap ) debate .
To quote Alex Martelli ( because I could n't have said it better myself ) :
A common idiom in other languages , sometimes known as " look before you leap " ( LBYL ) , is to check in advance , before attempting an operation , for all circumstances that might make the operation invalid .
This approach is not ideal for several reasons : 1 . The checks may diminish the readability and clarity of the common , mainstream cases where everything is okay .
2 . The work needed for checking may duplicate a substantial part of the work done in the operation itself .
3 . The programmer might easily err by omitting some needed check .
4 . The situation might change between the moment the checks are performed and the moment the operation is attempted
Here 's an example of LBYL :
def do_something ( filename ) : if not can_open_file ( filename ) : return err ( ... ) f = open ( filename ) ...
Suppose that can_open_file indicates whether the subsequent open call will succeed .
Let 's see how Alex 's points apply here :
In this case the diminished readability is less obvious , but when more error checks are added , it is .
Anyone with enough experience in C is familiar with the bulks of error checking typical at the top of some functions .
can_open_file definitely duplicates some of the checking done in open .
Just because open is a built - in , you feel less DRY - violation .
How can you be sure you 've covered everythin in can_open_file ?
What if you have not ?
Suppose you work in a multi- processing environment ( no need to think far , a web application running on a server is a good example ) .
Between your test with can_open_file and the actual call to open , some other process might have modified the file 's properties , opened it , or deleted it .
This is a hard - to - debug race condition .
The same code with exception handling ( EAFP ) :
def do_something ( filename ) : try : f = open ( filename ) except IOError , e : raise MyApplicationsExceptionType(e.msg ) # could even pass whole traceback etc # etc ...
Suffers of none of these problems and provides greater flexibility .
For example , in some cases you can skip the exception checking in do_something completely , because catching it at a higher level is more appropriate .
This is difficult to do with error codes .
Never use exceptions for flow - control
Exceptions exist for exceptional situations : events that are not a part of normal execution .
When a programmer calls str.find ( ' substring ' ) he does n't expect an exception to be thrown if the substring is n't found .
This is what he called find for .
A better approach is to return a special value like None or - 1 .
But if he called str[idx ] , and str is shorter than idx+1 characters , an exception is appropriate , because the user expected index idx to be valid , but it is n't - this is an unanticipated event .
When used for flow - control , exceptions are like goto .
There might be a few esoteric cases in which they 're appropriate , but 99.99 % of the time they are not .
Handle exceptions at the level that knows how to handle them
By their very nature , exceptions can propagate up a hierarchy and be caught at multiple levels .
A questions rises - where is it appropriate to catch and handle an exception ?
The best place is that piece of code that can handle the exception .
For some exceptions , like programming errors ( e.g. IndexError , TypeError , NameError etc. ) exceptions are best left to the programmer / user , because " handling " them will just hide real bugs .
If you have a complete application , it is not appropriate to just fail with an exception , of course .
It 's better to demonstrate a polite error message ( or dialog ) and thoroughly log the exception itself , which can later help in the investigation of the bug ( kind of like the dialog Microsoft replaced BSODs with - you get a polite message and may send a detailed report to Microsoft ) .
So before writing try / except , always ask yourself - " is this the right place to handle this exception ?
do I have enough information to handle it here ? " .
This is also the reason why you should be extremely careful with except : clauses that catch everything .
These will not only catch the exceptions you intended , but all of them .
Do not expose implementation details with exceptions
As I noted above , exceptions ride the express train up your implementation hierarchy .
As such , they are prone to break encapsulation and expose implementation details .
An example :
Suppose you implement an object that manages an internal cache , using a file .
An error may occur that that the object can't open its cache file for some reason .
The underlying open function will throw IOError .
Where should you catch it ?
Do not leave it to the user of the object .
This breaks encapsulation , since the user should not be aware that you 're using a file at all .
Maybe in the next version you 'll use a database , or a web connection ?
Rather , you should catch the exception in the object , wrap it with your own custom exception ( say , CachingFailedError ) , and trying to preserve as much information as possible , propagate it up .
The user of the object will then only have to catch your exception , and wo n't have to modify his code when you modify the underlying caching implementation .
However , if during testing the user will want to investigate the source of the error , he will have all the information he needs to do so .
Re-raising exceptions correctly is difficult .
Unfortunately there 's no one - fit - all recipe - can you recover from the error ?
can you provide extra informatin ?
do you need the original exception ?
do you need its traceback ?
If all you need is to re-raise an exception with a more appropriate type , retaining the information stored in the old exception , do :
class StuffCachingError( Exception ) : pass def do_stuff ( ) : try : cache = open ( filename ) # do stuff with cache except IOError , e : raise StuffCachingError ( ' Caching error : %s ' % e )
Benefits :
You did n't expose the internal implementation to outside code .
Now users of do_stuff can install handlers for StuffCachingError , without knowing you use files under the hood .
If the user wants to investigate the error in depth , you 've also provided the original exception in the error message , and he can do so .
If you think you need to retain the original traceback as well ( IMHO is most cases you do n't have to ) , write :
class StuffCachingError( Exception ) : pass def do_stuff ( ) : try : cache = open ( ' z.pyg ' ) # do stuff with cache except IOError : exc_class , exc , traceback = sys.exc_info( ) my_exc = StuffCachingError(' Caching error : %s ' % exc ) raise my_exc.__class__ , my_exc , traceback
Now StuffCachingError will be raised as before , but with the original traceback leading to the call to open .
Document the exceptions thrown by your code
A useful idiom when thinking about programs is in terms of contracts .
Put simply , each function / method has a contract with the outside world :
What it expects from its argument or the state of the world when invoked The result (s ) it returns
Its side effects on the world
The exceptions it throws
For some reason , it is much more common to explicitly document the first three terms , but not the last one .
I think this is wrong , and exceptions should be documented as well .
Do n't overdo it , of course .
Writing " this code can throw NameError because I might have made a coding mistake " is superfluous at best .
But thinking about which exceptions your code may throw will help you write better , safer and more encapsulated code .
Maybe some exceptions must be hidden from the outside world ( just like in the earlier tip on encapsulation ) .
The user of your code must know which handlers to prepare , and which exceptions to propagate forward .
Using error codes :
STATUS DoSomething ( int a , int b ) { STATUS st ; st = DoThing 1 ( a ) ; if ( st != SGOOD ) return st ; st = DoThing2 ( b ) ; if ( st != SGOOD ) return st ; return SGOOD ; }
Using exceptions :
void DoSomething ( int a , int b ) { DoThing1( a ) ; DoThing2 ( b ) ; }

In the video here , Bush tells us Condi has met with the globalist cartel in Brussels and they have decided Russia needs to forget about the rape of South Ossetia by the “ democrat ” Saakashvili and remove their military pronto .
Russia , of course , will not do this , even though Russian president Dmitri Medvedev has told Nicolas Sarkozy , president of the EU , that Russia will begin leaving Georgia on Monday .
For the Russians , South Ossetia and Abkhazia are part of Russia .
Sarkozy warned Medvedev of “ serious consequences ” if Moscow fails to implement the globalist brokered cease - fire deal .
Sarkozy and the EU , the scowling Condi and Bush the Clueless , all are blowing hot air .
Last week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Georgia should “ forget about any talk about … territorial integrity , ” that is to say claiming dominion over South Ossetia , where Saakashvili ’s goons and ethnic cleansers killed over 2,000 civilians .
In his speech , Bush said Russia faces a choice “ to act in a 21st - century way , [ to ] fully integrate into the international institutions , ” that is to say Russia should allow the banksters and one - worlders to trod all over her .
It should be noted that Russia has attempted to make peace with NATO and the EU , but to no avail .
Russia offered to join NATO but NATO made it clear no such an invitation was offered .
“ If nobody expects us in NATO why should we be happy about the expansion of NATO and its movement toward our borders ? ” mused Putin after the snub .
In response , the U.S. declared its intention to place a radar base in the Czech Republic and interceptor missiles in Poland , part of a supposed missile “ defense shield ” to protect against what the United States calls “ rogue ” states , such as Iran and North Korea , an absurdity at best as missiles from these “ rogue states ” are unable to reach Europe .
The missiles are instead designed to prevent Russia from responding to an attack .
Bush said Russia faces a choice " to act in a 21st - century way , [ to ] fully integrate into the international institutions , " that is to say Russia should allow the banksters and one - worlders to trod all over her .
“ Russia is considering arming its Baltic fleet with nuclear warheads for the first time since the cold war , ” reports the Sunday Times .
“ According to the report , under the Russian plans nuclear warheads could be supplied to submarines , cruisers and fighter bombers of the Baltic fleet based in Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania . ”
Late last week , Russia warned Poland it faced nuclear attack if it allows the U.S. to place the supposed missile “ defense shield ” on its territory .
“ Poland , by deploying ( the system ) is exposing itself to a strike … 100 per cent , ” General Anatoly Nogovitsyn , the deputy chief of staff of Russia ’s armed forces , told the Interfax news agency .
Medvedev said the deal “ absolutely , clearly demonstrates what we had said earlier : the deployment has the Russian Federation as its target . ”
As the corporate media tells us , other bankster fiefdoms carved off the corpse of the Soviet Union are worried about the emerging Russian response as well .
“ The sense of alarm may be greatest here in Ukraine , ” writes the International Herald Tribune .
“ Since the Orange Revolution began in 2004 , bringing the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko to power after widespread protests , Ukraine has been a thorn in Moscow ’s side , though perhaps not as sharp as the outspoken Georgian president , Mikheil Saakashvili . ”
A planted thorn , no doubt , as Ukraine ’s “ Orange Revolution ” was the result of concerted subversion by the likes of the Center for Non-Violent Resistance ( otherwise known as Otpor , a Soros Foundation and NED project tasked with taking out Slobodan Milošević in the former Yugoslavia ) , Freedom House ( another NED project funded by the Ford Foundation , Soros , USAID , and the CIA operative Richard Mellon Scaife ) , Soros ’ Open Society Institute , the National Democratic Institute ( chaired by the neolib baby killer , Madeleine K. Albright , and funded by NED , USAID , the Citigroup Foundation , the World Bank , and the United Nations ) , the International Republican Institute ( created by NED and responsible , along with the CIA , for the botched coup in Venezuela ) , and a smattering of European globalist cartels and support organizations , including the European Union and the Council of Europe .
If Ukraine is “ a thorn in Moscow ’s side , ” it was planned that way by the above enumerated globalist , one - world interests .
In fact , the banksters , not satisfied with reducing former Soviet states to groveling peonage , want to carve Russia up into malleable vassal states and loot the country ’s massive natural resources , specifically its oil reserves .
The Ukraine thorn became especially apparent after the globalists went over Russia ’s head and held private talks with oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky about arranging a sale to transnational Chevron of a large chunk of what was then Russia ’s largest oil company , Yukos - Sibneft .
The following year , in 2004 , after the arrest of oligarch Khodorkovsky by Russian police , Russia experienced CIA and U.S. State Department - sponsored and financed putsches in Georgia and Ukraine .
“ Seen from Moscow eyes , the attempt of NATO to take Ukraine or Kievan Rus , the historic heart of Slavic Russia for almost one thousand years , along with Russia and Belarus , was not only militarily a grave threat .
It was also culturally and economically potentially catastrophic given the distribution of industry and infrastructure between Ukraine and Russia dating back to the 1930 ’s , ” writes F. William Engdahl .
“ However , the proverbial ‘ straw that broke the Russian camel ’s back ’ was the decision by Washington to pursue nuclear missile defense installations in NATO members Poland and the Czech Republic . ”
An additional final straw was Georgia ’s U.S. and Israel directed invasion of South Ossetia .
As Condi scowls for the cameras and Bush mangles his speech delivery at the compound in Crawford , Texas , the Russians are preparing a response to the South Ossetia outrage , NATO ’s encirclement , and the installment of U.S. missiles on its border .
“ Russia must adequately react to the agreement signed between Washington and Warsaw on US missile defense shield in Poland ’s territory , ” declared Vyacheslav Popov , member of Russian Council of Federation and former commander of Russian North Fleet , on August 15 .
It is said Russia will consider new target lists in response to the latest provocations .
“ There is no alternative , we should enhance our security , ” said Popov .
In other words , thanks to the heavy plodding of the neolibs and their faltering neocon cousins , your hometown in America may soon be a target for Russia ’s thermonuclear weapons .
Russia has more than 660 missiles capable of striking the United States .
As F. William Engdahl noted last week , the “ trigger for such a war is not Georgia ‘s right to annex South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Rather , it is US insistence on pushing NATO and its missile defense right up to Russia ‘s door . ”

One of the best things about Hollywood movies is the tough guys .
The glitz and gloss of Hollywood are known the world over , but the brooding , hard - as - nails tough guy is one of Hollywood ’s most admired exports .
Whether heroes , anti-heroes , morally - ambiguous loners or downright villains … we all recognize and admire the roles these men played ; as boys we look up to them as role models and try to emulate them , and as men we find them reminders of what it means to be a real man in a world sodden with political correctness , feminism , and new sexual politics .
So here ’s the salute to the twenty toughest characters you would n’t want to get on the wrong side of …
20 John Garfield
One of the kings of gritty film noir , the small - but - scrappy , streetwise Garfield was the star of the classic “ The Postman Always Rings Twice , ” playing the doomed Frank Chambers , risking it all for hot - as - hell Lana Turner .
Makes the list for steely , I - do n ’t - care - how - big - you - are - I ’ll - knock - you - on - your - ass , street - honed stare and wise guy attitude .
19 Anthony Quinn
Nobody could ever figure out Quinn ’s ethnicity ( he was Irish - Mexican ) because he played so many varied roles , from Arab to Italian to Greek ( he was Zorba ) and countless others — but the connecting thread for all these different faces was that you just would n’t mess with the guy .
He was the strongman in Fellini ’s classic “ La Strada , ” a revolutionary in “ Viva Zapata , ” a boxer in “ Requiem for a Heavyweight ” … and even his tempestuous Gaugin is a brawler in “ Lust for Life . ”
18 Sean Connery
Not much exposition necessary here .
For most of us Connery is THE James Bond , the original and best , the one whose shoes were never quite filled .
Latter day Bond Daniel Craig comes closest , but there ’s still no Bond like Connery , who managed to convey at all times the right combination of suave sophistication and menace .
You never believed that Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan could kick your ass … but Connery always looked like he could kill you if you crossed him .
Makes the list for his classic spy as well as for being practically the template of the crusty old Scotsman in real life … who you still would n’t cross .
17 Charlton Heston
Even his Moses was a brawling , takes - no - shit tough guy with a granite - hard attitude towards Pharoah .
The pleasure of watching “ The Ten Commandments ” is the extended stare - down going on between Heston and Yul Brynner ( see below ) .
Makes the list for handling not only a recalcitrant Ramses but also for dispatching talking apes , a world - o- vampires , jungle ants and Roman charioteers with equal , no -nonsense machismo .
16 James Coburn
Tall and slim Coburn was the wiry sort of tough guy with a disarming grin that might put you at ease for a moment … until you looked in his sharp eyes and saw the danger lurking within .
Makes the list for endless cowboy roles , as both hero and villain , ( especially “ The Magnificent Seven ” ) and for playing the parody spy Derek Flint : ultra-sophisticate , ultra- genius , ultra ladies man .
Smooth and suave with a clear propensity for kicking your ass with whatever obscure martial art struck his fancy .
15 Steve McQueen
Ever-brooding and super - cool McQueen played cops , cowboys , crooks and soldiers … and no matter what the role , he had the car , ( or the horse ) the girl , the gun and the ‘ tude , all balanced to “ do n’t give me your guff , punk ” perfection .
He ’s the rebellious tough guy , the one with the motorcycle or the hot rod who looks the anti-hero no matter what the part .
14 Edward G. Robinson
Come on … Edward G. Robinson .
The original Little Caesar ( this one did n’t deliver pizzas ) and perennial movie gangster … the pugnacious and pug - like grumbler with just a tiny touch of the psycho behind his knife - edged eyes .
Even when playing the good guy he had a threatening demeanor about him ( “ The Stranger ” for instance , or his insurance investigator in “ Double Indemnity ” ) … so odd when you realize this guy , in real life , was an art collector and knew a thing or two about fine wines .
Makes the list for all those death scenes in a hail of bullets .
13 Robert Mitchum
At home equally in roles playing psychotic villains ( “ Cape Fear ” ) or menacing preachers ( “ The Night of the Hunter ” ) or historic figures ( “ Midway ” ) Mitchum is the guy who stares you down and then casually lights a cigarette before informing you just how it is and how it ’s going to be … and you know damn well you do n’t want to disagree with him .
Makes you believe you could follow him on the beaches of Normandy or into an ambush with gangsters … and while he might come out bloodied and beaten up , he ’ll still be standing … and you should see the other guy .
12 James Cagney
Ever the sociopathic gangster with cruel charm oozing from every pore , Cagney gets points for umpteen classic roles where he fights society time and time again … and almost gets away with it .
For a moment he ’s even on top of the world … before it blows up underneath him .
Not the guy you cross under any circumstances , and do n’t by ANY means betray him … because he wo n’t rest until you pay .
He ’ll put you at ease , make you trust him and think all is well … then he ’ll drill you full of holes and laugh while doing it .
Points for danger , tight - as - a - tightwire edginess and for knowing how to handle a grapefruit .
11 Richard Widmark
Remembered for playing a psychopathic gangster who shoves an old lady in a wheelchair down a staircase , Widmark was ever the guy you did n’t want to turn your back on , even when playing the hero .
Never a pretty man , never a kind , softhearted role ( in real life he was a softie of course ) but always the guy you ’d want on your side in a street brawl … because you know he ’d fight damn dirty .
10 Dana Andrews
One of my personal faves and , I think , one of the most underrated actors of classic Hollywood , who deserves a larger following …
I have literally never seen Dana Andrews in a bad film or a crap role .
Andrews had that LOOK in his cold , hard eye … you knew he ’d do what he ’d have to do , and he ’d never shirk from it .
Best remembered role : the tough detective in “ Laura ” who not only solves the murder , but along the way gets to intellectually spar with Clifton Webb , sucker punch Vincent Price , and win drop - dead gorgeous Gene Tierney .
Not a bad day ’s work .
9 Charles Bronson
Not one of my personal favorites , but to leave him off would have been sacrilege , I thought .
Bronson is the ugly ex-boxer you DEFINITELY want in your corner of the ring when it comes time to deal out justice to punks , gangsters , and all the other low - lifes of society .
Give the guy a wide berth , and for god ’s sake leave his family alone .
8 John Wayne
I am not at all a fan of John Wayne and for me he loses points for his ultra- patriotism–when in truth he never stepped up to the plate during WWII to fight ( he instead looked to his career ) .
Even so , he ’s got to make the top ten for obvious reasons .
Wayne is the original and best bow - legged cowboy whose rolling stroll is dripping with his patented and carefully crafted attitude — he ’s all about justice and he does whatever a man needs to do … quietly , calmly and without much more to betray his feelings than that curl in his lip and the narrowing of his eyes .
7 Kirk Douglas
He ’s played everything from boxers to Homeric heroes ( “ Ulysses ” ) , from Spartacus to tortured soul Vincent Van Gogh , from Doc Holliday to a Viking … but regardless of the role he was ever the fighter , ever the clenched - teeth and broad - chested man ’s man ( well , not so much Van Gogh , but every tough guy has his departure ) with more than a little edginess about him ; in fact Douglas usually can be described as “ seething . ”
6 Burt Lancaster
Athletic , good looking , toothy and always ready - for - a- rumble , Burt Lancaster was an ex acrobat , and it shows in how he holds himself , moves , and deals with situations where he ’s gotta kick some ass .
Dead serious but knows how to have some fun when the time was right , he was both admired leader of men and ladies man extraordinaire .
Never doubt , however , that Lancaster was ready to handle shit when it was necessary .
He was Jim Thorpe , All American … Wyatt Earp ( “ Gunfight at the OK Corral ” ) , morally challenged but blusteringly larger - than - life “ Elmer Gantry , ” the Crimson Pirate , the Rainmaker … just watching him deal with life , women , pressure and problems was like watching a finely - tuned machine run with smooth precision .
5 Yul Brynner
Makes the list for steely toughness as gunfighter ( “ Magnificent Seven ” ) , Pharoah , King and con man … and for his shiny shaved pate , which he dares you to comment on ( no one ever does ) .
Each word is spoken like being spat , and each movement of his body delivered with shoulders back , chest out , daring you to take a poke at him .
( No one ever does ) .
Moses ’ god may be the true god , but Brynner ’s Ramses is the guy we root for half the time because he ’s just so damn impressive a figure .
So let it be written … so let it be done .
4 Humphrey Bogart
An obvious choice , Bogie makes it for his Sam Spade , his Philip Marlow , and his Dobbs in “ Treasure of the Sierra Madre . ”
Also for countless gangster and good guy roles where he outwits and outfights the Nazis , beats the devil , and wins the girl ( but , like all tough guys , sometimes has to let the girl go ) .
Although more a figure of romance in “ Casablanca , ” he makes it on the list also for that classic role where he has to balance personal pain with self - sacrificing nobility … though as tough guy scenes go , few beat the way he man-handles Peter Lorre in “ The Maltese Falcon ” or how he deals with slimy French collaborators in “ To Have and Have Not . ”
Bogie ’s toughness always comes with that edge of vulnerability — sometimes he shakes a little , because he ’s human — sometimes he ’s scared — but he always shoots it out in the end and he ’s still standing .
3 Robert Ryan
Another underrated talent from Hollywood ’s golden years , Ryan was in a class by himself in the dark and gritty film noir days , when no one could out - do his superb combination of menace , determination , and “ I wo n’t take your crap ” attitude … nor did anyone else have his cold , glaring eyes .
In real life Ryan was a gentleman and a long - time fighter for Civil Rights … onscreen however , he played everything from anti-semites to racists , and yet always seemed to garner a grudging admiration out of the audience .
A boxer in real life , legend has it that Ryan even managed to out - intimidate feisty director Sam Peckinpah during the filming of “ The Wild Bunch . ”
This was a guy you did n’t argue with and you knew if you stood in his way he was going right through you .
Ryan deserves a new audience of fans — there are few better tough guys on the screen ( in fact , I think only two ) and certainly no one today matches up to him ( let alone any of the others on this list ) .
2 Clint Eastwood
What can be said of Clint Eastwood that has n’t already been said ?
Like John
Wayne , he ’s an iconic figure for his loner cops and loner gunfighters — ever the anti-hero , every the man among men who has to step up to the plate and take action when the powers - that - be wo n’t lift a finger .
Hard - edged and snarling , Eastwood is rarely subtle , but he ’s more than one - dimensional .
Pretty decent with comedic twists on his tough persona ( “ Every Which Way But Loose ” ) as well as an accomplished director ( he ’s got quite a few winners under his belt , most notably the recent “ Million Dollar Baby ” )
Eastwood is a skilled craftsmen , and it ’s hard to believe that he ’s not least a little like his onscreen persona .
I ’ve never been disappointed in him onscreen , even when the movie he was playing in was n’t the best .
He always delivers , both in character and out .
1 Lee Marvin
My personal favorite , and I ’m not even sure I know why , but I know that Marvin always came off as believable to me — and yet somehow humble .
Definitely a real - life tough guy and no poseur , it almost did n’t matter if Marvin was playing bad guy or good guy — the result was the same : unafraid , irresistible , rocklike and imperturbable … a stand - up guy , but one you did n’t want to turn your back on for a moment .
The gravelly voice , the eyes that cut right through the screen , that snarling lip … at all times he ’s a little bit the no-nonsense Marine that he was in real life , even when lampooning himself in “ Cat Ballou . ”
It ’s a pleasure to watch him work .

China 's Second Pebble Bed Reactor Steam Plant ; World 's Third Commercial HTGR
July 3rd , 2008 by Rod Adams
There is some excitement in the nuclear focused blog world about “ The World ’s First Commercial High Temperature Nuclear Reactor ” based partly on a recent article in Power Engineering by Jana Miller titled “ Powering Up A Growing Nation ” .
This project in Shandong Province will be a unique plant whose reactor heat source is two containers full of spherical fuel elements , each one of which is about the size of a billiard ball .
I am a bit reluctant to call this plant a “ first ” , but I can get just as excited about the third , 10th or 100th plant in a progressive series of improved plants that should number 1000 reactors or more .
The plant , designated as HTR - PM , will be a 200 MWe pebble bed reactor heated steam plant with two reactors , each with a single steam generator ( boiler ) feeding a single turbine .
The plant will be built in Rongchen City on a site large enough to host series of perhaps 10 - 12 similar plants .
In that area of China , there are hundreds of older coal fired power plants generating 50 - 300 MWe each .
The HTR - PM is a carefully watched project that uses technology old enough to be new again .
The concept was introduced in the late 1940s by Farrington Daniels who suggested the idea of combining uranium with graphite , which is a high temperature substance that also moderates neutrons , into small , discrete units that could be piled into a simple , shielded container .
This concept , known as the Daniels ’ Pile , was a bit before its time .
The material science available in the late 1940s could not provide the tight , vapor - proof coatings needed to ensure that all fission by - products remained sealed in the pebbles in all core conditions .
That problem was addressed and overcome by the German project known as the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor ( AVR ) run in Julich from 1959 - 1988 .
The AVR started operating in 1961 , provided power to the grid in 1967 and was shut down after many years of testing and fuel developmental improvements in 1988 .
The first commercial high temperature reactors
The AVR did not operate in isolation ; during the same time there was a high temperature gas cooled reactor , built by Gulf General Atomics ( now just General Atomics ) and operated in the US at Fort St. Vrain .
That HTGR was based on fuel in a different form , but it used fuel particles surrounded by layers of graphite and silicon carbide to provide the capability of operating at a significantly higher temperature and thermal efficiency than the conventional light water reactors .
I had the opportunity to visit General Atomics in 1994 , before they decommissioned the fuel manufacturing facility that produced the Ft. St. Vrain fuel , and they gave me the pebble that you see here as a keep sake .
It has been on my desk ever since .
The German group operating the AVR also built a commercial unit – Thorium High Temperature Reactor ( THTR ) – using fuel pebbles where some pebbles contained uranium - 235 and others contained thorium - 232 .
This fuel combination intrigued the designers because thorium is about 3 - 4 times as abundant as uranium , but it needs to be exposed to neutrons in a reactor before it can be used as fuel .
Unfortunately , though they were both commercial reactors , neither the Ft. St. Vrain HTGR nor the THTR operated for very long and neither led to any immediate successors .
Good ideas , however , often incubate in the minds of problem solvers that see all of the potential and determine ways to solve the problems for another try .
China ’s New High Temperature Reactors ( HTR )
In 2000 , the AVR rose up like a Phoenix in a new location at Tsinghua University with a new name – HTR - 10 .
The Chinese had recognized the potential of the design and purchased essentially all of the makings including technical drawings , machinery , and consulting engineering services from the German owners .
In January 2003 , the HTR - 10 began critical operations and testing .
I have a number of friends and colleagues who have visited the facility and have been impressed .
You can have a similar experience by watching a video produced by the Australian Broadcasting System titled Nuclear China .
There are many things about pebble bed reactors that fascinate me , but one of them is the fact that they can be configured to be able to withstand a complete loss of cooling without causing any core damage .
As long as each reactor unit produces less than 400 MW of thermal energy , operators can turn off the cooling circulators and walk away knowing that the plant will heat up a bit , shut itself down , and never exceed a temperature at which any fuel damage will occur .
Now that is a hot idea whose time has come !
The HTR - PM is capable of providing very high quality steam , identical to the steam produced in the most efficient coal fired power plants .
In fact , Jim Holm has suggested that we could short cut the lengthy nuclear plant construction process by replacing boilers in existing steam plants with high temperature pebble beds .
It is one hell of a way to help solve the world ’s most pressing energy challenge – how do we replace the low cost heat that coal provides to enable our modern economy without creating emissions that may overheat our planet ?

When you have a teenager on the rampage , who are you going to turn to ?
In America , parents send their troubled offspring to Jamaica 's Tranquility Bay - a ' behaviour - modification centre ' which charges $ 40,000 a year to ' cure ' them .
Decca Aitkenhead , the first journalist to gain access to the centre in five years , wonders if there is n't too high a price to pay
Were you to glance up from the deserted beach below , you might mistake Tranquility Bay for a rather exclusive hotel .
The statuesque white property stands all alone on a sandy curve of southern Jamaica , feathered by palm trees , gazing out across the Caribbean Sea .
You would have to look closer to see the guards at the wall .
Inside , 250 foreign children are locked up .
Almost all are American , but though kept prisoner , they were not sent here by a court of law .
Their parents paid to have them kidnapped and flown here against their will , to be incarcerated for up to three years , sometimes even longer .
They will not be released until they are judged to be respectful , polite and obedient enough to rejoin their families .
Parents sign a legal contract with Tranquility Bay granting 49 per cent custody rights .
It permits the Jamaican staff , whose qualifications are not required to exceed a high - school education , to use whatever physical force they feel necessary to control their child .
The contract also waives Tranquility 's liability for harm that should befall a child in its care .
The cost of sending a child here ranges from $ 25,000 to $ 40,000 a year .
Opened in 1997 , Tranquility Bay is not a boot camp or a boarding school but a ' behaviour modification centre ' for 11 - to 18 - year - olds .
An American Time magazine journalist visited in 1998 , and since then no media have been allowed inside .
With all access denied , there has been little coverage beyond sketchy reports based on hearsay - even the local community knows almost nothing of what goes on .
My discovery of Tranquility Bay came only by accident in 2000 , while living nearby , and all my approaches since then were , like every other media request , firmly rejected .
The owner is an American called Jay Kay .
He does n't trust the media , because ' they go for sensationalist stuff .
Nothing has really presented things in a way that is factual . '
On the other hand , he believes anyone who saw inside Tranquility would support and admire it , and blames criticism on ignorance .
So Kay has been in a dilemma .
His business is expanding , and he is turning his attention to the UK , for he believes there is a large untapped market of British parents who would ship their children straight off to Jamaica if only they knew about Tranquility .
The British government , too , he hopes , might send him children in its care .
' If social services was interested , at $ 2,400 a month I bet they can't offer our services for that .'
This spring he decided to grant me and a photographer unprecedented , exclusive access .
If he did n't like the result , ' Hell will freeze over before anyone gets in here again . '
The first impression once inside Tranquility Bay 's perimeter walls is of disconcerting quiet .
Students are moved around the property in silence by guards in single file , 3ft apart - a complicated operation , because girls and boys must be kept segregated at all times , forbidden to look at one another .
Tranquility has a language of its own .
The vocabulary is recognisable , but its use has been delicately customised , so that boys are ' males ' , girls ' females ' , and they are all divided into single - sex ' families ' of about 20 .
The families have names such as Dignity , Triumph and Wisdom , and are led by a staff member known as the ' family mother ' or ' father ' , addressed by the children as Mum or Dad .
The 200 staff are all Jamaican .
Along with multiple guards known as ' chaperones ' , the family mothers and fathers control and scrutinise their children 24 hours a day .
The only moment a student is alone is in a toilet cubicle ; but a chaperone is standing right outside the door , and knows what he or she went in to do , because when students raise their hand for permission to go , they must hold up one finger for ' a number one ' , and two for ' a number two ' .
Corporal punishment is not practised , but staff administer ' restraint ' .
Officially it is deployed as the name suggests , to subdue a student who is out of control .
However , former students say it is issued more often as a punishment .
One explains : ' It 's a completely degrading , painful experience .
You could get it for raising your voice or pointing your finger .
You know you 're going to get it when three Jamaicans walk in and say , " Take off your watch . "
They pin you down in a five - point formation and that 's when they start twisting and pulling your limbs , grinding your ankles . '
Before sending their teen to Tranquility , parents are advised that it might be prudent to keep their plan a secret , and employ an approved escort service to break the news .
The first most teenagers hear of Tranquility is therefore when they are woken from their beds at home at 4 am by guards , who place them in a van , handcuffed if necessary , drive them to an airport and fly them to Jamaica .
The child will not be allowed to speak to his or her parents for up to six months , or see them for up to a year .
Let us say you are a new female assigned to Challenger family .
You sleep with your family in one bare room , on beds which are pieces of wood on hinges hung on the walls .
The day begins with a chaperone shouting at you to get up .
You put on your uniform and flip - flops ( harder to run away in ) in silence and fold your bed against the wall .
The room is now completely bare .
After performing chores , the family is ordered to line up , for your family mother to do a head count .
You are walked to a classroom to watch an ' EG ' - a 30 - minute video intended to promote ' emotional growth ' - on a theme such as why you should n't smoke .
Then the family is lined up , counted and walked to the canteen to eat a plate of boiled cabbage and fish in silence while listening to an ' inspirational tape ' broadcast loudly through the room , urging you to , for example , eat healthily .
' If 70 - 80 per cent of the food you eat is not water rich , what you are doing is clogging your body .
Eat 80 per cent water - rich food .
Try it for the next 10 days .
Watch what happens to your body .
It will blow your mind . '
Students have no choice in what they eat - there is a seven - day plan of basic Jamaican meals which never changes , and eating less than 50 per cent of any dish is forbidden .
Morning routines vary between families .
Some shower ( three minutes , cold water ) , others wash clothes ( outside , in buckets , cold water ) , or exercise ( walk round the yard ) .
At 9.30 am , each family is moved into a classroom for two hours .
You continue the US high - school curriculum where you left off at home , but there is no teaching .
Watched by chaperones , you read prescribed course books , take notes , then sit a test after each chapter .
Two or three Jamaican teachers sit at the back of the room in case you get stuck , and they may be able to help .
But to mark the tests , they have to use an answer key sent down from the States .
After lunch and another inspirational tape come three further hours of school , a second EG , plus an educational video about a historical figure of note .
There is a sports period , a family meeting , a final meal with tape , followed by a period called Reflections , when you must write down what you have memorised from the tapes and EGs .
You may also write home to your parents , and though staff can read your mail , you may write what you like .
But Tranquility 's handbook for parents warns them not to believe anything that sounds like a ' manipulation ' , the programme 's word for a complaint .
There is no free time , and you are never alone .
At 10 pm everyone is in bed for Shut Down ; the lights go off , and Tranquility is silent , save for waves crashing on to the beach below .
Chaperones watch you through the night .
And the next day is exactly the same .
As is the next , and the next .
' Yep , identical , ' says Kay .
' Exactly identical .
Now you see , ' he adds , with a grim nod of satisfaction , ' why kids are not happy here . '
Tranquility Bay is one of 11 facilities affiliated to an organisation in Utah called the World Wide Association of Speciality Programs .
The facilities are located in the States and Caribbean region , and although independently owned , all run the same programme , devised by Wwasp .
Jay Kay is 33 years old , and the son of Wwasp 's chief director .
He opened the facility at the age of 27 , after four years as administrator of a Wwasp - run juvenile psychiatric hospital in Utah .
Previously he had been a night guard there , and before that a petrol - pump attendant , having dropped out of college .
He has no qualifications in child development , but considers this unimportant .
' Experience in this job is better than any degree .
Am I an educational expert ?
No .
But I know how to hire people to get the job done . '
There is more than a touch of the Jerry Springer guest about his looks - heavy , shaven - headed , colourless , and a similarly deadening certainty of mind .
' I 've got the best job in the world , ' he claims , but he carries himself like a man who has learnt to expect the worst , and is seldom disappointed .
Tranquility is basically a private detention camp .
But it differs in one important respect .
When courts jail a juvenile , he has a fixed sentence and may think what he likes while serving it , whereas no child arrives at Tranquility with a release date .
Students are judged ready to leave only when they have demonstrated a sincere belief that they deserved to be sent here , and that the programme has , in fact , saved their life .
They must renounce their old self , espouse the programme 's belief system , display gratitude for their salvation , and police fellow students who resist .
A finely engineered reward - and - punishment system has been designed to effect this change .
In order to graduate , students must advance from level 1 to 6 , which they do by earning points .
Every aspect of their conduct is graded daily and as their score accumulates , they climb through the levels and acquire privileges .
On level 1 , students are forbidden to speak , stand up , sit down or move without permission .
When they have earnt enough points to reach level 2 , they may speak without permission ; on level 3 , they are granted a ( staff - monitored ) phone call home .
Levels 4 , 5 and 6 enjoy significantly higher status .
In addition to enjoying privileges , such as ( strictly limited and approved ) clothing , jewellery , music and snacks , they are employed for three days a week as a member of staff , and must discipline other students by issuing ' consequences ' .
Every time a member of staff or upper - level student feels a student has broken a rule , they ' consequence ' them by deducting points .
Rule - breaking is classified into categories of offence .
A ' Cat 1 ' offence , ie rolling your eyes , is consequenced by a modest loss of points .
A ' Cat 3 ' offence , eg swearing , costs a significant number , and may drop the student 's score beneath their current level 's threshold , thus demoting them and removing privileges .
' You know , ' offers Kay , 'if people want to talk about the length of the programme , it 's up to the child .
If a parent wonders why their kid is here so long , well gee , we are doing our part , maybe you need to ask your little Joey why he is not moving forward .
Everyone knows how to earn the points .'
The strategy of coercing children to rewire themselves is the concept Kay is most proud of , for he believes it places troubled teenagers ' redemption in their own hands .
The choice is theirs .
' For years , we just believed if you make the kids do what you want them to do , then they will make the change .
But what we figured out was , why not get them to come to the conclusion that they need to make the change themselves ?
That 's what makes this programme special .
It 's up to them . '
Students who fail to grasp this formula are forcefully encouraged to get the message .
One girl currently has to wear a sign around her neck at all times , which reads : ' I 've been in this programme for three years , and I am still pulling crap . '
When most children first arrive they find it difficult to believe that they have no alternative but to submit .
In shock , frightened and angry , many simply refuse to obey .
This is when they discover the alternative .
Guards take them ( if necessary by force ) to a small bare room and make them ( again by force if necessary ) lie flat on their face , arms by their sides , on the tiled floor .
Watched by a guard , they must remain lying face down , forbidden to speak or move a muscle except for 10 minutes every hour , when they may sit up and stretch before resuming the position .
Modest meals are brought to them , and at night they sleep on the floor of the corridor outside under electric light and the gaze of a guard .
At dawn they resume the position .
This is known officially as being ' in OP ' - Observation Placement - and more casually as ' lying on your face ' .
Any level student can be sent to OP , and it automatically demotes them to level 1 and zero points .
Every 24 hours , students in OP are reviewed by staff , and only sincere and unconditional contrition will earn their release .
If they are unrepentant ?
' Well , they get another 24 hours . '
One boy told me he 'd spent six months in OP .
I did n't think this could be true , but it transpired this was not even exceptional .
' Oh no , ' says Kay .
' The record is actually held by a female . '
On and off , she spent 18 months lying on her face .
' The purpose of observation , ' Kay offers , 'is to give the kids a chance to think .
Hopefully , it 's giving the kids a chance to reflect on the choices they 've made . '
And indeed it is often in OP that a student decides to stop fighting .
In this respect , OP works .
In fact , the success rate of OP can be understood as a perfect distillation of Tranquility Bay 's ideology .
If your son is willfully disrespectful , the most loving gift a parent can give him is incarceration in an environment so intolerable that he will do anything to get out - where ' anything ' means surrendering his mind to authority .
' I say to the parents , ' says Kay , leaning back in his office seat .
' The bottom line is , what 's the end result you want ?
Getting there may be ugly , but at least with us you 're going to get there . '
An autopsy was recently performed on a deceased 115 year old woman who left her body to science at age 82 .
Her brain showed almost no evidence of Alzheimer 's disease .
The finding suggests Alzheimer 's disease and other forms of dementia are not inevitable , as had been suspected .
" Our observations suggest that , in contrast to general belief , the limits of human cognitive function may extend far beyond the range that is currently enjoyed by most individuals , " said lead researcher Gert Holstege , a neuroscientist at the University Medical Center Groningen , in The Netherlands .
The results are detailed in the August issue of the journal Neurobiology of Aging .
This finding underscores the need for individuals to take proactive action to manage their cognitive fitness .
Holstege is a leader in imaging and analyzing the orgasmic brain of both men and women .

Let me start by saying while reading The Annotated Turing : A Guided Tour through Alan Turing ’s Historic Paper on Computability and the Turing Machine I encountered two other reviews worth note .
The first review by Jeff Atwood focused on Alan Turing ’s personal life as a gay man in the first half of the 1900 ’s and is light on reviewing the actual text of Turing .
The second review is by Deirdre Sinnott and does cover the text in depth , but one must carry a certain level skepticism ( however undue ) toward Deirdre given her relationship to Petzold .
I must also alert the reader to my own bias , as I have written well of Petzold in the past and was sent a ( signed ) copy of Turing .
I did however purchase the book before I knew a copy was being sent to me .
For the impatient , busy , or otherwise opposed to reading what has become a lengthy review , I will save you the investment of time by saying now I highly enjoyed this book and would strongly recommend it to any programmer , mathematician , or person with an interest for numbers .
I will qualify this recommendation with the disclaimer that if you do not have the time to devote to reading the remainder of this review , you may not have the time needed to read and understand the book ’s content .
I found myself only able to read 10 - 20 pages a night of this scant 359 page book due to the amount of mental engagement demanded by the subject matter ; which only worked to increase my enjoyment .
Before we get into the content of the book however , let us take a moment to understand the actors involved …
Alan Turing is our hero in this tale , a brilliant young man who leads a troubled life and finds refuge in a love for numbers .
Our narrator , Charles Petzold , shares a great many things in common with Turing , including this love of numbers and the mind to process these numbers in complex ways .
I have read many of Petzold ’s books on Microsoft Windows programming and one constant is that his examples often use calculus or trigonometry equations in a way that the example itself teaches as much on mathematics as the API the text covers .
Mathematics and computers , I ’m learning , are tied much closer together than most would assume .
The last character is myself , the reader , who poses only a basic understanding of college level mathematics ( enough to meet CS requirements ) and who once wrote a two page mathematical paper that was , in the words of the professor , " an amazing level of insight and effort , but 100 % flawed and incorrect " .
I mention this because while I was not able to understand every formula and proof covered in Turning , this did not detract from my understanding of its significance to the material .
The events in Turing surround Turing ’s paper " On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem . "
I will probably offend true mathematicians with the following explanation of the Entscheidungsproblem ( and again later in this review ) , but simply put the Entscheidungsproblem asks for a set of steps one can use to determine if a given formula has a solution ( but not what that solution might be ) .
Consider A² +
B² = C² , which we know is true because we can plug in 3 , 4 , and 5 and see that it works .
What about A³ + B³ = C³ ?
Before we start trying some random numbers it would be nice to know if there even is a solution – and this is what the Entscheidungsproblem is all about .
( My method would be to try some random numbers , I ’m sure a mathematician would start with a much more reasonable and fruitful approach . )
Turing proved that no , there is not a universal method for determining if a given formula has a solution .
Turing was not the first to prove this : 6 weeks before Turing ’s paper was published in 1936 , Alonzo Church published a paper that also proved there was no method for the Entscheidungsproblem .
Turing ’s solution was so novel and unique in it ’s approach however , that it has the rare honor of also being published , and Turning added a proof to his paper that both methods are equivalent .
Truth .
To normal folk truth has a somewhat soft definition , but to mathematicians truth has strong and rigid meaning .
You may know something to be true simply through common sense , but in the world of mathematics something must be proven in concrete formula before it can be accepted as true ; until then it remains unproven and will not even be considered worthy of assumption of truth in all but the most extreme cases .
To tackle the truth of the Entscheidungsproblem , Turning invented ( on paper ) a machine that could read a sequence of commands that expressed a method to calculate number and print it as the result .
This allowed Turing to work with numbers like π without needing to calculate the exact value ( something no easier in 2008 than it was in 1936 ) .
Further , Turing devised a method to give every possible sequence of commands a unique number , called a Description Number , or DN .
The DN for a machine that computed π might be DN 314,257 .
Last ,
Turing invented a machine that could be given a DN and generate the sequence of commands that DN represented , then pass this sequence off to another machine to calculate the result .
Turing ’s machines worked in binary , i.e. 0 ’s and 1’s only , so Turning then proved it was not possible given a DN to determine if the calculation machine would ever print a 0 as a result of calculation , thus proving there was no universal method to determine if a given formula had a solution .
Just reciting the list of actors and events does n’t convey the story , we must also discuss the meaning and impact .
Much of The Annotated Turing is true to the title ; Petzold presents the unmodified original Turing paper and provides annotations to help understand the material , while also citing related material and events .
In this capacity , Petzold is unsurpassed – the bibliography for Turing cites over 90 books and papers ( including a humble citation of Petzold ’s own Code ) and one is given the impression Petzold read many more books not cited .
Petzold ’s greatest contributing to Turing ’s work comes at the end however , when he explores the impact Turing had on the fields of mathematics , computer science , and philosophy .
Any developer reading above recognized that Turing machines are computers running programs .
What may not have been obvious is that Turing ’s proof also means that no program can be written that will determine the output of another program .
That we cannot break this limitation , and our new platforms , languages , and computers will " at best [ … ] only do jobs faster . "
The philosophic impact is far greater , for we humans qualify as Turing machines .
Other philosophers and mathematicians have come very close to a proof that the universe is fundamentally digital , can be expressed as 0’s and 1’s , and qualifies as a Turing machine .
If true , this abandons our romantic notions of free will , for as a Turing machine in a digital universe our actions are calculable .
Our perception of free will is merely the misunderstanding of the inability to predict the output of our own Turing machine , the mind .
I do not assert I ’ve laid out a solid argument in the above paragraph – for that you ’ll need to read Turing and possibly the references cited by Petzold .
Having just finished Turing hours before writing this review , and being a person who has rejected the idea of fate , I ’m still a little uneasy myself .
It ’s as if Alan Turing sat next to me on the airplane and said , " Oh fate ?
It exists , I have a mathematical proof here somewhere in my backpack I did last summer when I had some spare time . "
At least I do n’t have to tell the major religions of the world I was wrong about them too …
Last , I ’d like to mention that in planning for CodeSock this summer , we were able to get Wiley Publishing ( publisher of Turing ) as a supporter .
I requested and was granted 5 copies of The Annotated Turing to give away at the end of the conference .
BitTorrent is without a doubt the best way to share large files , as long as you follow some basic rules , that is .
We asked one of the leading BitTorrent client developers for some tips and tricks so you can speed up your BitTorrent downloads .
There are several ways to optimize your BitTorrent download speeds .
One of the easiest ways is to join a private torrent tracker , but there are others .
Since there ’s always a lot of debate about what works and what does n’t , we decided to ask an expert to share his thoughts with us .
Olivier Chalouhi , developer and CTO of Vuze ( formerly known as Azureus ) was kind enough to give us some of his own tips and tricks .
Since Olivier was the person who initiated the Azureus Open Source project in 2003 , which went on to create one of the most popular BitTorrent clients ever , if anyone knows how to get the best out of your torrent client , he does .
Here are some of Olivier ’s tips for optimizing your torrent download speeds .
There tips work with every BitTorrent client , except for the last one .
1. Seed .
Downloading speeds will be sub-optimal for everyone unless everyone plays their part and seeds .
Private tracker sites are a great example of how the overall speed of the swarm increases when everyone is seeding and downloading in equal measure .
So , play your part in seeding and tell others to as well .
2 . Be connectable .
Make sure you ’re not “ firewalled ” by opening up your incoming ports or by enabling UPnP in your router , otherwise you ’ll be leaving bandwidth on the table .
3 . Manage your upload speed .
It is all about striking a balance .
You do n’t want the upload speed to be too high , nor do you want it to be too low .
Ideally you want to set your upload speed to be 80 % of the maximum possible line speed .
TF note : Want an easy life ?
Try this handy settings calculator , works for all clients
4 . Select the right torrents .
Your download will be faster if you choose to download a torrent where there is a good balance of seeds and peers .
For instance , Vuze ranks its search results according to the number of seeds and peers to make this easier .
5 . Be realistic .
Check the swarm average and if you ’re already above average , then you just need to be patient .
If you ’re below average , go back and check some of these other things I ’ve mentioned .
6. Get a Friend Boost .
I would n’t be a Vuze developer if I did n’t give a plug for the Friend Boost feature we recently developed :) .
When you create a network of Friends on Vuze , you agree to seed content to each other on a preferential basis .
That is , if one of your friends has a torrent that you want , you will be able to directly use a portion of their bandwidth to get it .
In most cases this will increase your download speed .
Obviously , ways in which to actually implement some of these tips will differ from client to client .
If you want to find out how to do it on Vuze , you can check out our wiki .
It ’s official – China has officially overtaken the United States as the world ’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) .
In 2007 , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said that it expected China to exceed the U.S. by the end of the year , but a new Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency study reported by the New York Times says that China ’s 2007 CO 2 emissions were 14 % higher than the U.S. ’ , and that China ’s emissions expanded by 8 % from 2006 .
This is why environmentalist organizations and other parties concerned about global heating around the world are calling on China to be part of whatever follow - on agreement replaces the Kyoto Protocol .
However , that being said , the story also points out that the U.S. per capita emissions are way , way higher than China ’s – 19.4 tons vs. 5.1 tons per capita respectively .
The NYTimes article says that Russia ’s and the EU ’s emission per person are 11.8 and 8.6 tons respectively .
This tells us two things .
First , if China is planning on having a standard of living roughly equal to Europe ’s , then China ’s emissions are likely going to rise at least another 70 % before they start falling as the EU ’s emissions are supposed to .
That ’s huge .
Second , it means that Americans are going to have to figure out how to do everything we do today with less than half of the CO 2 emissions we currently have , or we ’ll have to accept that our economy and culture are going to undergo a massive collapse .
Both are Bad Things™ .

Nuclear advocates ( disclosure : I am one ) often claim that nuclear power generates no greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) .
This is true , but only on a very limited basis – the nuclear reaction that leads to the generation of electricity releases no GHGs .
Unfortunately , mining uranium ore , refining it and separating usable U283 from it ’s largely useless U235 isotopic cousin , and then reprocessing or storing the waste are all energy - intensive , and so hardly GHG - free .
Even so , though , IPS News reported last week that the IEA has called for the construction of 1,400 new nuclear power plants between now and 2050 .
This would be more than three times as many plants than are operating today and would require massive new uranium mining operations .
According to the article , though , the IEA proposal has been met with downright hostility from some of the environmental community ( such as Greenpeace and , as quoted in the article , the German Green Party ) for one main reason – 1,400 new reactors would require spent nuclear fuel to be reprocessed into new fuel , and that ’s both an environmental nightmare and a potential proliferation problem .
It ’s also vital if nuclear power is going to be a bridge technology .
The question is whether alternative technologies can be commercialized fast enough to make wide - scale nuclear generation unnecessary .
And that ’s a question that the utilities , governments , utilities , and citizens will determine over the coming years .

According to the AFP , the Jason 2 oceanographic satellite will be launched tomorrow from Vandenberg Air Force Base .
Jason 2 will orbit with the Jason 1 satellite and track sea level rise along with ocean surface topography .
Beyond determining the effects and locations of sea level rise , mapping the surface of the ocean aids in the detection of El Nino / La Nina events , the accurate mapping of oceanic currents , and estimating the future strength of tropical cyclones .
And , for a space geek like me , it ’s just plain cool .

Back in March , the Weekly Carboholic reported on a paper that indicated there had been no observed oceanic heating since 2003 , and that the scientists involved with the ARGO system that took the data were at a loss to explain why .
One of the possible causes was an undetected systemic bias to the data that was yet to be removed .
A new study reported by The Canberra Times points to a new analysis of ocean temperature data since 1961 that discovered just such a bias in the data .
It turns out that the “ expendable bathythermograph ” devices had manufacturing flaws that led to them systematically mis-measuring the depth to which they ’d plunged as they were taking temperature measurements .
The researchers were able to correct or minimize the bias in literally millions of temperature measurements since 1961 .
The corrected data has revealed that the oceanic temperature and sea level rise climate models have been underestimating oceanic heating and that actual measured heating and thermal expansion has been underestimated by over 50 % .

Scientists have begun to suspect that radical changes in climate have been at least partly responsible for most of the mass extinctions throughout the history of the Earth .
Whether triggered by cometary or asteroidal impact , the eruption of massive volcanoes , or wild shifts in the sun ’s output and the Earth ’s Milankovich cycles , the end result has been a radically altered climate that the majority of species alive at the time cannot adapt to .
But for the first time a scientist has suggested that changes in sea level is the driving factor , not the climate change .
According to an AFP article in the Independent Online ( IOL ) , geologist and sole study author Shanan Peters of the University of Wisconsin - Madison discovered that the last five mass extinctions all correlated with massive changes in sea level , including the suspected impact that corresponds to the extinction of the dinosaurs .
Peters appears to suggest that it ’s the flooding or exposure of new land due to sea level changes that cause mass extinctions .
While it ’s true that the flooding caused by rising sea levels would flood entire regions and likely drive local species to extinction , it ’s fair to ask whether the correlation between that extinction means that it ’s the sea level rise itself that is ultimately the causative event .
For example , when tectonic forces lifted the Isthmus of Panama out of the ocean , it cut the Atlantic off from the Pacific and totally reshuffled oceanic currents around the globe – should we blame the currents for causing extinctions , or the rise of the Isthmus of Panama ?
If the dinosaurs were wiped out by a comet , the impact itself probably did n’t kill most of them , the resulting ( likely ) centuries - long cold snap is what did the killing , but does that mean we blame the radically colder climate for the extinction , or do we blame the comet or asteroid that likely caused the cold in the first place ?
In my opinion , it ’s fair to say that there was correlation between changes in sea level and mass extinctions , if Summers did actually find such a correlation .
But given how the ocean is more reactive to the environment around it ( atmospheric temperature , tidal effects , solar heating , etc. ) than causative , I believe that it ’s far more likely that the changes in climate and geology that drove sea level changes are the actual causative agents in those mass extinctions .
Afghanistan , Ghowr Province : an opium village
[ Ed. note : Connor O’Steen writes of going to an opium village in Afghanistan ’s Ghowr province to do the necessary research to admit Nasim to the orphanage in Chaghcharan . ]
First the roads .
They were dirt the entire way and I was expecting this , but I had also figured that they would have been purposefully made , smoothed over even to facilitate the transfer of people from point A to point B. Silly me .
The roads were the natural result of cars following the same path over and over .
We drove in the ruts that had been imprinted by heavier trucks and , from time to time , our car ’s tires scraped against the sides of the ruts , bouncing us from side to side .
At first I imagined it was like being on a particularly cloying rollercoaster .
Then I imagined it was like being inside a pinata .
Then I stopped imagining things .
I sat in the back seat , sandwiched between the principal of the [ Chaghcharan ] orphanage and Reese , Marnie ’s son .
Somehow , in a way I ’ll never be able to fathom , Reese managed to doze through the unrelenting turbulence , waking only briefly when the bumps in the road knocked his head hard against my shoulder .
The principal just looked carsick , and stared out the window .
In the trunk was Nasim , who had decided to come along to see his family and village for what was almost surely the last time .
I was impressed by the scenery .
Just like in the airplane ride over , I got the sense that the hills around us were an endless expanse .
Cresting each ridge showed more of the same , and the further east we went , the steeper the slopes became , until off in the distance they blended into proper rock - faced , dry , barren looking mountains .
There was an unsettling sense of deja vu as we drove on .
The landscape was so unchanging that time bent .
Two hours could have been five , or it could have been 30 minutes .
Whenever I looked at my watch , I forgot what time it had been before .
As we got close , the road got narrower until our car could barely squeeze along the track cut out of a steep , inclined slope .
In front of us on the road , men and boys drove donkeys out of our way , whipping them roughly with thin canes and staring at us like we were in an armored convoy rather than a beat up SUV .
Whenever we slowed down , the cloud of dust that we kicked up in our wake surrounded the car and streamed through the open windows .
We wrapped the scarves we wore around our faces , and by the time we got there we looked like we ’d showered in dust .
Now the village .
I stretched my legs , rarely having been happier to get out of a car , and looked around at the houses .
Some of them lay in the valley below , where a thin river snaked its way west , but the majority were mud houses built into the side of the hill –seemingly held there by additional mud that provided a ledge underneath .
There was a breeze .
It was nice .
The weather and vegetation reminded me of home .
Then the people .
A man and his son approached us , and I was struck by his features .
He had light brown hair , stubble instead of a beard , a square jaw and very white teeth .
He would n’t have looked out of place in the United States or ( I imagine ) Spain or Italy .
He greeted Nasim like he had n’t been gone for a year , but had just stepped out for an afternoon .
Yasin and the principal of the orphanage stopped and talked with him , and it was then that I started to feel uneasy .
I ’m still not sure what was said , exactly .
Yasin translated bits and pieces for us reluctantly , but I was shocked to find how , even in a situation where I could n’t understand what was being said , I could still feel that something was–very deeply , very fundamentally –wrong .
It was the way the man with the white teeth reacted –there was something superficial about his movements , his smile was strange and the way he looked at all of us was like he was just staring , like there was no seeing or recognition involved .
We sat for a while in the shade of the trees .
Yasin would say something , receive an answer , shrug , and look out at the river .
Before long we were ushered into a low room that had a carpeted floor , walls , and ceiling .
It was on the way there that we saw the dried poppies , and it was the first and only time I ’ve felt afraid on this trip .
It was n’t a panicked fear , or a strong one , just a gnawing feeling that sat in my gut and made me go over the worst scenarios again and again .
We were isolated , I did n’t think our phone was working , these people almost certainly knew what they were growing was illegal .
And here we were , sitting in a room lousy with flies , stuffy with heat , and listening to these poppy farmers tell lying versions of Nasim ’s story .
Again , I got the unshakeable sense that something was very profoundly flawed in these people .
The way they laughed , the way they acted normally when telling Nasim ’s ordeal , the glazed over way they looked at us , and the way Yasin responded in turn showed their disconnect from reality .
I was struck with the conviction that these people were acting , that they had somehow lost any kind of emotional direction and simply spoke out of custom , out of habit rather than thought , rather than empathy .
The more they talked , the more I thought that , inside , they had rotted away .
Yasin was the first to express what we all felt , he turned to us saying , “ I feel sick here . ”
And it was true .
During the rough ride I ’d felt tired but fine ; here I felt nauseous and claustrophobic .
I realized gradually that the claustrophobia was n’t just the room , it was socially suffocating .
These people , shorn of any kind of deeper reality , made me physically ill .
We sat there for at least an hour .
There was a window facing west and I stared through it and tried to imagine myself zooming home across oceans and mountains .
I tried to picture the oak tree at my house , the sunroom and screen door , the mailbox , but the tide of nausea made it too hard to concentrate .
Finally word came that Nasim ’s mother and father would n’t see us .
We could take Nasim and officially put him in the orphanage .
We got out as fast as we could ( which was n’t that fast , because turning the car around on that narrow track was difficult ) and drove west , chasing a bright afternoon sun .
I looked out the window at the rolling hills , and smelled the air .
I do n’t think I ’ve ever been more relieved to leave somewhere .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- National U.S. home prices fell a record 15.4 % in the second quarter compared with last year , according to a report released Tuesday .
The latest S&P / Case - Shiller national home price index is down 18.2 % from its peak in the second quarter of 2006 , and there are no signs that the pace of home - price declines is easing .
The second - quarter loss was even larger than the record 14.2 % drop posted in the first three months of 2008 .
Both the Case - Shiller 10 - city index ( down 17 % ) and 20 - city index ( down 15.9 % ) also posted record year - over - year losses in the second quarter .
A small piece of good news :
In June the pace of monthly declines slowed ever so slightly compared with May .
Prices for the 10 - city index declined 16.9 % year - over - year and the 20 - city index was down 15.8 % .
Too much inventory
" While there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices , it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back , which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level , " said David Blitzer , chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor 's , in a statement .
Still , all 20 cities covered by Case - Shiller are in negative territory for the past 12 months , said Mike Larson , a real estate analyst with Weiss Research .
" [ The moderation ] is not good news , " he said .
" It 's just a little less bad . "
And with mortgage loans difficult for many home buyers to obtain and foreclosure rates still rising , inventories of homes for sale continue to expand , depressing home prices .
There is now an 11.2 month supply of existing homes on the market .
" The inventory problem has not been solved , " said Larson .
Peter Schiff , president and chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital , said the market is only about halfway to its bottom .
In 2005 , he predicted the then - coming bust would cut 30 % off national home prices .
Losses will continue because there has been no fundamental change in markets , he said .
Despite abundant foreclosure sales , inventories are still growing and lending availability is still shrinking .
And , people are not inclined to buy in a falling market .
They wait for it to hit bottom .
" If prices fall another 20 % , that 's the time to buy , " said Schiff .
Hardest hit
The worst performing city in the index was Las Vegas , where prices plunged 28.6 % year - over - year , followed by Miami , down 28.3 % , and Phoenix , down 27.9 % .
In June , Phoenix prices dropped 2.6 % from May , the largest decline of any city in the index .
Denver and Boston were winners for the month , with home prices climbing 1.5 % and 1.2 % , respectively .
Prices have risen in both markets for three consecutive months .
Charlotte and Dallas , both up 1 % , have recorded four straight months of gains
The lower - priced homes are posting the biggest price declines , according to Blitzer .
One reason : Lending abuses were much more common low - priced homes during the boom .
" There was more speculative lending in inexpensive homes , " he said .
He cited San Francisco , where the price of inexpensive homes has fallen more than 40 % from the peak , while moderate priced homes were off 30 % , and expensive homes fell just over 10 % .
" That 's a dramatic spread , " said Blitzer .
Still , Larson of Weiss Research said he believes that while year - over - year prices will continue to decline , sales of foreclosed homes will help moderate those losses by taking rock - bottom priced homes off of the market .
" Prices have fallen so much that you 're starting to see sales improvement , " he said .
" People are snapping up a lot of distressed properties . "

I liked working night shifts , because whenever they were awake , I wanted to apologize to them .
When they were sleeping , I did n't have to worry about that .
I could just walk up and down the blocks all night long .
There was usually one detainee who would lead the call to prayer at five in the morning .
That person was in the very last cell .
The detainees , they sang beautifully .
It was so eerie to hear , because it was such a beautiful song , and to hear forty - eight detainees just get up in the morning and , in unison , sing this gorgeous song that I could never understand — because Arabic is way out of my range of possibility — it was really intense .
Camp Delta is on a cliff that overlooks the ocean .
I had never been to the ocean before in my whole life .
There have been a few times in the military when I 've been so stricken by the juxtaposition of how awful what is happening inside the moment is , and how aesthetically beautiful it is at the same time .
Seeing the first couple detainees start preparing for prayer , and then at the same time the sun starting to come up over this cliff base — that was probably one of the most confusing moments of my life .
Every day you walked down the blocks , forty - eight people in two rows of twenty - four cells , and you have no idea what any of them are there for .
They 're just sitting in their cells .
You give them food , and if they get crazy , you spray them with this terrible oil - based chemical .
Then you send these five guys in to beat the shit out of them .
I grew up in Charlotte , Michigan .
This was the first time that I ever met any Muslim person before in my life .
My family lived in a trailer in a cornfield on a dirt road .
I enlisted when I was seventeen , on November 20 , 2001 .
Oh , my God , I met a lot of new people by enlisting .
I had bought two pornos before I left for Cuba , and I had no idea that I would get so depressed that those would n't even interest me .
I ended up cutting them up , and I put the remnants of the pornos all over my wall .
I made a wallpaper on my half of the room of all these like really grotesque pornographic photos .
My mom had sent me a packet of dinosaur stickers , so all of the particularly obscene shots I covered with dinosaurs , and I would just sit and stare at that for a long time .
During the span of a few months , I worked maybe half the time on the blocks .
It was n't a whole lot of time , but it was really starting to break me down .
I could n't deal with it .
I tied a 550 cord to the ceiling fan that was in my room and I tried to hang myself , but I ripped the fan out of the ceiling .
I 've never been happier about poor construction .
That was about two months before we went home .
One thing I miss is the cups .
The detainees were only allowed to have Styrofoam cups , and they would write and draw all over them .
I 'm not totally familiar with Muslim culture , but I did learn that they do n't draw the human form , and I 'm not positive if they draw any creatures , but they draw a lot of flowers .
They would cover the things with flowers .
Then we would have to take them .
It was a ridiculous process .
We would take the cups — as if they were writing some kind of secret message that they were somehow going to throw into the ocean , that would get back to somebody — and send them to our military intelligence .
They would just look at these things and then throw them away .
I used to love those little cups .

Malware authors have created a strain of scareware packages that lifts the name of an infected user from the registry of an infected PC in order to create more convincing scams .
The wife of reader Chris came across the ruse when she used his PC to check on her Hotmail account .
Before she could get onto the website she was confronted by a pop-up message saying " Chris [ surname ] , your computer is infected with a Trojan , you should download this spyware removal tool ( recommended ) " and giving a yes / no option .
" I immediately closed it and am now running a scan to see what is causing this , but what was more concerning , and the reason that I am writing this to you , is that the perp of this malware / spyware / phishing attack has managed to write a program which can check the name that windows is registered to , to make it appear genuine , " Chris told El Reg .
" This seems a really scary prospect to me , and I am IT savvy , but imagine Mr or Miss Average JoeShmo presented with that . "
The malicious behaviour is identical to the Fakeale Trojan first spotted by net security firm Sophos last week .
Carole Theriault , senior security consultant at Sophos , explained that the malware takes the user 's name from the registry in order to craft a tailored warning message .
Fakeale Trojan false alarm
Users who respond to the come - on are taken the the website of an outfit punting a rogue anti-malware product .
They are then told that their PC is infected with malware - even if it is clean - in a bid to frighten them into buying a product identified by Sophos as IE Defender installer .
Goes down badly : results of the scan of a clean machine
Bogus warnings that attempt to trick users into purchasing " anti-malware tools " and have little or no security utility have been around for some time .
The Paleale Trojan only differs in the use of trickery to make the unpalatable scam more convincing . ®

Tallis in Wonderland
Saving Truth
Raymond Tallis asserts the truth about the truth .
Truth has been having a rather hard time in recent decades .
Insults have been hurled at it from left and right .
Truth , we are endlessly told , is relative to perspective , to viewpoint , to ‘ where you ’re coming from ’ .
The most popular versions of such relativism connect truth with power : what counts as true is the world according to those who have the greatest political or institutional clout .
Even the truths of science are less about nature than about discourses that have become dominant for reasons other than their ability to uncover reality .
Nietzsche ’s famous riposte to the positivist claim that there are only facts – that “ there are no such things as facts , only interpretations ” – is a favourite among humanist intellectuals .
Such assaults on the notion of objective truth appear to have a lot going for them , at least if you ’re in a seminar room rather than , say , dealing with a medical emergency or running for a bus .
Some political and historical truths do indeed seem to be spin-dependent .
And in many other circumstances , the selection and even the construction of facts will be influenced by the interests of those who are offering them as ‘ the truth about such - and - such ’ .
Relativism discredits itself , however , when it is generalised to all putative truths .
Ultimately , the assertion that there is no such thing as truly objective truth is self - refuting , if it means anything : for there is no reason why this meta - truth about truth should be immune from its own radical attack on all truths .
Is it true ?
John Gray , whose misanthropic pessimism is always good for a laugh , gives a classic example of a different form of self - refutation when he invokes certain facts about the human condition to justify denying that we can have access to any kind of objective truth .
In Straw Dogs he tells us that since Darwinian science has shown that “ the human mind serves evolutionary success , not truth , ” humankind cannot know the truth , least of all through science .
No prizes for any 12 - year - old who can spot the problem with that assertion .
There are more interesting attacks on the concept of truth .
By far the most important and influential come from within analytical philosophy .
These are the so - called ‘ deflationary ’ or ‘ minimalist ’ accounts that empty truth of content or reduce it to a formal relation .
The grandfather of contemporary truth - emptiers was the philosopher F.P. Ramsey , a genius who died at the tragically young age of 26 .
Let ‘ p ’ stand for an idea or proposition , such as ‘ porcupines are animals ’ .
Ramsey argued that to assert that ‘ p ’ and to assert that ‘p is true ’ is to assert the same thing .
The concept of truth is therefore redundant .
Since his time , there have been ever more sophisticated variations on this argument – many of them deriving ultimately from the Polish logician Tarski ’s so - called ‘ Semantic Theory of Truth ’ .
For Tarski , truth is a relation between a first - order language and a second - order language .
This sounds complicated , but his classic example shows how simple – and stark – his notion of truth is :
‘ Snow is white ’ is true if and only if snow is white
The apparent predicate ‘ is true ’ about the phrase ‘ snow is white ’ is not really a predicate at all : it merely defines a relationship between a higher order assertion in quotes and a lower order assertion not in quotes .
There are many other minimalist or ‘ deflationary ’ theories of truth – the emptiest of all being the theory that one should n’t have a theory of truth at all , because there is no entity corresponding to the item in question .
( This idea was sometimes espoused by Richard Rorty , when he was not advocating pragmatic theories . )
In this theory , to say of a statement that it is true is merely to give it a ‘ rhetorical pat on the back ’ .
Donald Davidson also spoke of ‘ The Folly of Trying to Define Truth ’ because it had no content .
Even many of those who are not so radically dismissive of truth think that philosophers would be best to avoid discussing it because ‘ truth ’ is an unredeemably muddled part of our linguistic heritage .
Before going on to defend a richer , more substantial idea of truth , it might be a good idea to set aside those aspects of the traditional notion of truth that are indefensible .
Firstly , we should not imagine that ‘ being true ’ is a property of anything , or that ‘ is true ’ is a predicate like ‘ is green ’ .
It is obviously absurd to say of an object or state of affairs that it has the property of being true ( or , indeed , false ) .
A pebble is neither true nor false : it simply is .
Truth and falsehood must relate to assertions about objects or states of affairs .
Truth is not , however , a predicate or property even of the sentences used to make those assertions .
A sentence - type such as ‘ Margaret Thatcher is Prime Minister ’ will be true on some occasions and false on others .
The truth or falsity does not inhere in the sentence – say its sounds , its structure , its mouth of origin – but will depend on the existence of the state of affairs to which it refers .
The conditions for its being true lie in the world beyond the sentence .
The second indefensible notion is that there is something called ‘ The Truth ’ , understood either as a kind a substance in which all true assertions participate or a point at which all truths converge , summate or merge .
The third indefensible assumption is that the whole of truth can be captured in a single aspect of it – such as , say , a correspondence between an assertion and a state of affairs .
At the very heart of truth ( and falsehood , for the possibility of truth and falsehood are born at the same time ) is explicitness .
This is precisely what was overlooked by Ramsey when he thought he had demonstrated the emptiness or redundancy of the notion of truth .
I want to draw your attention to a seemingly unimportant word : ‘ that ’ .
Yes , of course , to assert “ ‘ That p’ is true ” does n’t add much to the assertion ‘ That p ’ because my belief that it is true – or my wish to make you believe that it is true – is implicit in the unadorned assertion ‘ That p ’ .
The assertion of truth is present in both ‘ p ’ and ‘ p is true ’ : they both make explicit , of what is the case , that it is the case .
Aristotle ’s famous definition of truth in Metaphysics 1011 b makes this very clear : ‘ To say of what is that it is , or of what is not that it is not , is true ’ ( italics mine ) .
While a state of affairs is in itself neither true nor false , the statement that it obtains may be either .
This gives us the first two most fundamental aspects of truth : identity and correspondence .
Truth inheres in the identity of the sense ( ie its meaning and reference ) of a sentence used on a particular occasion , with the particular sense of the state of affairs that it picks out .
These two entities which have the same sense – the assertion and the state of affairs asserted in it – consequently correspond to one another .
And their identity is most clearly exemplified in facts .
That is why it is wrong to say , as so many philosophers do , that truth is ‘ correspondence to the facts ’ .
The facts are the identity that underpins the correspondence .
While identity of sense and a consequent correspondence between the bearers of the sense ( typically an assertion and a state of affairs , as above ) lie at the heart of truth , this is not the whole story .
At a higher level – the level of very general statements , of possible events , of theories and laws – truth is not always to be located in a direct correspondence between a particular assertion and the state of affairs it asserts .
While I might check the assertion that my friend is at the front door by going to see if that state of affairs obtains , or ask someone else to check , or look at my CCTV , I do not check most of the truths that enable me to navigate through the planet in this way .
I will very often rely on the assertion being consistent with what I know already , or with what others tell me is already known .
There are more accessible consequences of empirical truths or general laws which enable me rationally to accept or to reject assertions which lie beyond my ability to check for direct correspondence .
This coherence of truths with other truths is evident in everyday life – if I am in Prague at a certain time , I cannot possibly have been seen by someone in London at that time .
It regulates our expectations .
The need for coherence is , however , most fully developed and most obviously to the fore in the truths of science .
Even for science , however , the audit trail ultimately still has to end with correspondence with my experiences , direct or mediated .
An assertion can count as true only if it coheres with other true assertions ; but ultimately the truth of all assertions is underwritten by correspondence .
The final aspect of truth is pragmatic : that which is true is that which ‘ works ’ for us , in the broadest possible sense of the word .
In the case of certain beliefs which are not accessible to empirical testing – for example , religious beliefs or secular ideologies – ‘ truth ’ is almost entirely assimilated to what the William James called pragmatic ‘ cash value ’ , and which evolutionary theorists would call ‘ survival value ’ .
We cannot , however , reduce the difference between all truths and all falsehoods simply to the difference between what works and what does n’t .
If we did , we would still have to explain why some things do and some things do n’t work .
While beliefs may feel true because they ‘ work ’ , ultimately , most of our beliefs that work do so because they are true .
And ultimately that means corresponding to a state of affairs , or a range or pattern of states of affairs .
In short , truth is far from empty , as Davidson claimed ; and the theory of truth is not “ a set of truisms , ” as J.L. Austin said scornfully .
Truth is rich , and the theory of truth complex .
This is precisely what we might expect , as the nature of truth touches on what is most distinctive about us .
Of all the creatures in the universe who experience what is the case , we are the only ones who make explicit what is the case , and assert that it is the case .
We are explicit , or truth - bearing and falsehood - bearing animals , and to see truth truly is to see ourselves truly .

Michael Phelps introduces Chinese children to McDonald's
What would Michael Phelps ' mother think of him pushing junk foods ?
( Natural News )
On the heels of Olympian Michael Phelps ' deal with Kellogg 's to promote sugary breakfast cereals -- a move for which he was widely criticized -- NaturalNews has learned that Phelps is also involved in a deal with McDonald 's to introduce Chinese children to American junk food .
According to Xinhuanet.com , a mainstream news source in China , Michael Phelps is serving as an ambassador for a program sponsored by McDonald 's to bring Chinese children to the Olympics and serve them American fast food .
But keep reading , and see why Michael Phelps may deserve another chance at being a true hero , and why I 've personally volunteered to be his nutrition coach .
Pushing junk foods is an American tradition , it seems .
Introduce a nation to our processed foods and junk foods , and in just one generation , its population will need our high - profit pharmaceuticals and chemotherapy drugs , too .
Because once a nation starts eating American junk foods , degenerative disease is not far behind : Cancer , diabetes , depression , heart disease , Alzheimer 's , osteoporosis , infertility , behavior disorders and a whole lot more .
These are the debilitating health conditions caused by eating fast food and junk food on a regular basis .
( Just ask Morgan Spurlock of . )
Coke , Pepsi , McDonald's ... these are the food industry ambassadors of the United States , it seems , and in my opinion they only bring disease and death to the countries they target .
Olympian Michael Phelps is currently an active participant in this " junk food imperialism " that 's sweeping through China , ensnaring hundreds of millions of children in a junk food diet that may doom many of them to deadly diseases later in life .
Of course , if you ask Coke , Pepsi and McDonald's , all their products are perfectly healthy and there 's no relationship between fast food and poor health .
Perhaps that 's what Michael Phelps believes , too .
But no informed consumer ( or even doctor ) believes that anymore .
It is now common knowledge that sugary soda pop contributes to obesity , diabetes and bone loss .
It is also common knowledge that eating at McDonald 's on a regular basis is extremely unhealthy .
Just look at the nutrition facts on a Big Mac :
An incredible , 10 grams of heart - clogging saturated fat , virtually no fiber and over a thousand milligrams of sodium !
And that does n't even count the fries and Coke that usually accompany it .
If we want to see China become a meat - eating , environment - destroying , health - suppressing , disease - infested cattle - factory abyss like much of America , then rounding up Chinese children and bringing them to McDonald 's is certainly the way to accomplish that .
To see Michael Phelps serving as an ambassador to McDonald 's , actively engaged in recruiting Chinese children to become McDonald 's customers , is downright disturbing .
Sipping sugary sodas , chewing on unhealthful , inhumane meat products and eating French fries loaded with acrylamides is not exactly the kind of habit a champion should encourage in others .
And this does n't even mention the brainwashing and child behavior conditioning pursued by McDonald 's to imprint happiness on children 's impressionable young brains , even while they 're being fed extremely unhealthful foods that may ultimately harm them .
See the picture here of Michael Phelps bringing Chinese children to McDonald 's : Sad , is n't it ?
Here 's an Olympic champion using his fame to recruit innocent Chinese children into an American junk food restaurant .
I guess the only saving point in all this is that when those children need organ transplants later in life , they will have easy access to them thanks to the organ harvesting black market in China which suddenly seems to have a whole lot of kidneys and livers available following the arrest and rounding up of free speech protestors and Falun Gong members .
If Michael Phelps is an ambassador of McDonald 's , in my opinion .
America is the world 's largest exporter of disease , and Michael Phelps appears to be right at the forefront of this effort .
But it 's not too late ... can Phelps redeem himself ?
Keep reading ... Astoundingly , Michael Phelps ' own mother has been teaching nutrition to local schoolchildren at the middle school where she works .
NaturalNews has learned that Phelps ' mother , Deborah Phelps , " ... designed and implemented an interdisciplinary , award - winning nutrition and food science curriculum , created a state - of - the - art food science lab and was a member of a variety of school improvement committees .
" This is reported on the Windsor Mill Middle School website in Baltimore , Maryland , where Deborah Phelps is the Principal of the school .
You can read it yourself here : http://schools.bcps.org/schools/cms/windsor_mill/principal.htmIf
she cares about the health of children , she would likely be outraged at Michael 's actions , but we have n't interviewed Deborah , so we can't say for sure .
What we can say , however , is that Michael Phelps ' promotions of McDonald 's and sugary breakfast cereals directly contradicts his own mother 's publicly - stated nutrition programs designed for schoolchildren .
Then again , Deborah Phelps probably is n't being paid ten million dollars to design healthy food choices for schoolchildren .
She 's simply doing it because she has a professional responsibility to her school 's children and In the next article , I announce my willingness to volunteer as Michael Phelps ' nutritionist , helping him exceed his eight gold medals by preparing for the 2012 Olympics using the world 's most powerful superfoods and nutritional know - how .
With superfoods nutrition boosting his performance to even higher levels , Phelps would truly be the greatest champion in the history of Olympic swimming .

FORT LAUDERDALE
 Republican John McCain said he wo n't try to " separate " himself from a weakened President Bush or his unpopular handling of the war in Iraq to try to win the general election against Barack Obama , who has made opposition to the war a focus of the Democratic campaign .
During an interview Thursday with USA TODAY , McCain also made it clear that he would emphasize his steadiness and experience — particularly on national security issues — to counter the vibrancy and oratory skills that have made Obama a sensation on the campaign trail .
" I believe that people are interested very much in substance , " McCain said .
" If it was simply style , William Jennings Bryan would have been president . "
( Bryan , a noted orator , lost three presidential elections as the Democratic nominee in 1896 , 1900 and 1908 . )
McCain discussed his campaign strategy in broad , general terms but his comments suggest voters will see a significant contrast this fall between the 71 - year - old Arizona senator — a Navy veteran who was a prisoner of war during Vietnam — and Obama , 46 , the first - term senator who has made history as the first person of color to lead a major - party presidential ticket .
The interview came as McCain , who has waited since March for Democrats to resolve their marathon nomination fight , turns his attention to his newly tapped opponent and tries to assuage disaffected conservatives within the Republican Party .
McCain touched on a range of priorities : the need to create more jobs and help Americans deal with a slumping economy , the role of race in the fall campaign and his search for a running mate .
" I eagerly look forward to the contrast between my experience and knowledge and judgment and ( Obama's ) inexperience , " McCain said .
On Tuesday , as Obama claimed enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination , McCain praised him for his " eloquence and spirited campaign " and then proceeded to say the Democrat was too out of touch with Americans and not ready for the White House .
In the interview , McCain continued to focus on what he called Obama 's inexperience , describing him as a novice who believes in " big government " and " does n't understand . "
Americans " did n't find out about me yesterday , " said McCain , who has been in the Senate for 21 years .
" They 're just getting to know Senator Obama , " whom McCain noted was once named the most liberal senator by National Journal magazine .
McCain said he believes the biggest difference between him and Obama is how they view the role of the federal government .
He contends that Obama wants the government to " make decisions that I think individuals , businesses and families should make . "
Obama frequently has criticized McCain as running for Bush 's third term — a slap at ties between the two Republicans , especially on Iraq .
McCain voted in 2002 to give Bush the authority to use military force against Saddam Hussein 's regime , while Obama — who was in the Illinois Legislature at the time — emphasizes that he was against the war from the beginning .
McCain is also a vocal supporter of Bush 's " surge " strategy to temporarily boost U.S. troop levels in Iraq as a way to quell sectarian violence .
McCain says Obama lacks firsthand knowledge of conditions in Iraq because the Illinois senator has not been there since 2006 .
" It 's very clear that the surge is winning this war , " said McCain , whose most recent trip to Iraq was in March .
He said he has no plans to return to Iraq , which he has visited eight times , before the November election .
As for his ties to his onetime rival Bush , McCain stressed that he is not trying to distance himself in the fall to win over independents , who are a key part of the electorate in battlegrounds such as New Hampshire and Oregon .
" I 'm not trying to separate myself , " he said .
" I 'm trying to point out my own record and my own plan of action to solve our housing , energy , economic and national security challenges . "
However , McCain has criticized Bush 's handling of Hurricane Katrina relief as " terrible " and " disgraceful , " vowing never to respond as slowly as Bush did to a natural disaster .
McCain also supports mandatory curbs on carbon emissions as a way to reduce global warming ; Bush prefers industries cut their pollution voluntarily .
McCain acknowledged he has not given much thought to what would legislation he would send to Congress first .
But he said his priority will be to curb federal spending and said " three important aspects " of his campaign will be reform , prosperity and peace .
Among McCain 's other comments :
• On town hall meetings with Obama .
McCain said he pitched his idea of holding joint town hall meetings with Obama on Wednesday , when he called his Democratic rival to congratulate him on securing the delegates needed for nomination .
McCain said Thursday he is still trying to hold an event with Obama next week in New York .
The Obama campaign seemed intrigued by the proposal , and so are others .
" We 're hearing from cities all over America that are saying , ' Come to our city , we 'll make all the arrangements . ' " McCain said .
The campaigns have begun to discuss terms , but neither side has made a commitment .
• On picking a running mate .
McCain said he hopes to settle on one before the GOP convention starts Sept. 1 in St. Paul , but he offered no timetable .
Late last month , the senator met in Arizona with one of his primary rivals , Mitt Romney , and governors Charlie Crist of Florida and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana , but McCain 's campaign said the No. 2 slot on the GOP ticket was n't discussed .
Romney has emerged as one of McCain 's most active supporters and fundraisers , making several TV appearances on McCain 's behalf .
• On campaign finance .
McCain , whose campaign nearly unraveled last summer from money woes , said he has not decided whether to accept about $ 85 million in public financing for the fall campaign .
The senator , author of sweeping changes in 2002 to campaign finance laws aimed at limiting the influence of special interests , has improved his fundraising haul lately but lags far behind Obama , who has set records with his $ 265 million take so far .
McCain has raised about $ 90 million .
These are filled with mozzarella .
They go on the grill .

Truck Trend is talking about GM's and Ford 's inability to spot trends .
Detroit 's automakers might not have been able to predict today 's $ 4 to $ 5 per- gallon gasoline and diesel prices , but sales of truck - based SUVs have been sliding for the past three or four years .
In its heyday , Ford sold something like 450,000 Explorers per year .
Last year , it was about 179,000 .
Last month , Ford sold 8,122 Explorers , which is an annual rate of about 97,000 units .
I 'm guessing it wo n't sell as many as 8 k Explorers this month .
SUV sales have dropped so much that CNW Research 's Art Spinella says finance companies ( I 'm looking at you , GMAC ) , banks , credit unions and independent lessors will lose billions on leased truck - based sport / utilities returned over the next few years because they wo n't meet their residual values .
The tab , he says , will approach $ 4.9 billion in 2008 , $ 5.24 billion in '09 and $ 4.74 billion in ' 10 , thanks to residual values off by more than $ 6,000 per SUV .
That means General Motors , which owns 49 percent of GMAC , will continue to lose money on its non-automotive operations .
It also will affect Chrysler 's private equity owners , Cerberus , which owns the other 51 percent .
SUV And Truck Residuals Plunge
High gas prices and economic uncertainty have hurt sales of large vehicles that have long been the profit centers for the U.S. auto industry .
Recent developments have also wreaked havoc on residual values for pickups and SUVs , which are worth far less than had been assumed just a few months ago .
Stuck holding the bag are dealerships and auto finance companies such as GMAC and CitiFinancial Auto – the auto finance unit of Citigroup .
They ’re trying to sell inventories of thousands of these vehicles as they come off leases , or are repossessed from owners unable to keep up with their car payments .
Dealerships must either cut prices on the used inventory or dump it on the wholesale market , cutting profit margins and pressuring the dealers to lower prices on new pickups and SUVs to pique the interest of consumers .
With vehicle values falling and economic pressures on consumers rising , auto finance companies " are extremely vulnerable " , says Matt Traylen , a senior director of economics and portfolio services at Automotive Lease Guide .
The downward pressure on prices " increases loan - loss severity dramatically , and lenders need to be aware of the potential risks in their portfolio from the severity point of view , " he says .
Hidden Cost Of SUVs
If you thought $ 4 per gallon was a hit to the wallet , wait until hundreds of thousands of off - lease sport / utility vehicles are returned to dealerships .
That 's when the whammy of inflated residual values of off - lease sport / utes will hammer the market .
According to Oregon - based CNW Research , with some 800,000 truck - based sport / utility vehicles coming off lease this year , residual values projected three and four years ago will be missed by as much as $ 6,000 per unit .
Whom will this hurt ?
Those who lend the money -- banks , credit unions , car companies ' captive finance arms and others who write leases -- will face a tab of nearly $ 5 billion just in 2008 .
That number rises to $ 5.24 billion in '09 and $ 4.74 billion at the end of the decade .
A 2008 Suburban 2500 with a 6.0 - liter V8 , four - wheel drive , automatic transmission and leather sells new for $ 43,235 ; a two - year - old model with 24,000 miles in excellent condition can be yours for less than $ 20,000 .
A new - generation 2008 Toyota Land Cruiser with a 5.7 - liter V8 that gets 13 mpg city and 18 mpg highway runs for $ 64,785 ; a two - year - old model similarly equipped goes for between $ 34,120 and $ 35,975 , depending on its condition .
Money To Burn
GM Shares Hit 26 Year Low
Buckingham Research Analyst Joseph Amaturo cut his stock price target to $ 10 from $ 13 , and reiterated his underperform rating , saying production declines are likely to widen loss expectations and accelerate the drain on liquidity .
GM 's stock , a component of the Dow industrials , shed 0.6 % to $ 16.02 , and has now lost 31 % since the end of April .
It hit a low of $ 15.76 earlier in the session , the lowest price seen since August 1982 .
Amaturo said he now expects a 2008 loss of $ 6.53 a share and a 2009 loss of $ 7.73 a share , wider than his previous forecasts of a 2008 loss of $ 4.57 a share and a 2009 loss of $ 6.14 a share .
He also said the automaker 's cash and equivalents balance is expected to fall below $ 20 billion by the end of the second quarter , and raised his 2009 cash burn projection to $ 17 billion from $ 14 billion .
" We believe it is becoming evermore likely that GM 's current cash dividend could be eliminated or cut as the company likely has to raise capital to remain solvent beyond 2008 , " Amaturo said in a research note .
" We believe management could raise capital as much as $ 7 billion to $ 10 billion , which will result in significant dilution for the current equity holder , in our opinion . "
Separately , Credit Suisse Analyst Chistopher Ceraso said GM 's third - quarter production schedule appears to be " way to aggressive , " and could leave trucks about 50 % overstocked at the end of September .

AFL - CIO mobilizing veterans to oppose McCain Associated Press
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008

The AFL - CIO is mobilizing union members who are military veterans to work against Republican presidential candidate John McCain and other office seekers it opposes , officials said Thursday .
John Sweeney , the president of the labor federation , planned to announce the creation of a Union Veterans Council in a teleconference Thursday .
The union , which endorsed Democrat Barack Obama for president last month , plans to form state councils of union veterans in key election battlegrounds , including Wisconsin , Minnesota , Colorado , Ohio and West Virginia .
Later , it plans to organize in Pennsylvania , Michigan and Virginia .
" We 're forming this Union Veterans Council to bring together union members who are veterans to speak out on the issues that matter the most to them  in this year 's election and beyond , " Sweeney said in a statement .
" With the formation of the Union Veterans Council , veterans will be front and center in the effort to put our country back on track . "
Sweeney said key issues will include money for the Veterans Affairs Department , health and education benefits for veterans , and job growth .
The union also launched an ad that will air Thursday that features a Vietnam combat veteran criticizing McCain 's stance on the war in Iraq and on veterans issues .
The ad will air for three weeks on national cable and in Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Wisconsin , union officials said .
The outreach effort will include door - to - door canvassing and visits to worksites by veterans to talk to union members about issues in the election .
The union also plans to identify and track union veterans .
The AFL - CIO estimates it has 2.1 million members who are either veterans or are serving in active duty in the military .
Sweeney was expected to make the announcement with Mark Ayers , the president of the Building & Construction Trades Council and a former Navy pilot .
" Not only has McCain voted the wrong way on veterans issues  such as opposing increased funding for veterans ' health care the last four years in a row  but he also does n't support middle - class people 's issues , " Ayers said in a statement .
" He wants to tax people 's health care benefits and supports unfair trade deals , including NAFTA . "
CNN reporter : Bush excuse for unemployment rate ' ridiculous '
During an economic speech today , President Bush partly blamed a dramatic rise in unemployment on new workers entering the workforce .
Later , in a CNN interview , Bush Labor Secretary Elaine Chao also said that the increase the unemployment rate was " caused in part by a surge of young entrants into the job market . "
CNN senior business correspondent Ali Velshi weighed in that Bush administration excuses for the poor economy were " ridiculous . "
Velshi explained , " I just wish they would n't say that .
President Bush said something earlier about how the unemployment rate today -- the increase -- was because a whole bunch of teenagers have joined the workforce , that 's the point .
100,000 people join the working age working force every month .
If we do n't create 100,000 jobs every month , we 're not doing the right thing . "

LAS CRUCES , N.M.  Senator John McCain is facing increasing scrutiny about his selection of a running mate as some social conservatives expressed alarm on Tuesday that Mr. McCain might ask a candidate who favors abortion rights to join him on the ticket .
But other conservatives said that Mr. McCain , who has long been in step with the Republican Party platform in opposing abortion , was unlikely to be the first Republican presidential nominee in decades to select such a candidate .
They said that Mr. McCain ’s recent public flirtation with Tom Ridge , a former Pennsylvania governor who supports abortion rights , was as much to give the appearance that Mr. McCain had an open mind on the issue as it was an embrace of Mr. Ridge .
“ I think there ’s such sufficient understanding at the most senior levels of this campaign of the importance of the pro-family constituency that I ’m very comfortable with how the selection process is proceeding , ” one Republican strategist close to the campaign said .
“ I think social conservatives will be fine . ”
Republicans said Mr. McCain would name his choice after the Democratic convention ended next Thursday .
Mr. McCain ’s aides said that no day had been set , but that one strong possibility was Friday , when Mr. McCain has a rally scheduled in Ohio .
Making cement without also making carbon dioxide seems impossible ; the basic chemistry of the process releases the gas .
But maybe that ’s not really true , Stanford University scientist Brent Contstantz began thinking last year .
Of course , it was only a theory , he told himself , but the market for cement is so large — about $ 13 billion annually in the United States alone — and the pressure to reduce its effect on the environment so strong that he sent a 12 - line email to venture capitalist Vinod Khosla .

“ I have an idea for a new sustainable cement , ” Contstantz wrote .
“ I ’m sure you are already aware that for every ton of [ standard ]
Portland cement produced , approximately one ton of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere .
My cement would n’t do that ; in fact , it would remove a ton of carbon dioxide from the environment for every ton of cement produced . ”
Khosla , who knew Contstantz only casually — the two had n’t been in touch for 20 years — was on vacation .
But after a discussion that lasted only an hour , he told the scientist , “ I do n’t care about the rest of the business plan .
You do n’t need to estimate costs .
You do n’t need to do a cash flow .
You do n’t need to do a presentation .
Just hire five people , set up a lab , and go . ” Contstantz was astonished .
“ What we ’re up to , ” he warned , “ takes balls . ”
“ Well , you ’ve got the money now , ” was the response .
“ Get busy . ”
It was a classic performance from Khosla , a man who “ enters any chamber believing he ’s the smartest man in the room , ” in the words of one longtime VC .
“ In 30 seconds , in one paragraph , I knew this was worth doing , ” Khosla says now , adding that the cement startup , called Calera , “ may be our biggest win ever . ”
Over the past four years , Khosla has become the world ’s foremost investor in environmental startups .
He has committed an estimated $ 450 million of his personal fortune to financing 45 ethanol factories , solar - power parks , and makers of environmentally friendly lightbulbs , batteries , and automotive components .
These investments have made him the most prominent of an increasingly rare breed , the so - called angel investors who put their own funds into the youngest of companies — including outfits that are pursuing the most innovative , but not yet commercially viable , approaches to serious problems such as global warming .
It ’s a kind of seed - stage investing that traditional venture funds have largely abandoned .
And rightly so , Khosla says .
“ If somebody comes to you with a cold - fusion idea , you should not be funding it as an investor with other people ’s money .
Funding it , if they ’re credible people , as a science experiment , as a hobby , is perfectly okay — as long as it ’s your own money . ”
advertisement
Khosla ’s green investing has made him something of a celebrity , mentioned in the media with the likes of mogul Richard Branson , former President Bill Clinton , Hollywood producer Stephen Bing , and General Motors chairman and CEO Richard Wagoner .
I ’ve known Khosla since his days as a recent immigrant from India more than two decades ago but had n’t seen him in years until we met in his office in Menlo Park , California , earlier this year .
Khosla Ventures is tucked away in an unprepossessing corner of a redwood complex of small offices .
The decor is rental - furniture bland .
The only reading set out for visitors is a four - month - old issue of National Geographic with a cover story on biofuels .
Khosla ’s own office is spare , with 15 large black - and - white photographs of his four children on the walls .
For others in the firm , office dress is Silicon Valley casual — jeans , fleece vests , and running shoes — but Khosla arrives more elegantly attired , in taupe slacks ; a chocolate long - sleeve , zip - neck knit shirt ; and slip - ons in luggage tan with leather bows and kilties .
He ’s 53 , a slender 5 - foot - 10 , genial and looking relaxed despite the prominent dark circles under his eyes .
Although he lives near his office , this morning he has already driven one of his daughters to school in San Francisco , a 90 - minute round - trip that he makes every weekday in order to spend time alone with her .
Later , he ’ll review several business proposals , prepare to announce three new investments and the hiring of an operational manager for his firm , and polish his remarks for an appearance at the United Nations .
To meet with me , he has taken a break from writing a position paper on where the world will get the biomass it needs for oil independence .
He writes two or three such papers a month , averaging more than 100 pages a year .
“ Nobody wastes less of the time in his life than Vinod , ” says venture capitalist Roger McNamee , whose office at Integral Capital Partners was for a decade just down the hall from Khosla ’s , at the storied Silicon Valley partnership of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers .
During nearly two decades at Kleiner Perkins , Khosla lost far more often than he won .
He was n’t responsible for the firm ’s best - known successes of his era — Amazon , Netscape , and Google .
By my reckoning , he was most closely involved with 42 startups .
Most were sold or closed , although a few still operate privately .
Eleven , however , went public ( mostly during the dotcom bubble ) .
That ’s better than 25 % — not at all bad in the VC world .
And measured by return on invested capital , Khosla ’s record has been outstanding .
His half - dozen best deals at Kleiner Perkins multiplied $ 314 million in investments into $ 15 billion in cash and stock — an increase of nearly fiftyfold , and five times more than all the money invested in all 42 companies .
It was at the peak of his success in late 2000 and early 2001 — when Fortune named him the “ most successful venture capitalist of all time ” and he later appeared on the covers of two other national business magazines in a single week — that he decided to change .
Shares in his most successful company , Juniper Networks , were trading at more than 40 times their offering price a year and a half earlier .
But he foresaw a bleak near future for optical networking equipment , in which he had made his name .
Just as telecom stocks , including Juniper , were reaching all - time highs , he warned in a keynote at a Goldman Sachs conference that at least one of the industry ’s most famous companies would soon be bankrupt .
“ If I really believed what I was saying , I told myself , then it was time to look elsewhere , ” he recalls .
Around that time , a friend introduced him to a space - research scientist with a business idea unlike any Khosla had considered before : generating electric power from water , oxygen , and natural gas .
Seven years later , the company , now known as Bloom Energy , has yet to introduce its first product , but Khosla marks his initial support for it as a turning point in his career .
“ I knew then I wanted to go green , ” he says .
In 2004 , he struck out on his own .
“ I felt that energy needed more exploring than a responsible venture fund should do , ” he says .
At Khosla Ventures , he has put his own money into graphics - display , data - center , and wireless technologies , but environmental startups are what excite him .
He has been on a campaign to end American dependence on petroleum since oil was trading at a quarter of its present price .
Unlike his more famous former partner at Kleiner Perkins , the energetic John Doerr — who has choked up onstage recounting his daughter ’s worries about climate change — Khosla is unemotional about going green .
He hopes to improve the world by developing , for example , cleaner - burning coal and cars that run leaner , but his more fundamental motivations seem to be the size of the potential market and , even more important , the intellectual challenge of intractable problems .

Some Khosla Ventures deals are so preliminary that even he calls them “ imprudent science experiments ” rather than companies .
“ Science experiments are key to solving the problems of global warming and energy independence , ” he says .
“ Incremental approaches will not work . ”
He has backed a company developing automobile injection systems that could double the fuel efficiency of gasoline engines , if its technology works .
He has millions riding on efforts to make fuel from materials other than corn , although none has advanced beyond the pilot or demonstration phase .
He has put money into a company that believes its microbes , which can turn sugar into the basis for a malaria drug , also can turn it into cheap substitutes for gasoline — and he did so long before the founders had figured out what the company ’s product would be .
“ We ’ve funded an incredible number of things that would make no sense at all for a traditional venture fund , ” he says .
Khosla has long seemed drawn to venture capital by the chance to satisfy his curiosity and to demonstrate that , whatever the question , he has the answer .
“ I ’ve never been interested in business , surprisingly , ” he tells me .
“ I ’m a techie nerd .
What I like is intellectual stimulus .
It ’s fundamentally what I enjoy . ”
He was smitten by Silicon Valley as a teenager in New Delhi in the 1970s .
Every week , he would rent and carefully read worn - out copies of what was then the startup publication of record , Electronic Engineering Times .
In the 1990s , he was inspired to concentrate on optical communications while reading books on the physics of optics — during a vacation in Hawaii .
On another typical summer break , he studied complex systems at the Santa Fe Institute ; to prepare , he worked for six months with a tutor , brushing up on calculus and linear algebra .
When he got interested in climate change , he prepared an extensive briefing book for himself , loosely based on Danish political scientist Bjørn Lomborg ’s book , The Skeptical Environmentalist .
Khosla ’s almost obsessive thoroughness carries over into his private life .
In the late 1980s , before hiring a designer for his new 12,000 - square - foot home on a woody hillside , he read more than 100 books on architecture .
He likes to set goals that can be measured .
To remind himself to spend more time with his eldest child , he used to keep a jar of jelly beans on his office desk , removing one each Monday ; those that remained were the number of weekends until she would go off to college .
Although he travels frequently , he requires himself to be home for dinner at least 25 evenings a month ; his administrative assistant monitors his performance .
Sometimes his own bookkeeping is quirky ; in midconversation with me on a cell phone several years ago , he pulled into his driveway , announced that he was “ officially at home , ” and kept right on talking for an hour .
But when I ask how often he skied last year , he answers immediately and precisely : 45 days .
Fellow investors describe Khosla as driven , arrogant , sometimes single - minded .
He likes to argue and is so tenacious that his former partners often sent him into negotiations to defeat , or at least wear down , the opposition .
“ What makes him invincible is that he does n’t care if you do n’t think well of him , ” says an ex-partner .
After Khosla expressed skepticism about hybrid cars , he responded to every last criticism of his position on the Gristmill blog .
“ I want to test my ideas , ” he explains .
“ I do n’t really care what they think , but one in 10 responses is something I should consider . ”
“ What makes Khosla invincible is that he does n’t care if you do n’t think well of him , ” says an ex-partner .

Initially rejected by Stanford University ’s Graduate School of Business , Khosla lobbied the dean ’s office for two years , sometimes making weekly calls , until he was finally admitted .
“ The best way to get Vinod to do something , ” says longtime friend Doerr , “ is to tell him you do n’t believe he can do it . ”
But there is at least one skill Khosla seems to lack .
As his official biography has it , while still in his twenties , Khosla helped found two extraordinarily successful startups , Sun Microsystems and an early design - automation company called Daisy Systems .
He wrote the business plan for Daisy while still a student at Stanford , but others ran the company and he soon left .
At Sun , he was replaced early on as chief executive by his former roommate in business school , Scott McNealy .
Khosla “ had no people sense , ” recalls a Sun director of that era .
“ He would go through the factory floor and terrorize people and shut down the line .
There was Vinod ’s way and no other way .
It drove his cofounders crazy . ”
( Khosla says that his disagreements with the board were frequent and significant but his involvement with production was n’t among them . )
To keep him with the company , the board promoted him to chairman , but after he boycotted four board meetings in a row , sitting resentfully alone in his office , he was fired .
He retained a large stake in Sun , however , as well as in Daisy , and their public offerings made him rich .
His brief , troubled tenure in the executive suite rarely stops him from telling startup CEOs what they ought to be doing .
At board meetings , he ’s insistent — “ analytical , unemotional , and often blunt , ” says one fellow director .
Another describes him as “ massively intrusive . ”
A third , more charitably , says , “ He has so much more energy than other people that he can overwhelm entrepreneurs …
If Vinod ’s on the board , the CEO needs a senior vice president in charge of managing him . ”
As we talk around a table in his office , Khosla pulls out a laptop and runs me through one of his numerous PowerPoint presentations , flipping the slides quickly until he reaches a diagram of possible remedies for global warming .
“ I get so many proposals that unless I have in my head what areas I will be interested in ahead of time , it does n’t really work , ” he tells me .
He ’s a tireless promoter , speaking at dozens of conferences a year .
To contrast himself with Al Gore , now a member of Kleiner Perkins , Khosla likes to focus on what he calls “ solutions , not problems . ”
The presentation he shows me , his favorite , is entitled “ Mostly Convenient Truths From a Technology Optimist ” — among them that global warming is “ a technology crisis , not a resource crisis ” and that solutions to large problems require “ a dash of greed . ”
To mainstream environmentalists , some of his views are heretical .
He contends that hydrogen fuels are a dead end .
Although he drives a hybrid car , he believes that hybrids wo n’t significantly slow global warming .
And he ’s convinced that , in most places , energy from solar panels will for many years be much too expensive .
“ There are only four problems with global warming , ” he tells me , “ oil , coal , cement , and steel .
If we do those four , we ’re done . ”

Done , however , is for tomorrow .
Despite his ambitious plans and hundreds of millions of invested dollars , Khosla ’s companies are still in the early stages .
Calera is typical ; it is only now preparing to open its first cement plant , on a 200 - acre site next door to a gas - fired electric - power utility .
Carbon - dioxide - laden exhaust from the power plant will be captured and used to make and dry the cement .
Calera plans to be in pilot production by the end of the year , in commercial operation by 2010 , and running 100 sites in North America five years later .
As our meeting comes to an end , Khosla closes his laptop and heads back to work on the biomass paper .
An academic is helping him with this one , which he hopes will be accepted by Science or Nature , the prestigious scientific weeklies .
“ Think of it , ” he says as he turns away .
“ Publication in a peer - reviewed journal .
What other venture capitalist would even try to do that ? ” Richard Shaffer writes about technology and economics from New York .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States will provide Israel with a radar system used to detect and track missile and rocket attacks , a senior Pentagon official told CNN Tuesday .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak says the technology will be running before Bush leaves office .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the U.S. assistance will include an agreement to facilitate the sharing of U.S. " early warning " launch data and technical and financial help developing defenses against shorter range rockets and mortars .
The technology is called X - band frequency , which has microwave range and provides for ultra - high very precise resolution .
It is able to distinguish between real missiles , decoys and debris .
The technology would be running before " the new [ U.S. ] administration arrives " in January , Israel 's Defense Minister Ehud Barak said , according to Israel 's Haaretz newspaper .
The plan for assistance was announced after Barak met with Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Tuesday .
At Tuesday 's Pentagon briefing , spokesman Geoff Morrell said , " What we are committed to is exploring additional defensive capabilities for Israel . "

When a group of University of Oklahoma researchers began studying the environmental fate of spilt petroleum , a problem that has plagued the energy industry for decades , they did not expect to eventually isolate a community of microorganisms capable of converting hydrocarbons into natural gas .
The researchers found that the groundbreaking process — known as anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism — can be used to stimulate methane gas production from older , more mature oil reservoirs like those in Oklahoma .
The work has now led to the recognition that similar microorganisms may also be involved in problems ranging from the deterioration of fuels to the corrosion of pipelines .
A new OU initiative led by Joseph Suflita , Director of the Institute for Energy and Environment within the Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy , brings together researchers from multiple disciplines and departments to attack the corrosion problems affecting pipelines , storage tanks and tankers as well as the deterioration of fuels inside such facilities .
Suflita says , “ The OU initiative is the only major U.S. initiative of its kind devoted to the problem of biodeterioration and biocorrosion . ”
Biodeterioration and biocorrosion are fundamental microbiological processes that can cause pipelines , storage facilities and tankers to leak and contaminate the environment .
“ First , we have to understand how Mother Nature cleans up these spills and we can do this by studying the way microorganisms interact with hydrocarbons , ” says Suflita .
OU researchers have isolated some interesting organisms that metabolize hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen — insight that was lacking for a long time .
OU researchers have extended their studies to how energy is produced in this country by investigating biocorrosion that leads to pipeline failures on the North Slope of Alaska .
“ We want to better understand how organisms eat through these pipelines .
Several fundamental mechanisms cause this problem , but it is spotty and does n’t occur all of a sudden .
Rather , biocorrosion occurs over a long period of time , and we are using a series of new molecular and chemical tools to find out why and how this happens , ” says Suflita .
“ We think cells grow in communities that adhere to the inner surface of pipelines and form three - dimensional biofilms that can sometimes cause pitting .
Once we understand what these microorganisms are doing , we can interrupt their processes or diagnose them more effectively .
The science is rudimentary at this stage .
The modern tools of molecular microbiology have not been applied yet , but a National Science Foundation grant , support from the DOE ’s Joint Genome Institute and the cooperation of the energy industry , allowed us to study pipeline biocorrosion on the North Slope . ”
Interruptions in energy supply are significant and cause price spikes that have global impact .
Over 500,000 miles of pipeline that crisscross the United States carry over 75 percent of crude oil and 65 percent of refined product .
Problems occur throughout the industry , in storage facilities , refineries and tankers , and have similar consequences .
Microorganisms grow inside the pipelines because water often accompanies hydrocarbons pumped from the ground .
As reservoirs age , more water is pumped creating an even greater problem .
“ For many years , no one ever thought anaerobes could grow by metabolizing hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen , but that is simply wrong .
The organisms are actually quite good at it .
The underlying mechanisms will be even more important as we introduce newer biofuels to augment our fossil fuel supply .
We are putting new fuel combinations into the existing pipelines that service the entire country .
The new biofuels can be less stable , so there is a different problem to deal with .
The chemistry of biofuels may not allow us to store them as long and more research is needed to determine the stability , compatability and composition of such fuel mixtures . ”
While biocorrosion and biodeterioration can be problematic , anaerobic hydrocarbon metabolism also has an upside .
The OU researchers found that they can use their organisms to convert hydrocarbons in oil reservoirs to natural gas .
“ Because two - thirds of U.S. oil is still in place , we can use these organisms to convert residual hydrocarbons into natural gas and create a new source of domestic energy .
The concept of anaerobic metabolism is an innovative process and the OU initiative is the only one of its kind in the United States at the present time .
We are also experimenting with shales and other unconventional reservoirs . ”
“ Biotechnology can influence recovery and address some of today ’s problems if we can understand how microorganisms degrade hydrocarbons in the absence of oxygen .
OU is one of the top universities in the world to study anaerobic microbiology with 14 experts performing research in some aspect of this field .
It is rare for universities to have even a single individual with this specialization .
OU is an exciting place to be if you are an environmental microbiologist .
This initiative has unified this group of experts and led to the groundbreaking research we have just begun to understand . ”
“ We know that bacterial cells communicate much like those that cause disease .
If we know the language they use , we can send signals and interrupt their communications so they will change their behavior .
The best way to treat the biocorrosion problem has not yet been determined .
Active ongoing monitoring of pipelines tells us there is an ongoing process , but we need to get to the problem before it gets to the critical stage .
Some and perhaps most microorganisms are not routinely monitored , so we have to understand the role they play in this process — information we can use to more effectively diagnose and treat the consequences . ”

Petit vs. Grand Geopolitic
A Spoiler - Free Environment
The New Era
As students of geopolitics , we at STRATFOR tend not to get overexcited when this or that plan for regional peace is tabled .
Many of the world 's conflicts are geographic in nature , and changes in government or policy only rarely supersede the hard topography that we see as the dominant sculptor of the international system .
Island states tend to exist in tension with their continental neighbors .
Two countries linked by flat arable land will struggle until one emerges dominant .
Land - based empires will clash with maritime cultures , and so on .
But the grand geopolitic — the framework which rules the interactions of regions with one another — is not the only rule in play .
There is also the petit geopolitic that occurs among minor players within a region .
Think of the grand geopolitic as the rise and fall of massive powers — the onslaught of the Golden Horde , the imperial clash between England and France , the U.S. - Soviet Cold War .
By contrast , think of the petit geopolitic as the smaller powers that swim alongside or within the larger trends — Serbia versus Croatia , Vietnam versus Cambodia , Nicaragua versus Honduras .
The same geographic rules apply , just on a smaller scale , with the added complexity of the grand geopolitic as backdrop .
The Middle East is a region rife with petit geopolitics .
Since the failure of the Ottoman Empire , the region has not hosted an indigenous grand player .
Instead , the region serves as a battleground for extra-regional grand powers , all attempting to grind down the local ( petit ) players to better achieve their own aims .
Normally , STRATFOR looks at the region in that light : an endless parade of small players and local noise in an environment where most trends worth watching are those implanted and shaped by outside forces .
No peace deals are easy , but in the Middle East they require agreement not just from local powers , but also from those grand players beyond the region .
The result is , well , the Middle East we all know .
All the more notable , then , that a peace deal — and a locally crafted one at that — has moved from the realm of the improbable to not merely the possible , but perhaps even the imminent .
Israel and Syria are looking to bury the hatchet , somewhere in the Golan Heights most likely , and they are doing so for their own reasons .
Israel has secured deals with Egypt and Jordan already , and the Palestinians — by splitting internally — have defeated themselves as a strategic threat .
A deal with Syria would make Israel the most secure it has been in millennia .
Syria , poor and ruled by its insecure Alawite minority , needs a basis of legitimacy that resonates with the dominant Sunni population better than its current game plan : issuing a shrill shriek whenever the name " Israel " is mentioned .
The Alawites believe there is no guarantee of support better than cash , and their largest and most reliable source of cash is in Lebanon .
Getting Lebanon requires an end to Damascus ' regional isolation , and the agreement of Israel .
The outline of the deal , then , is surprisingly simple : Israel gains military security from a peace deal in exchange for supporting Syrian primacy in Lebanon .
The only local loser would be the entity that poses an economic challenge ( in Lebanon ) to Syria , and a military challenge ( in Lebanon ) to Israel — to wit , Hezbollah .
Hezbollah , understandably , is more than a little perturbed by the prospect of this tightening noose .
Syria is redirecting the flow of Sunni militants from Iraq to Lebanon , likely for use against Hezbollah .
Damascus also is working with the exiled leadership of the Palestinian group Hamas as a gesture of goodwill to Israel .
The French — looking for a post -de Gaulle diplomatic victory — are re-engaging the Syrians and , to get Damascus on board , are dangling everything from aid and trade deals with Europe to that long - sought stamp of international approval .
Oil -rich Sunni Arab states , sensing an opportunity to weaken Shiite Hezbollah , are flooding petrodollars in bribes — that is , investments — into Syria to underwrite a deal with Israel .
While the deal is not yet a fait accompli , the pieces are falling into place quite rapidly .
Normally we would not be so optimistic , but the hard decisions — on Israel surrendering the Golan Heights and Syria laying preparations for cutting Hezbollah down to size — have already been made .
On July 11 the leaders of Israel and Syria will be attending the same event in Paris , and if the French know anything about flair , a handshake may well be on the agenda .
It is n't exactly pretty — and certainly is n't tidy — but peace really does appear to be breaking out in the Middle East .
Remember , the deal must please not just the petit players , but the grand ones as well .
At this point , those with any interest in disrupting the flow of events normally would step in and do what they could to rock the boat .
That , however , is not happening this time around .
All of the normal cast members in the Middle Eastern drama are either unwilling to play that game at present , or are otherwise occupied .
The country with the most to lose is Iran .
A Syria at formal peace with Israel is a Syria that has minimal need for an alliance with Iran , as well as a Syria that has every interest in destroying Hezbollah 's military capabilities .
( Never forget that while Hezbollah is Syrian - operated , it is Iranian - founded and - funded . )
But using Hezbollah to scupper the Israeli - Syrian talks would come with a cost , and we are not simply highlighting a possible military confrontation between Israel and Iran .
Iran is involved in negotiations far more complex and profound than anything that currently occupies Israel and Syria .
Tehran and Washington are attempting to forge an understanding about the future of Iraq .
The United States wants an Iraq sufficiently strong to restore the balance of power in the Persian Gulf and thus prevent any Iranian military incursion into the oil fields of the Arabian Peninsula .
Iran wants an Iraq that is sufficiently weak that it will never again be able to launch an attack on Persia .
Such unflinching national interests are proving difficult to reconcile , but do not confuse " difficult " with " impossible " — the positions are not mutually exclusive .
After all , while both want influence , neither demands domination .
Remarkable progress has been made during the past six months .
The two sides have cooperated in bringing down violence in Iraq , now at its lowest level since the aftermath of the 2003 invasion itself .
Washington and Tehran also have attacked the problems of rogue Shiite militias from both ends , most notably with the neutering of Muqtada al - Sadr and his militia , the Medhi Army .
Meanwhile , that ever - enlarging pot of Sunni Arab oil money has been just as active in Baghdad in drawing various groups to the table as it has been in Damascus .
Thus , while the U.S. - Iranian understanding is not final , formal or imminent , it is taking shape with remarkable speed .
There are many ways it still could be derailed , but none would be so effective as Iran using Hezbollah to launch another war with Israel .
China and Russia both would like to see the Middle East off balance — if not on fire in the case of Russia — although it is hardly because they enjoy the bloodshed .
Currently , the United States has the bulk of its ground forces loaded down with Afghan and Iraqi operations .
So long as that remains the case — so long as Iran and the United States do not have a meeting of the minds — the United States lacks the military capability to deploy any large - scale ground forces anywhere else in the world .
In the past , Moscow and Beijing have used weapons sales or energy deals to bolster Iran 's position , thus delaying any embryonic deal with Washington .
But such impediments are not being seeded now .
Rising inflation in China has turned the traditional question of the country 's shaky financial system on its head .
Mass employment in China is made possible not by a sound economic structure , but by de facto subsidization via ultra-cheap loans .
But such massive availability of credit has artificially spiked demand , for 1.3 billion people no less , creating an inflation nightmare that is difficult to solve .
Cut the loans to rein in demand and inflation , and you cut business and with it employment .
Chinese governments have been toppled by less .
Beijing is desperate to keep one step ahead of either an inflationary spiral or a credit meltdown — and wants nothing more than for the Olympics to go off as hitch - free as possible .
Tinkering with the Middle East is the furthest thing from Beijing 's preoccupied mind .
Meanwhile , Russia is still growing through its leadership " transition , " with the Kremlin power clans still going for each other 's throats .
Their war for control of the defense and energy industries still rages , their war for control of the justice and legal systems is only now beginning to rage , and their efforts to curtail the powers of some of Russia 's more independent - minded republics such as Tatarstan has not yet begun to rage .
Between a much - needed resettling , and some smacking of out - of - control egos , Russia still needs weeks ( or months ? ) to get its own house in order .
The Kremlin can still make small gestures — Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin chatted briefly by phone July 7 with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on the topic of the nuclear power plant that Russia is building for Iran at Bushehr — but for the most part , the Middle East will have to wait for another day .
But by the time Beijing or Moscow have the freedom of movement to do anything , the Middle East may well be as " solved " as it can be .
For those of us at STRATFOR who have become rather inured to the agonies of the Middle East , such a sustained stream of constructive , positive news is somewhat unnerving .
One gets the feeling that if the progress could hold up for just a touch longer , not only would there be an Israeli - Syrian deal and a U.S. - Iranian understanding , the world itself would change .
Those of us here who are old enough to remember have n't sensed such a fateful moment since the weeks before the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
And — odd though it may sound — we have been waiting for just such a moment for some time .
Certainly since before 9/11 .
STRATFOR views the world as working in cycles .
Powers or coalitions of powers form and do battle across the world .
Their struggles define the eras through which humanity evolves , and those struggles tend to end in a military conflict that lays the groundwork for the next era .
The Germans defeated Imperial France in the Franco - Prussian War in 1871 , giving rise to the German era .
That era lasted until a coalition of powers crushed Germany in World Wars I and II .
That victorious coalition split into the two sides of the Cold War until the West triumphed in 1989 .
New eras do not form spontaneously .
There is a brief — historically speaking — period between the sweeping away of the rules of the old era and the installation of the rules of the new .
These interregnums tend to be very dangerous affairs , as the victorious powers attempt to entrench their victory as new powers rise to the fore — and as many petit powers , suddenly out from under the thumb of any grand power , try to carve out a niche for themselves .
The post -World War I interregnum witnessed the complete upending of Asian and European security structures .
The post - World War II interregnum brought about the Korean War as China 's rise slammed into America 's efforts to entrench its power .
The post -Cold War interregnum produced Yugoslav wars , a variety of conflicts in the former Soviet Union ( most notably in Chechnya ) , the rise of al Qaeda , the jihadist conflict and the Iraq war .
All these conflicts are now well past their critical phases , and in most cases are already sewn up .
All of the pieces of Yugoslavia are on the road to EU membership .
Russia 's borderlands — while hardly bastions of glee — have settled .
Terrorism may be very much alive , but al Qaeda as a strategic threat is very much not .
Even the Iraq war is winding to a conclusion .
Put simply , the Cold War interregnum is coming to a close and a new era is dawning .

Missile silos might be the world ’s most amazing abandonments .
There is something about their immense scale , implicit secrecy , loaded history and and underground location that makes them an exciting target for urban exploration .
Here are some fascinating examples of deserted subterranean silos one can visit and even purchase !
One set of intrepid building infiltrators set about breaking into the above missile silo ( location undisclosed ) at risk of both personal injury and federal penalty .
Despite their retroactive warnings not to follow their example , these adventurers produced an amazing photo - documentary of their journey .
As you navigate their website , it becomes a kind of choose - your - own - adventure tale allowing you to pick your path .
The Minuteman Missile Tour exists at the opposite end of the legal spectrum , providing a fun and interesting but completely safe and legitimate tour through an abandoned missile complex .
Located in South Dakota , annual summer tours regularly fill completely with people who are curious about America ’s past and the days of the Cold War , when fears of Mutually Assured Destruction haunted the country ’s psyche .
Also be out this amazing collection of missiles , rockets and other weapons .
Last but not least , it is even possible to buy your own abandoned missile silo and associated complex !
Even better : you can do so from the comfort of your computer via eBay for 15 million dollars .
Of course , you may have have to sell your house to afford the $ 300,000 downpayment , but would n’t it be worth it ?

A senior Iranian official reportedly told members of the Iranian parliament Monday that Iran has agreed to freeze its enrichment program for six weeks and begin negotiations with the P5+1 group of states as early as next week , according to reports of that decision by the Iranian Student News Agency ( ISNA ) and by a Farsi - language website in Iran .
Remarks by Iranian Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki and a top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday also seemed to indicate that decision to accept a " freeze for freeze " proposal from the P5+1 to begin at least preliminary negotiations .
The P5+1 consists of the permanent members of the UN Security Council  the United States , Britain , France , China and Russia  and Germany .
The apparent Iranian decision comes in the wake of an atmosphere of heightened threat of attack on Iran by Israel created by a series of moves by Israeli and US officials in recent days .
The head of Iran ’s atomic energy agency , Gholam - Reza Aghazadeh , told members of the Majlis energy committee Monday that Iran has agreed to start the talks , according to the Farsi - language Iranian website Fararou .
It said " informed sources " had specified that Iran had accepted a six - week freeze on any expansion of enrichment as a condition on such negotiations , as proposed by European Union foreign affairs chief Javier Solana .
The P5+1 proposal also offers to suspend further progress in advancing UN sanctions against Iran .
It does not address sanctions organized outside the UN Security Council framework , however .
ISNA reported in a brief item on Monday that an Iranian parliamentary energy committee member , whom it did not name , had declared that Iran " has agreed to start talks with 5+1 countries group " .
It added that the talks " will begin next week " .
Although ISNA did not report that the official had said Iran would freeze its nuclear activities , in the sense of foregoing any increase in centrifuges , it implied as much by reporting that the P5+1 proposal delivered by Solana Jun. 14 " required Iran to suspend nuclear activities in exchange for a set of economic and security incentives " .
The news further quoted unnamed " Iranian officials " as saying that " common points of the two packages can be a launching pad to start talks " .
The Farsi - language website Fararou identified the member of the committee who had quoted Aghazadeh as informing committee members that Iranian authorities had agreed to negotiate with the 5+1 group as Seyed Admad Hosseini .
It was Hosseini who was quoted as telling reporters that the talks should start next week .
Fararou also provided additional details on the Aghazadeh ’s briefing .
It said the secretary of the Majlis energy committee , Moayyed Hosseini , told its reporter that the Aghazadeh had pointed to " positive aspects " of the negotiations with the P5+1 , " including the fact that the west was accepting Iran ’s possession of 3,000 centrifuges . "
That comment suggested that Tehran will present the " freeze for freeze " proposal as a concession to Iran ’s right to enrich uranium .
The committee secretary was quoted by Fararou as stating flatly that the proposal for a six - week freeze on enrichment " has been accepted by Tehran " .
The same parliamentarian was quoted as saying the atomic energy chief had declared that the " package " of proposals from the P5+1 was still being studied , and that Iran would respond by the end of the week .
The formal P5+1 proposal given to Iranian officials by EU foreign affairs commissioner Javier Solana Jun. 14 was a repackaging of the mid-2006 proposal to Tehran .
But it was accompanied by a six - week " freeze for freeze " proposal under which Iran would not increase the level of its enrichment efforts and the P5+1 would freeze the movement towards tougher sanctions against Iran , according to diplomats in London quoted by Reuters Jun. 21 .
That would enable " pre-negotiations " to begin between the two sides on " parameters for formal negotiations " , according to the diplomats .
Beginning formal negotiations , however , were said to require that Iran to " fully suspend " enrichment , meaning that it would actually temporarily halt the enrichment .
The formal negotiations envisaged would last " up to six months " , according to the diplomats cited by Reuters , during which time the halt to enrichment would have to continue .
The remarks by energy committee secretary Hosseini implied that Iran ’s commitment was only to the six - week freeze on the level of its nuclear activities and not to an actual suspension of enrichment as required for the formal stage of negotiations .
But Mottaki , in remarks at a luncheon meeting with reporters at the Iranian mission in New York , suggested that the Iranians might be prepared to go further .
Mottaki said that there were sufficient commonalities between the Solana proposal on behalf of the P5+1 and Iran ’s own proposals for negotiations to provide the basis for talks .
That remark , paralleling the unattributed view reported by ISNA on Monday , suggested that Iran was preparing to enter into substantive negotiations .
Furthermore , Mottaki failed to repeat the standard Iranian statement that enrichment is Iran ’s legitimate right , even though he was repeatedly questioned on the point .
Further indicating an Iranian desire to take advantage of any diplomatic opening in a period of rising threat from Washington and Tel Aviv , Ali Akbar Velyati , a top foreign policy adviser to Khamenei , said , " Americans wanted Iran not to accept Solana .
Therefore our interests imply that we should embrace Solana . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic senators called on Tuesday for the resignation of Stephen Johnson , head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , saying he sided with polluters instead of fighting global warming and other ecological problems .

The three senators , all active in the climate change debate , also asked the U.S. attorney general to investigate whether Johnson has made false or misleading statements in sworn testimony before the Senate ’s Environment and Public Works Committee .
“ Mr. Johnson has consistently chosen special interests over the American people ’s interests in protecting health and safety , ” Sen. Barbara Boxer of California told reporters .
“ He has become a secretive and dangerous ally of polluters and we cannot stand by and allow more damage to be done . ”
Boxer , who heads the environment committee , said Johnson had made damaging decisions on mercury , lead , toxic chemicals , drinking water standards , ozone air pollution and global warming .
She said these decisions were “ harmful to the American people . ”
Boxer noted that last year , Johnson denied California ’s request for federal permission -- known as a waiver -- to impose tough new limits on climate - warming carbon dioxide emissions from cars and light trucks .
That decision effectively blocked as many as 18 other states from doing the same .
Boxer , Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , asking him to investigate Johnson , specifically noting the California waiver decision .
“ False testimony by any witness is serious and undermines our ability to fulfill our constitutional duties on behalf of the American people , ” the senators wrote .
“ Our concern is heightened because this decision by the EPA administrator affects the health and well - being of the American people . ”
White House spokesman Tony Fratto dismissed the allegations against Johnson , saying Boxer has “ no standing ” to question Johnson ’s integrity .
“ Administrator Johnson is an honorable , experienced , career scientist and everything he has done at the EPA has been with the interests of protecting the American people and our environment , ” Fratto said .
According to Wikipedia , the term Designer Toys is used to describe a toy or other collectible work of art made in limited quantities , usually by designers or graphic artists .
The most common materials used to manufacture these toys are vinyl and plastic .
Plush dolls are also a frequent designer toy expression medium .
Metal , wood and cloth are occasionaly used .
These toys are consumed predominantly adults and very rarely by kids due high prices and the lack of a naive aspect .
Sometimes , a designer toy is produced in an all white version just to let designers and artists create their own exclusive version of the toy , just like a work of art .
These versions are usually very expensive for a toy .
This list gathers just a small sample of some cool designer toys from different artists around the web .
Go and have some fun with these designer toys !
It ’s not a “ timetable ” for extricating U.S troops from Iraq that George W. Bush is suddenly talking about , and heaven help anyone who accuses him of proposing a “ timeline . ”
No , the Decider says he is now amenable to a “ time horizon , ” which apparently is a whole different kind of time thing — not at all like the sensible course of action that Democrats and other critics of the Iraq occupation have been demanding .
If Bush were known for exquisite subtlety in his use of the language , I ’d note that a horizon is , by definition , a line that can never be reached .
But pigs will streak across the sky at Mach 2 before this president displays a diabolical mastery of semantics .
His new “ time horizon ” formulation is just smoke , intended to obfuscate and stall .
In six months , Iraq becomes somebody else ’s problem .
The shift does put loyal supporters of Bush ’s Iraq policy in an untenable position , though .
Their mantra has been that anyone who suggests a date for U.S. withdrawal , however vague or distant or aspirational , is being “ defeatist . ”
Now , logically , they ought to be saying the same thing about the president .
John McCain is the real victim of Bush ’s rhetorical moonwalk .
After yoking himself to the president ’s stay - the - course policy and musing that U.S. troops could be in Iraq for a century , he finds himself virtually alone in advocating what is now an extremist position .
Events have conspired to make the strategy advocated by Barack Obama and other leading Democrats — set a timetable for shutting down the sideshow in Iraq ; focus attention and resources on the main event in Afghanistan — the only sane way to proceed .
For one thing , the Iraqis are making it clear that the time is coming for us to leave .
In an interview published Saturday in the German magazine Der Spiegel , Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki basically endorsed Obama ’s 16 - month time frame for withdrawal .
U.S. military officials in Baghdad later released a statement from Maliki ’s office that claimed , without citing specifics , that the prime minister ’s remarks had been “ mistranslated ” and “ not conveyed accurately . ”
But on Monday , after Obama met with Maliki in Baghdad , a spokesman for the prime minister reiterated the Iraqi government ’s view that a “ timetable ” for U.S. withdrawal is now desirable .
The schedule or horizon or whatever the spokesman proposed — U.S. troops out in 2010 — coincides roughly with Obama ’s plan .
Obama spent the weekend in Afghanistan , where he found the situation “ precarious and urgent . ”
He told CBS News that Afghanistan “ has to be our central focus , the central front in our battle against terrorists . ”
More troops and materiel are needed now , he said , adding that “ if we wait until the next administration , it could be a year before we get those troops on the ground . ”
Attacks on U.S. forces in Afghanistan have become much more frequent and brazen over the past year , including a frontal assault on a forward base earlier this month that left nine Americans dead .
The Taliban , far from being a spent force , is reconstituted and apparently re-energized .
Across the border in the lawless hinterlands of Pakistan , al - Qaida is believed to have established new bases and training camps .
Gen. David Petraeus , the U.S. commander in Iraq , has said that he believes al - Qaida may be de-emphasizing Iraq and shifting its focus to Afghanistan .
This should come as a surprise to no one , except perhaps the man in the Oval Office .
Iraq was never anything more than a windfall to al - Qaida , an opportunity to engage and tie down the enemy — that would be us — while headquarters enjoyed a respite to regroup and rebuild .
The idea that al - Qaida , whose membership consists of fanatical Sunni Muslims , would ever expect to establish a serious operational base in majority - Shiite Iraq has always been absurd .
The terrorists ’ goal was simply to commit as much anti-American mayhem as possible , for as long as possible .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said he wants to send additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan “ sooner rather than later . ”
But that ’s easier said than done .
Today there are more U.S. troops in Iraq than before last year ’s troop surge — despite the token withdrawals that Bush has been touting .
The occupation of Iraq continues to devour resources that could and should be put to better use .
The day when the real fight against al - Qaida can be resumed has not yet arrived .
But even George Bush can see it on the horizon .

The RAC has called for a review of every camera
The RAC called for a national review of every camera – and for those which are not at accident blackspots to be scrapped .
The Liberal Democrats said some cameras “ debase ” the value of those at blackspots .
And the Tories said local authorities should review cameras on their patch .
AA president Edmund King estimated that four in every 10 of Britain ’s 5,562 cameras – around 2,200 – could just be making money rather than making roads safer .
The devices last year raised £ 104.4 million in fines , although the Government this year gave councils £ 110 million for road safety .
The pressure grew hours after Tory - controlled Swindon Borough Council announced it was considering quitting the Wiltshire and Swindon Safety Camera Partnership .
The council thinks it can use its £ 400,000 annual contribution to make roads safer without speed cameras .
Tory council leader Roderick Bluh , who in 2004 lost his licence after being caught by speed cameras four times , said : “ We are not going to compromise safety , but we are taking the opportunity to review how we utilise the money . ”
His colleague , councillor Peter Greenhalgh , who is head of highways in Swindon , described cameras as “ a blatant tax on the motorist ” .
And yesterday the RAC called for a major rethink .
RAC motoring strategist Adrian
Tink said : “ We believe that measures that help educate motorists and promote safe driving behaviour , such as average - speed cameras and speed - activated signs , are far more likely to have an effect than those that simply penalise motorists .
“ Three - quarters of Britain ’s motorists surveyed in this year ’s RAC Report on Motoring now think cameras are more about raising money than improving road safety . ”
Lib Dem transport spokesman Norman Baker said : “ The present guidelines introduced in January 2006 suggest that cameras can only be put in where there is a proven accident record .
“ Undoubtedly there are many cameras installed before then which do not meet those criteria . ”
Shadow transport secretary Theresa Villiers warned that cameras could not catch drivers who were drunk or on drugs .
She said : “ The Government ’s heavy reliance on fixed speed cameras means that important road safety issues which cameras cannot tackle are neglected . ”
Mr King said cameras had a role to play on some roads .
But he added : “ I would estimate that 40 per cent are probably revenue raisers – such as cameras hidden behind trees at the bottom of hills or on sliproads on motorways where drivers rightly speed up to join the main carriageway . ”
Employers ponder tough tactics to halt smoking Symposium presents tough tactics to halt habit that costs state billions in medical care , lost work hours
Chronicle photo illustration by Tracy Cox Chronicle photo illustration by Tracy Cox Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Employers ponder tough tactics to halt smoking 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Howard Weyers tried the " carrot " approach by giving his employees incentives and encouragement to quit smoking .
But when that did n't work , he resorted to the stick .
A big stick .
Weyers , owner of a health care benefits administrator in Lansing , Mich. , gave his 200 employees an ultimatum in 2004 : Quit smoking in 15 months or lose your job .
He refused to hire smokers .
Ultimately , he extended his smoking ban to employees ' spouses and monitored compliance through mandatory random blood testing .
Weyers ' method , while effective , would n't fly in California because the state has laws that prohibit employers from making hiring or firing decisions based on employee participation in a legal activity .
But participants in a smoking cessation forum hosted Monday by the Commonwealth Club of California found the idea nonetheless intriguing .
" We 're talking about ending an epidemic .
This is a global pandemic , " said Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , likening Weyers ' approach to controlling an outbreak of disease .
About 45 million Americans , 4 million of whom live in California , smoke cigarettes despite more than three decades of public efforts to encourage people to quit .
California , on both the state and local levels , has been at the forefront of anti-smoking efforts with laws to ban smoking in public places .
A law went into effect in January that prohibits drivers from smoking when children are in the car .
Still , smoking costs the state an estimated $ 8.6 billion in direct medical costs and $ 7.3 billion in lost productivity a year , according to the California division of the American Cancer Society .
In addition to lost work hours , employers have a vested interest in getting their workforce to kick the habit , given that they pay a large portion of health care costs and are the main source of health insurance for more than half the population .
At Monday 's event , officials from the California Public Employees ' Retirement System , the third - largest purchaser of health care in the country , said they asked the three health insurers that provide coverage for the fund 's 1.2 million state and local employees to increase member participation in smoking cessation programs by 20 percent next year .
" We do n't want to know if there 's a cost associated with this .
It 's in ( the health plans ' ) best interest and ours to do this , " said CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco .
Safeway Inc. announced that its Pleasanton headquarters will become smoke - and tobacco - free as of July 1 , with the ban extending to all regional offices in Canada and the United States as of Sept.
1 . Safeway already requires nonunion employees who do not participate in smoking - cessation efforts to pay more for their health premiums and is in discussions to extend the policy to union workers .
Safeway prefers to influence its smokers through incentives rather than penalties , said Larree Renda , an executive vice president with the grocery chain .
" Our focus right now has been one of being supportive and trying to help people quit smoking , " she said .
Renda took considerable heat from audience members because she works for a company that espouses healthy lifestyles but sells tobacco products .
Renda said Safeway has no plans to quit selling tobacco because it does not dictate what legal products its customers should buy , and ceasing cigarette sales would put the company at a competitive disadvantage .
Meanwhile , the San Francisco Board of Supervisors is considering a law that would ban the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products in the city 's drugstores .
Panel members had several suggestions for employers , such as providing benefits that cover smoking cessation programs , medications and counseling .
A major hurdle to such efforts is the fact that employees change jobs frequently and typically have to change health benefits with each job .
California employers do not have to offer smoking cessation programs to employees .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a 2005 bill by former state Sen. Debra Ortiz , D - Sacramento , that would have required health insurers that cover prescriptions to include coverage for programs to help people quit smoking .
The governor , a cigar smoker himself , supports increasing cigarette taxes .
On the federal level , Congress is considering a bill that would give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration greater authority to regulate tobacco products .
The bill , which is endorsed by Philip Morris USA , is controversial in part because it bans all flavored cigarettes except menthol , which are particularly popular among African Americans .
Cerebus is , as some of you know , an Aardvark .
Over the years , the author , Dave Sim , has let us follow this odd creature through his adventures as a barbarian , mercenary , drunk , Prime Minister and even , Pope .
Cerebus is a man , excuse me , an Aardvark , of big ambitions .
His ambitions involve grabbing as much gold as possible .
He does well .
Cerebus is a morally ambiguous character , at times sympathetic , at others callous .
He is often foul - mouthed and uncouth , has a vicious temper , and loves getting drunk .
Cerebus is a warrior by heart , his favorite weapon is his sword .
His most unusual weapon : the dreaded pig snout punch .
It began as a spoof of Conan the Barbarian , mixed with a dash of Howard the Duck .
But over the years Cerebus the Aardvark turned into something much more : an intricate socio-political allegory and an epic labor of love for its creator .
In 1976 , cartoonist Dave Sim drew a fanzine logo for his girlfriend , Denise Loubert .
It was only later that they realized they 'd misspelled the name of Cerberus , the mythical three - headed dog who guards the gates of Hades , so they decided it was the name of the company mascot , instead .
( The company name , Aardvark - Vanaheim , was created by combining suggestions from Loubert 's two siblings . )
So when , in 1977 , Sim decided to publish a comic book of his own creation , " Cerebus the Aardvark " just seemed like the natural way to go .
Cerebus the Aardvark ( or simply Cerebus ) is an independent comic book , written and illustrated by Canadian artist Dave Sim , with backgrounds by fellow Canadian Gerhard .
Now complete , it marks the longest - running English - language comic book series ever by a single creative team and one of the longest works of fiction in literature .
Sim began the series in 1977 , running for 300 issues and 6,000 pages , through March 2004 .
Cerebus and Elfquest are generally considered the two pioneers that sparked the self - publishing movement in comics — and of the two , Cerebus was self - published first , by several months .
At the time Stan Lee and Jack Kirby 's run of 100 issues on The Fantastic Four was still the longest run of any creative team on a comic , and that was a team rather than a single individual .
" He came to our city in the early dawn ...
Though later he would be called the finest warrior
to enter our gates , at the time , he was but a curiosity ...
You see , he stood only five hands high , had a lengthy snout ,
a long tail and was covered with short grey fur ...
He was , in short ............. CEREBUS THE AARDVARK . "

SAN FRANCISCO --
Intel is preparing the second generation of its vPro remote management technology and is promising more goodies in the third generation , which will take advantage of new features and functionality in the new Nehalem family .
vPro is not found in any single component of a computer .
It is a combination of processor technologies , hardware enhancements , management and security features for remote PC administration .
It allows administrators to access a system regardless of the operating system or whether the computer is on or off .
There are a number of requirements to be classified as a vPro PC , although most of those features are standard these days .
They include multi-core processors , Intel Active Management Technology ( AMT ) , remote configuration technology for AMT , wired and wireless network connection , Intel Trusted Execution Technology ( TXT ) and Intel Virtualization Technology .
vPro is one of those Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) products you do n't hear about much , but according to Andy Tryba , director of marketing for the Digital Office Products division , more than 60 percent of the Fortune 100 have deployed and use it .
The new version , due next month , will be for Penryn - based systems .
It will be one more generation before vPro is found on Nehalem systems , and Intel has been fairly steady about releasing vPro updates around the September timeframe , said Tryba .
Among the upcoming features in vPro will be the ability to remotely manage an encrypted hard disk .
Right now that 's not possible , since the computer 's user needed to enter the password to let the remote manager in .
The next generation will allow for power up and remote management without a password .
Currently , vPro has Cisco's Network Admission Control ( NAC ) but plans to add Microsoft Network Access Protection ( NAP ) as well , for administering Windows systems from a Server 2008 console .
Security is also enhanced by storing keys and other strong encryption passwords in silicon , not software , since software is the most common target of attack .
It 's also possible to intercept a password when it is being used in software .
So Intel moved it to a harder point to crack , the silicon .
A better kill switch
Intel also plans to update the remote kill switch , which lets an administrator disable or wipe a laptop that 's lost or stolen .
But that requires the thief or person who found the lost laptop to turn it on and connect it to the Internet .
The new vPro will allow an administrator to toast a laptop 's contents even if they do n't turn it on .
Just walk into range of a wireless Internet network and your laptop will get the signal to self - destruct .
Going forward , Tryba said Intel is looking at both the Nehalem and the MID space .
Nehalem is logical as it will be a desktop and eventually server platform .
MID , however , would be a new one .
" That whole market has a lot of the same needs as the regular laptop market so it would make sense , " he told InternetNews.com .
Nehalem laptops will feature Intel Antitheft Technology , which Intel first announced at the April IDF in Shanghai , China .
Built on the Intel Manageability System , this system will lock the system and lock the disk drive , so people can not get at the data .
It could even use a laptop 's built - in Webcam to show the face of the thief , which Intel demonstrated in a comical fashion here at the Intel Developer Forum ( IDF ) .
Pat Gelsinger , senior vice president and general manager of the Digital Enterprise group , disguised himself during a second keynote and stole a laptop from the stage , only to be exposed as using it and sitting in the audience a few minutes later .
Another new market for vPro is consumer .
They are getting a subset of remote power on technology in the form of Remote Wake , which will power on a computer .
Tryba said it 's most likely use would be for Internet telephony , since a lot of them go through a PC , and it would spare having to leave a computer on or turning it on to make and receive phone calls .

Barack Obama has pledged unwavering support for Israel in his first foreign policy speech since declaring himself the Democratic nominee for president .
He told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) , a prominent lobbying group , that Israel 's security was " sacrosanct " and " non-negotiable " .
He also said he would do " everything " to stop Iran getting a nuclear weapon .
As the Democrats ' primary season ended , Mr Obama received the support of enough delegates to clinch the nomination .
His rival , Hillary Clinton , has yet to concede .
I believe we need a Democrat in the White House next January
Hillary Clinton
Obama has a mountain to climb Clinton the ' insider ' swept aside
Their speeches to Aipac focused on similar topics - with Mr Obama setting out what he would do as US president , while Mrs Clinton referred to what " the next president " should do .
She told Aipac the Democratic party 's strong commitment to Israel would continue under the next Democratic president .
" I know Senator Obama understands what is at stake here , " she said .
" It is an honour to call him my friend - and let me be clear , I know that Senator Obama will be a good friend to Israel . "
Whoever gets the Democratic nomination to run for president will face Republican John McCain .
Palestinian anger Mr Obama told Aipac real security came from lasting peace in the Middle East - and he would work from the start of his administration to achieve a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli one , but with Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel - a comment rejected by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas .
DELEGATE COUNT
Winner : Needs 2,118 delegates Super- delegates : Obama , 389 ; Clinton , 282 Total delegates : Obama , 2,154 ; Clinton , 1,919 South Dakota and Montana ( early results ) : Obama , 15 ; Clinton , 13 Source : AP projections at 1000 GMT on 4 June
Delegate scorecard Crowd lifts Obama Turning his attention to Iran , Mr Obama said the US - led war in Iraq had emboldened the Islamic state , which posed a real , grave danger .
" My goal will be to eliminate this threat , " he said .
Mr Obama said " aggressive , principled diplomacy " was needed to deal with Tehran but added that he would " always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally Israel " .
Mr McCain 's senior foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann criticised Mr Obama 's speech , saying he presented " a false choice ... that the only diplomacy that can work is with Iranian leaders " .
" And Senator McCain has a very different view , that the kind of diplomacy we should pursue is with our allies , " he told the AFP news agency .
He said the Israel - American relationship was a cross-party issue - but he criticised the current administration 's policies in the region .
Unity bid Mr Obama has paid tribute to Mrs Clinton and hinted that she would play a role in any future Obama administration .
Mrs Clinton has said she would be " open " to the idea of being Mr Obama 's vice - presidential running - mate .
The final primaries of the season were held on Tuesday - with Mr Obama winning Montana and Mrs Clinton winning South Dakota .
A candidate needs 2,118 delegates to secure the nomination and Mr Obama now has the support of 2,154 delegates .
Mrs Clinton has 1,919 .
Correspondents say the Democratic campaign to choose a nominee has been deeply divisive which is why senior Democrats have called for the party to unite and focus on the general election .
They urged the remaining 150 or so super - delegates - party officials with a free choice over who to support at the party 's selection convention in August - to make their choice by Friday .
If confirmed , Mr Obama would be the first black candidate to represent a major party in a US presidential poll .
But even before the nomination is officially decided , the Republican - led US administration has offered its congratulations to Mr Obama .
President George W Bush said it was a " historic achievement " .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , the first black woman to hold the post , said it showed " an extraordinary expression of the fact that ' We the people , ' is beginning to mean all of us " .
The BBC's Justin Webb says Mr Obama 's mixed race heritage could be why he has made it this far - he runs half as a black man and half as a post- racial politician .
That , he adds , could be a winning mix .

 This is not a definitive study , but just one more that furthers the association between environmental mercury and autism ,  said lead author Raymond F. Palmer , Ph.D. , associate professor of family and community medicine at the UT Health Science Center San Antonio .
The article is in the journal Health & Place Dr. Palmer , Stephen Blanchard , Ph.D. , of Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and Robert Wood of the UT Health Science Center found that community autism prevalence is reduced by 1 percent to 2 percent with each 10 miles of distance from the pollution source .
This study was not designed to understand which individuals in the population are at risk due to mercury exposure ,  Dr. Palmer said .
 However , it does suggest generally that there is greater autism risk closer to the polluting source .
The study should encourage further investigations designed to determine the multiple routes of mercury exposure .
 The effects of persistent , low - dose exposure to mercury pollution , in addition to fish consumption , deserve attention ,  Dr. Palmer said .
 Ultimately , we will want to know who in the general population is at greatest risk based on genetic susceptibilities such as subtle deficits in the ability to detoxify heavy metals .
The new study findings are consistent with a host of other studies that confirm higher amounts of mercury in plants , animals and humans the closer they are to the pollution source .
The price on children may be the highest .
We suspect low - dose exposures to various environmental toxicants , including mercury , that occur during critical windows of neural development among genetically susceptible children may increase the risk for developmental disorders such as autism ,  the authors wrote .
Mercury - release data examined were from 39 coal - fired power plants and 56 industrial facilities in Texas .
Autism rates examined were from 1,040 Texas school districts .
For every 1,000 pounds of mercury released by all industrial sources in Texas into the environment in 1998 , there was a corresponding 2.6 percent increase in autism rates in the Texas school districts in 2002 .
For every 1,000 pounds of mercury released by Texas power plants in 1998 , there was a corresponding 3.7 percent increase in autism rates in Texas school districts in 2002 .
Autism prevalence diminished 1 percent to 2 percent for every 10 miles from the source .
Mercury exposure through fish consumption is well documented , but very little is known about exposure routes through air and ground water .
There is evidence that children and other developing organisms are more susceptible to neurobiological effects of mercury .
We need to be concerned about global mercury emissions since a substantial proportion of mercury releases are spread around the world by long - range air and ocean currents ,  Dr. Palmer said .
 Steps for controlling and eliminating mercury pollution on a worldwide basis may be advantageous .
This entails greener , non-mercury - polluting technologies .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) estimated environmental mercury releases at 158 million tons annually nationwide in the late 1990s , the time period studied by the Texas team .
Most exposures were said to come from coal - fired utility plants ( 33 percent of exposures ) , municipal / medical waste incinerators ( 29 percent ) and commercial / industrial boilers ( 18 percent ) .
Cement plants also release mercury .
With the enactment of clean air legislation and other measures , mercury deposition into the environment is decreasing slightly .
Dr. Palmer and his colleagues pointed out the study did not reflect the true community prevalence rates of autism because children younger than school age are not counted in the Texas Education Agency data system .
The 1:500 autism rates in the study are lower than the 1:150 autism rates in recent reports of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Furthermore , the authors note that distance was not calculated from individual homes to the pollution source but from central points in school districts that varied widely in area .
Data for environmentally released mercury were from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory .
Data for releases by coal - fired power plants came from the same inventory and from the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality .
Data for school district autism came from the Texas Education Agency .
Adapted from materials provided by University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio .
Lewandowski earlier criticized ( see below ) that distance to a point source is not necessarily related to level of exposure .
While Texas is a significant source of mercury emissions , depending on the mercury species being emitted , the mercury from these emissions is largely deposited hundreds to thousands of miles to the east .
Lewandowski therefore argues that is highly unlikely that mercury emitted in a particular county or school district can be correlated with air mercury exposures in that locality .

Now that iPhone 2.0 is out I started playing around with some of the new web features , and soon found that I had created the prototypical virtual light table that ’s an essential demo for any new multitouch technology .
It ’s about 100 lines of JavaScript .
It grabs the 10 latest photos from Flickr ’s “ interesting photos ” API and randomly places them on the screen for you to play with :
This is great if you have an iPhone with the 2.0 software , but desktop browsers should get some multitouch love too .
So I started writing a little bridge that fakes multitouch events in desktop browsers .
It ’s far from complete , but it ’s just good enough to get the virtual light table demo working .
So go ahead and load it up in the new iPhone MobileSafari or Safari 3.1 + / WebKit nightly ( requires CSS transforms ) :
http://tlrobinson.net/iphone/lighttable/
In desktop browsers it uses the previous clicked location as a second “ touch ” , so you can click a photo then click and drag another spot on the photo to resize and rotate ( notice the yellow dot ) .
For a good overview of touch events and gestures , check out this SitePen blog post and Apple ’s documentation .
Here ’s the source for the fake multitouch bridge :
http://tlrobinson.net/iphone/lighttable/multitouch-fake.js.
Clearly the reverse of this bridge would be even more useful , since iPhone only sends mouse events under specific conditions .
The mousedown , mouseup , and mousemove events could be emulated using the touch equivalents to make certain web apps work on the iPhone without much additional work .
Of course you would need to either cancel the default actions ( i.e. panning and zooming ) on touch events , or have some way to manage the interactions between them .
The Revolutionary Guards ' investigation into last weekend 's explosion is understood to be looking into the possibility that it was caused by sabotage .
Iran has suffered a number of unexplained explosions in recent months , including an explosion at a mosque in Shiraz , which had been holding a military exhibition , and another incident at a missile site that killed dozens of Iranian technicians .
Earlier today I posted Operation " Rescue Fannie " Underway - Paulson a Blatant Liar .
Since then , additional details are trickling out .
Consider Paulson 's Statement on Freddie Mac , Fannie Mae .
First , as a liquidity backstop , the plan includes a temporary increase in the line of credit the GSEs have with Treasury .
Treasury would determine the terms and conditions for accessing the line of credit and the amount to be drawn .
Second , to ensure the GSEs have access to sufficient capital to continue to serve their mission , the plan includes temporary authority for Treasury to purchase equity in either of the two GSEs if needed .
Use of either the line of credit or the equity investment would carry terms and conditions necessary to protect the taxpayer .
Third , to protect the financial system from systemic risk going forward , the plan strengthens the GSE regulatory reform legislation currently moving through Congress by giving the Federal Reserve a consultative role in the new GSE regulator 's process for setting capital requirements and other prudential standards .
Paulson , speaking on the steps of the Treasury facing the White House , asked Congress for authority to buy unlimited stakes in and lend to the companies , aiming to stem a collapse in confidence .
The Federal Reserve separately authorized the firms to borrow directly from the central bank .
" They appear to be crossing the Rubicon , " Sean Egan , president of Egan - Jones Ratings Co. , a credit - rating company based in Haverford , Pennsylvania , said , referring to Caesar 's invasion of Italy to set up a dictatorship .
Paulson 's proposal , which the Treasury anticipates will be incorporated into an existing congressional bill and approved this week , signals a shift toward an explicit guarantee of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt .
The shareholder - owned companies are government - sponsored enterprises , giving investors the indication of an implicit federal backing .

Cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells could be commercially viable in 15 years , according to a new report , but only if engineers overcome technological hurdles and the government pumps $ 55 billion into their development .
The primary barriers to adoption are high costs and the absence of an infrastructure to distribute hydrogen [ CNET ] , according to the federally funded study .
Several car companies are already leasing their experimental fuel - cell cars , but the report says they wo n't be a mass - market hit until 2023 at the earliest .
Automakers do n't disclose the costs of the few hundred fuel cell vehicles on the roads -- but generally say it costs $ 1 million to $ 2 million to produce one in such low volumes .
The main expense is the platinum in the fuel stack , which accounts for 57 percent of the fuel stack cost [ The Detroit News ] .
Hydrogen cars have been touted as an environmentally benign fix for America 's car culture for years .
The technology combines hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity that powers the car , with drips of water the only byproduct ; traditional vehicles emit greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming .
Even President Bush has promoted hydrogen vehicles :
In 2003 , President Bush had proposed spending $ 1.2 billion to develop fuel cells and infrastructure [ Reuters ] .
The new report acknowledges the long road ahead for hydrogen car development but does n't suggest pulling back from the research ; instead it recommends a " portfolio approach " of pursuing different transportation technologies , including fuel cells , biofuels , and fuel efficiency
[ CNET ] .
closer to commercial viability .
But according to Paul Scott , an electric car advocate , the study really suggests that research should focus on plug - in electric cars , which are
" It 's obviously ridiculous to put all the emphasis on a technology that 's decades away when our needs are imminent , " Scott said [ Reuters ] .
For a little more perspective on the environmental impact of the first hydrogen cars , see the DISCOVER review , " Under the Hood of the First Real Fuel - Cell Car . "

Comcast tech : " What am I doing here ? " -- my servi
Two weeks before my planned move ( about 3 miles , a different neighborhood ) I called Comcast to schedule the transfer of my service .
The online guy was great , took my new address down and said everything was all set .
He said I could move my modem to the new address , connect it , call Comcast and within 5 minutes be up and running as normal .
Great , I thought , I hope it really does work like that .
On moving day , the movers took care of the furniture while I moved my computer equipment .
Once at the new place and settled in a bit , I set up the computer and modem .
Service was already active it seemed , I could browse , get email , etc .
So , I called Comcast as instructed .
I was told that I could NOT get service at my new location because the previous tenent had not disconnected their service .
I informed them that I had signed the lease on the place nearly a month previous , that there had been no tenent here for at least that long , but the CSR was adamant that there was nothing she could do , I could not transfer my service to my new address until the previous service was disconnected .
That disconnect was scheduled for 4 days away and was due to the account being delinquent .
I asked if they could automatically transfer service to me at that time , she said no .
I was informed by her and her supervisor that on that day someone would come out and physically disconnect the service and I would then have to call to schedule an appointment for reconnection .
I asked when the next available appointment : two weeks !
" You mean I have to be without service for two weeks ???? " , I asked .
" Yes , there 's nothing we can do about it , the account is delinquent and must be disconnected physically . "
" But * I * do n't have a delinquent account , so why am * I* being punished for it ? "
I got nowhere with the CSRs and supervisors , so I called the Executive Complaint Center and spoke with a nice guy there who took down everything .
I was called back a few hours later by another guy who said what I 'd been told and the actions taken so far should NOT have occurred .
He later called back and said that the best he could do is get the service reconnected ( after the disconnect ) two days later , so I would have two days of no service .
I sighed and said I appreciated his help and would accept that .
The day of disconnect came , and went , with no disconnect .
I still had service , tv and internet functioned as normal .
The next day the same .
Then on Saturday , the day my reconnect is to occur , the technician shows up at my door .
He comes in and I tell him that the service is working .
He looks at my modem , he looks at the TV .
I explained to him the scenario and he just says , " Then what am I doing here ? " .
He spoke an expletive about the CSRs and said that was typical " BS " from them , he said they could have transferred the service without sending him out here to waste his time .
I felt sorry for him , he apologized for the interruption of my day and left .
Later , the guy from the Executive office called to make sure my install went ok .
I told him what had happened and he apologized .
He said that it was obvious there was a breakdown in the system somewhere that needed to be addressed .
Now I just wait to see what my bill will look like , when service start / stop and such .
I hope I do n't have to jump through hoops all over again .

Comcast tech : " What am I doing here ? " -- my s actually what happened is the way it should happen .
when a new install is scheduled the disconnect gets rescheduled and is only completed IF the new install gets rescheduled .
when a new sub moves in its actually good practice to send a tech out .
the tech wasnt supposed to just look and see it was working .
he was suppose to check levels at all outlets and make sure everything was up to spec .

Some should tell the CSRs what the actual procedures are , then .
It seems they are only told just enough to frustrate customers .
Even the " supervisors " I spoke with were seemingly uninformed on how this worked .
There is still a great deal of work Comcast needs to do on their customer service .

What should have happened is the disco got no trucked , and you got scheduled for an install or a self install .
A tech coming out and verifying levels is a good idea but not a requirement , you can self install the modem and and dct's , the csr can transfer the EQ to the new account so the only real thing would be re provisioning the modem , get your account number at the new residence , and choose customer when you get the weird comcast screen for every web page you try to go to .
No idea what rody is talking about .

this same thing happened to my boss when he moved into his new house just recently .
there was nothing that Comcast could / would do , and he had to wait for the billing to be straightened out , which they expected him to pay the past - due balance , which took him some effort to fight .
good luck !

This is n't the case everywhere , assuming it is where you live .
Though a customer can get the modem provisioned remotely , Comcast tends to ask their csr's to send out a tech anyway to new connects / reconnects ; in my opinion , it makes sense for the simple fact that it * can * avoid future and multiple trouble calls due to self installs and remotely activating services not working .
Boxes can get trickier as , from my understanding , you can't use the same box in two different corps : ie - if you 're moving from an area where the first five digits ( corp ) on your account is " 01691 , " you generally can't use it in an area where the first five digits on your new account is " 09513 " ( both examples used are two corps in the same city , Philadelphia - which is also interesting because those two corps are unique to the point where you could literally move to the next house over and be in 1691 after moving from 9513 ) .
This case , in my opinion , is generally the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing and vice - versa - a major flaw within Comcast I still believe .
I 'd venture to say that techs do not know the protocols that CSRs / CAEs have to follow , and definitely in vice - versa ... then when you go complain about this to the executive office I 'd argue that they REALLY do n't know what either group is doing as logic does n't always dictate what rules are actually in place ( but this is the same with many companies , lol ) .
You can tell that no one knew what the other was doing - even the exec office , as yes - what CT3 said , everything could have been no trucked and done remotely for the fastest results .
Problem here lies in that the fastest results do n't always provide the best results - too many failed SIKs , really .
Though , something about this thread does n't pan out .
Fuzi stated that he did a " transfer of service . "
Now , as far as I know , the transfer would NOT have completed on the day he was trying to set it up online if the new address he was moving in was still active .
The day he set up the transfer , the new address would have been listed in Comcast 's database as a " Pending Install . "
Now , even though the online rep was probably a nice guy , did this chat rep not actually do the transfer ?
There 's something more to this , because I 've never even heard of a rep successfully transferring service to an address that was n't at least in pending disconnect .

Thanks for attempting to call me a liar .
I called Comcast before my move to set up a transfer of service .
That 's what I asked for and that 's what the CSR I spoke with discussed with me .
He told me all I would need to do is connect my modem at the new address , call Comcast , and everything would be set within 5 minutes .
Am I supposed to second - guess every Comcast employee ?
Am I supposed to know what they can and cannot do ?
Am I supposed to know the status of the new address somehow ?
Just how much mind - reading and technical knowledge is the CUSTOMER supposed to have in order to get competent service from Comcast ?
How many calls to how many people are required ?

Typically when a customer attempts to either setup new service , or transfer service , to an address that is in pending disconnect ( for non-pay ) , the agent will either not be able to setup service at that address , or can go in and " complete " the disconnection ( it 's only so the old account is finalized , no physical disconnection is done since service is starting again ) .
If the customer has equipment from Comcast ( i.e. digital box , modem , emta ) , they are normally not allowed to use the same equipment at their new residence and would require that a tech comes out , sets everything up and takes the old equipment .
It 's very very rare that an agent will transfer service and not send a tech out , but it has happened .
But it 's never good policy , for many reasons .
When you connected your modem at the new location , it worked because you must have been in the same corp and the disconnection from the previous tenant did not occur .
Without looking at your account , it 's difficult to say where the problem lies .
I suspect that the first agent you spoke with ( " The online guy was great , took my new address down and said everything was all set . " ) did nothing .
If he did make sure everything was " set " , then you would n't have any of these problems .
I believe the online support is based in Manila .
How can Comcast improve ?
Very simple .
When a pending disconnect notice is entered into the system to do a physical disconnection ( whether it 's for non-pay , or because the customer requested it ) , Comcast must attempt to do it as quickly as possible .
I have seen pending disconnects scheduled for 1 - 2 weeks AFTER the customer called .
What then occurs is there is a conflict with the new tenants , which is what happened with you .
And as always , markets vary and so does your mileage .
Sorry you had the problems .
Hope everything has been corrected .

Sterling Heights , MI baineschile Premium Member Never gonna happen like that .
Comcast waits on pending disconnects for 2 reasons .
1 . If the customer leaves comcast for a different company , in the 2 week period between the requested disconnect day , and the actualy physical disconnection , a team within comcast calls the customer to try and win them back .
If they do so sucessfully , no truck has to be rolled .
2. as long as a customer is still connected to the system , requested disconnect or not , they are considered a subscriber .
Comcast , near the end of fiscal quarters , limits the amount of physical disconnects ( dont forget , bills have already been stopped ) to semi-inflate their numbers

chat rep ... based on what I 'm actually saying .
I 'm questioning if you were screwed from the beginning , NOT once you actually moved into the new home .
Communication breakdown started as soon as rep 1 told you it was okay to just go ahead , take your modem to the new location , and call comcast to get started .
Sorry if you thought otherwise .
EDIT - I did n't read further down myself , as Rob ( a wise man throughout these comcast forums , IMO ) just said the exact same thing - but probably with much better wording than how I said it quote :

All of the CSRs I spoke with were in the USA , there was no foreign accent with any of them .
It just appears that there are divisions in Comcast and they do n't communicate well with each other .
I find it ironic they advertise , which I 've seen several times recently , the ability to quickly transfer your service with one call , when that obviously does n't occur .
I 've spoken now with 5 other people with similar stories to my own here in Atlanta .
Maybe this is an Atlanta breakdown ?

I must have misunderstood when you said " The online guy " , which I took it as you having chatted using the online chat feature and not on the phone .

I asked when the next available appointment : two weeks !
" You mean I have to be without service for two weeks ???? " , I asked .
" Yes , there 's nothing we can do about it , the account is delinquent and must be disconnected physically . "
" But * I * do n't have a delinquent account , so why am * I* being punished for it ? "
I got nowhere with the CSRs and supervisors , so I called the Executive Complaint Center and spoke with a nice guy there who took down everything .
I was called back a few hours later by another guy who said what I 'd been told and the actions taken so far should NOT have occurred .
He later called back and said that the best he could do is get the service reconnected ( after the disconnect ) two days later , so I would have two days of no service .
I sighed and said I appreciated his help and would accept that .
The day of disconnect came , and went , with no disconnect .
I still had service , tv and internet functioned as normal .
The next day the same .
Then on Saturday , the day my reconnect is to occur , the technician shows up at my door .
He comes in and I tell him that the service is working .
He looks at my modem , he looks at the TV .
I explained to him the scenario and he just says , " Then what am I doing here ? " .
He spoke an expletive about the CSRs and said that was typical " BS " from them , he said they could have transferred the service without sending him out here to waste his time .
I felt sorry for him , he apologized for the interruption of my day and left .
Later , the guy from the Executive office called to make sure my install went ok .
I told him what had happened and he apologized .
He said that it was obvious there was a breakdown in the system somewhere that needed to be addressed .
Now I just wait to see what my bill will look like , when service start / stop and such .
I hope I do n't have to jump through hoops all over again .
Two weeks before my planned move ( about 3 miles , a different neighborhood ) I called Comcast to schedule the transfer of my service .
The online guy was great , took my new address down and said everything was all set .
He said I could move my modem to the new address , connect it , call Comcast and within 5 minutes be up and running as normal .
Great , I thought , I hope it really does work like that .
On moving day , the movers took care of the furniture while I moved my computer equipment .
Once at the new place and settled in a bit , I set up the computer and modem .
Service was already active it seemed , I could browse , get email , etc .
So , I called Comcast as instructed .
I was told that I could NOT get service at my new location because the previous tenent had not disconnected their service .
I informed them that I had signed the lease on the place nearly a month previous , that there had been no tenent here for at least that long , but the CSR was adamant that there was nothing she could do , I could not transfer my service to my new address until the previous service was disconnected .
That disconnect was scheduled for 4 days away and was due to the account being delinquent .
I asked if they could automatically transfer service to me at that time , she said no .
I was informed by her and her supervisor that on that day someone would come out and physically disconnect the service and I would then have to call to schedule an appointment for reconnection .

Take your lease and goto the local office .
They could have disconnected the account right away and put it in your name .

The real internal procedural breakdown happened in the first paragraph .
Most comcast areas are not able to setup installs on top of an active account .
The previous tenant / owner has to call and schedule a disconnect / transfer .
The residence does not need to be physically disconnected for service to be installed .

its actually pretty clear .
the house was up for nonpay disconnect .
when the new customer moved in and informed comcast that he was getting service .
comcast reschedules the disconnect and sets up a install for the new customer .
what part of that dont you understand ?
ive worked for comcast since early 1992 .
have you ?
we as techs roll on these types of jobs probably 5 to 10 times a week .
we dont just say we shouldnt be here and leave .
we check all outlets and replace all the fittings and relocate outlets as needed and make sure all levels are up to specs .
just because its active at the tap doesnt mean jack .
let me ask you if you no truck the disconnect which completes the job what happens if the customer isnt home for the install .
i will do you a favor and answer the question for you .
the customer gets free service until a audit which might be 10 years down the line .
thats why they reschedule it and dont no truck complete it .
im not a dispatcher but even i can understand why you dont no truck complete a disconnect unless the customer is standing in front of you with id in hand .
remember he was doing this over the phone and online not in person .

How can Comcast improve ?
Very simple .
When a pending disconnect notice is entered into the system to do a physical disconnection ( whether it 's for non-pay , or because the customer requested it ) , Comcast must attempt to do it as quickly as possible .
I have seen pending disconnects scheduled for 1 - 2 weeks AFTER the customer called .
What then occurs is there is a conflict with the new tenants , which is what happened with you .

want to delay the physical disco for a reasonable amount of time .
The reason is that it saves the install tech a trip to the tap to reconnect if a new install follows right on the heels of previous service , or more importantly , a trip into the wiring closet in an MDU .
In a single family home , it 's not a big deal - tap access is a given , but in a lot of MDU installs , you can save some CAE from having to explain to an irate customer that , even though the tech is standing right there with your modem and cable box , he can't actually install you because the building maintenance guy - the one guy who has a key to the wire room - is only available on alternate Sundays between 5 and 7 AM .
Rescheduling a WIP marked " NO ACCESS " is really not much fun , for customers , techs , or CAEs
Anyway , what should happen in this sort of case is that someone needs to notice that disconnects have two dates attached to them - an effective date , when the billing stops , and a schedule date , when a tech actually rolls out to do the physical disconnect .
As long as the effective date has passed , there 's no reason a new install can't be done , even if the schedule date has n't come to pass yet - as I said , you actually want to do it that way whenever possible , to avoid problems for the new install .
Actually , no , you want to do exactly the opposite , particularly for MDU situations - youto delay the physical disco for a reasonable amount of time .

The nearest " local office " is 25 miles away in a not - so - nice area of town .
I should n't have to drive 50 miles round - trip and wait in a line that snakes around the building ( which is what I saw last time I was there ) just to get service .

Quakertown , PA 4 edits rody _44 Premium Member comcast has to balance what to do when a sub leaves owing them money .
you cant just keep activating equipment when a sub says he just moved in lol .
nobody would pay the bill and just call and give another name every three months .
you also cant just disconnect a active sub because someone says they moved in when the old sub hasnt even requested a disconnect .
people often make mistakes with addresses when they move into new places .
i can see it now , comcast says someone else lives here and disconnected my equipment .
in this case it wasnt perfect but it was pretty close to the way it has to be .
its always a balancing act .
some will work out one way and some will work out the other .
if you cant fax a copy of the needed documintation or visit your area comcast its up in the air which way its going to go .
but let me ask you say you lived in that address and were unit 2 and comcast allowed it without documents and it turned out you were unit 4 you would be pretty upset when comcast shut your stuff off when you didnt make any changes .
you can fax the needed documents here also .
not over the internet or on the phone tho .
you have to ask yourself is it worth the trip or not .
when in conflict they need proof either way it goes .

It still boils down to the fact that the ads saying " Easy Move " are n't accurate .
Maybe they should clarify that the " Easy Move " is only for people moving to a new , detached home or condo that nobody has ever lived in and had service at previously .
If someone at Comcast had asked me to fax a copy of my lease , I would have done so , I was never given that option .
Not any of the CSRs or their supervisors .
The Executive Center guy DID call the former tenant and confirmed they no longer lived here , but that did n't change anything .
The fact remains , Comcast 's bureaucracy is a customer nightmare and all of their hype about improving customer service is for naught until they address that root cause .

I believe your complaint and anger should be directed at the deadbeat who moved out and left the deliquent account at your new address .
Cable companies and utilities can't be blamed for that .
There are guidelines and rules that companies have to follow when one person is trying to deal with another persons account .
I believe if you took your lease agreement and appropriate photo ID to the Comcast office , as suggested above , you could have the issue straightened out in short order .
You have an option .
Terry I moved from one apartment to another November last year .
Somebody certainly lived here before .
Had cable and phone service too .
I made arrangements to transfer my utilities , Comcast cable tv/HSI and my Qwest telephone to the new address about a week or 10 days prior to the move .
It was an " easy and seemless move " ... I believe your complaint and anger should be directed at the deadbeat who moved out and left the deliquent account at your new address .

Terry Comcast 's problems with deadbeat customers should not have ANY effect on other customers .
That is a billing issue between Comcast and the deadbeat , not me .
As an already established customer , with an excellent account record , and my identity already verified , there should never be any reason to question MY integrity .
Again , if anyone at Comcast , the numerous CSRs and their supervisors , had stated I could fax or bring a copy of my lease to them to solve the issue , I would have done so .
Comcast dropped the ball bigtime on this issue .
So now it is MY responsibility to determine whether the previous tenant is a deadbeat and to seek them out ????
Perhaps that should be spelled out in Comcast 's advertisements , as well , then .
Comcast 's problems with deadbeat customers should not have ANY effect on other customers .

I would say that , if you 're so inclined , it can't hurt at all to write up an actual letter describing your experience in as much detail as possible , and mail it in to your local office .
It may be that , for some reason , they do n't have a procedure whereby you can just fax in proof of residence .
Or maybe you just had the bad luck to run into an agent who was n't up to speed on transfer procedures .
Either way , whether it prompts them to look into streamlining the process for customers , or whether it prompts them to have a sit - down chat with the agent (s ) you spoke to to make sure everyone 's on the same page , sharing your frustrations will very often help improve the customer service experience .
Written complaints tend to be taken pretty seriously , in my experience , and it sounds like you definitely have a legitimate issue here - moving is stressful enough , even when it goes smoothly , and the last thing you need is the cable company adding to the stress
Good luck !
I do n't blame you for being frustrated - normally your move should go more smoothly than that , but obviously something went wrong this time .

fuziwuzi Premium Member I do have to say that Daryl at the Executive Complaint Center has been a great asset to Comcast .
I think he helped make a bad situation somewhat better , though even he was limited by the bureaucracy in what he could accomplish .
Hopefully , through him , some changes may be advanced to make situations like this less likely in the future .
Amazon S3 Availability Event : July 20 , 2008
We wanted to provide some additional detail about the problem we experienced on Sunday , July 20th .
At 8:40 am PDT , error rates in all Amazon S3 datacenters began to quickly climb and our alarms went off .
By 8:50 am PDT , error rates were significantly elevated and very few requests were completing successfully .
By 8:55 am PDT , we had multiple engineers engaged and investigating the issue .
Our alarms pointed at problems processing customer requests in multiple places within the system and across multiple data centers .
While we began investigating several possible causes , we tried to restore system health by taking several actions to reduce system load .
We reduced system load in several stages , but it had no impact on restoring system health .
At 9:41 am PDT , we determined that servers within Amazon S3 were having problems communicating with each other .
As background information , Amazon S3 uses a gossip protocol to quickly spread server state information throughout the system .
This allows Amazon S3 to quickly route around failed or unreachable servers , among other things .
When one server connects to another as part of processing a customer 's request , it starts by gossiping about the system state .
Only after gossip is completed will the server send along the information related to the customer request .
On Sunday , we saw a large number of servers that were spending almost all of their time gossiping and a disproportionate amount of servers that had failed while gossiping .
With a large number of servers gossiping and failing while gossiping , Amazon S3 was n't able to successfully process many customer requests .
At 10:32 am PDT , after exploring several options , we determined that we needed to shut down all communication between Amazon S3 servers , shut down all components used for request processing , clear the system 's state , and then reactivate the request processing components .
By 11:05 am PDT , all server - to - server communication was stopped , request processing components shut down , and the system 's state cleared .
By 2:20 pm PDT , we 'd restored internal communication between all Amazon S3 servers and began reactivating request processing components concurrently in both the US and EU .
At 2:57 pm PDT , Amazon S3's EU location began successfully completing customer requests .
The EU location came back online before the US because there are fewer servers in the EU .
By 3:10 pm PDT , request rates and error rates in the EU had returned to normal .
At 4:02 pm PDT , Amazon S3's US location began successfully completing customer requests , and request rates and error rates had returned to normal by 4:58 pm PDT .
We 've now determined that message corruption was the cause of the server - to - server communication problems .
More specifically , we found that there were a handful of messages on Sunday morning that had a single bit corrupted such that the message was still intelligible , but the system state information was incorrect .
We use MD5 checksums throughout the system , for example , to prevent , detect , and recover from corruption that can occur during receipt , storage , and retrieval of customers ' objects .
However , we did n't have the same protection in place to detect whether this particular internal state information had been corrupted .
As a result , when the corruption occurred , we did n't detect it and it spread throughout the system causing the symptoms described above .
We had n't encountered server - to - server communication issues of this scale before and , as a result , it took some time during the event to diagnose and recover from it .
During our post - mortem analysis we 've spent quite a bit of time evaluating what happened , how quickly we were able to respond and recover , and what we could do to prevent other unusual circumstances like this from having system - wide impacts .
Here are the actions that we 're taking : ( a ) we 've deployed several changes to Amazon S3 that significantly reduce the amount of time required to completely restore system - wide state and restart customer request processing ; ( b ) we 've deployed a change to how Amazon S3 gossips about failed servers that reduces the amount of gossip and helps prevent the behavior we experienced on Sunday ; ( c ) we 've added additional monitoring and alarming of gossip rates and failures ; and , ( d ) we 're adding checksums to proactively detect corruption of system state messages so we can log any such messages and then reject them .
Finally , we want you to know that we are passionate about providing the best storage service at the best price so that you can spend more time thinking about your business rather than having to focus on building scalable , reliable infrastructure .
Though we 're proud of our operational performance in operating Amazon S3 for almost 2.5 years , we know that any downtime is unacceptable and we wo n't be satisfied until performance is statistically indistinguishable from perfect .
Sincerely ,
The Amazon S3 Team
( Adds comment from transport ministry , details )
MUMBAI , July 2 ( Reuters ) - Millions of Indian truckers went on strike on Wednesday to protest against high taxes and rising fuel bills , union leaders said , adding that a meeting with the transport ministry had failed to resolve the dispute .
Trucks provide the transport lifeline of India ’s economy and a lengthy strike would threaten not only goods supplies but also industrial output .
Diesel sales could drop sharply .
“ About 4.5 million trucks are off the road as part of our indefinite strike .
Transportation of all goods , including essential items , has been stopped , ” said S.K. Sharma , an adviser to the All India Motor Transport Congress .
“ We have to wait and watch for the government ’s response . ”
T.R. Baalu , India ’s transport minister , released a statement asking the transporter associations to end their strike , saying the ministry was trying to sort out their problems .
In the southern city of Chennai , about 1,000 protesters waved placards in a noisy rally , while vegetable vendors said people had already began panic buying potatoes and other groceries .
Any prolonged action will add to the woes of India ’s coalition government , which is already battling inflation soaring at a 13 - year high .
Also , its communist allies are threatening to withdraw support over a nuclear deal with the United States , raising the prospect of a snap election .
Charan Singh Lohara , president of the truckers ’ congress , which represents both large and small operations , and other representatives met transport ministry officials on Wednesday .
The ministry said in its statement that it had explained in the meeting the reasoning behind some of the rate hikes , and was trying to solve some of the other problems raised .
Lohara said he was unhappy with the minister ’s response , and that the strike would continue “ until the government solves our problems . ”
A similar week - long strike in August 2004 pulled monthly diesel sales down 9.3 percent from a year earlier and hurt annual growth in industrial output because of disrupted shipments .
Lohara said earlier most of the 4 million trucks he expected to stay off the roads were long - distance cargo carriers , consuming between 75 and 80 litres of diesel a day .
He told Reuters on Tuesday that fuel retailers had been forcing commercial vehicles to meet half of their fuel consumption through costlier branded diesel for the last ten days .
A senior official at leading retailer Indian Oil Corp said the cheaper diesel was still available at highway outlets but customers were being “ encouraged ” to buy branded fuel in cities .
The transport ministry said in its statement that it was looking into the issue of “ forced selling ” of branded fuel with the petroleum ministry .
India caps the prices of normal petrol and diesel sold through fuel stations but no such price control exists for branded fuels , which are still much cheaper than if prices were market - determined .
The Indian government , which heavily subsidises fuel prices to protect the poor , raised the retail price of petrol and diesel by about 10 percent this month to partly pass on the soaring cost of crude oil .
But many of the country ’s states cut local taxes to soften the impact on consumers .

In the 1960s , Robert Harvey , a biomedical postgraduate student , encountered the miracle berry , a fruit from west Africa which turns sour tastes to sweet .

The Miracle Berry , presented by Tom Mangold , is on Radio 4 at 2100 BST on 28 April Or listen again on the BBC iPlayer " You can eat a berry and then bite into a lemon , " says Harvey .
" It becomes not only sweeter , but it will be the best lemon you 've tasted in your life . "
More importantly , this " miracle " can be used to manufacture sweet tasting foods without sugar or sweeteners , which have always been plagued by an after - taste .
Spotting the potential health benefits , and the healthy profits , that the miracle berry promised , Harvey founded the Miralin Company to grow the berry in Jamaica and Puerto Rico , extract its active ingredient in laboratories in Hudson , Massachusetts , and market it across the United States .
At first , Harvey aimed his products at diabetics .
" In market testing , diabetics thought our product , as the name implies , was a miracle . "
But Harvey 's sweet dream of making the world healthier came to an abrupt end .
On the eve of the launch in 1974 , the US Food and Drugs Administration unexpectedly turned against the product .
MIRACLE BERRY
Also known as " miracle fruit " or Synsepalum dulcificum Grown in Africa , first documented in 18th Century Acts on the sour receptors of the tongue , turning sour tastes sweet Effect lasts 30 mins - two hours Effect is destroyed in hot foods - eg coffee and baked foods Renders an accompanying dry white wine sickly sweet Legal advice and contact with the FDA had led Harvey to believe that the extract from the berry would be allowed under the classification " generally recognised as safe " .
Having been eaten before meals for centuries in west Africa , without anecdotal reports of problems , it could be assumed not to be harmful .
But the FDA decided it would be considered as an additive which required several years more testing .
In the poor economic climate of 1974 , this could not be funded and the company folded .
" I was in shock , " says Harvey .
" We were on very good terms with the FDA and enjoyed their full support .
There was no sign of any problem .
Without any opportunity to know what the concern was and who raised it , and to respond to it - they just banned the product . "
He remembers a number of strange events leading up to the FDA 's decision , beginning immediately after one particular market research test .
His investors , including Reynolds Metals , Barclays and Prudential , had put up big money .
They were looking for big returns .
" From the beginning my interest was in the diabetic market but my backers wanted to put double zeros after the numbers we were projecting . "

So , in the summer of 1974 , miracle berry ice lollies , in four different flavours , were compared to similar , sugar - sweetened versions by schoolchildren in Boston .
The berry won every time .
Don Emery , then vice president of the Miralin company , recalls the excitement .
" If we had got beyond the diabetic market we could have been a multi-billion dollar company .
We 'd have displaced maybe millions of tons of sugar and lots of artificial sweeteners as well . "
A few weeks later , things turned sour .
A car was spotted driving back and forwards past Miralin 's offices , slowing down as someone took photographs of the building .
Then , late one night , Harvey was followed as he drove home .
" I sped up , then he sped up .
I pulled into this dirt access road and turned off my lights and the other car went past the end of the road at a very high speed .
Clearly I was being monitored . "
Sugar denial Finally , at the end of that summer , Harvey and Emery arrived back at the office after dinner to find they were being burgled .
The burglars escaped and were never found , but the main FDA file was left lying open on the floor .
A few weeks later the FDA , which had previously been very supportive , wrote to Miralin , effectively banning its product .
No co-incidence , according to Don Emery .
Obesity is a massive problem in the West " I honestly believe that we were done in by some industrial interest that did not want to see us survive because we were a threat .
Somebody influenced somebody in the FDA to cause the regulatory action that was taken against us . "
The Sugar Association , the trade body representing " Big Sugar " in the US , declined to be interviewed on the subject but flatly denied that the industry had exerted any influence over the FDA .
The Calorie Control Council , which represents artificial sweetener manufacturers in the US , has failed to respond to questions on the issue .
The Food and Drugs Administration also refused to be interviewed and has indicated that a Freedom of Information ( FOI ) legislation request to look at the relevant FDA files will not be considered for a year .
Robert Harvey had requested the same files over 30 years ago .
" We got back the most redacted information I 've ever seen from FOI .
Everything was blacked out .
There would have been material in the file that would have embarrassed the FDA , I believe . "
Faced with this silence , it 's virtually impossible to assess what actually happened to prevent the miracle berry 's progress to a sugar - free market .
This would be the best lemon you ever tasted But one thing is certain , it never got the chance to prove whether it really would have provided a miracle in our ever fattening world .
And for Robert Harvey , that 's the biggest shame of all .
" It was a big loss not only for my employees and shareholders but , even more importantly , for diabetics and other people with special dietary needs .
It was tragic . "
But all hope is not lost for the berry 's champions .
Today a firm called BioResources International is trying to produce freeze - dried miracle berry at a plant in New Jersey .
Dieters will watch the outcome closely .
Below is a selection of your comments .
Are we to assume that the non-US market simply was n't big enough ?
The FDA , for all their power , have no jurisdiction in , say Canada , Mexico or France .
Make it there , sell it for seven years as proof of safety and then ship it back to the States .
Mark Bell , Guildford , England
What a surprise .
How many foods now have sugar added , that never had sugar before ?
Things like tinned soups and most heat - and - serve savoury convenience foods have sugar in , and make the food unhealthy .
Nobody needs sugar in mince or in any meat foods .
Sometimes we need a quick ready meal , and the convenience foods play a role .
Are people so used to sugar nothing tastes right without it ?
We need a Claire Rayner type of person to start a campaign .
Fingers crossed for BiResources - this berry could well save lives .
The sugar industry has a lot to answer for .
Marian , Hull " Faced with this silence , it 's virtually impossible to assess what actually happened to prevent the miracle berry 's progress to a sugar - free market . "
It 's easy to assess what might have happened .
The sugar companies happened .
Far too big an industry to be brought down by a berry .
The same would happen with oil companies too , if " they " ever come up with a viable alternative ...
Hazel Love , Brighton , UK I remember , years ago , talk of a water injection system for petrol engines to reduce fuel consumption .
The inventor claimed he was sabotaged by the big oil companies .
So , budding Woodward & Bernsteins , do these big - business conspiracy theories stack up ?
Stan Thomas , Wrexham , UK I am a little surprised that the big backers were unable to get to the bottom of it but " Big Sugar " is a massively powerful lobby , with the same approach to health as the cigarette companies .
Dr AGP Laxton , Carmarthen
Try putting salt on a grapefruit and you get the same effect .
I believe it also sweetens lemons .
Peter Leach , Epping Perhaps he should be invited and welcomed with open arms by the UK govt .
to set up business here ?
It 's an obvious long - term health benefit in the western world , and a potentially valuable cash crop for the developing world .
Peter Jones , Lancaster , England I am diabetic 2 , and need to control my diabetes by tablets and watching my diet / food intake .
This sounds like someone did not want this to come to market , where it could possibly be of great help to people like me .
Mr John Bryan Jackson , Euxton , Lancs I fail to understand authorities who simply ban such a product , with the potential to perhaps save lives of people who through no fault of their own have a " sweet tooth " and therefore put on weight which simply destroys their quality of life .
This " miracle berry " seems to me to reduce the chemicals used to produce sugar substitutes .

Cool Roofs – Technology you should be using
July 23 , 2008 at 7:46 am
It seems very obvious that the surface on our buildings that is most visible to the warming of sunlight should be the first we would address from an insulation and energy saving perspective , but it ’s often forgotten .
Cool roofs come in many types and configurations and certainly one will be the right one for you site .
First we should probably define what a “ cool roof ” is .
From the Cool Roof Rating Council ( http://www.coolroofs.org/)
What is a Cool Roof ?
A cool roof reflects and emits the sun ’s heat back to the sky instead of transferring it to the building below .
“ Coolness ” is measured by two properties , solar reflectance and thermal emittance .
Both properties are measured from 0 to 1 and the higher the value , the “ cooler ” the roof .
Benefits of cool roofs include : Energy savings and global warming mitigation
Reduction in urban heat island effect and smog
Improved occupant comfort
Comply with codes and green building programs
Also on this site is a very comprehensive directory of reviewed technologies and products :
http://www.coolroofs.org/products/search.php
Now it is often the case that you may be required to comply with a building code specification recently mandated by your local state or city as these roofs are seen as front line components of energy efficiency and the new green building codes springing up around the country .
At this site , a link from California ’s Energy Commission site ( http://www.energy.ca.gov/title24/coolroofs/index.html) is a calculator to help you decide what you need to do : http://www.asphaltroofing.org/title24_reroof.html
Also here is a good evaluation of all of the basic technologies put forth by the state of Texas for your review : http://www.seco.cpa.state.tx.us/zzz_sa/sa_coolroof-report2007.pdf
Lastly here is a truly green roof option : http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/green-roofs-fukuoka-japan.php.
This is where a building ’s roof is completely covered in gardens , very striking !
As always I thank you for your time and interest .

Watercooler Games saw this earlier in the week and gave a detailed deconstruction of how a Free the Falklands !
concept would be graphically impossible on the Atari 2600 .
I took one look and knew it was satire because one of the writers for this site , Jason Torchinsky , is a comedian and a name I remember as the editorial cartoonist of The Daily Tar Heel back when I was at N.C. State 's Technician in the early 1990s .
But play along , because it 's funny .
Why look , his site , the Van Gogh - Goghs , have unearthed from some New Mexico landfill documented evidence of 11 scrapped projects for the Atari 2600 !
The casualties included such licensing / adaptations as Bosom Buddies ( a cross between Kaboom ! and Donkey Kong , and Kramer vs. Kramer ( like Pong with children ) .
My favorite , because I like poop jokes , is Gunther Gebel - Williams ' Cage Cleaner .
The bogus rationale for the bogus game sounds like pure pre-video - game - crash self - b.s.ing :
" You can't blow up asteroids in real life , but you sure as [ expletive deleted ] can clean up [ expletive deleted ] . "

I have n’t seen a ton of cool advertising lately .
So I ’m going to take this opportunity to showcase one of the cooler things I ’ve seen in the past few days .
Dublin - based French artist Benjamin Gaulon is still playing around with his Printball project .
Think of a cross between an ink - jet printer and a paintball cannon .
This time ’round , it ’s positioned at a glass window in Dublin .
Awesomeness .
I really want to check this out in person – on the other side of the glass .
More photos and info type stuff here .
Maybe it will be creative inspiration for someone out there .

Oscar - winner Tatum O’Neal was released from jail today following her arrest for buying drugs from a homeless ex-con on the Lower East Side .
PHOTOS : Tatum Leaves Court
PHOTOS : Tatum Through the Years
Sporting a stylish , but wrinkled , dark - gray suit and tousled hair , the former child star , 44 , was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance and arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court .
The troubled actress – whose career appeared to be on the rise again after years of drug and alcohol addiction – said nothing as she left the courthouse with her architect beau , Ron Castellano .
O’Neal ’s brush with the law began on Sunday night around 7:30 p.m .
She left her apartment on East Broadway in the tony Forward Building – which was revamped by her boyfriend – in search of drugs , according to court papers .
That ’s when she met up with Alan Garcia , 33 , in front of nearby 181 Clinton St .
An undercover cop spotted the Oscar - winner and the ex-con chit- chatting before Garcia headed solo into a bodega , according to court papers .
“ [ Garcia ] then exited the bodega and walked with Tatum O’Neal again , ” according to Garcia ’s criminal complaint .
They briefly strolled along the gentrified ‘ hood before Garcia darted off .
When he returned , “ Tatum O’Neal handed the defendant money in exchange for a yellow object , ” the paper alleges .
That ’s when the cops swooped in and busted the star and her new buddy , who was convicted in 2003 of criminal possession of crack .
Garcia was arraigned today on charges of criminal sale of a controlled substance .
“ My client adamantly denies the charges , ” his court - appointed lawyer Laura Stasior told the judge .
He was held in lieu of $ 10,000 bail .
When cops cuffed O’Neal , they found two yellow plastic bags of cocaine in her front pants pockets , according to the complaint .
It ’s the latest trouble for O’Neal , who as a 10 - year - old rocketed to fame on the silver screen in 1973 ’s “ Paper Moon , ” opposite her dad , Ryan O’Neal .
For that role , she won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award , becoming the youngest person ever to win an Oscar .
But her charmed life was an illusion .
She chronicled her troubles with addiction , her famous parents , and ex-husband John McEnroe in her 2004 memoir “ A Paper Life . ”
In it , she claims her father was emotionally abusive and hit her when angry .
Her fights with her tennis great ex are also legendary .
She said McEnroe yanked her arm when she was pregnant and once called him “ a sociopath ” in an interview .
McEnroe has slung his share of mud her way as well .
He said in his memoir “ You Cannot Be Serious ” that the first time they had sex was a dismal failure because they were both high on drugs .
But in recent years , she seemed to be bouncing back from her troubles .
She guest starred on “ Sex and the City ” and has a recurring role on Denis Leary ’s firefighter show , “ Rescue Me , ” as the star ’s alcoholic sister , Maggie .
And she has even repaired her relationship with McEnroe – who remarried rocker Patty Smyth – for the sake of their kids .

NARBONNE , France 
The Tour de France , already diminished by the absence of some of the world ’s best cyclists because of doping violations , was thrown into turmoil yet again Thursday when an Italian rider who had won two stages of this year ’s race was kicked out of the competition for failing a drug test .
The rider , Riccardo Ricco , is the third cyclist in this year ’s race to test positive for the banned blood - boosting drug EPO .
Upon the announcement of his failed test , his Saunier Duval - Scott team , which is based in Spain , voluntarily withdrew from the Tour .
Ricco , an outspoken 24 - year - old rider who was ninth in the overall Tour standings , is by far the most visible cyclist to be caught doping this year at cycling ’s biggest event .
He was also in the lead in the competitions for the best mountain climber and for the best rider age 25 or younger .
In May he finished second in the Tour of Italy .
The new doping case raises questions about whether antidoping authorities are making progress in their fight .
This year is the 10th anniversary of the Festina scandal , which similarly shook the Tour de France when an official of a French cycling team was arrested after being caught with a car full of EPO and related doping products .
George 's Secret Key to the Universe is probably exactly what you 'd expect from a children 's book written by the world 's preeminent theoretical physicist and his daughter .
It is full of information about the universe , theories about black holes and tributes to the wonders of science in general , but presented in a gentle way so that it all remains digestible to young minds .
George is a young boy whose parents are extreme technophobes , to the point of refusing to use light bulbs .
George does n't feel the same way , and wants a computer more than anything else in the world .
One day his pet pig Freddy runs away , he follows him next door ( where George has been forbidden to go ) , and he discovers that the neighbors are Eric , a physicist , and his daughter Annie , a free spirit .
In Eric 's study resides Cosmos , the most powerful computer in the world , with a somewhat sullen personality .
Eric and Annie , with Cosmos 's reluctant help , introduce George to the wonders of science and teach him about the universe .
In the process , of course , they teach the reader as well .
Alas , George accidentally reveals the existence of Cosmos to his evil school teacher , Dr. Reeper , which sets up much of the plot of the rest of the book .
There is also a subplot involving school bullies .
There are some beautiful photographs , mostly from the Hubble Space
Telescope , provided in the book , and charts presenting scientific data directly so as not to make the text too technical .
Still , I can't unequivocally recommend the book .
The first several chapters are clunky , setting up the story in a very obvious way .
The messages are delivered in a very heavy - handed way – for example , the disparity between George 's parents and Eric need not have been made quite so drastic .
I think many , if not most , kids will realize that the story is there only as a vehicle for the lessons being taught .
Still , if my kids ( 7 and 5 ) are any indication , they will enjoy the story anyway .
There is an unexpectedly scary moment late in the book , which I felt was handled poorly by the authors , but taken as a whole it's a worthwhile read .
George 's Secret Key to the Universe is the first book of a planned trilogy , with the second and third books coming out next year and 2010 , respectively .
It is not a perfect book , and unlike most of the books I have recommended here is not as good a read for adults as for kids , but it 's worth the money for its ability to get complicated facts and theories across to kids .
And for GeekParents , there 's something comforting about knowing that you do n't have to double - check the science in a book , because one of the authors is often mentioned in the same breath as Newton and Einstein , which you probably are n't .

Oliver Morton recalls how the first major science fiction novel to depict an impact event conjured the thrill and the horror of natural cataclysm — and even inspired some researchers .
Lucifer 's Hammer Larry Niven &
Jerry Pournelle HarperCollins : 1977 . 494 pp .
Everyone remembers the surfer .
When fragments of comet Hamner–Brown strike Earth a third of the way into Lucifer 's Hammer , the surfer is floating on his board off Santa Monica , California .
The flash in the sky and the fiery cloud on the horizon warn him what 's coming .
He paddles out to face his death — a tsunami that lifts him to the sky and turns him to the land .
He rides the end of the world into the Los Angeles basin like a Hot Tuna Valkyrie , locomotive - fast and skyscraper - high , imagining for a moment that , despite the unbearable strain in his legs and the weight of an ocean at his back , he might still survive to tell his story : “ a surfing movie with ten million in special effects ! ”
The surfer is remembered because he provides the novel 's most enduring taste of the sublime — a simultaneous evocation of terror and wonder , immediate danger and cognitive distance , common to disasters imagined and real .
As The Times columnist Matthew Parris put it , writing with disturbing honesty about the mixed horror and thrill he felt contemplating the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 : “ A minor but insuppressible part of me has almost relished — yes , relished — those huge numbers .
As the newspaper headlines spoke greedily of the numbers of dead “ approaching ” twenty , then fifty , then eighty , then a hundred thousand , something undeniable twitched in the back of my brain ... as though some great auctioneer of calamity were taking bids from the media floor , and I was willing the bidding to carry on upwards ... .
When the gods themselves strike — then I believe a new depth to our fascination opens . ”
Published in 1977 , Lucifer 's Hammer was the first major science fiction novel to try to deal realistically with the planetary emergency of an impact event .
It plumbs those depths of fascination on an epic scale , rewarded at the time with sales far beyond the normal expectations of the genre .
Authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle originally outlined a story in which aliens , planning to invade , drop a small asteroid on the earth as a useful softening - up exercise .
Their editor told them to forget the aliens and concentrate on the asteroid .
They did so , making it the centre - piece of a disaster novel carefully fashioned for best - sellerdom , with a large cast and a heft that promises to take up a lot of beach time .
In the process they converted the asteroid to a less predictable but more spectacular comet , with doubts about its trajectory allowing a tension - building introduction to their disaster - movie - ready cast of Angelenos .
The novel works well , still , as an airport read .
( It is better than the alien - invasion novel the authors finally wrote almost a decade later , although to be fair , Footfall ( Del Rey , 1985 ) does have a magnificent space battle at its finale . )
And Lucifer 's Hammer is distinguished by its thorough and informed imagining of a broadly plausible cataclysm never before described .
Niven and Pournelle went out of their way to make the impact and its attendant horrors — tsunamis , earthquakes , climate change and crop failure , wars for the best remaining farmland — believable at a time when remarkably little scientific attention had been paid to such things .
When the book emerged , it encouraged more of that attention .
“ Lucifer 's Hammer killed the dinosaurs , ” said US physicist Luis Alvarez , saluting the authors when , a few years later , they attended his lecture on the geochemical evidence he and his son had found of a massive impact at the end of the Cretaceous period .
For all that , the book is n't about the comet .
It is about the enervating fragility of civilization .
Pre-comet , Los Angeles is already perched on the cusp of disaster , as always ; in the city 's Cielo Drive , Charles Manson has already proved civilization “ neither eternal nor safe ” .
“ Nothing silly about being ready for the end of civilization , ” opines a wise biker camping off Mulholland .
There 's a period pall of sweaty paranoia and doom that gives the impact an almost cleansing feel .
At times , the thrill of destruction and survival seems to totter into glee at the settling of scores .
Feminism does not outlast the cataclysm , and it is not much missed .
Woolly - headed pinko environmentalists eat their enemies and each other , as do most of the book 's black characters — a development with disturbing echoes , to say the least , of George Fitzhugh 's 1857 antebellum tract Cannibals All ! or , Slaves Without Masters .
The authors ' main theme is that , comet or no , a civilization has the morality its machinery allows it to afford , and that saving the last nuclear power plant is worth a war if it avoids a return to serfdom and slavery .
Pangs of survivor guilt and a nostalgia for lost niceties cut across the suspicion that some of the protagonists like the Hammer - scourged world a bit too much .
The sacrifice of the scientist who devotes his last winter to making poison gases for the power plant 's protection , rather than insulin that would save his own life , is manipulative .
But it is plausibly and effectively so .
And the richer crops that grow where the gas pooled and corpses fell are a powerful symbol of good from ill .
It is hard not to feel a sense of uplift as , on the last page , emblems of industry and trade — electricity , an IOU and , most beautifully , an aircraft 's contrail — herald returning life and dignity .

Life Expectancy
By Country Life expectancy equals the average number of years a person born in a given country would live if mortality rates at each age were to remain constant in the future .
The life expectancy is shown separately for males and females , as well as a combined figure .
Several non- sovereign entities are also included in this list .
The figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including ongoing wars , obesity , and HIV infections .
Worldwide , the average life expectancy at birth was 71.0 years ( 68.5 years for males and 73.5 years for females ) over the period 2010 - 2013 according to United Nations World Population Prospects 2012 Revision , and 70.7 years ( 68.2 years for males and 73.2 years for females ) for 2009 according to The World Factbook .

The 5 Stages of Obesity There has been significant criticism of existing obesity definitions and cardiometabolic risk assessment tools , particularly with regard to body mass index ( BMI ) , Cha said , adding that some studies have shown that EOSS may be a better predictor of risk .
It includes five stages , ranging from obesity with no metabolic abnormality ( stage 0 ) , to preclinical conditions such as prediabetes ( stage 1 ) , comorbidity such as type 2 diabetes , hypertension , or dyslipidemia ( stage 2 ) , end - organ damage such as heart failure ( stage 3 ) , and severe disability ( stage 4 ) .
The researchers compared EOSS criteria with diet and lifestyle factors among 106 overweight and obese young adults in the Atlanta metro area .
About three - quarters ( 77 % ) were female and 73 % were African American , and the majority ( 79 % ) fell into EOSS stage 2 obesity .

Source Wikipedia Running 5 Minutes A Day Might Add Years To Your Life Attention everyone who hates to run :
Turns out , you only need to torture yourself for about five minutes a day to reap some important health benefits like adding years to your life .
According to a new study published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , those who jogged or ran for as little as five minutes a day reduced their risk of premature death by about three years .
USA
Today quotes the study 's lead author , who says those who run for less than an hour a week reap the same health benefits as those who run more , regardless of age , gender or health conditions .
" More [ running ] may not be better in relation to health benefits . "
To get these results , researchers studied the exercise habits of more than 55,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 100 over the course of 15 years .
They found , compared to those who did n't run at all , those who ran less than an hour a week were 30 percent less likely to die for any reason during the course of the study .
And on top of that , those runners were also 45 percent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease .
A cardiologist and chief medical officer of Virginia Heart in northern Virginia told CNN " That 's important to note .
Even with all the negative factors , such as obesity , smoking and diabetes , those who were , let 's say , obese and ran had a less likely chance of dying from heart problems than those obese people who did n't run .
Same with smokers , diabetics , etc . "
And other studies have gone one step further finding that taking your running routine to the max on a consistent basis may do more harm than good .
Research presented at the American College of Cardiology recently found those who run more than 20 miles a week have shorter life spans compared to non runners .
In fact , they apparently live , on average , about as long as people who do n't run much at all .
It seems consistency is key here .
The study found those who ran consistently over a six year period gained the most health benefits : 29 percent saw a lower risk of death , and 50 percent had a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease .
The researchers advise those who want to start running should start off slow with walking , then move to jogging and running .

Although everyone with emphysema is unique , emphysema staging can help with prognosis .
However , no emphysema staging system can accurately predict what will happen to any individual person with emphysema .
Pulmonary Function Affects Emphysema Prognosis
Emphysema staging requires pulmonary function testing ( PFTs ) .
Doctors use PFTs to follow the lung capacity in people with emphysema .
During PFTs , a person with emphysema breathes and blows air through a tube while airflow is measured .
A person 's emphysema prognosis is in large part determined by PFTs .
The lung damage in emphysema creates small air pockets in the lungs , where air becomes trapped .
The trapped air makes it difficult for people with emphysema to blow out forcefully .
The more air that is trapped , the worse lung function becomes .
Over time , this makes it harder to breathe with emphysema , and pulmonary function test results decline .
The GOLD Emphysema Staging System
One major emphysema staging system is called GOLD .
It was created by an expert group called the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease .
The major factor in GOLD emphysema staging is the amount of air a person with emphysema can forcefully exhale in one second .
This is called the forced expiratory volume , or FEV1 .
GOLD emphysema staging is as follows :
Stage I , Mild emphysema : FEV1 greater than or equal to 80 % of normal
Stage II , Moderate emphysema : FEV1 less than 80 % , but greater than or equal to 50 % of normal
Stage III , Severe emphysema : FEV1 less than 50 % , but greater than or equal to 30 % of normal
Stage IV , Very severe emphysema : FEV1 less than 30 % of normal , OR less than 50 % of normal with low blood oxygen levels
GOLD emphysema staging is well established and widely used .
However , GOLD emphysema staging does not include other areas of functioning that are important , such as how people living with emphysema feel .
The BODE Emphysema Staging System
Emphysema affects more than the ability to blow air through a tube .
The BODE index , another emphysema staging system , measures emphysema 's impact on multiple areas in life :
Body mass index ( B ) , or weight adjusted for height
Airflow limitation ( O for obstruction ) , measured by pulmonary function tests .
Breathlessness ( D for dyspnea ) , assessed by a questionnaire .
Exercise capacity ( E ) , measured by how far a person with emphysema can walk in six minutes .
The BODE index does a slightly better job at determining emphysema prognosis than GOLD criteria .
Emphysema ( COPD ) Life Expectancy and Emphysema Statistics
An emphysema prognosis is impossible to determine in any individual person .
Although emphysema staging can help identify the severity of emphysema , it can't predict the future .
There have been no large studies to determine emphysema's effect on life expectancy .
The largest and best studies have only included a few hundred people .
Emphysema staging is helpful , but emphysema still varies widely between two people at the same stage .

Exposure to the sun causes :
- Pre-cancerous ( actinic keratosis ) and cancerous ( basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma ) skin lesions - due to decreases in the skin 's immune function
- Benign tumors
- Fine and coarse wrinkles
- Freckles
- Discolored areas of the skin , called mottled pigmentation
- Sallowness -- a yellow discoloration of the skin
- Telangiectasias -- the dilation of small blood vessels under the skin
- Elastosis -- the destruction of the elastic and collagen tissue ( causing lines , wrinkles and sagging skin )
What Causes Skin Cancer ?
Skin cancer is the most prevalent form of all cancers in the U.S. and the number of cases continues to rise .
It is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal skin cells .
This rapid growth results in tumors , which are either benign ( noncancerous ) or malignant ( cancerous ) .
There are three main types of skin cancer : basal cell carcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma .
Basal cell and squamous cell cancers are less serious types and make up 95 % of all skin cancers .
Also referred to as non-melanoma skin cancers , they are highly curable when treated early .
Melanoma , made up of abnormal skin pigment cells called melanocytes , is the most serious form of skin cancer and causes 75 % of all skin cancer deaths .
Left untreated , it can spread to other organs and is difficult to control .

Source : elephantjournal Key To COPD Life Expectancy Is Early Detection Is It Early COPD ?
The first symptoms of COPD are frequent coughing and more mucus or phlegm coughed up from the lungs .
Your chest may start to feel tight .
The coughing begins to disturb your sleep .
You may feel tired , and become short of breath when walking up a hill or a flight of stairs .
It 's tempting to think of these symptoms as just a part of normal aging .
But they may not be .
" If you 've smoked , are over 45 , get short of breath doing daily activities , or are backing off your exercise regimen because of a little breathlessness at the end all those are reasons not just to talk with your primary care provider but maybe to talk to a lung specialist , " says Dr. James Kiley , PhD , director of the lung disease division of the National Institutes of Health .
COPD diagnosis depends on a test called spirometry .
The test measures how much air you can force from the lungs and how fast it blows out .
Early Disease Detection Key to COPD Life Expectancy
There is no such thing as an average case of COPD .
One person 's experience may differ dramatically from another's .
In general , lung function declines slowly but steadily , until there 's a sudden worsening of symptoms .
That speeds up lung damage .
To monitor someone with COPD , doctors keep tabs on their current symptoms , lung function tests , and other conditions such as heart disease and diabetes that are often also seen in people with COPD .
Diagnosed early enough , a person with risk factors for COPD might be able to get off the slippery slope of worsening lung function .
" The most important thing would be to really quit smoking , " according to a recent WebMD article .
Further focus should be to keep up to date on immunizations a flu shot and a pneumonia shot .
All may keep someone with no symptoms from the progress or worsening COPD .

How to protect yourself
If you 're shopping for a life insurance policy ( Online ) *
As we 've long advised for most consumers , buy term life rather than a cash value or whole life policy .
Shop for the best price by using online insurance brokers , such as Accuquote.com , FindMyInsurance.com , and LifeInsure.com .
Whatever you buy term , cash value life , or annuities , sign only with an insurer that has earned the very top financial strength rating from an independent rater .
That would be the A ratings tier at TheStreet.com , available to consumers free , as well as the AAAq grade at Fitch and the AAApi grade at S&P .
To further diversify , buy coverage within your state 's guaranty association limit from separate companies :
For example , a $ 300,000 death benefit policy or $ 100,000 cash surrender value policy from Company A , and additional , similar value policies from Companies B , C , etc .
But the added safety of multiple policies might cost you a higher combined premium than you might pay with a single policy .
If you 're already a policyholder :
Try to maintain good health in case you need to shop for new coverage .
If you have cash value life or an annuity , monitor your insurer 's health regularly .
When TheStreet.com 's agency went by the name Weiss Ratings , it spotted trouble long before six major life / health failures in the late 1980s and early 1990s and red flagged the companies as " vulnerable " an average of 10 months before regulators stepped in , well in advance of other agencies .
By contrast , Best did so an average of one day after regulators took action , rating two of those disasters A ( excellent ) at the time of their impairment .
Best says its rating process has been " substantially enhanced " since then , but its financial strength rating of AIG Insurance was ?

What counts as income ?
The ACA counts income based on something called your " Modified Adjusted Gross Income " ( MAGI ) .
MAGI is your taxable income , the income you report on your tax return .
For most people , MAGI will be the adjusted gross income ( AGI ) that is on your federal tax return .
You can find your adjusted gross income in the following places :
Tax Form 1040 - Line 37
Tax Form 1040 - EZ - Line 4
Tax Form 1040A - Line 21
All Social Security benefits count towards MAGI , not just the taxable amount .
Here 's an annotated version of Form 1040 that we marked up to show what goes into MAGI .
If you do n't have a previous tax return to use or you think you may be eligible for Medicaid , this worksheet can help you learn more about MAGI .
Do I report everybody 's income or just my own ?
Just like when you complete your income taxes , for the tax credits you report everyone in your tax household 's income .
That means you report your income , your spouse 's income and the income of any dependents who are on your tax return .
Do I report my past income , current income or future income ?
The income that you report should be for the year that you want health insurance .
If you apply in November 2014 for insurance to start in January 2015 , you will need to estimate your future income for 2015 .
If you are applying during the same year you will have insurance ( for example , applying in February 2015 for insurance that would start in March 2015 ) , you would report your expected income for 2015 .

Anxiety may be caused by a mental condition , a physical condition , the effects of drugs , or a combination of these .
The doctor 's initial task is to see if your anxiety is caused by a medical condition .
Common causes of anxiety include these mental conditions :
Panic disorder :
In addition to anxiety , common symptoms of panic disorders are palpitations ( feeling your heart beat ) , dizziness , and shortness of breath .
These same symptoms also can be caused by coffee ( caffeine ) , amphetamines ( " speed " is the street slang for amphetamines when they are not prescribed by a doctor ) , an overactive thyroid , abnormal heart rhythms , and other heart abnormalities ( such as mitral valve prolapse ) .
Generalized anxiety disorder
Phobic disorders
Stress disorders
These common external factors can cause anxiety :
Stress at work
Stress from school
Stress in a personal relationship such as marriage
Financial stress
Stress from an emotional trauma such as the death of a loved one
Stress from a serious medical illness
Side effect of medication
Use of an illicit drug , such as cocaine
Symptom of a medical illness ( such as heart attack , heat stroke , hypoglycemia )
Lack of oxygen in circumstances as diverse as high altitude sickness , emphysema , or pulmonary embolism ( a blood clot in the vessels of the lung )
The doctor has the often - difficult task of determining which symptoms come from which causes .
For example , in a study of people with chest pain -- a sign of heart disease -- 43 % were found to have a panic disorder , not a heart - related condition .

Car insurance is one of the necessary evils of modern life .
You pay a substantial amount of money each month to the insurance company , and if you are like most people , you have not had an accident or made a claim in years .
Yet when you do suddenly find yourself involved in a collision , the insurance premiums you 've been forking over all these years will finally pay off .
The advent of the Internet has raised the level of competition between insurance companies .
Because you can now sit at home in your bathrobe and compare rates and coverage between companies , they are under more pressure to offer competitive deals .
So why not leverage the Internet 's potential to help you save time , save money , and find the best auto insurance coverage ?
First , let 's be clear about the fact that auto insurance is required by law in most states ―it 's not optional .
If you drive a car , you must have auto insurance .
So you need to find out what the law requires in your jurisdiction when it comes to how much auto insurance coverage you need to maintain .
Print out your state 's requirements , and save that information for the next step in the process .
What Can Influence Your Rates
Because insurance prices are all based on statistics , the prices each of us pays varies wildly .
Things like the driver 's age , years of driving experience , what neighborhood the car is usually parked in overnight , the make and model of the car , what kind of safety features the car has , and whether or not you have antitheft devices installed ―all of these variables will factor into the price you 'll pay for the particular level of coverage you choose .
Before you get too far into shopping for insurance , you might want to order a copy of your driving record .
In much the same way that your credit rating determines what kind of interest rate you 'll get when you are applying for financing , your driving record will influence your insurance rate .
When you get your driving record , take a look at it to make sure that it is current and accurate .
You would not want an error on your driving record to keep you from getting the best rate possible .
What Coverage Do You Need ?
Your state sets forth the minimum liability coverage you must maintain , as mentioned above .
But these are just the legal minimums and might not give you the coverage you need .
You 'll have to decide what you want to buy beyond these minimums .
Keep in mind that you are looking to find the balance between having adequate coverage and overpaying .
According to Consumer Reports , a general guideline for adequate bodily injury liability limits is $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per accident , plus $ 100,000 for property damage .
These amounts are what your insurer will pay to someone you are in an accident with .
For uninsured motorist coverage , you should get the same amount as for bodily injury liability , as this covers your medical costs when someone who is not insured hits you .
Other Types of Coverage
You can always supplement your policy with specific protections ( for a higher premium , of course ) .
For example , many motorists get comprehensive and collision coverage .
Comprehensive pays out when your car is damaged or lost due to causes other than an accident , such as vandalism , theft , or weather .
Collision coverage will pay to repair your own car if you hit something .
These options typically come with your choice of deductible , usually $ 250 to $ 1,000 .
This is the amount you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in ; the higher the deductible , the lower the premium you 'll pay for this type of coverage .
Additional options include rental reimbursement coverage , which pays for a rental car while your car is in the shop being repaired .
Roadside assistance coverage will pay to have your vehicle towed .
Keep in mind that if you already have an auto club membership , you do not need this additional coverage .
Get the Best Rate
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC ) recommends that you ask your potential insurer about the following discounts :
Good driving record :
Many auto insurers offer discounts to drivers who have not made a claim , have n't been in an accident , or have n't received a traffic ticket in three years .
Good grades :
Young drivers can get discounts for maintaining a B average or better in school .
Driver 's education :
Some insurance companies offer a discount for drivers who complete a driver 's education or driver 's safety course .
Multiple policies :
Some insurance companies offer discounts if you have two or more policies with them .
Safety equipment : Equipment such as antilock brakes and antitheft devices can get you a discount .
Longtime policy holder :
If you have kept your policy with an insurer for several years , ask about a discounted premium .
Higher deductibles : A higher deductible usually means lower premiums .
Gather Quotes
Once you know what kind of coverage your state requires , you will need the following information in front of you in order to get an accurate quote for auto insurance :
The age and sex of the driver (s ) , the number of drivers in your household , and their driver 's license numbers .
A description of your car : the make , model , year , and vehicle identification number ( VIN ) .
The type of coverage and limits you want .
Where you park your car overnight .
Get free auto insurance quotes and compare rates by using DMV.org 'S Car Insurance Center .
Check References
Now that you have a few comparable quotes and you know which company offers the lowest price for the policy you want , you still need to check out the company itself to find out whether it 's reliable .
You can check with your state 's department of insurance , which should allow you to compare premiums for insurance companies in your state .
You can also check on the financial stability of a company and look up the number of consumer complaints it has accumulated .
Take a look at Weiss Ratings to get an independent rating of the companies you are considering .
J.D. Power and Associates also offers useful consumer reviews of auto insurance companies .
Review Your Policy
Before you sign , be sure to carefully review your new policy to make sure it includes all the coverage you want .
Your policy will need to comply with your state 's legal requirements as well as any additional requirements of the company that finances your auto loan .
Source : DMV.org What Causes Mesothelioma ?
Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos , a naturally - occurring mineral that was used in various products during the 20th century .
When asbestos particles are inhaled or ingested through food or drink , they can become trapped in the body and my cause cancerous tumors to form on the lining of the lungs , abdomen or heart .
Mesothelioma is considered malignant , meaning it can become progressively worse and spread to other areas of the body .
Source : Mesothelioma.org How to Find the Best Mesothelioma Lawyer or Law Firm
Choosing a mesothelioma attorney is not a task that should be done in haste .
You should never hire a lawyer just because a law firm ’s TV ad was loud and flashy .
There are many attorneys and law firms competing to handle asbestos or mesothelioma cases , but some are inexperienced newcomers who might not be able to handle your case properly .
You need to separate the good lawyers from the not - so - good ones .
But with so many law firms and attorneys out there , how do you find the right one ?
The first step is to do research on mesothelioma and asbestos attorneys .
This sounds easy enough , but it requires time , patience , and energy .
These three assets might be in short supply , especially when you are tired and do n't feel well , yet it ’s important to make sure you seek out the mesothelioma law firm for your particular case and needs .
Even if they do n’t , they can help you conduct Internet searches and make lists of law firms or attorneys who may be qualified to handle your case .
Whether you conduct your own research or delegate it to others , look for attorneys with the right qualifications and established histories of dealing with asbestos law .
Do n't make a list that 's too long .
Select a manageable number of prospective mesothelioma law firms and ask for a case evaluation as quickly as possible .
If a law firm can't evaluate your case in a timely manner , there is a chance they may be too busy to take on your case .
With cases as sensitive as mesothelioma lawsuits , you 'll need an attorney who not only has the experience , but also the time and effort to dedicate to your case .
Looking in the Internet is a convenient and relatively simple method to find the best mesothelioma attorney .
The search terms “ asbestos lawyer ” and mesothelioma attorneys yield literally thousands of search engine results .
Though the sheer number of lawyer websites is staggering , you can figure out the better ones simply by reading the information provided on home pages and FAQ sections .
An experienced mesothelioma law firm ’s website should provide you detailed information regarding all aspects of asbestos - related diseases , state statute of limitations , pertinent information regarding lawsuits , and answers to important questions you may have .
If the information is well - written , free of hyperbole , and covers detailed information , add the firms ' names to your list of possible choices .
Steer clear of websites belonging to attorneys who make exaggerated promises about how much you will win if you retain them to handle your case .
Although it 's important to seek out a law firm 's track record of previous successful mesothelioma lawsuits , no law firm can guarantee exactly how much you 'll win .
Keep in mind , however , that although mesothelioma legal cases were relatively obscure until the number of documented mesothelioma cases rose in the 1990s and 2000s , they are usually lucrative .
Yet , there are an array of factors that affect each case , such as the stage of the disease , how you long you were exposed , and much more .
Therefore , it ’s not possible for a mesothelioma law firm to promise you a set amount of money beforehand .
The best mesothelioma lawyers will never make you false promises of how much compensation you can win .
Source : mesotheliomalawyercenter.org Car Donation : How To Donate Your Car To Charity
The car donation process is simple .
All you need to do is call the charity and someone will come and pick up your vehicle , or tell you where to bring it .
However , with so many charities to choose from and so many people trying to scam the innocent , picking the right organization is not always easy .
On this page you 'll find some general tips you can use when you are trying to decide where and how to donate your vehicle .
First Steps to Take When Donating a Car
Before you donate your car to charity , the IRS advises that you :
- Research the charity or organization you plan to donate to .
- See if you will receive a tax benefit for your donation .
( The charity / organization you donate to must be qualified .
501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations are common types that make you eligible for a tax deduction . )
- Look up the value of your car ( however , you can only deduct the actual amount the charity sells your car for ) .
- Ask if you , as a donor , have any other responsibilities in the process .
In addition , you may want to consider :
How your car will be used and where it will go .
If the money from the sale of your car will be used locally or outside of your community .
Which programs or services within the charity will receive funding from the sale .
What the efficiency rating of the charity is .
( A lower rating means more of your donation goes toward administrative costs , not to the programs and services you want to support . )
For more information on this and tax - related matters , read the IRS's A Donor 's Guide to Vehicle Donations .
Finding a Charity
The choice is yours , but before donating your car , confirm that your charity of choice is recognized by the IRS .
Otherwise , your deduction will be rejected .
If in doubt , check the IRS 's Cumulative List of Organizations which lists qualified charities .
Religious organizations are n't listed , though they do qualify .
You can also contact the Better Business Bureau ( BBB ) in your area or the BBB Wise Giving Alliance .
If you 're still undecided , Forbes ranks America 's 200 largest charities and , in some cases , discloses their financial details .
Keep in mind , however , that not every charity listed here accepts car donations .
Additionally , you can search for charities and tax - exempt organizations on the IRS website .
Tax Write - Offs
The IRS has clamped down on how much you can write off on donated cars .
No longer can you submit a vehicle 's full value or " blue book " value for your tax deduction .
Now , instead , you can only claim the amount for which it is sold or the fair market value .
Motor Vehicle Department Donation Procedures
Just as if you were selling your car as a private party , when you donate your car to charity , you 'll need to satisfy some requirements with your state 's motor vehicle division .
Some common processes you 'll likely need to complete include :
Completing a title transfer .
Canceling your registration .
Completing a notice of transfer / release of liability form .
The exact steps you 'll need to take will vary from state to state .
Check with your state 's DMV office for specific requirements and details .
NOTE : In addition to DMV requirements , you 'll also need to cancel your car insurance policy .
Notice of Transfer / Release of Liability
Be sure to visit our guide about Title Transfers to learn how to transfer the title over .
You may also need to complete a notice of transfer or release of liability form .
Canceling Your License Plates and Registration
The laws for this vary by state .
Some states require surrendering the vehicle 's license plates to the DMV .
Others require submitting a sold notice , and there are a few states that require no formal notification at all .
Little Known Facts About Diabetes
In 2013 it was estimated that over 382 million people throughout the world had diabetes ( Williams textbook of endocrinology ) .
Type 1 Diabetes - the body does not produce insulin .
Approximately 10 % of all diabetes cases are type 1 .
Type 2 Diabetes - the body does not produce enough insulin for proper function .
Approximately 90 % of all cases of diabetes worldwide are of this type .
Gestational Diabetes - this type affects females during pregnancy .
The most common diabetes symptoms include frequent urination , intense thirst and hunger , weight gain , unusual weight loss , fatigue , cuts and bruises that do not heal , male sexual dysfunction , numbness and tingling in hands and feet .
If you have Type 1 and follow a healthy eating plan , do adequate exercise , and take insulin , you can lead a normal life .
Type 2 patients need to eat healthily , be physically active , and test their blood glucose .
They may also need to take oral medication , and / or insulin to control blood glucose levels .
As the risk of cardiovascular disease is much higher for a diabetic , it is crucial that blood pressure and cholesterol levels are monitored regularly .
As smoking might have a serious effect on cardiovascular health , diabetics should stop smoking .
Hypoglycemia - low blood glucose - can have a bad effect on the patient .
Hyperglycemia - when blood glucose is too high - can also have a bad effect on the patient .

Asbestos Exposure in California
Asbestos materials were used in the U.S. from the early 1900s until the 1970s in construction , shipbuilding , automobile manufacturing , electronics , and national defense applications .
After the the early 1970s , when the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) first linked asbestos exposure to lung cancer , asbestosis , and mesothelioma , U.S. mining of asbestos gradually stopped .
However , asbestos ’ carcinogenic effects continue to affect millions of individuals , mostly men who served in the military or in any industry which used asbestos between its peak years of use .
Due to the prevalence of asbestos used by civilian industries and military facilities in California , everyone in the state is potentially at risk of being exposed to asbestos .
California is particularly vulnerable to a marked increase in mesothelioma deaths for several reasons .
The state is home to many types of industries which at one time were large - scale users of asbestos .
For instance , during World War II , California contained aircraft factories , manufacturers of radar and radio equipment , shipyards , and automobile plants .
All of these industrial complexes used asbestos for various purposes .
According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , electricians , pipefitters , plumbers , shipbuilders , and steamfitters were the civilian and military workers who were most exposed to asbestos between the late 1930s and the end of the war .
Furthermore , military personnel who served between World War II and the mid-1970s were exposed to asbestos for long periods of time while on active duty .
This is the principal reason why mesothelioma is diagnosed mainly in white males aged 65 and older .
However , women and children in California are at risk of increased exposure to asbestos fibers in the near future .
Because the state ’s population boom coincided with the prosperity of the post -Depression recovery of the late 1940s and early ‘ 50s , thousands of asbestos - laden homes and residential developments still exist in California .
With the popularity of home makeover shows on television , it is possible that many homeowners will carry out do - it - yourself renovation projects and stir asbestos dust into the air as a consequence .
California is also one of the largest repositories of naturally occurring asbestos ( NOA ) thanks in part to its propensity for earthquake activity .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , asbestiform minerals occur in soil and rock as a result of natural geologic processes .
In California , NOAs lie in veins near fault lines on the coastal plains and the lower elevations of the Sierra Nevada .
NOAs are harmless to humans if they remain undisturbed under the Earth ’s surface .
However , the effects of natural erosion and human activity stir up asbestos fibers and release them into the air .

California Mesothelioma Cases
The explosive increase of California ’s population since the 1940s has not only resulted in the state ’s dynamic economic expansion , but also in an increase in mesothelioma diagnoses and deaths .
As more people moved to the state to seek jobs or to live in California ’s temperate climate after World War II , the resulting boom in construction resulted in widespread use of asbestos .
At the time , asbestos ’ health dangers were not widely known .
Instead , the mineral fibers ’ heat - and fire - resistant properties made them attractive for the construction industry .
As a result , millions of homes , schools , office buildings , and factories were built with materials filled with asbestos .
Workers who handled drywall , insulation , roofing materials , steam pipes , plumbing materials , and electrical wiring exposed the most .

In many cases , Americans can be prosecuted for giving money to foreign armies .
As we have been told in the case of John Walker Lindh , Americans can give up their citizenship rights by joining a foreign army .
But as with many things , there is an exception : Israel .
Not only is it allowed to give money to the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) , it is actually a tax - deductible contribution under US tax laws .
The Fund for Strengthing Israel 's Defenses , solicits funds from US citizens to " make up what the [ Israeli ] defense budget can't cover . "
And these contributions ( of $ 100 or more ) are tax - deductible by making the checks to the P.E.F.
Israel Endowment Fund .
Their website contains the following quote from Israel 's first prime minister , David Ben-Gurion : " The IDF should also be the center for Zionist education for Israel 's youth , children and immigrants ... "
Britain is the worst country in the Western world in which to be a child , according to a recent UNICEF report .
Ordinarily , I would not set much store by such a report ; but in this case , I think it must be right — not because I know so much about childhood in all the other 20 countries examined but because the childhood that many British parents give to their offspring is so awful that it is hard to conceive of worse , at least on a mass scale .
The two poles of contemporary British child rearing are neglect and overindulgence .
Consider one British parent , Fiona MacKeown , who in November 2007 went on a six - month vacation to Goa , India , with her boyfriend and eight of her nine children by five different fathers , none of whom ever contributed financially for long to the children ’s upkeep .
( The child left behind — her eldest , at 19 — was a drug addict . )
She received $ 50,000 in welfare benefits a year , and doubtless decided — quite rationally , under the circumstances — that the money would go further , and that life would thus be more agreeable , in Goa than in her native Devon .
Reaching Goa , MacKeown soon decided to travel with seven of her children to Kerala , leaving behind one of them , 15 - year - old Scarlett Keeling , to live with a tour guide ten years her elder , whom the mother had known for only a short time .
Scarlett reportedly claimed to have had sex with this man only because she needed a roof over her head .
According to a witness , she was constantly on drugs ; and one night , she went to a bar where she drank a lot and took several different illicit drugs , including LSD , cocaine , and pot .
She was seen leaving the bar late , almost certainly intoxicated .
The next morning , her body turned up on a beach .
At first , the local police maintained that she had drowned while high , but further examination proved that someone had raped and then forcibly drowned her .
So far , three people have been arrested in the investigation , which is continuing .
About a month later , Scarlett ’s mother , interviewed by the liberal Sunday newspaper the Observer , expressed surprise at the level of public vituperation aimed at her and her lifestyle in the aftermath of the murder .
She agreed that she and her children lived on welfare , but “ not by conscious choice , ” and she could n’t see anything wrong with her actions in India apart from a certain naivety in trusting the man in whose care she had left her daughter .
Scarlett was always an independent girl , and if she , the mother , could turn the clock back , she would behave exactly the same way again .
It is not surprising that someone in Fiona MacKeown ’s position would deny negligence ; to acknowledge it would be too painful .
But — and this is what is truly disturbing — when the newspaper asked four supposed child - rearing experts for their opinions , only one saw anything wrong with the mother ’s behavior , and even she offered only muted criticism .
It was always difficult to know how much independence to grant an adolescent , the expert said ; but in her view , the mother had granted too much too quickly to Scarlett .
Even that seemed excessively harsh to the Observer ’s Barbara Ellen .
We should not criticize the mother ’s way of life , she wrote , since it had nothing to do with her daughter ’s death : “ Scarlett died for the simple fact that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people , as well as being blitzed with drugs , late at night , in a foreign country . ”
On this view , being in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people is a raw fact of nature , not the result of human agency , decision , education , or taste .
It could happen to anybody , and it just happened to happen to Scarlett .
As for drugs , they emerge from the ether and blitz people completely at random .
It all seems very unfair .
A columnist for the left - wing Guardian took a similarly exculpatory line :
Anyone taking even a fleeting glance at recent news will have picked up a crucial message : women with children by more than one partner are apparently hussies , who deserve everything they get .
The opprobrium . . . served up to Fiona MacKeown , mother of murdered 15 - year - old , Scarlett Keeling . . . has been hideous to behold .
The spitting criticism is particularly interesting when you compare it to attitudes to men in the public eye .
Rod Stewart ( seven children by five women ) , Jack Nicholson ( five children by four women ) , and Mick Jagger ( seven children by four women ) are painted as great , swinging studs .
Anyone else smell a vile double standard ?
No one criticizes Rod Stewart , Jack Nicholson , or Mick Jagger for how they behave ; therefore , apparently , there was nothing wrong with how Fiona MacKeown behaved .
It is worth remembering that the Observer and the Guardian are not the publications of a lunatic fringe but the preferred newspapers of the British intelligentsia , of those who work in the educational and social services , and of broadcasting elites ( the BBC advertises vacancies almost exclusively in the Guardian ) .
Not every person who reads these newspapers agrees with everything written in them — and both , commendably , offer a little space to writers whose worldview differs from their own — but the general moral tone must be one with which most readers agree .
In other words , it is likely that a large part of the educated elite sees nothing wrong , or at least affects to see nothing wrong , with MacKeown ’s conduct .
This nonjudgmentalism surely helps explain why British youth are among the Western world ’s leaders in such indicators of social pathology as teenage pregnancy , violence , criminality , underage drinking , and consumption of illicit drugs .
Britain has the third - highest rate of teenage pregnancy in the industrialized world , according to the UNICEF report ( only the United States and New Zealand are higher ) — a startling case recently made headlines of 16 - , 14 - , and 12 - year - old sisters , all of whom gave birth within a year of one another .
British children have the earliest and highest consumption of cocaine of any young people in Europe , are ten times more likely to sniff solvents than are Greek children , and are six to seven times more likely to smoke pot than are Swedish children .
Almost a third of British young people aged 11 , 13 , and 15 say they have been drunk at least twice .
What explains the nonjudgmental attitude among elites ?
The reluctance to criticize Fiona MacKeown might be an expression of sympathy for someone in the throes of grief : however foolishly ( or worse ) she behaved , she certainly did not deserve the murder of her daughter .
Furthermore , the Guardian and Observer journalists might argue , we do not know enough about the details of her life to criticize her fairly .
Perhaps she is a good mother in most respects ; perhaps her children , apart from the drug addict and the murdered Scarlett , are happy , and will lead lives of fulfillment and achievement .
After all , no style of upbringing guarantees success or , for that matter , failure ; and therefore we should suspend judgment about her .
I suspect , however , that the main consideration inhibiting elite criticism of MacKeown is that passing judgment would call into question the shibboleths of liberal social policy for the last 50 or 60 years — beliefs that give their proponents a strong sense of moral superiority .
It would be to entertain the heretical thought that family structure might matter after all , along with such qualities as self - restraint and self - respect ; and that welfare dependency is unjust to those who pay for it and disastrous for those who wind up trapped in it .
One day after Scarlett Keeling ’s murder , a nine - year - old girl , Shannon Matthews , went missing from her home in Dewsbury , in northern England .
Twenty - four days later , after an extensive police search , she was found alive , locked in a drawer under a bed in her stepfather ’s uncle ’s house .
Police soon arrested the stepfather , 22 - year - old Craig Meehan , for possession of 140 pornographic pictures of children , and charged the uncle , Michael Donovan , with kidnapping .
Shannon ’s mother , Karen Matthews , 32 , was also arrested , for child cruelty , neglect , and obstructing the police by lying during the search for her daughter .
Karen Matthews , who received welfare payments of $ 40,000 a year , had borne seven children to five different men .
She called two of her children with the same father “ the twins , ” thus transferring the meaning of “ twin ” from the relatively unusual biological occurrence of double birth to what she clearly thought the equally unusual social circumstance of full siblinghood .
Three of her children lived with their fathers , and four lived with her and Meehan , whom Shannon reportedly regarded as her father .
Shannon ’s true father — one Leon Rose , who has since “ moved on ” to live with another “ partner ” — apparently was happy to find himself usurped by the young Meehan ; but Karen Matthews ’s brother reported that Shannon often spoke of Meehan ’s violence to her and of her deep unhappiness at home .
The reasons for Shannon ’s abduction have not yet emerged , but again the Guardian managed to distract the reader ’s attention from less than optimal family arrangements .
Instead , it ran an upbeat story on the housing project where the Matthews family lived ; that way , the obvious could be ignored rather than denied .
The Sun , a tabloid newspaper whose readership is virtually entirely working - class , had described the project as “ like Beirut — only worse . ”
But the Guardian , whose readership is largely middle - class and employed in the public sector , drew attention to the improvements that had taken place in the project , thanks to the local council ’s having spent $ 8 million on it over the last three years — supplying traffic bollards shaped like penguins , for example .
Before the improvements , one resident said , “ We ’d houses burgled , sheds burned , caravans blown up . ”
Now , only one house in 90 is robbed per year ; and , thanks to the penguins , joy - riding by youths in stolen cars is presumably much reduced .
The implication is clear : with more public spending of this kind everywhere in the country , administered by Guardian readers and their peers , everything will be all right .
It wo n’t matter in the slightest if children either have no fathers , or different fathers every few years .
One might dismiss the stories of Scarlett Keeling and Shannon Matthews as the kind of horrific things that can take place in any society from time to time .
But I think that they are the tip of an iceberg .
As the liberal newspapers ’ response shows , the problem with British childhood is by no means confined to the underclass .
Our society has lost the most elementary common sense about what children need .
More than four out of ten British children are born out of wedlock ; the unions of which they are the issue are notoriously unstable .
Even marriage has lost much of its meaning .
In a post - religious society , it is no longer a sacrament .
The government has ensured that marriage brings no fiscal advantages and , indeed , for those at the lower end of the social scale , that it has only disadvantages .
Easy divorce means that a quarter of all marriages break up within a decade .
The results of this social dysfunction are grim for children .
Eighty percent of British children have televisions in their bedrooms , more than have their biological fathers at home .
Fifty - eight percent of British children eat their evening meal in front of the television ( a British child spends more than five hours per day watching a screen ) ; 36 percent never eat any meals together with other family members ; and 34 percent of households do not even own dining tables .
In the prison where I once worked , I discovered that many inmates had never eaten at a table together with someone else .
Let me speculate briefly on the implications of these startling facts .
They mean that children never learn , from a sense of social obligation , to eat when not hungry , or not to eat when they are .
Appetite is all they need consult in deciding whether to eat — a purely egotistical outlook .
Hence anything that interferes with the satisfaction of appetite will seem oppressive .
They do not learn such elementary social practices as sharing or letting others go first .
Since mealtimes are usually when families get to converse , the children do not learn the art of conversation , either ; listening to what others say becomes a challenge .
There is a time and place for everything : if I feel like it , the time is now , and the place is here .
If children are not taught self - control , they do not learn it .
Violence against teachers is increasing : injuries suffered by teachers at the hands of pupils rose 20 percent between 2000 and 2006 , and in one survey , which may or may not be representative , 53 percent of teachers had objects thrown at them , 26 percent had been attacked with furniture or equipment , 2 percent had been threatened with a knife , and 1 percent with a gun .
Nearly 40 percent of teachers have taken time off to recover from violent incidents at students ’ hands .
About a quarter of British teachers have been assaulted by their students over the last year .
The British , never fond of children , have lost all knowledge or intuition about how to raise them ; as a consequence , they now fear them , perhaps the most terrible augury possible for a society .
The signs of this fear are unmistakable on the faces of the elderly in public places .
An involuntary look of distaste , even barely controlled terror , crosses their faces if a group of young teens approaches ; then they try to look as if they are not really there , hoping to avoid trouble .
And the children themselves are afraid .
The police say that many children as young as eight are carrying knives for protection .
Violent attacks by the young between ten and 17 , usually on other children , have risen by 35 percent in the last four years .
The police , assuming that badly behaved children will become future criminals , have established probably the largest database of DNA profiles in the world : 1.1 million samples from children aged ten to 18 , taken over the last decade , and at an accelerating rate ( some law enforcement officials have advocated that every child should have a DNA profile on record ) .
Since the criminal - justice system reacts to the commission of serious crimes hardly at all , however , British youth do not object to the gathering of the samples : they know that they largely act with impunity , profiles or no profiles .
The British may have always inclined toward harshness or neglect ( or both ) in dealing with children ; but never before have they combined such attitudes with an undiscriminating material indulgence .
My patients would sometimes ask me how it was that their children had turned out so bad when they had done everything for them .
When I asked them what they meant by “ everything , ” it invariably meant the latest televisions in their bedrooms or the latest fashionable footwear — to which modern British youth attaches far more importance than Imelda Marcos ever did .
Needless to say , the British state ’s response to the situation that it has in part created is simultaneously authoritarian and counterproductive .
The government pretends , for example , that the problem of child welfare is one of raw poverty .
Britain does have the highest rate of child poverty , bar the United States , in the West , as defined ( as it usually is ) by the percentage of children living in households with an income of less than 50 percent of the median .
( Whether this is a sensible definition of poverty is a subject rarely broached . )
But after many years of various redistributive measures and billions spent to reduce it , child poverty is , if anything , more widespread .
The British government thus pursues social welfare policies that encourage the creation of households like the Matthews ’ , and then seeks , via yet more welfare spending , to reduce the harm done to children in them .
But was the Matthews household poor , in any but an artificial sense ?
At the time of Shannon ’s current stepfather ’s arrest , the household income was $ 72,000 ; it lived free of rent and local taxes , and it boasted three computers and a large plasma - screen television .
Would another $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 or $ 20,000 have made any difference ?
A system of perverse incentives in a culture of undiscriminating materialism , where the main freedom is freedom from legal , financial , ethical , or social consequences , makes childhood in Britain a torment both for many of those who live it and those who observe it .
Yet the British government will do anything but address the problem , or that part of the problem that is its duty to address : the state - encouraged breakdown of the family .
If one were a Marxist , one might see in this refusal the self - interest of the state - employee class : social problems , after all , are their raison d’être .

A little over a year ago , I wrote an article about the IP v4 address consumption with the subtitle IP v4 Address Space : 2.46 Billion Down , 1.25 Billion to Go. A week ago , we reached the magic number of 2.7 billion IP v4 addresses used .
With 3.7 billion possible addresses , ¹ this means we now have less than a billion unused IP v4 addresses left .
There are 39 blocks of 16.78 million addresses in the IANA global pool and another 339 million addresses that have been given out by IANA to the five Regional Internet Registries , but not yet delegated to ISPs or end -users .
So , how long will a billion quench our thirst for addresses ?
Geoff Huston at the Asia Pacific Network Information Centre has written a script that downloads the relevant information and creates daily predictions .
The current ones target 10 February 2011 as the moment that IANA will give out the last of its blocks to one of the regional registries , and 17 December 2011 as the day that the last RIR will hand out the last IP v4 address to an ISP ( or end - user ) .
Personally , I 've always thought that Geoff 's model is a bit pessimistic ; in order to run out of addresses in a little over three years , we'd have to increase the rate at which addresses are handed out by 30 percent each year .
In 2007 , the increase over 2006 was 19 percent .
The year before that there was no increase to speak of .
However , we 're now so close to running out that the exact figures do n't really matter anymore .
Regardless of whether we see our yearly IP v4 use stay flat or increase by 70 percent , the results all point in the same direction :
Yearly increase Run out date 0 percent December 2013 10 percent November 2012 20 percent April 2012 30 percent December 2011 50 percent June 2011 70 percent February 2011
In other words , unless something unexpected happens , we 'll be out of IP v4 addresses at some point in the neighborhood of 2012 .
So when the next Olympics come around , it 's very possible that some of us will have to watch them online over IPv6 .
( Actually the official website of the 2008 Olympics is already available over IPv6 . )
If all of this inspires you to try out IP v6 on your own system , have a look at SixXS.
net .
The people at SixXS run a " tunnel broker " and have developed an Automatic IPv6 Connectivity Client Utility ( AICCU ) that make it possible to get an IPv6 address and tunneled connectivity that works through Network Address Translators and most firewalls .
Unfortunately , the AICCU utility is n't particularly easy to install and configure , so only give this a try if you 're comfortable debugging network connectivity issues and running programs from the command line .
¹ IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long , which allows for 4,294.97 million unique combinations .
However , the addresses starting with 0 and 127 ( 33.55 million in total ) can't be used because those address ranges are shortcuts for the default route and localhost address .
Addresses starting with 224 - 239 are multicast addresses ( 268.44 million ) and those starting with 240 - 255 are " class E " addresses ( another 268.44 million ) , which are reserved for future use .
Unfortunately , almost all operating systems and routers block these addresses in some way , so in practice they 're unusable .
The three ranges of private addresses ( 10.x.x.x , 172.16.x.x - 172.31.x.x , and 192.168.x.x ) add up to 17.89 million addresses , making for a total of 588.32 million unusable addresses .
BAGHDAD -
In a city with constant electricity shortages but no lack of sunshine , the new buzz is solar energy .
Teams of engineers have appeared along major Baghdad roadways , bolting panels and bulbs to rows of towering steel poles to make solar - powered streetlights .
" We are lighting up the city with solar power , " Sajad Hussein declared when queried by curious residents .
" People say it is a gift from God . "
Surging oil prices have fueled interest in solar power and other renewable energy sources across the United States , where pressure also is building to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fend off global warming .
But Iraq 's decision to embrace clean energy has little to do with cost cutting or the environment : Iraqi policy makers want to improve security , and the national grid does n't supply enough electricity to illuminate city streets .
For Iraqis , the lack of reliable power has been one of the biggest frustrations of the war .
The US government has committed $ 4.91 billion to repairing the ravaged electricity infrastructure and bringing new generating units online .
But most Iraqis can count on just a few hours of power a day .
Faced with another long , hot summer without sufficient electricity , an Iraqi journalist confronted a US general at a news conference in the spring and demanded to know why the military was n't harnessing the sun 's rays for the national grid .
Brigadier General Jeffrey Dorko , commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers in Iraq , said the cost was prohibitive .
" A rough standard worldwide is it costs approximately $ 1 million to create a power plant to generate one megawatt of power , " he said .
" The cost per one megawatt for solar power is several times that , maybe $ 6 million or $ 7 million per megawatt . "
But US and Iraqi officials agree that solar energy can be useful on a more limited scale , such as powering a street lamp .
Iraq 's electricity grid already was in a state of disrepair after years of sanctions when US - led forces invaded in March 2003 .
The US efforts have added about 2,200 megawatts of daily generating capacity , which now stands at about 5,500 megawatts .
But the growth in demand has far outpaced supply .
Iraqis are snapping up other energy - consuming devices that have come onto the market since the fall of Saddam Hussein .
US reconstruction efforts have added to the pressure on the national grid as new hospitals , schools , water treatment plants , and other facilities come online .
Essential services are guaranteed a near - continuous supply of electricity , which leaves little for business and residential consumers .
Although capacity has improved , production levels rarely achieve their potential .
Transmission towers are frequently attacked , causing disruptions throughout the network .
A severe drought has reduced output from hydroelectric plants by nearly 30 percent .
The sector is also beset by fuel shortages .
Iraq sits atop the world 's third - largest proven oil reserves .
But the country has limited refining capabilities and imports large quantities of diesel to keep its turbines spinning .
But there is no shortage of sunshine , said Aziz al - Shimari , spokesman for the Electricity Ministry .
Iraq is a country of vast deserts where summer temperatures can top 120 degrees .
" This offers us more possibility of producing power , " Shimari said .
Light is " an important condition for security , so people will go out at night . "
The ministry plans to install 5,000 solar - powered streetlights in Baghdad at a cost of $ 1,800 to $ 2,000 apiece .
There also are plans to install 1,000 units in each of Iraq 's 18 provinces .

TEHRAN , Iran - Iran has sentenced eight women and one man convicted of adultery to death by stoning , activists said Sunday .
A lawyer and women 's rights activist , Shadi Sadr , said the nine , who are between 27 and 50 years old , were convicted of adultery in separate cases in different Iranian cities .
Trial protocol was not applied properly in the cases , she said .
Six of the nine were convicted based solely on judges ' decisions with no witnesses or the presence of their lawyers during their confessions , said Sadr , who has been leading a campaign in Iran against stoning deaths .
" Their verdicts are approved , and they may be executed at any time , " she told reporters .
" We are trying to stop the implementation of their verdicts .
And we want to amend the country 's penal law , in which death by stoning is prescribed . "
Under Iran 's Islamic laws , adultery is the only capital offense punishable by stoning .
A man is usually buried up to his waist , while a woman is buried up to her neck .
Those carrying out the verdict then throw stones until the condemned dies .
Stoning was widely imposed in the early years after Iran 's 1979 Islamic revolution , but it has seldom been applied in recent years , though the government rarely confirms when it carries out stoning sentences .
Reformist legislators have demanded an end to death by stoning as a punishment for adultery , but opposition from hard - line clerics has sidelined their efforts .
Croatia claimed an impressive win over pre-tournament favourites Germany to take control of Group B at Euro 2008 .
Darijo Srna broke the deadlock on 24 minutes when he beat Marcell Jansen to Danijel Pranjic ’s cross and fired home .
Croatia were gifted a second goal on 63 minutes when Ivan Rakitic ’s cross came off Lukas Podolski and rebounded off the post for Ivica Olic to slot home .
Podolski pulled a goal back with a late drive but Bastian Schweinsteiger ’s red card ended German hopes in injury time .

According to the story published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and covered in Space.com , it appears that some of the landforms in dry valleys on Mars are the result of glaciation ... advancing and retreating of glaciers , formed from the accumulation of snow into compacted ice over tens or hundreds of thousands of years .
There is no return to the perchlorate discussion yet .
However , this implies that the climate was far more earth - like than it is now , since it supported H - 2 - 0 precipitation , which mean atmospheric pressure was much higher than it is now , and temperatures must have been in the narrow band ( relatively speaking ) when snow falls .
The thicker atmosphere would have deflected ultraviolet radiation .
If it 's too hot , there will only be water vapor and maybe liquid water , if it 's too cold - it wo n't snow .
On earth , snow does not fall below temperatures of - 40 C .
Heaviest accumulations of snow occur when there is significant atmospheric mixing of low and high temperatures and surface temperatures may be anywhere from around 0 C ( 32 F ) to - 30 C or so .
Glaciers form from yearly accumulation of snow that does n't melt completely .
On earth the glacier accumulation range at present is sea level in the arctic to 6000 meters high at the equator .
This has varied in the past .
So , possibly Mars would have been habitable by forms of organisms recognizable on the earth today .
With all the ice and snow , water - and cloud cover - Mars would have been much brighter in the sky than it 's present iron - rich desert appearance and would have looked more like earth , an azure marble , through a small telescope .

A Craigslist ad today offers law school grads in New York the chance to , uh , cross -examine one another at a Manhattan apartment .
Studying for the state bar exam is , of course , quite stressful , so the plan is to cut loose with a weekly orgy .
But no gathering of legal vipers , no matter how unconventional , would be complete without a clearly defined set of rules to parse and eventually argue about .
For example , there 's no talking about your law firm , no talking about your law school , no using your real name , an equal number of men and women , and , to ensure no uglies , everyone has to send a picture , " but you can blur your face . "
The event , for all involved , should make for some awkward depositions and court appearances in the coming years , but it 's not like it will disqualify anyone from , say , becoming a governor , Congressman or senator .
The original ad has been pulled from Craigslist , but there 's a copy after the jump ( sans a small , grainy orgy photo ) .

A team of neuroscientists at University College London ( UCL ) has begun to discover how the brain maps three - dimensional space .
The work could one day aid in the understanding and treatment of Alzheimer ’s disease , which involves the same area of the brain as encodes space .
The results of the research are to be presented today ( Sunday 13 July ) at FENS 2008 by Dr Kate Jeffery of UCL .
It ’s long been known that humans and other mammals have “ cognitive maps ” , spatial representations in their brains that map their environment and enable them to find their way around .
These maps are made up of types of brain cells ( neurons ) known as place cells and grid cells , which are found in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex , the memory regions of the brain .
Place cells each represent a particular place , firing when the animal is at that place , while grid cells are thought to provide place cells with information about distances and directions .
“ We ’ve learned quite a lot about how neurons represent flat spaces , ” says Dr Jeffery .
“ What we do n’t really know is how that information extends to the third dimension – are our maps really just flat or are they actually three - dimensional ? ”
To find out , the team at UCL placed rats on a spiral staircase which they had to run up and down to collect food .
The team recorded the activity of individual neurons while the rats performed this task .
They found that the place cells are sensitive to height , while grid cells are not .
“ This raises the possibility that the vertical dimension is encoded differently from the horizontal ones , a possibility that we are exploring on tilted surfaces , and by using mazes that the rats can climb through freely in all directions , ” says Dr Jeffery .
This idea that vertical and horizontal space are encoded differently may also explain some aspects of human behaviour , such as the fact that people get lost easily in multi-storey buildings .
Dr Jeffery is also interested in how non-spatial cues help the animal to map its environment – for example it ’s known that specific smells and colours and even the animal ’s intentions and expectations can contribute to the cognitive map .
“ It ’s slightly more complicated than just a spatial map , also incorporating what the animal might expect to happen there , ” she says .
Essentially the map is using knowledge from the animal ’s memory to help it understand its environment .
And in fact the connection between the map and memory is very close indeed – the same brain areas that encode space in the rat and human brain are also important in episodic memory , or remembering past events .
“ We ’re trying to build up a picture of how space and memory are woven together , ” says Dr Jeffery .
Alzheimer ’s disease illustrates just how closely these two concepts are linked .
The disease involves the degeneration of the hippocampus , where the place cells are located , and the entorhinal cortex , which contains the grid cells .
“ The big symptom of degeneration of those structures is the loss of episodic memory , ” Dr Jeffery explains , “ but in fact one of the first symptoms Alzheimer ’s sufferers experience can be loss of memory for places ” .
Dr Jeffery now aims to find out more about how 3 - D space is represented in the brain , and it ’s to be hoped that research like hers may one day help us to better understand not only how we navigate , but also diseases such as Alzheimer’s .

Muslims outraged at police advert featuring cute puppy sitting in policeman 's hat
A postcard featuring a cute puppy sitting in a policeman's hat advertising a Scottish police force 's new telephone number has sparked outrage from Muslims .
Tayside Police 's new non-emergency phone number has prompted complaints from members of the Islamic community .
The choice of image on the Tayside Police cards - a black dog sitting in a police officer 's hat - has now been raised with Chief Constable John Vine .
Tayside Police caused uproar in the Muslim community after they released this advertisement featuring police puppy Rebel sitting in a hat
The advert has upset Muslims because dogs are considered ritually unclean and has sparked such anger that some shopkeepers in Dundee have refused to display the advert .
Dundee councillor Mohammed Asif said : ' My concern was that it 's not welcomed by all communities , with the dog on the cards .
' It was probably a waste of resources going to these communities .
' They ( the police ) should have understood .
Since then , the police have explained that it was an oversight on their part , and that if they 'd seen it was going to cause upset they would n't have done it . '
Councillor Asif , who is a member of the Tayside Joint Police Board , said that the force had a diversity adviser and was generally very aware of such issues .
He raised the matter with Mr Vine at a meeting of the board .
Tayside Police Chief Constable John
Vine said the advert was not intended to cause any offence
The chief constable said he was unaware of the concerns and that the force had not sought to cause any upset but added he would look into the matter .
Councillor Asif said : ' People who have shops just wo n't put up the postcard .
But the police have said to me that it was simply an oversight and they did not seek to offend or upset . '
Cards featuring police dog - in - training Rebel have been distributed to communities throughout the area to advertise the single number point of contact for non-emergency calls to the police .
Rebel has proved a popular recruit for Tayside Police after coming through the very first Lothian and Borders Police dog-breeding programme in February .
One of seven German Shepherd pups born in early December , he has now completed his course of inoculations , and is free to venture out onto the streets of Tayside .
A spokesman for Tayside Police said : ' Trainee police dog Rebel has proved extremely popular with children and adults since being introduced to the public , aged six weeks old , as Tayside Police 's newest canine recruit .
' His incredible world - wide popularity - he has attracted record visitor numbers to our website - led us to believe Rebel could play a starring role in the promotion of our non-emergency number .
' We did not seek advice from the force 's diversity adviser prior to publishing and distributing the postcards .
That was an oversight and we apologise for any offence caused . '
A baby boy born with two heads in south - western Bangladesh has been placed under police protection because of the curiosity his birth has caused among residents , a doctor said on Wednesday .
The boy , named Kiron , was born by caesarean section in Keshobpur , 135 kilometres from Dhaka , on Monday , gynaecologist Mohamad Abdul Bari said .
He weighed 5.5 kilograms .
" He has one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths .
He has one genital organ and a full set of limbs , " he said .
" He was born from one embryo but there was a developmental anomaly . "

As the legal issues surrounding file - sharing heat up in the UK , more and more recipients of compensation demands are considering their defense .
One such possibility is the ' wireless ' or ' WiFi ' defense .
We take a look at the issue and try to shine some light on what people can expect , should they take this route .
As long as there have been lawsuits against alleged file - sharers , there have been people claiming that they did not do what the anti-piracy agencies are alleging .
In a practical world , although it should be possible for competent groups and individuals to identify an IP address infringing copyright , it is known worldwide that many anti-piracy outfits are simply not competent .
They send warnings or compensation demands to laser printers and hundreds of other non-infringing users and devices , such as the user in Germany recently who proved to be using a client which was n’t capable of infringing .
Even the MPAA acknowledges that it ’s so difficult to gather evidence to use in these cases that feels it should n’t have to provide any .
Let ’s imagine for a moment that these anti-piracy tracking companies operate 100 % flawless systems ( I know , I know … )
That they have opened up their systems for scrutiny , and that they can correctly identify an infringing IP address 100 % of the time .
Surely if we reached this point , there can be no further dispute ?
Well , not quite .
Although the identification of an infringing IP address should be possible , in the absence of spy cameras it is absolutely impossible to identify the user sitting at the keyboard at the time of the alleged infringement .
Add a wireless router into the mix and the infringer on the network could be just about anyone within its range .
Add an unsecured wireless router in a densely populated area , and it ’s happy hour at lawsuit hotel .
However , this does n’t put off lawyers from sending out compensation claims as they only target the bill payer .
Since the UK law firm Davenport Lyons are leading the chasing of alleged file - sharers in the UK , we ’ll look at their cases .
Davenport acknowledge in their compensation - demanding letters that the bill payer may not be responsible for the infringement – but nevertheless , that does n’t stop them from threatening them anyway .
So what happens when a bill payer is accused of an infringement he knows he did not commit ?
Recently , we covered the story of a German case where the Regional Court in Frankfurt declared that if an infringement takes place on a wireless network , it is the responsibility of the infringer , not the network owner .
Of course , for Davenport Lyons this was quite a problem due to the fact that for over a year now they ’ve been saying that German law would be echoed in the UK , and that wireless network owners would be found liable for activities carried out on them .
Now , Struan Robertson , a technology lawyer with prominent law firm Pinsent Masons ( the company behind the well respected Out - Law.com ) has confirmed what we ’ve suspected all along – that a UK court would not hold the bill payer responsible if it ’s clear they were n’t responsible for the infringement :
“ The onus is on the party bringing the action to convince the court on a balance of probabilities that the person being sued is responsible for the infringement , ” he said .
“ The legal wrong is n’t that you left your network open , it ’s the file - sharing . ”
In a civil case in the UK , this phrase “ balance of probabilities ” is very important and roughly means “ is it likely the defendant carried out the act , based on the evidence provided ? ”
It ’s worth noting that higher levels of proof ( as in a criminal case ) are not required , as Robertson notes : “ The trouble is , if you use the Wi-Fi defense , absent of any computer evidence to back either party ’s case , the judge might simply think that you ’re lying .
That ’s one reason why you ’re asking for trouble by leaving your Wi -Fi network open to the world . ”
Noting Robertsons comments , in preparing a wireless defense , evidence from a router showing that others have accessed the device ( multiple MAC addresses in the logs , for example ) could prove vital in tipping the scales in the favor of the defendant .
Presuming that the case ever gets to court , that is .
There is n’t any requirement to hand this evidence over beforehand , but indicating that it could be produced in court would be helpful .
As Logistep provide their data to the court in spreadsheet format , that should also suffice when offering evidence in defense .
Information received by TorrentFreak further indicates that some of those who have robustly denied Davenport ’s allegations , have found the law firm backing down .
Now it appears that in some cases they seem to be backing down when faced with a strong “ wireless defense ” .
This is quite a turning point since up to now , Davenport have insisted the bill payer is always responsible for what happens on his connection .
Interestingly , according to documents shown to us , Davenport state that although they wo n’t take any further action now , they would take action if the user ’s IP address is seen infringing in the future , and that proceedings would be made against the bill payer for failing to secure the network against 3rd party access .
Back to Mr Robertson ’s comments :
The legal wrong is n’t that you left your network open , it ’s the file - sharing .
Moving on …..
The dangers of mounting a weak or non-genuine “ wireless defense ” were outlined earlier by Mr Robinson , so this is a clearly a very serious issue .
However , there are also other areas where infringement could ’ve been carried out by someone other than the bill payer , not from outside but from within the family unit – by children for instance .
Out - Law has kindly clarified the position in the UK :
“ Both Scots law and English law provide that a parent generally is not liable for the actions of their child , and that a civil judgment is as binding on a child as it is on an adult .
There are , though , some circumstances in which a parent can become responsible for the child ’s actions .
That can happen when a child causes injury to others or where a parent has previously authorised or subsequently ratified the child ’s unlawful act . ”
There is little doubt that at least some of the people accused by Davenport have committed some sort of infringement .
Equally we have seen lots of evidence that shows that many have not .
Many bill payers are wrongfully accused due to the actions of others and since the Logistep tracking company ( and others like them ) wo n’t open up their software to outside scrutiny , it ’s impossible to say how many others are being wrongfully accused simply through errors in the system .
Whatever the truth , one wrong accusation is 100 % unacceptable .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Inflation is the itch that the Federal Reserve just can't seem to scratch .
The Fed has slashed interest rates numerous times since last September to try to get the economy out of this severe funk .
But so far , the most notable consequences of the rate cuts are a drastically weakened dollar and surging commodity prices .
The Labor Department reported Tuesday that its Producer Price Index , which measures wholesale prices , jumped 1.1 % in March , the second biggest gain in the past 33 years and much higher than forecasts .
The so - called " core " PPI number , which excludes food and energy prices , rose a more modest 0.2 % , in line with expectations .
But is that really supposed to soothe consumers ?
Oil prices hit a new record high Tuesday , as did the prices per gallon of gas and diesel fuel .
In the past twelve months , sugar prices are up 27 % .
Corn prices have surged 67 % and wheat prices have shot up 73 % .
The argument that economists should look more at " core " inflation has to ring hollow with consumers who are taking a big financial bite every time they go food shopping and fill up their car 's gas tank .
" This is just another data point in the crescendo of negative news we 've been getting for the past couple of months , " said John Derrick , director of research for U.S. Global Investors , a money management firm .
" Energy and food price increases continue to be the main story , " he added .
" The higher cost of energy is not just affecting Americans through the price of a gallon of gas , it 's affecting the cost to put food on their table . "
We 'll find out Wednesday just how much of these increased costs are being passed on to you and me when the Labor Department reports its Consumer Price Index .
Economists expect a 0.3 % increase in the overall CPI and 0.2 % bump in the core number .
But one has to think that the overall number will be higher than forecast based on Tuesday 's PPI figure .
The weak dollar and resulting surge in commodity prices have the Federal Reserve concerned .
That 's why more big rate cuts from the Fed might not be the best way to address the economic weakness .
" Think of the fed funds rate as a monetary spigot , and the Fed 's goal is keeping the lawn of the economy green and healthy , " said Dallas Federal Reserve president Richard Fisher ( our favorite Fed official and father of the world 's best Tom Cruise impersonator ) in a speech in San Antonio last week .
" If we turn the spigot up too forcefully , we will flood and kill the grass with inflation .
If we provide too little , the lawn turns brown , starved for money , " Fisher explained .
Fisher went on to say that because of the credit crunch , rate cuts have not yet helped to stimulate more borrowing .
He blamed " the shadow banking system , " referring to a term dubbed by Pimco managing director Paul McCulley last year to describe unregulated securities created by many investment banks .
Fisher said credit problems have made investment banks look like " a Rube Goldberg device designed by a hydrologist on acid , with pipes and conduits that lead every which way and not always toward the goal of sustainable economic growth . "
( Imagine Ben Bernanke using that metaphor . )
For this reason , he added that " even as we have been cutting the fed funds rate , even as we have been opening the monetary spigot , interest rates for private sector borrowers have not fallen correspondingly , and rates for some borrowers have increased .
The grass is turning brown . "
In other words , the rate cuts have not substantially helped and more big rate reductions might not either .
Instead , they may simply lead to a further weakening of the dollar and more inflation .
These words should n't come as a big surprise since Fisher is the Fed 's resident inflation hawk .
He voted against the three - quarter point rate cut in March as well as the half - point cut on Jan. 30 .
( He was not a voting member of the Fed 's policy - making committee last year . )
But other Fed members who were on board with these big rate cuts are starting to express more worries as well .
" We also need to be alert to risks to price stability , " said Fed governor Kevin Warsh in a speech in New York Monday .
" Increases in food and energy prices have pushed up overall consumer prices and are putting upward pressure on core inflation and inflation expectations .
We will continue to monitor the inflation situation closely . "
Warsh has voted in favor of all of the Fed 's six rate cuts since last September .
And Philadelphia Federal Reserve president Charles Plosser joined Fisher in voting against the three - quarter point cut in March .
According to the minutes of that meeting , released last week , Plosser indicated that the Fed " could not afford to wait until there was clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored , as by then it would be too late to prevent a further increase in inflation pressures . "
Plosser will be speaking Wednesday at Montgomery County College in Blue Bell , Pa. , about the near - term prospects of the economy .
It will be interesting to see if he elaborates further on his inflation concerns .
Because if oil at $ 113 a barrel is n't " clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored , " I do n't know what is .

FFP , Combinator Calculus and Parallel Forth
by Baldrson
In his 1977 Turing Lecture , John Backus challenged computists to break free of what he called " the von Neumann bottleneck " .
One of the offshoots of that challenge was work on massive parallelism based on combinator calculus a branch of mathematics that is far closer to Forth 's formalism than parameter list systems ( which are more or less lambda calculus derivatives ) .
The prolific Forth afficionado Philip Koopman did some work on combinator reduction related to Forth but seems not to have followed through with implementations that realize the potential for massive parallelism that were pursued in the early 1980s by adherents of Backus 's Formal Functional Programming paradigm .
Given recent advances in hierarchical grammar compression algorithms , such as SEQUITUR , that are one step away from producing combinator programs as their output , and your own statements that Forth programming consists largely of compressing idiomatic sequences , it seems Backus 's original challenge to create massively parallel Formal Functional Programming machines in hardware are near realization with your new chips -- lacking only some mapping of the early work on combinator reduction machines .
It is almost certainly the case you are aware of the relationship between combinator reduction machines and Forth machines -- and of Backus 's challenge .
What have you been doing toward the end of unifying these two branches of endeavor so that the software engineering advantages sought by Backus are actualized by Forth machines of your recent designs ?
Chuck Moore :
What can I say ?
Backus did not mention Forth in his lecture .
He probably did n't know of it then .
Yet Forth addresses many of his criticisms of conventional languages .
He thinks a language needs or benefits from a formal specification .
I grew up worshiping Principia Mathematica ' till I learned how Goedel refuted it .
The result is that I distrust formal representations .
For example , the ANSII Forth standard does not describe Forth , but a language with the same name .
Yes , I am struck by the duality between Lisp and Lambda Calculus vs. Forth and postfix .
But I am not impressed by the productivity of functional languages .
Even as research tools , they have failed to live up to their promise .
By that I mean to do something with computers that I could n't do more easily in Forth .
I designed the memory for the c18 to occupy the same area as the processor .
This means small , fast and smart .
c 18 can respond to a bus request by fetching from its memory , accessing off - chip or performing a calculation .
The 25 x avoids the von Neumann bottleneck by making up to 27 memory accesses at the same time ( 2 off - chip ) .
And its multiple buses do not substitute a network bottleneck for a memory one .
Standard code will be in the ROM of each computer .
How this is customized in RAM and the computers assigned tasks is left to the ingenuity of the programmer , not a compiler .
Automatically generated or factored code has never impressed me .
Nor has automatic place and route for circuit boards or silicon .
They are both an order - of - magnitude from human performance .
Because humans understand the problem , judge the results and cheat as required .
Marginalizing of the blind
by Medievalist
When I built my first Internet node , the web did not yet exist , and one of the amazing things about the Internet was how friendly it was to the blind .
Now , with some computer experts estimating that over 50 % of the Internet is incomprehensible to braille interfaces , and most computer operating systems devolving to caveman interfaces ( " point at the pretty pictures and grunt " ) we seem to be ready to take the next step - disenfranchising the merely color - blind .
I realize that colorforth is not inherently discriminatory , in that there are a great many other languages that can be used to do the same work .
The web is also not inherently discriminatory , because it does not force site designers to design pages as stupidly as , for example , Hewlett - Packard .
Would you care to comment on the situation , speaking as a tool designer ?
How would you feel if a talented programmer were unable to get a job due to a requirement for colored sight ?
CM : I 'm amazed at how effective blind programmers can be .
I rely so strongly upon seeing the code that it 's hard to imagine listening to it .
Yet I know it can be done .
Not being color - blind , it 's hard to appreciate the degree of information loss .
But it 's less than being blind .
My goal is to develop tools that augment my abilities .
If others can use them , fine .
It would be foolish to lose an opportunity to explore or excel just to conform to some equalitarian philosophy .
Too often our culture seeks the lowest common denominator .
20 - 20 vision is required for fighter pilots .
I have no qualms about requiring color vision for programmers .
Everyone does not need to be a programmer .
But in fact , color is merely a property of words that helps to distinguish them .
As is intensity , size , font , volume and tone .
I 'm sure colorForth will be translated into these other representations .
I , myself , will be exploring spoken colorForth .
( As soon as I can decipher PC sound cards . )
Massively Parallel Computing
by PureFiction
The 25X system reminded me of IBM's Blue Gene computer , where a large number of inexpensive CPU cores are placed on a single chip .
The biggest problem in dealing with a large number of small cores lies in the programming .
I.e. how do you design and code a program that can utilize a thousand cores efficiently for some kind of operation ?
This goes beyond multi- threading into an entirely different kind of program organization and execution .
Do you see Forth ( or future extensions to Forth ) as a solution to this kind of problem ?
Does 25X dream of scaling to the magnitude that IBM envisions for Blue Gene ?
Do you think massively parallel computing with inexpensive , expendable cores clustered on cheap dies will hit the desktop or power - user market , or forever be constrained to research ?
CM : Forth is a massively pragmatic language : do whatever you can to solve a problem .
Its strength is in the ease of violating whatever rules it has .
The 25 x is similarly pragmatic .
I do n't know how to program it yet , but I 'm confident I can .
It 's just another level of factoring .
The parallelism provided by the 25 x has a different slant from other parallel architectures .
The computers are not identical .
I expect many will have different ROM and different interface to the real world .
This asymmetry is a powerful clue as to how applications will be factored .
A 10x10 array of 25 x chips is an easy board to build .
At 50 Watts , it needs as much power as a notebook .
That 's 2500 computers providing 6M Mips .
I can't imagine programming them any other way than Forth .
The advantage of Forth in this kind of context is that it scales .
Forth is the machine language , Forth is the high - level language , Forth is the task - control language , Forth is the supervisory language .
Each of these has a different vocabulary , but they share syntax , compiler and programmer skills .
Back to the array of 25 x chips .
Each chip could be on a vertical and horizontal serial bus with 10 others .
A half - duplex bus requires a computer to manage , so that accounts for 200 computers .
Now whatever the application , data must be provided .
Say 1GHz Ethernet .
Data ( and program ) is received , distributed and crunched .
The assignment and coding of computers follows the data flow .
Results are routed back to Ethernet , or displayed or whatever .
It 's a nice programming problem , well within the ability of a human to organize .
Will this ever reach the mass market ?
I do n't know .
The direction of 25 x Microcomputer ...
by Midnight Ryder
The 25 x concept looks like it could really a damned interesting idea .
But one of the questions in my mind is where you want to head with it ?
Is this something that is to be used for very specialized research and scientific applications , or is this something that you envision for a general ' desktop ' computer for normal people eventually ?
Secondly , if you are considering the 25 x for a desktop machine that would be accessible by people that are n't full - time geeks , what about software ?
Forth is a lost development art for many people ( It 's probably been 10 years since I even looked at any Forth code ) and porting current C and C++ application would be impossible - or would it ?
Is there a potential way to minimize the ' pain ' of completely re-writing a C++ app to colorForth for the 25 x machines , which could help to speed adoption of a platform ?
CM : At this stage the 25 x is a solution looking for a problem .
It 's an infinite supply of free Mips .
There 's no obligation to use them all , or even very many .
But they can effectively be used to eliminate hardware .
To bit - bang what would otherwise need a controller .
So if you want video or audio or radio or ...
The first applications will doubtless be embedded .
These offer greater volume , less software and less market resistance than a general - purpose computer .
I see 25 x reaching the desktop as dedicated appliances rather than universal golems .
I 'm not interested in recoding C applications .
My experience indicates that most applications are hardware - dependent .
The 25 x is as large a change in the hardware environment as I can imagine .
This changes the program so much it might as well be rethought and recoded .
The most efficient way to do that is Forth .
Forth is a simple , interactive language .
Its learning curve is steep with a long tail .
You can be productive in a day / week .
This depends only on how long it takes to memorize pre-existing words .
Good documentation and management helps mightily .
I 'd rather train programmers than fight code translators .
That said , there are those who look at the mountain of existing applications and want to mine it .
C to Forth translators exist and with some pre/post editing could produce code for the c18 core .
How to distribute the application among 25 tiny computers would be a good thesis .
Quick question
by jd
( If you could microcode the " instruction set " , all the better .
A parallel processor array can become an entire Object Oriented program , with each instance stored as a " thread " on a given processor .
You could then run a program without ever touching main memory at all . )
I 'm sure there are neater solutions , though , to the problems of how to make a parallel array useful , have it communicate efficiently , and yet not die from boredom with a hundred wait - states until RAM catches up .
What approach did you take , to solve these problems , and how do you see that approach changing as your parallel system & Forth language evolve ?
CM : The 25 x could implement a multi - thread application nicely indeed .
Except that most applications expect more memory that a c 18 core has .
Whereupon memory remains the bottleneck .
It 's important to choose problems and solutions that avoid using off - chip memory .
Even so , with 25 computers to support , I expect that every memory cycle will be utilized .
The computer controlling memory can be smart about priorities and about anticipating requirements .
For example , it could guarantee enough access to support display computers .
And the nice thing about memory - mapped communication is that a computer need not be aware of its environment .
It 's an ordinary Forth program accessing data asynchronously .
Delays are invisible , as is synchronization .
Of course , due care is required to avoid lock - up loops .
These conjectures are fun .
But in a year we 'll have real applications to review .
And a much better appreciation of the advantages and drawbacks of so many tiny computers .
Programming languages ...
by Midnight Ryder
This one would probably require a bit more time to answer than you probably have available , but a quick rundown would be cool :
Where do you see programming languages headed - vs- where do you think they SHOULD be headed ?
Java , C# , and some of the other ' newer ' languages seem to be a far cry from Fourth , but are languages headed ( in your opinion ) in the proper direction ?
CM : I 've been bemused with the preoccupation of new languages with text processing .
I 've been accused of not providing string operators in both Forth and colorForth .
Indeed , I have n't because I do n't use them .
Editing a file to pass on to another program never struck me as productive .
That 's one reason I chose pre-parsed source , to break the dependence upon strings and text processors .
Languages are evolving , as evidenced by the new ones that arise .
But as with natural evolution , the process is not directed .
There is no goal to approach nor any reward for approaching it .
But whatever progress you might perceive , I do n't .
New languages seem only to propose new syntax for tired semantics .
These languages are all infix .
Which is extraordinarily clumsy for anything but arithmetic expressions .
And even those are comfortable only because we learned them in Algebra 101 .
Do you remember the learning curve ?
Does everyone really think that 50 years into the computer age we have hit upon the ultimate language ?
As more and more C code accumulates , will it ever be replaced ?
Are we doomed to stumble over increasingly bloated code forever ?
Are we expecting computers to program themselves and thus save civilization ?
I 'm locked in the Forth paradigm .
I see it as the ideal programming language .
If it had a flaw , I 'd correct it .
colorForth uses pre-parsed source to speed and simplify compilation .
This solves a non-problem , but it 's neat and worth exploring .
At least it proves I have n't gone to sleep .
What about memory protection ?
by jcr
From the web pages , I do n't see any mention of access control .
Can this processor be used in a multi-user , general - purpose mode ?
CM : If you had a chip , you 'd physically control access to it .
It does n't make sense for another person to share your chip .
He can get his own .
Certainly an individual c18 has too little memory to multi-task .
And I doubt 25 computers could run 25 tasks .
But the 25 computers can certainly perform more than one task .
They have to share resources : communication buses , off - chip memory and interfaces .
Access is negotiated by the computer in charge of the resource .
There is no hardware protection .
Memory protection can be provided by the access computer .
But I prefer software that is correct by design .
Communication with other computers , via internal or external buses , is subject to the usual problems of scheduling , routing and authentication .
Internally , at least , my goal is to minimize delay rather than attempt protection .
I anticipate spectacular crashes while software is developed .
( Have you ever crashed 2500 computers ? )
Where is forth going ?
by JanneM
I learned forth early on in my programming career ; it was very memory and CPU efficient , something that was important on early microcomputers .
It was also a great deal of fun ( though far less fun to try and understand what you wrote a week earlier ... ) .
Today , even small , cheap microcontrollers are able to run fairly sophisticated programs , and it is far easier to cross - compile stuff on a ' big ' machine and just drop the compiled code onto the development board .
Forth has ( in my eyes ) always been about small and efficient .
Today , though , embedded apps are more likely to be written in C than in forth , and the " OS as part to the language " thing is n't as compelling today as it was in the eighties .
Where is forth being used today , and where do you see it going in the future ?
CM : Forth is being used today as it always has been .
In resource - constrained applications .
I think they will always exist .
I 'm creating some with the tiny c18 computers in the 25 x .
I imagine molecular computers will be limited when they first appear .
Personally , I do n't mind losing a mature market that can afford abundant resources .
Such applications are n't as much fun .
But Forth is n't restricted to small applications .
Even with huge memories and fast processors , small , reliable programs have an advantage .
The major project cost has become software , to the dismay of managers everywhere .
On - time , bug - free software is the grail .
Forth does n't guarantee it , but sure makes it easier .
Will this ever be convincingly demonstrated ?
Will management ever value results over procedures ?
The currently popular language is selected by uninformed users .
The only thing in favor of such democratic choice is that it 's better than any other .
But why would anyone want to debug 1 M lines of code instead of 10 K ?
What 's the next Big Computational Hurdle ?
by DG
Now that sub - $ 1 k computers are running in the GHz range , it seems that all the computational tasks on a common desktop system are not processor - bound .
3D , rendered - on - the - fly games get well over 30 frames per second at insanely high resolutions and levels of detail .
The most bloated and poorly - written office software scrolls though huge documents and recalculates massive spreadsheets in a snap .
Compiling the Linux kernel can be done in less than 5 minutes .
And so on .
It seems that the limiting speed of modern computers is off the processor , in IO .
What then , do you forsee coming down the pike that requires more processor power than we have today ?
What 's the underlying goal you intend to solve with your work ?
CM : Memory is cheap .
I do n't mind wasting memory as long as it's not full of code that has to be debugged .
Likewise , Mips are cheap .
The trick is to find productive ways to waste them .
A Pentium waiting for a keystroke is n't very clever .
So here 's a huge pool of Mips .
What can you do with them ?
Voice recognition comes instantly to mind .
Image recognition close behind .
The brain deploys substantial resources to these tasks , so I suspect a computer must .
IO is indeed a bottleneck , but not in principle .
If you can't get data from the camera to the computer , combine them .
Put the image recognition algorithms in the camera .
Analyse , reduce , compress data at the source .
Meanwhile , it helps to have multiple paths off - chip .
revolutionary
by rnd
What is the most revolutionary ( i.e. , it is scoffed at by those in control / power ) idea in the software industry today ?
Explain how this idea will eventually win out and revolutionize software as we know it .
CM : Forth !
But then I have n't been out looking for revolutionary ideas .
I like the phrase Baldrson used above : compressing ideomatic sequences .
If you do this recursively , you obtain a optimal representation .
I see no way to get a more compact , clear , reliable statement of a problem / solution .
Forth clearly revolutionizes software as most know it .
It could lead to efficient , reliable applications .
But that wo n't happen .
A mainstay of our economy is the employment of programmers .
A winnowing by factor 100 is in no one 's interest .
Not the programmers , the companies , the government .
To keep those programmers busy requires clumsy languages and bugs to chase .
I do n't have to be glib or cynical .
Those are facts of life .
Society must cope with them .
But I do n't have to .
Nor you .
There are niches in which you can be creative , productive , inspired .
Not everyone can be so lucky .
Forth as intermediate language
by Ed Avis
Many high - level languages compile into C code , which is then compiled with gcc or whatever .
Do any use Forth instead ?
I understand Forth is a stack - based language : does n't that present problems when compiling for CPUs that mostly work using registers ?
CM : I remember my shock at learning that Fortran compiled into Assembler , that then had to be assembled .
A language that can be translated into another is clearly unnecessary .
Truely different languages cannot be translated : C into Lisp .
Forth would make a fine intermediate language .
But why have an intermediate language ?
It introduces another layer of confusion and inefficiency between the programmer and her computer .
Macros were invented to support compiling directly to machine code .
Stacks are a compiler - friendly construct .
Every compiler has to use one to translate infix notation to postfix .
If this stack solution has to be assigned to registers , it 's an extra step .
Forth uses stacks explicitly and avoids the whole subject .
Register - based CPUs have more problems than just the complexity of their compilers .
Their instructions must contain register addresses , which makes them longer and programs bigger .
And it is rare that every register can be used in every instruction .
Moreover registers need to be optimized .
After assigning system registers , performance depends on how well the remaining registers are handled .
Compilers can optimize infix expressions better than humans .
But such expressions are no longer the preferred means of doing arithmetic .
DSPs and super - computers integrate difference equations .
Design guidelines encourage code with many subroutine calls each with only a few arguments .
This is the style Forth employs .
But it plays havoc with optimization , since register usage must be resolved before each call .
So apart from being unnecessary and difficult , optimization has no effect on good code .
The end of the SUV / Love 'em or hate 'em , the American land yacht is rumbling into the sunset .
Rejoice ?
Let us , first and foremost , be perfectly clear : it ain't over yet .
Millions of dinosaurs still roam the Earth , the giant meteor of merciful annihilation has yet to strike , complete and total upheaval is still merely pending .
But it 's coming fast .
You can sense the shadow , the darkening , the imminent and oily doom .
The dinosaurs are trembling , scribbling out their wills as fast as possible .
They know the end is near , the signs are all in place , as that giant $ 63 K Toyota Land Cruiser V8 you bought just a couple years ago violently depreciates down to less than half of what you paid for it .
Ouch .
Yes , the imploding petroleum economy has spoken , and this is what it said :
The era of the big , happy , dumb SUV is over .
Will you celebrate ?
Mourn ?
Mark this year on your calendar with the bright red Sharpie of petro-economic ignominy mixed with the cold tears of terrified Detroit CEOs , and dash off to buy a nice scooter ?
Well , why not ?
Twenty years .
That 's about how long these great and ridiculous beasts stomped the Earth without peer or predator or even much coherent justification , how long the full - sized SUV has been at the center of warped American automotive identity , giving soccer moms and frat dudes alike a false and often dangerous sense of security and capability , when all the beasts really offered was horrible mileage and appalling handling and many thousands of fiery rollover deaths , mixed with aesthetics straight from the caveman - with - a- sledgehammer school of design .
Ah , we loved them well .
Shall we enjoy a brief retrospective ?
Because I believe it was Ford MoCo who ( arguably ) fired the opening salvo , who shocked both itself and the world when it ( sort of ) invented the first mass - market SUV back in 1990 merely by tacking some extra seats and a few hunks of cheap leather and soft shocks onto a lug - nut pickup truck , painted it a pretty color and called it an Explorer and sold about 50 million in a week .
Oh , there were plenty of stiff trucks with SUV - like shapes in existence many years , even decades , before the Explorer ( hi Ford Bronco , Jeep Cherokee , Chevy Blazer , et al ) , but Ford was the first to see the untapped potential of these ungainly beasts and take the thuggishness - with - style idea soft and mainstream .
What a time it was .
But now , brutal irony abounds .
Ford is in panic mode , just suffered a whopping $ 8.7 billion in losses last quarter alone , is right now scrambling to overhaul many of its truck plants so as to start cranking out hot little Fiestas and Focuses and a slew of mediocre sedans , all as a result of leaning on the SUV 's enormous profit margins for far too long .
And GM is in the same boat , having racked up $ 50 billion in losses in three painful years .
In fact , all of Detroit is , technically speaking , freaking out .
Meanwhile , all Japanese and even most German automakers , each with lots of small , efficient cars / brands already in the stable , are grinning like well - prepared survivalists in their own bomb shelters .
Leave it to America 's most boorish , thick headed companies to find themselves as they were back in the ' 70s oil crisis , caught about nine steps behind reality .
Zero sympathy , except for all those laid - off factory workers .
But really , who did n't see the SUV 's collapse coming a mile away ?
Who did n't note the beginning of the end when , a mere five years ago , the world 's worst consumer vehicle ever took its place as the king of obscene stupidity , the poster child for all that went wrong with the condescending American ethos , the oil - sucking war - drunk Bush - mauled mind - set ?
Ah , the Hummer H2 .
Has any consumer product embodied our misguided arrogance better ?
The ridiculous scale , the horrible handling , the crappy build quality , the contemptible road manners , the false machismo , the Cro-Magnon design , the ability to traverse 60 - degree rockslides in a hurricane even though all you ever really needed to do was run over those little concrete bumps in the Wal - Mart parking lot .
Dude !
Righteous !
But I have to admit , this part of the tale makes me a little bit sentimental .
Honestly , I 'm going to miss the Hummer ( and its simply fantastic byproduct , Hummer cologne ) , much in the same way I 'll miss Dick Cheney when the Hellmouth swallows him home next year .
Dumb villains simply do n't come much more glaring , much more churlish and sad than that .
But baby , it 's all over now .
GM is trying desperately to dump the Hummer brand ( maybe on China ) , SUV sales are nosediving faster than Miley Cyrus ' career into the land of anorexia and Olsen Twin - certified rehab .
Already small cars are outselling SUVs and pickup trucks for the first time in years .
Hybrid sales are soaring .
" Crossover " is the new ( and rather lame ) buzzword in Detroit , as automakers strain for a tolerable fusion of SUV - like capacity and car - like efficiency .
Of course , the shift wo n't happen overnight .
There are still tens of millions of SUVs on the road , most well under a decade old and most with lots of lumbering life left .
Plus , five bucks a gallon is still a pittance for a large and wealthy hunk of the SUV - loving populace , as evidenced by the slew of luxobarges still being cranked out by Audi , Mercedes , Lexus , Porsche , et al .
Hey , when you can afford $ 95 K for a loaded Cayenne Turbo , 100 bucks for a tank of premium is pocket change .
So maybe what 's really changing is the central mind - set , shifting from our usual " more is more " ethos , the near - religious belief that Americans can use as much as we want and take up as much space as we like and not really give a damn , to something resembling thoughtfulness and refinement .
Would n't that be nice ?
That the downfall of the SUV is largely due to a slow but sure awakening and re-education of the American animal ?
Not a chance .
As usual , it 's merely sheer economics , most Americans turning back to small , efficient cars only because they have to .
And besides , all those mid-sized sedans and silly retro-inspired muscle cars and 30 mpg quasi - hybrid Ford Escapes coming out now are n't exactly a big step forward .
Detroit is about as nimble and innovative as a brick .
But it 's not completely their fault .
Big Auto knows that big , graceless , overpowered vehicles are a cornerstone of the all - American identity .
Even with President Obama 's imminent new environmental policies , thoughtful , permanent change is gonna take awhile .
So now I suppose we just sit back and watch the slow and uncomfortable fade , enjoy the clunky death throes of the giant and wonderfully pointless beasts that helped define an era .
Oh you big , sweet , dumb dinosaurs .
You 'll always have a special place in our hearts .
And , you know , in our juvenile rap videos .
Farewell .

「 技術力には自信があるんだけど、どうもカネ儲けがヘタでねぇ」
メーカー在籍時代、さらには記者として多くのメーカーで経営者や技術者にお話をうかがうたびに、耳にタコができるほど聞いたフレーズである。文字で書けば自嘲、反省の弁ともとれるが、実際に生でうかがうとそうでもない。ほとんどの場合、笑顔で、ときに誇らしげに語られるのである。
私も多少は常識をわきまえた社会人なので、そのような場面に遭遇すれば微妙な笑顔で「そうですかぁ」などとあいまいに受け流す。だが、責任ある立場の人からこのような発言が飛び出すと、かつて技術者であった私はそのたびにイラっとしたものだ。発言は「技術者は頑張っていい技術を開発してくれるけど、会社はその成果を利益に結びつけることができない」ことを白状したもので、誇らしげにそれを言うということは「それに関して責任はぜんぜん感じていない」ということだろう。少なくとも私には、そう聞こえてしまうのだ。技術者に限ったことではないけれど、努力して成果を出した人がちっとも報われないシステムというのは、何ともやりきれないものである。
ついに売られてしまうのか
「 それはイカンぞ」という、いっぱし義憤みたいなものがずっと心の隅にあった。で、どうするか。カネ儲けもちゃんとできるようにならなきゃならない。そうか、技術経営か、という思いが、かつて手掛けた日経ビズテックという雑誌の創刊へとつながっていったのだと思う。そんなわけで、その創刊案内パンフレットにも冒頭の話を書いた。「技術があるのに儲からない」ということは、「いい食材はふんだんにあるのにろくな料理が作れない」ということと同じ。それはマズいから、新雑誌では技術を価値に昇華させる手段を真面目に議論していきます、と宣言したのである。
それもすっかり過去の話になってしまったが、それを改めて思い出させてくれる事件が最近あった。沖電気工業（OKI）が半導体部門を分離、子会社化し、その株式の大部分をロームに譲渡する計画であることを発表したのだ。先に「メーカー在籍時代」と書いたけど、そのメーカーとはOKIのことで、「技術力には自信があるのだが・・・」というフレーズを私の脳裏にしっかり刻み付けてくれた思い出深い場所である。そこの技術者に会えば、ようやく流行らなくなってきたそのフレーズがいまでも聞けるという、貴重な会社でもある。

Rep. Steven King ( R - Iowa ) Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . )
Prospects are so bad for Republicans in the Senate that Sen. Mitch McConnell , their embattled leader , has given them free reign to vote against the party and , certainly , their unpopular president , if it will help them save their seats in November .
In stark contrast , Republicans in the House are apparently determined to follow Bush in lockstep over the cliff ( to mix multiple metaphors ) , or at least that 's the impression they gave at the impeachment hearing last Friday --- which was officially titled " Executive Power and Its Constitutional Limitation " --- when GOP Judiciary Committee members put on a show of the sort of blind loyalty to George Bush that put their party in its dire predicament in the first place .
One by one , these pols --- all of them the sort of Republicans who give white guys a bad name --- took turns lashing out at the proceedings and trying to spin Bush 's crimes as insignificant and morally relative to other president 's misdeeds .
At worst , it was a disgusting display of complicit politicians trying to save their own skins by fending off any pursuit of justice for Bush .
At best , they came off a bit comically , like vampires in movies clawing and snarling at sunlight just seconds before they meet their doom .
Speaking of horror , a prime example of growling and back - biting --- not to mention outright lying on the record --- was the performance of Rep. Steve King of Iowa ( who is not related to the novelist Stephen King ) .
" And as I 've watched the Bush administration every day in the seven and a half years , " King said , " I did n't see anything along the way that would have indicated to me by an objective judgment that we would be sitting here with these impeachment hearings today . "
And later , " I would point out that it would be pretty rare if you could find anyone out in the crowd who could actually say what it is that [ Dick Cheney 's former Chief of Staff ] Scooter Libby actually did . "
That was a rhetorical statement , of course .
There were probably any number of people in the room who could have told King that Libby was convicted on one count of obstruction of justice , two counts of perjury and one count of making false statements to federal investigators , and that he is the highest ranking White House official to be convicted of a crime since John Poindexter was convicted in the Reagan - Bush Iran - Contra scandal .
King is best known for saying that the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison was no worse than a fraternity hazing .
In March , he made news when he said that terrorists " will be dancing in the streets " if Barack Obama is elected president .
Even worse than King , however , was Rep. Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) , who trotted out tired and tattered GOP terror politics , first by eliding the nefarious aims of bin Laden to gain nuclear power with those of his mortal enemies who run the Iranian regime , and then by implying that by holding the hearing , the Democrats were helping the terrorists :
The coincidence of jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation , I believe , is one of the most dangerous circumstances facing the human family today .
Osama bin Laden says , quote , it is our duty to gain --- our religious duty to gain --- nuclear weapons .
And every day , Iran continues to enrich uranium to build a nuclear weapon .
Terrorists bide their time .
Mr. Chairman , there may well be a day when we all wish that we could revisit this day again , and when we could try to reorder our priorities and perhaps better appreciate a president who was willing to subordinate his popularity with the American people in order to protect them .
Mr. Chairman , I know that the full committee does not address itself to any of these subjects today .
Instead , it conducts a do - over hearing that amuses our terrorist friends [ sic ] greatly and that would make Alice in Wonderland roll her eyes .
Rep. Lamar Smith ( R - Texas ) , the ranking member , set the tone for his party 's studied unseriousness about the proceedings : " This week it seems that we are hosting an anger management class . "
Rep . Dan Lungren , the last Republican attorney general of California , articulated the minority 's position : " Maybe what we 're here for is something called impeachment lite .
. . .
We 're sort of in that Never - Neverland of accusing the president of impeachable offenses but not taking actions to impeach him , which I guess impugns him but does not impeach him , but maybe it has the same effect in the court of public opinion . "
And :
" One wonders what we are becoming here .
When I was a kid growing up , we used to watch Friday night fights .
Now it looks like we have the Friday morning show trials . "
For a flavor of the Republicans ' comportment , here are excerpts extracted from a recap of the hearing by Mikel Weisser at OpEd News :
GOP loyalists uniformly outraged over the very essence of the hearings Ranking Repug Lamar Smith hissed loudly the mantra of the GOP objections : congressional consideration of the numerous lies , deaths , unjust imprisonments , and misspent billions of President Bush amounts to " the criminalization of political partisanship . "
In other words the problem is not that Bush and his supporters committed these heinous acts , but that they were members of the Republican Party and those complaining about their actions are members of the Democratic Party . [...]
Trent Franks stuck to his message of dismay that the terrorists are winning and that there were many notable Democrats who also called for a War on Iraq based on claims of WMDs .
He also did a rousing review of quotes to demonstrate how much the terrorists hate us for our freedom .
" And somehow we 're going after this president you has done everything in his power to protect us . "
Of course , in putting together his terror routine , Franks failed , as so many GOP leaders do , to mention that the American public and politicians were operating on intelligence supplied by Bush in the first place .
When Swartz tried to comment Franks concluded his turn rather than let him speak .
He also mentioned that by focusing on " fairy tales " instead of terrorists , all there that morning should be ashamed . [...]
Rep. Louie Gohmert R- TX condemned most of the witnesses , reminding them that if misleading to congress is a criminal offense they should consider their " brash allegations . "
Gohmert focused on Clinton 's earlier failures and poor President Bush who " naively " " accepted " " Clinton 's lies " about Iraq WMDs .
He further claimed that Joe Wilson started speaking out to protect his friends in France who were scamming the UN oil for food deal .
He also added , like Franks that the focus of the day should have been on the terrorists , not the innocent , though naive president .
The biggest problem right now is that the Supreme Court had just voted to " release terrorists on American soil . " [...]
Dan Lungren , R- CA , addressed Holtzman and Bugliosi and returned to the popular Republican phrase , the criminalizing of political difference of opinion .
He looked back to earlier presidential abuses including the little mentioned tale of Wilson having political cartoonists imprisoned for unfavorable cartoons .
He also likened Japanese Internment to Nixon 's post - presidential tax investigations and said the Democrats were " tantamount to overcharging the case . "
He asked if impeachment is the proper tool .
Turning to Rabkin and Presser for support , Lungren interrupted Presser and himself to complain that people in the audience were holding signs . [...]
The last to speak , Dan Lungren , R- CA , came back to the microphone to say that " there is an essential difference between an misstatement of facts and an intentional misstatement ; " and as a former prosecutor he knows such allegations are easily made and hard to prove , it 's " a long road ; " only to find himself cross-examined by Rep. Jerrold Nadler , on whether or not the faulty and misleading intelligence reports Bush gave to Congress rises to the level of lying .
Again Lungren used the opportunity to complain about the crowd behavior .
Conyers apologized for the crowd 's behavior and said disrupters would not be invited back to this chamber .
After that , citing Eisenhower 's memoirs , he justified Bush 's choice to have faith in the intelligence we had and we should accept his good will and intentions .
Like Eisenhower , Bush merely " made a decision based on the best intelligence he had . "
" The way this has been portrayed as a president chomping at the bit to violate the Constitution is just unreasonable , " Lungren concluded .
Nadler countered that the issue was n't about the quality of the intelligence Bush had , but that prima fascia Bush selected the information he wanted to use and hid the rest from the world community .
Lungren stuck to his guns despite a final effort to challenge him by Rep Scott .
A pro-Bush witness called in by the GOP dismissed the proceedings this way :
" I am really astonished at the mood in this room , " commented ... George Mason University School of Law professor Jeremy Rabkin .
" The tone of these deliberations is slightly demented , " Rabkin said .
" You should all remind yourselves that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were Caligula . "
By " the rest of the country , " Rabkin , of course , meant " Fox News viewers " --- not the 55 percent of Americans who believe George Bush has abused his power in a way that rises to an impeachable offense .
All in all , it was as sad and sickening a display by the Republicans as we have seen since they lost control of Congress .
It was sad because these are the same Republicans who became complicit in Bush 's bullying and malfeasance by enabling him at every turn --- and it is always depressing to see enablers in an abusive relationships kowtowing to their abusers .
And it was sickening because , on Friday , as they have done since Bush assumed power in January 2000 , these pols put their fealty to Dear Leader , the Republican Party and their own political futures ahead of the good of the country and their own oaths to uphold the Constitution .

Other Coverage
The corporate media is ignoring this story , so here are some links to video and other coverage .
You 'll find a complete playlist of YouTube videos of the hearing here .
And here is a list of links to YouTube videos of the proceedings compiled by Gene Cappa , a commenter at OpEd News :
Dennis Kucinich on C - SPAN's " Washington Journal " :
Student inventor creates £ 20 wind turbine out of scrap for developing world
A student has built a wind turbine from scrap to help people in the developing world .
Max Robson , 22 , constructed a prototype using rubbish collected from skips , tips and bins including an old bike frame and wheel bearings , the magneto from a Vespa , a battery from a Ford Fiesta and bits of wood .
It is so simple , he says , it can be built by unskilled workers in less than a day anywhere in the world .
Max Robson designed a wind turbine made from 100 percent recycled materials
His turbine works by converting the energy in wind into electrical energy stored in a battery .
It produces an output of 11.3 watts , which is enough electricity to run lighting for 63 hours or a radio for 30 hours .
The product design student from Greenwich has just received a first class honours degree from the University of Portsmouth .
He said he had always been interested in gadgets and machines and was inspired by his father Ashley 's enthusiasm .
The wind turbine can be built by unskilled workers in less than a day anywhere in the world
' My dad wanted to do something like this but I beat him to it , ' said Mr Robson .
' He had the idea of designing a scrap wind turbine but it was my idea to use it in the developing world .
I wanted to build something worthwhile and I am interested in design being environmentally friendly . '
' This is n't going to change lives in the developing world dramatically but a device like this could make their lives a lot easier , ' he said .
' It cost me £ 20 to build the prototype and in the developing world it would be a lot less .
The nearest alternative wind turbine on the market costs £ 2,000 . '
Ashley Robson , 51 , who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Portsmouth , said he was delighted his son was following in his footsteps .
The term flip - flopping does n’t do justice to Mr. McCain ’s self - contradictory economic pronouncements because that implies there ’s some rational , if hypocritical , logic at work .
What he serves up instead is plain old incoherence , as if he were compulsively consulting one of those old Magic 8 Balls .
In a single 24 - hour period in April , Mr. McCain went from saying there ’s been “ great economic progress ” during the Bush presidency to saying “ Americans are not better off than they were eight years ago . ”
He reversed his initial condemnation of mortgage bailouts in just two weeks .
In February Mr. McCain said he would balance the federal budget by the end of his first term even while extending the gargantuan Bush tax cuts .
In April he said he ’d accomplish this by the end of his second term .
In July he ’s again saying he ’ll do it in his first term .
Why not just say he ’ll do it on Inauguration Day ?
It really does n’t matter since he ’s never supplied real numbers that would give this promise even a patina of credibility .
Mr. McCain ’s plan for Social Security reform is “ along the lines that President Bush proposed . ”
Or so he said in March .
He came out against such “ privatization ” in June ( though his policy descriptions still support it ) .
Last week he indicated he is n’t completely clear on what Social Security does .
He called the program ’s premise  young taxpayers foot the bill for their elders ( including him )  an “ absolute disgrace . ”
Given that Mr. McCain ’s sole private - sector job was a fleeting stint in public relations at his father - in - law ’s beer distributorship , he comes by his economic ignorance honestly .
But there ’s no A team aboard the Straight Talk Express to fill him in .
His campaign economist , the former Bush adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin , could be found in the June 5 issue of American Banker suggesting even at that late date that we still do n’t know “ the depth of the housing crisis ” and proposing that “ monitoring is the right thing to do in these circumstances . ”
Ms. Fiorina , the ubiquitous new public face of McCain economic policy , adds nothing to the mix beyond her incessant display of corporate jargon , from “ trend lines ” to “ start -ups . ”
Before she was fired at Hewlett - Packard , its stock had declined 50 percent during her five - plus years in charge .
She missed earning projections  by 23 percent in one quarter  much as she now misrepresents both the Obama and McCain records .
This month she said Mr. McCain wanted to require insurance plans to cover birth control medications along with Viagra , when in fact he had voted against it .

Ms. Fiorina received a $ 42 million payout ( half in cash ) from H.P. , according to a shareholders ’ subsequent lawsuit .
With this inspiring résumé , she now aspires to be Mr. McCain ’s running mate .
So does the irrepressible Mitt Romney , who actually was a business whiz before serving as Massachusetts ’s governor .
Beltway wisdom has it that the addition of such a corporate star will remedy Mr. McCain ’s fiscal flatulence .

Why We Interrupted Bush at Monticello
by David Swanson
Video by S. Johnson of Gael Murphy , Desiree Fairooz , and Linda Lisanti .
Photo by AP of our photographer S. Johnson whose work is below :
When Bush opened his mouth to speak I shouted “ Defend the Constitution , Impeach Bush ! ” I repeated that several times , as people nearby knocked me over , cops handcuffed me , people gave me smiles and thumbs up signs .
They threw me out and a couple of more defenders of our Constitution behind me , and then a few more , and then a few more .
The handcuffed citizens who ’d done their duty kept coming down the hill .
They did not arrest us but did give us a ride down the mountain where we joined a crowd of protesters in the road who greeted Bush ’s limo coming and going .
Why did we do this ?
Here ’s why .
Gael Murphy , like others , protested with a banner and shouted and never got thrown out .
She did interviews on the way out with CNN and Cville Weekly .
OPEN FOR MORE VIDEOS AND PHOTOS .
I ’ve also posted below a collection of corporate media reports on the protest , which are actually much better done than have been the depictions of the protest idea by people who oppose protesting while claiming to be on our side and paternalistically protecting us from negative news coverage .
Such unsolicited advisors may be made angry by their self - censorship , because they consistently project anger on those who protest , but I have to say we had a delightful time , the crowd was in large part friendly , the president got the message and claimed to approve of free speech , and the Albemarle Police were very decent .
I did n’t see any angry protesters , but I did see people doing their jobs as citizens and others appreciating it or resenting it while failing to do their own .

PC Gamer : What inspired you to resurrect Quake III Arena as Quake Live ?
John Carmack :
At the very highest level , Quake Live - what we originally called Quake Zero - was one of my experiments about what we could do usefully on the PC platform .
The consoles are very good machines for a lot of things , but there are some things the PC platform uniquely does better , such as anything having to do with a web browser and the superior mouse & keyboard interface .
[ Those things are ] pretty darn good reasons to be playing on the PC , and we ’re also trying out an innovative business strategy that could pave the way for the future .
Above :
In - game advertising will bankroll Quake Live , but wo n’t warn your dumb ass about incoming fire
It ’s completely free - there are n’t any micro-transactions .
Quake Live is completely ad - supported on the web browser pages and [ through ] in - game advertising .
Of course , this is speculative - we ’re going to have to see how this works out .
Early on , we were tossing around two different orders of magnitudes - anywhere from 50,000 to 5 million people playing .
We have no idea where it is going to be in there .
The fact that 70,000 people have signed up in a week means that we ’re going to be looking at hundreds of thousands of players , if not millions .
We hope that that can be a sustained critical mass of a community that can play this type of game , and be self - supporting .
Quake III Arena was always my personal favorite id Software game .
It ’s such a pure activity kind of game - more of a sport than a movie .
And I ’m excited to have this opportunity to bring back the pure type of gaming as opposed to the “ everything and the kitchen sink ” modern design .
We have no pretensions about it being the best multiplayer game in all types of things , but for any player looking to test their [ deathmatch ] skill , I think Quake III Arena is the best there ever was .
PCG : Why this new direction ?
JC : I would say that there is this sense of trying to figure out what to do with PC gaming .
Historically , id Software has been a PC gaming company , with consoles a secondary business that happened later .
And even though the PC does n’t get the focus that it used to , in many ways our hearts are still there , and we ’d like to do things where the PC is the appropriate platform .
[ We ’d like to ] do something that really speaks to the future of where the PC can be superior to consoles .
Above : The Quake III Arena touch - up for Quake Live includes new and refined character models
Obviously , we have examples like World of Warcraft that show how the PC can be viable and vibrant in its own way .
But in terms of first - person shooters , if you look at something like Crysis and say that ’s the height of what the PC market can manage , I do n’t think that ’s necessarily that exciting of a direction for the PC to be going in the future .
With Quake Live , we hope that there ’s an opportunity for people who ’ve never played shooters to give this a try , and with that , the potential of actually growing the PC gaming market .
I still have a lot of a faith in simple gameplay formulas - it might not be the game that everyone plays for three hours a day to be the best at , but it ’s something that offices , dorms , and schools across America can have fun with .
After having begun a series of investigative stories criticizing the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) in May 2008 , CNN reporter Drew Griffin reports being placed with more than a million other names on TSA ’s swollen terrorism watch list .
Although TSA insists Griffin ’s name is not on the list and pooh - poohs any possibility of retaliation for Griffin ’s negative reporting , the reporter has been hassled by various airlines on 11 flights since May .
The airlines insist that Griffin ’s name is on the list .
Congress has asked TSA to look into the tribulations of this prominent passenger .
In a recent op - ed in the Washington Post , probably responding to the controversy over Griffin , Leonard Boyle , the director of the Terrorist Screening Center , defended the watch list , claiming that because terrorists have multiple aliases , the names on the list boiled down to only about 400,000 actual people .
If there are 400,000 terrorists lying in wait to attack the United States , we are all in trouble .
But wait a minute .
There has been no major terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11  almost seven years ago .
Where are all these nefarious evildoers ?
Boyle says 95 percent of these people are not American citizens or legal residents and the vast majority are n’t even in the United States .
He rather sheepishly defends the size of the list by writing , " Its size corresponds to the threat .
It ’s a big world . "
That brings up a very important issue .
The U.S. government regularly tries to police the world and combat threats to other nations  in the process , usually generating more enemies .
Examining the forty - four organizations on the State Department ’s highly politicized list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations ( FTO ) , one finds that only a very few currently focus their efforts on U.S. targets .
And the U.S. government has even flirted with one anti-Iranian group , the Mujahedin-e Khalq , which was put on the FTO list long ago .
Similarly , the State Department ’s list of five state sponsors of terrorism has included Cuba and North Korea  neither of which has actively participated in terrorist attacks in decades .
These two countries continued to be on the list for other reasons  namely U.S. government aversion to them .
On its website , the State Department even admits that , " The Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) was not known to have sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean Airlines flight in 1987 . "
The website also contains an implicit admission that keeping selected countries on the state sponsors list can reap ulterior political benefits for the United States .
The website notes that under the umbrella of the Six - Party Talks , the United States intends to remove North Korea from the list as that nation takes actions toward getting rid of its nuclear weapons program .
Even the remaining three nations on the list that do sponsor terrorism 
Syria , Iran , and Sudan  do n’t support groups that focus their attacks on the U.S .
Thus , the humongous terrorist watch list for airline travel and the excessively large FTO and state sponsors lists are a few more examples of the United States taking on other nations ’ security burdens .
Trying to be the " big man on ( the world ) campus , " however , comes at a horrendous cost to American freedom at home .
The terrorist watch list is downright unconstitutional .
Under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , no warrants shall be issued unless there is probable cause that a crime has been committed .
If the government has such probable cause that a passenger is conspiring to commit a terrorist act on an airplane , it should not hassle that person at the airport when trying to fly or ban him or her from flying ; it should arrest them .
But of course the government does not have the evidence to do that for the vast majority of the 400,000 people on the watch list .
And it ’s apparently not easy to get yourself off the list once you are on it .
Although Boyle claims that the TSA constantly scrubs the list for possible mistaken identities of people who have frequent " encounters " with the list , even if they do n’t file a complaint , Griffin uncovered an innocent passenger with a common name  James Robinson  who has complained endlessly and has received no resolution of his case .
Senator Edward Kennedy  also with a common name  experienced endless hassles and red tape trying to get his name off the list .
If such a well - known figure has such problems , the average misidentified traveler is in big trouble .
And as the economists would say , what about opportunity cost to real security ?
The U.S. government should spend the time it devotes to scrutinizing 400,000 people on the watch list , and the vast majority of the 44 FTOs and all of the 5 countries who do n’t sponsor anti-U.S. terrorism , on the again rising principal threat from Osama bin Laden , Ayman al - Zawahiri , and their tens of hard core al - Qaeda followers operating out of Pakistan .
The American public would be much safer .
As the famous Prussian military ruler Fredrick the Great ( and closet economist ) said , " To defend everything is to defend nothing . "
Moreover , under current government policy , we have neither liberty nor security .
It 's great to see where this series started .
I find it tons of fun !
It 's a pity that this never got the attention some of your other stuff did .
It 's always nice to learn about " Dungeons And Dragons " .
I feel bad for never having played that .
I should be more of a nerd !
The voices just make this .
The emotions are done wonderfully .
The constant interruptions and irritation make this great .
It reminds me of when it said a dumb character is funny when he annoys the other characters than the audience .
Monocles are nice .
Sometimes I wonder to myself , " Why does NASA have to be so mindbogglingly conservative all the time ? "
Well this morning I got my answer : taxpayers in the Midwest .
The Rapid City Weekly News in South Dakota published an editorial response to Space.com 's ' Sex in Space ' article last week .
The editorial concludes , " the public has a right to know that tax dollars wo n't be funding fornication in the new frontiers . "
Sigh .
These guys are definitely not making it any easier for NASA to shift their stance on sex .
The Space.com article quoted NASA spokesperson Bill Jeffs of the Johnson Space Center in Houston saying , " We do n't study sexuality in space , and we do n't have any studies ongoing with that .
If that 's your specific topic , there 's nothing to discuss . "
Seems a little abrupt for a topic that could be critical to the long term survival of the species .
As a biologist I think all of this aversion to sex is a little too parochial .
Given that the goal of human space exploration at the moment is the development and settlement of space it is important to know how microgravity affects egg fertilization and embryonic development .
To date we have done vanishingly little , especially with mammals , and most work has stopped in the United States ( though France , Japan , Russia and others have done interesting work with fish and amphibians . )
Even if you are just talking about recreational sex , sex is a part of life and not something NASA needs to hide from .
No one is asking NASA to regulate the sexual activities of their flight directors .
We expect these professionals to mange their own lives and if there is a problem ( any type of problem ) that impacts their performance at work , that is when an employer steps in .
The Space.com article points out that sexual relationships on crews wintering over at the South Pole station are part of the culture there .
My favorite quote comes from a post of someone who spent time working in Antarctica :
Take any group of people .
Isolate them .
Put them under stress .
Sooner or later ... some of them will have sex .
It happens irrespective of race , creed , or gender ... We all know this .
Ask anyone who 's done submarine duty .
Ask anyone who 's done a military tour of any kind .
Ask anyone who 's been on an expedition .
People are people and always have been .
Beyond the taboo of sex with colleagues and a concern for what taxpayers will think , there is a concern for the potential complications romantic or sexual relationships can could raise for a long duration space crew .
However , the reality is that jealousy , anger , and hostility can endanger a crew even if there is no romance involved .
Banning sex will not protect crews from those types of conflicts .
Better to train the crews to be able to work through any issue that comes up on the mission and insure that they have sufficient support on the ground that they trust .
When you know you have a responsible crew that can work through anything , you do n't have to worry about legislating every action .
Perhaps a better answer Jeffs could have given was , " We do n't study human sexuality in space , and we do n't have any studies ongoing with that .
We do ask our crews to be responsible and professional and to carry themselves in a way befitting of a U.S. astronaut .
The long term health and safety of our crew is our primary concern . "

Back in December 2006 , a group of Belgian TV makers interrupted a programme about the future of the country to announce that the parliament in the Dutch - speaking part of the country , Flanders , had declared independence from the rest of Belgium .
Like all the best hoaxes , people were fooled because the scenario was just about credible .
Today , even the over - the - top scenes the TV makers conjured look prescient : a Brussels tram blocked as it tried to enter the new Flanders ; King Albert II deposed .
Although King Albert is unlikely to feel the need to flee – this is n't 18th - century Paris – the monarch seems to hold the fate of a country in his hands .
Instead of the usual duties of a 21st century democratic monarch of rubber - stamping parliamentary laws , the king must decide whether to accept the resignation of Prime Minister Yves Leterme and what to do about the Leterme 's declaration that the 6.5 million Dutch - speaking Flemish people , the 4 million French - speaking Walloons and the smaller German - speaking community have " conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to [ the ] state " .
What real chance does the king have of avoiding a split between the Walloons and the Flemish , given that , after hours of talks with leaders from all of the country 's main political parties , the positions of Flemish and Walloon politicians are as entrenched as ever ?
They are still divided on whether to devolve more power to the regional parliaments and on the voting rights of French - speakers in a Flemish - dominated area on the outskirts of Brussels .
Even if the king turns to a new , more charismatic prime minister as a peace - broker , his prospects look gloomy when you consider Leterme 's five - party coalition government only assembled after a nine - month deadlock following the failure to form a government after the elections of June 2007 .
What amazed me during that crisis was how nonchalant some Belgians seemed to be when I asked how it felt to be on a rudderless ship , or how worried they were about the future of the country .
One French - speaking friend ( who , like most university - educated Belgians , also speaks the other community 's mother tongue ) even told me the country was running fine , thank you , without a government , proving ordinary people could get along without meddling politicians .
This week , I can't help but compare his indifference to the denial of a partner in a troubled marriage .
However , if some Belgians are in denial , others are perhaps too easily seduced by a quick divorce .
Splitting up Belgium , if it happens , will probably involve a bitter settlement – one which will have to separate intermeshed economies , share out the national debt and decide the status of Brussels , which has a French - speaking majority at the heart of the Flemish region .
Such a process would inevitably take the shine off Belgium 's hosting of the European Union institutions .
As former Belgian prime minister Wilfried Martens put it : " We are the centre of the European Union .
How could we give such a bad example to all the member states if we were to split ? "
For other Europeans , more important than Belgium 's loss of legitimacy to be at the heart of Europe may be the dilemma of whether any of its breakaway nations can lay claim to be European Union members .
Catalan and Scottish nationalists are already lobbying in Brussels alongside Flemish separatists , insisting they are rightful existing EU members even if they form new countries .
Some say the matter is one for European constitutional lawyers .
My view is that the question may also be one for European voters .
The idea of an independent Flanders used to be only seriously defended by the region 's far right , racist party Vlaams Belang , which means " Flemish interests " in Dutch .
If the ideas of that party eventually influence the foundation of any new nation state , its laws and institutions , such a country has no place in the EU .

Uh , yeah .
So much for posting the next part in a few days .
I think I 'll stop trying to second guess when I 'll next have time ( but sine I 'm going off to Norway for vacation for a week , it 's a safe bet the next part wo n't show up until later than that ) .
For those who care ( anyone ?
anyone at all ?
did n't think so ) , I 've been very busy lately , both with a big new project at work that 'll see us relaunching the websites for three large restaurant chains in the UK .
The exciting part of it is n't the code - that 's pretty straight forward - but the infrastructure we 're building , which is giving me a great opportunity to set up a very resilient OpenVz based setup with every single component virtualized .
My spare time has all been taken up by other projects which I might say more about some other time ...
Anyone , back to the subject at hand ... Each step so far has included minor bits and pieces to test specific features .
But it 's hard to get an idea for how complete a language is becoming without writing something a little bit more substantial .
In this case I 've chosen to write a " text - mangler " that will " parse " an s-expression like ( Lisp like ) syntax and turn it into a Ruby script that will run the compiler with the equivalent program .
It will not be a proper parser , but merely a very simple case of rewriting pieces of text to turn something like this : into something like this :
Simple enough to do , but it'll test quite a few things .
First of all I 'll separate the compiler from the " driver " - the little snippet of code containing the actual program , and instantiating and running the compiler .
Essentially the entire Compiler class gets moved into a separate file .
Here 's a really stripped down starting point that illustrates how to use it , and how we 'll start producing the " parser " : Notice that the program included here reproduces another program with the same structure .
If run , it 'll output another driver program containing a basic program itself .
Our goal is to expand on this program so that it will read a Lisp like program and output something almost exactly like above .
The program above , in fact , should be exactly what we'd expect to get if " parsing " What exactly will we " parse " ?
We 'll turn
There are lots of copouts here :
This is throwaway code - I 'm not intending to write a Lisp compiler - so I 'm even less inclined than usual to spend time writing something robust .
Consider this a test of the capabilities of the compiler so far , and a way of planning out what to add next .
Nothing more .
First of all :
This is an exercise in bootstrapping .
First we write the " parser " in our current syntax .
Then we 'll manually translate it into the lisp like syntax it translate .
Then we 'll finally use itself to regenerate it 's own Ruby syntax .
This roundtrip will also serve as a test :
This is an IMPORTANT series of steps to keep in mind .
Whenever you bootstrap a compiler for a new language or a part of one in the language it compiles so it can process it's own source , you want to make VERY sure that each step can process the next version of itself correctly , and that you archive every single version , since it 's very easy to get yourself into a situation where you suddenly have a lot of uncompilable broken code when iterating the syntax and semantics of a new language .
First we spit out a driver as described above :
The code above defines a " parse " function for future use .
It then outputs a prolog , calls the parse function , and outputs a tiny epilog , just like the first part of writing the compiler itself .
Next we need to start filling in the parse function :
Hard to read ?
What about if I rewrite it like this : Character 41 ( decimal ) is incidentally right paranthesis .
It 's a shortcut to make it trivial to use this function recursively to parse expressions .
So " c " is obviously the current character .
What about " sep " ?
Sep will be use later to indicate whether or not to output " , " to separate sub -expressions .
So why are they passed as arguments ?
Well , there 's the first reminder for this step :
We lack local variables .
They 'll be added shortly .
Next piece .
Inside the while loop we add this :
In other words :
If we see a ' (' ( ASCII 40 ) , we output ' [ ' , call parse ( ) recursively , output ' ] ' and indicate that a comma separator is needed on the next sub expression .
Then :
If we see a double quote ( ASCII 34 ) , output double - quotes , call a new function " parse_quoted " to deal with it , output double - quotes again , and indicate we need a separator .
And here 's the last chunk of " parse " : If " c " is whitespace ( calling isspace ( ) from the c library ) and " sep " is not 0 , we output the separator , and clear the flag .
Note that this relies on Ruby ignoring trailing " , " in array declarations , so [ 1,2,3 , ] works the same way as [ 1,2,3 ] .
Then , if " c " is alphanumeric ( isalnum ( c ) ) and " sep " is n't set , we 'll indicate we need a separator and specifically if it's not a digit we 'll assume it needs to be turned into a Ruby symbol and output ':' , then we 'll finally output the character .
The reason we check to see that " sep " is n't set is to avoid outputing " : " in front of every letter .
That leaves parse_quotes , which looks like this : or : Put it all together , and this is the result : Completely unreadable and a nightmare to debug .
So lets translate it into our Lisp like syntax and see if it can process itself .
Some regexps and manual massage later : Yikes .
More parenthesis than in actual Lisp .
I would n't call it readable ( particularly the lack of an " else " keyword or similar makes it hard to see where an else block begins , but it 's an improvement .
The real goal was to write a slightly larger test , anyway .
Lets test it by running it on " itself " , then compiling the result , and run that on itself , and check that they match : Nice .
Next time we 'll go back to the compiler and do some refactoring , before adding some functionality ( such as local variables ) that would make the above example quite a bit cleaner .
Once that 's done it 's time for a real parser for a much nicer syntax .
In the meantime the archive of the files for this round can be found here
Ahhh work , that most marvelous of pursuits that keeps food on the table .
Today was my first official day of work as a full time employee of Gigantomegabankcorp North America , where I have been a contractor for 26 months .
Going from Contractor to FTE means bennies , paid time off ( 25 days a year actually .
Woo hoo ) , and job security ( at least to the degree that it exists anywhere today ) .
I am officially classified as an “ authorized homeworker or telecommuter ” , for which I get to work at home ; and the bank gets a tax credit , since I ’m not out there every day clogging up the roads , and burning up the gas .
Nice deal all around eh ?
However , for things such as receiving and filling out and submitting the 400 pages of HR paperwork , you kind of have to be in a physical office location .
… That ’s not a joke or an exaggeration by the way .
Between the general employment paperwork , Homeland Security paperwork , federal tax paperwork , Arizona tax paperwork , medical insurance , dental insurance , optical insurance , life insurance , AD&D , long term care coverage , healthcare savings account , 401k , employee stock purchase plan , employee credit card , employee checking , savings , and money market accounts , direct deposit , security forms , badge forms , non disclosure form , health and safety forms , electronic and information security forms , building safety forms , employee handbook acknowledgment , sexual harassment policy acknowledgment , terms of use acknowledgment , disciplinary procedures acknowledgment , environmental disclosures , and the checklists to keep track of them all ; I had to deal with over 100 form pages requiring filling in , and approximately 300 pages of reference materials .
How is it we make money again ?
Of course to fill all of this in , I had to get to the office at 8:30 , meet an admin assistant so she could let me in to do my badge paperwork ( my old contractor badge is officially no good ; I had to get a visitor badge until they could issue me a new “ team member ” badge ) so I could get my badge , and my two large “ packets ” ( I use the term loosely as together they weigh about 5 lbs and are 3 inches thick ) of reference materials and forms to fill out .
Amazingly enough , this is after a HUGE paperwork REDUCTION , and moving “ most ” of the HR , tax , wage , and benefit forms online .
Soon enough we ’ll be using resources like https://www.filecenterdms.com/info-pdf-splitter.html to manage our paperwork even more efficiently .
Seriously .
Why exactly I had to go to the office to do this , when all I ended up doing was filling it all in while borrowing someone else ’s cubicle , then dropping it into interoffice mail , and faxing copies of my homeland security form …
Oh wait ….
.. Riiiiiight
I have to do it in the office , so they can get a photocopy of my drivers license and social security card , witnessed by another employee for the homeland security form ( Oh and the fax is insufficient , they have to have the hardcopy , but it has to be on file within three days , and it may be delayed so we had to fax it ) .
Remind me again how we make money … and why it is that we have a “ homeland security ” department , checking up on my work status ?
… Riiiiiiight
Ahhh the joys of working for Gigantomegabankcorp North America in America today .
We ARE in America …
Are n’t we ?
When amateurs outperform professionals , there is something wrong with that profession .
Two examples :
1 . If ordinary people , with no medical training , could perform surgery in their kitchens with steak knives , and get results that were better than those of surgeons in hospital operating rooms , the whole medical profession would be discredited .
Yet it is common for ordinary parents , with no training in education , to homeschool their children and consistently produce better academic results than those of children educated by teachers with Master 's degrees and in schools spending upwards of $ 10,000 a year per student -- which is to say , more than a million dollars to educate ten kids from K through 12 .
Nevertheless , we continue to take seriously the pretensions of educators who fail to educate , but who put on airs of having " professional " expertise beyond the understanding of mere parents .
2. Central planners in the days of the Soviet Union had to set over 24 million prices .
Nobody is capable of setting and changing 24 million prices in a way that will direct resources and output in an efficient manner .
For that , each of the 24 million prices would have to be weighed and set against each of the other 24 million prices .
in order to provide incentives for resources to go where they were most in demand by producers and output to go where it was most in demand by consumers .
In a market economy , however , nobody has to take on such an impossible task .
Each producer and each consumer need only be concerned with the relatively few prices relevant to their own decisions , with coordination of the economy being left to supply and demand .
In short , amateurs were able to outperform professionals in the economy because the amateurs did not take on tasks beyond the capability of any human being or any manageable group of human beings .

House Republicans fire off letter to New York Times
In a move echoing past flaps over the perceived liberal bias among mainstream media outlets , House Republicans distributed a letter on Wednesday formally " urging "
The New York Times to allow a third party to take out a full - page ad featuring a rejected opinion piece by their party 's presidential candidate , Arizona Sen .
John McCain .
Calling the decision not to run McCain 's op - ed " unfortunate " and " alarming , " Republicans in the House asked the paper " to permit a third partythe purchase of ad space " in the Times " as a second - best means of responding " to an op - ed by Sen.
Barack Obama the Times published recently .
The GOP has taken issue with national media coverage - particularly in the Times - many times in the past .
Last year , Republicans seized on MoveOn 's full - page Petraeus / " Betray Us " ad as a sign of the paper 's liberal sympathies .
" A national publication such as the Times has a clear obligation to provide equal access to its op - ed page to both candidates , " the Republicans wrote , " to convey fairness by the paper and to help further the national debate . "
" In his op - ed , Senator Obama addresses the differences between his position and Senator McCain 's position on Iraq , and responds to the criticisms leveled by the McCain campaign , " the letter continues .
" The Times readership , and indeed the public , deserves an equal chance to read Senator McCain 's response on the same editorial page . "
GOP lawmakers also complain that an e-mail sent to the McCain campaign explaining the decision presents a clear editorial bias " by presuming to tell Senator McCain how and what to write in his submission in order to win the favor of the Times ' Op - Ed editors . "
The Republicans play on a perception that members of the national media clearly favor Obama over their own candidate , citing a Rasmussen poll that shows 49 percent of the respondents believe members of the media " will actively attempt to assist Senator Obama 's campaign " - a narrative that has taken root on cable news and the late - night comedy circuit as well .
As of Wednesday afternoon , 96 House Republicans had signed the letter .
The text of the letter is after the jump ; we 'll post a response from The Times when we get one .
July 23 , 2008
Mr. David Shipley
Op - Ed Page Editor
The New York Times
620 Eighth Avenue
New York , NY 10018
Dear Mr. Shipley :
We write to you out of great concern regarding the New York Times Op - Ed page 's recent decision to reject an op - ed submitted by Senator John McCain , the Republican candidate for President .
Senator McCain 's op - ed was in response to one published by the Times on July 14th by the presumptive Democrat nominee , Senator Barack Obama , regarding his plan for Iraq .
This unfortunate and alarming decision occurs at a time when the candidates , and the nation they are campaigning to serve , are engaged in a critical debate regarding the future of Iraq , and particularly whether there should be a timetable for withdrawal or a measured troop presence for the foreseeable future to maintain stability in the country and the region .
A timely opinion piece by a presidential candidate is an important piece of information that Americans can use to measure the candidates and their respective positions .
Moreover , a national publication such as the Times has a clear obligation to provide equal access to its Op - Ed page to both candidates , regardless of whether the Times '
Op - Ed editors personally disagree with the content of their submissions , to convey fairness by the paper and to help further the national debate .
In his op - ed , Senator Obama addresses the differences between his position and Senator McCain 's position on Iraq , and responds to the criticisms leveled by the McCain campaign .
The Times readership , and indeed the public , deserves an equal chance to read Senator McCain 's response on the same editorial page .
Instead of providing that opportunity to your readership in the Op - Ed page , your email response to the McCain campaign rejecting the Senator 's opinion submission stated :
" It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama 's piece …
It would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory – with troops levels , timetables and measures for compelling the Iraqis to cooperate .
And it would need to describe the Senator 's Afghanistan strategy , spelling out how it meshes with his Iraq plan . "
While it is commonplace for newspaper editorial pages to limit the topic and length of submitted material , your email crosses the line by presuming to tell Senator McCain how and what to write in his submission in order to win the favor of the Times Op - Ed editors .
The perceived lack of fairness and equal access shown by the Times Op - Ed page in this incident is particularly unfortunate , as it comes at a time when polls show that a sizeable percentage of Americans identify a clear Democrat bias in the national media .
A recent Rasmussen Reports poll shows that 49 % of respondents believe the media will actively attempt to assist Senator Obama 's campaign , compared to just 14 % who say the media will try to help Senator McCain .
With this in mind , one would think conveying impartiality would be particularly important in this specific instance for an op - ed page currently edited by a former speechwriter for former President Bill Clinton .
If , despite this alarming indictment of the media 's integrity by the American public , you refuse to provide Senator McCain the opportunity to explain his views as he wrote it , as opposed to how you want it , we would strongly urge you to permit a third party the purchase of ad space in your newspaper as a second - best means of responding to Senator Obama 's essay , so that Senator McCain 's views can be read unfiltered , perhaps at the same reduced rated enjoyed by the liberal 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) group MoveOn.org when it ran its disgraceful ad regarding General David Petraeus last September .
Given the critical importance of the nation 's Iraq policy in the context of the upcoming Presidential election , Senator McCain – and the American people – deserve nothing less .

Rates of dementia are predicted to soar Scientists have found further evidence that taking commonly used cholesterol - lowering statins may protect against dementia and memory loss .
The study , published in Neurology , found that statins - normally taken to reduce heart disease risk - may cut the risk of dementia by half .
The five - year project examined 1,674 Mexican Americans aged 60 and over at heightened risk of dementia .
The Alzheimer 's Research Trust said the research is " encouraging " .
A quarter of the patients took a statin , and in total 130 went on to develop dementia .
The jury is still out on how effective they are , but this study adds to growing evidence that they may have some benefits
Dr Clive Ballard
Alzheimer 's Society
Once the researchers had taken account of other risk factors , including education , smoking , and diabetes , they calculated that those who took statins had an approximately 50 % lower risk of developing dementia .
The study comes hot on the heels of separate research which suggests that drugs to reduce blood pressure can also cut the risk of dementia .
It is estimated that 4 million people in England and Wales alone currently take statins .
Lead researcher Professor Mary Haan , of the University of Michigan , said : " The bottom line is that if a person takes statins over a course of about five to seven years , it reduces the risk of dementia by half , and that 's a really big change . "
Statins help to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering levels of cholesterol which clog up the blood vessels .
It is thought that a poor supply of blood to the brain may be one factor which promotes the development of dementia .
Therefore , if statins help keep the blood vessels healthy , and blood flowing freely to the brain , they may help protect against the disease .
However , it is still not clear exactly how statins work on the biochemical pathways involved in dementia .
Professor Haan said one possibility is that statins may help to reduce levels of the hormone insulin , which have also been implicated in the development of dementia .
' Encouraging ' results Rebecca Wood , of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , described the research as " encouraging " .
However , she said : " People should not take statins unless medically advised to do as , as side - effects can be unpleasant .
" We need much more research into this possible prevention for dementia . "
Dr Clive Ballard , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said statins were increasingly being touted as a potential cure for dementia .
He said : " The jury is still out on how effective they are , but this study adds to growing evidence that they may have some benefits .
" All drugs have some side - effects so it is important to seek professional advice about medication . "
It is estimated that 700,000 people in the UK live with Alzheimers ' .
The number is expected to double within a generation as the average age of the population rises .

What are these ?
After every test case , the media assume the worst is over : that Britain 's libel laws , designed to protect the powerful from public scrutiny , have been fanged , and freedom of speech will no longer be treated like a crime .
And then it gets worse .
On the website of Craig Murray , the former British ambassador to Uzbekistan , you can read a letter his publishers have received from the law firm Schillings .
It contains something I have never seen before : a threatened injunction against a book they have n't read and that wo n't be published until September .
Acting on behalf of the " private security contractor " Tim Spicer , Schillings gave the publishers three days ( the deadline was last Friday ) to guarantee that the book does not defame its client , or face " an injunction to restrain publication " .
No publisher can afford to ignore a letter like this .
Though libel is a civil rather than a criminal matter in this country , the consequences can be much graver than most criminal convictions .
I would rather go to prison for a few weeks for committing a crime than spend five years fighting a libel case , then lose my house and my savings .
It is better to be caught mugging than to be caught speaking freely .
If someone launches a sustained and malicious campaign of false charges against another person , and that person is given no opportunity to demonstrate that he is being wronged , he should be allowed to seek redress .
But the libel laws of England and Wales are tilted so heavily against the defendant and involve such monumental costs that they amount , in effect , to censorship by private interests : a sedition law for the exclusive use of millionaires .
While in the United States the plaintiff must prove that the claims against him are false , in English law the defendants ' claims are presumed false until proven otherwise : he has to demonstrate his innocence .
If his defence fails , he must pay both costs and damages .
The plaintiff 's lawyers make little attempt to limit their costs : the partners at one well - known firm charge £ 750 an hour .
The bill can rise to millions .
Perhaps you do n't live in England or Wales , so you think this has nothing to do with you .
You 're wrong .
English libel law now applies to everyone on Earth .
Make any accusation , anywhere in the world , and if the subject can demonstrate that a single person in England or Wales has read it , you could be sued here for every penny , cent , rouble , rupee or renminbi you possess .
The internet and the global nature of publishing ensure that these medieval laws have become the most powerful extra-territorial legislation ever drafted .
Yesterday two men with whom I seldom agree , the US senators Arlen Specter and Joe Lieberman , launched a new bill , called the Free Speech Protection Act , to defend US citizens against English libel law .
Our laws , they argue , threaten the " free - flowing marketplace of ideas " which " enables the ideals of democracy to defeat the totalitarian vision of al - Qaida and other terrorist organisations " .
English libel law is an international menace , a national disgrace , a pre-democratic anachronism .
It defends crooks , terrorists and tyrants from investigation .
It threatens the free speech of people all over the world and causes untold damage to the reputation of this country .
And neither the British government nor the British parliament gives a damn .
Every few years the newspapers fill with optimistic headlines about the death of these repressive laws .
In 1999 , they were deemed to have been neutralised by the case of Reynolds v Times Newspapers , when the law lords established that a journalist could use the defence of public interest if he had acted responsibly , even if he could not prove his allegations .
But the criteria for responsible journalism were so narrowly defined that this defence has seldom succeeded .
In 2006 the laws were deemed to have died again when the Wall Street Journal succeeded in using the Reynolds defence in the House of Lords , overturning a case brought by the Saudi Arabian businessman Mohammed Jameel .
Last year they died once more when the court of appeal found that the investigative journalist Graeme McLagan had acted responsibly when he claimed that a former police officer had taken a bribe from a criminal .
But today Britain 's libel lawyers are more active than ever before .
They have developed a lucrative new line in shutting down websites .
This is the second time , for example , that Craig Murray has come to the attention of Schillings .
Last year it closed his site and several others by threatening the companies which host them - internet service providers ( ISPs ) - with libel suits on behalf of Alisher Usmanov , the Uzbek - Russian billionaire with a major share in Arsenal football club .
ISPs are especially vulnerable to the libel laws .
Most of them have no stake in the contents of the sites they host and have no means of deciding whether the material they contain or the complaints it generates are true , but they carry as much liability as the people who write defamatory blogs .
They can be sued even over the throwaway remarks of anonymous posters on comment threads - this is one of the reasons why the Comment is Free threads have to be moderated by the Guardian .
Some lawyers do n't bother to write to the authors of contentious web pages , but deal only with the ISPs , knowing that they are likely to surrender at the first whiff of gunpowder .
Some of the successful cases appear to me to be remarkably petty .
Last year the directors of the Sheffield Wednesday football club sued the fan site Owlstalk to force it to reveal the identity of 11 anonymous contributors to its forums , who had made derogatory comments about them .
The controversial childcare guru Gina Ford obliged the site Mumsnet to apologise and pay her legal costs , after bloggers had alleged , among other accusations , that she had been " strapping babies to rockets and firing them into south Lebanon " .
Who but Ms Ford could have taken this seriously ?
The blogger Richard Brunton tells a shocking story of the threats he received from a leisure company ( which he is now too frightened even to name ) after contributors to his site had made adverse comments about some of its products .
Such threats could bring an end to critical online reviews .
The internet butterfly is repeatedly broken upon the wheel of England 's medieval laws .
In 2002 , the Law Commission , a statutory body , recommended that the libel laws be reformed to protect ISPs .
Since then the government has done nothing .
British ministers love these censors ' laws .
Even the newspapers scarcely seem prepared to fight .
Rather than campaign for new legislation , they simply wait for the higher courts to act , then claim victory when no such thing has been achieved .
It is not as if most of the media are falling over themselves to expose the misdeeds of the rich and powerful anyway : the law gives editors the excuse they need to leave billionaires alone .
As for our parliamentarians , I would like to have ended this column by naming some of these self - interested chickens , who thunder about free speech while allowing the rich to stamp on their critics .
But I would n't dare : they might sue me .

The United States has experienced several years of robust economic growth , and Americans again have confidence in their economic future .
A reduction in the corporate tax rate from the second highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners ; the low rate on capital gains ; allowing business to deduct in a single year investments in equipment and technology , while eliminating tax loopholes and ending corporate welfare , have spurred innovation and productivity , and encouraged companies to keep their operations and jobs in the United States .
The Alternate Minimum
Tax is being phased out , with relief provided first to middle income families .
Doubling the size of the child exemption has put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers , further stimulating growth .
Congress has just passed by a single up or down vote a tax reform proposal that offers Americans a choice of continuing to file under the rules of the current complicated and burdensome tax code or use a new , simpler , fairer and flatter tax , with two rates and a generous deduction .
Millions of taxpayers are expected to file under the flat tax , and save billions in the cost of preparing their returns .
After exercising my veto several times in my first year in office , Congress has not sent me an appropriations bill containing earmarks for the last three years .
A top to bottom review of every federal bureaucracy has yielded great reductions in government spending by identifying programs that serve no important purpose ; and instigating far reaching reforms of procurement and operating policies that have for too long extravagantly wasted money for no better purpose than to increase federal payrolls .
New free trade agreements have been ratified and led to substantial increases in both exports and imports .
The resulting growth in prosperity in countries from South America to Asia to Africa has greatly strengthened America 's security and the global progress of our political ideals .
U.S. tariffs on agricultural imports have been eliminated and unneeded farm subsidies are being phased out .
The world food crisis has ended , inflation is low , and the quality of life not only in our country , but in some of the most impoverished countries around the world is much improved .
Americans , who through no fault of their own , lost jobs in the global economy they once believed were theirs for life , are assisted by reformed unemployment insurance and worker retraining programs .
Older workers who accept lower paying jobs while they acquire new skills are provided assistance to make up a good part of the income they have lost .
Community colleges and technical schools all over the country have developed worker retraining programs suited to the specific economic opportunities available in their communities and are helping millions of workers who have lost a job that wo n't come back find a new one that wo n't go away .
Public education in the United States is much improved thanks to the competition provided by charter and private schools ; the increase of quality teachers through incentives like merit pay and terrific programs that attract to the classroom enthusiastic and innovative teachers from many disciplines , like Teach for America and Troops to Teachers .
Educational software and online teaching programs endorsed by qualified non profits are much more widely in use , bringing to the smallest classrooms in America some of the greatest math , English , and science teachers in the country .
This revolution in teaching methods has especially benefited rural America .
Test scores and graduation rates are rising everywhere in the country .
Health care has become more accessible to more Americans than at any other time in history .
Reforms of the insurance market ; putting the choice of health care into the hands of American families rather than exclusively with the government or employers ; walk in clinics as alternatives to emergency room care ; paying for outcome in the treatment of disease rather than individual procedures ; and competition in the prescription drug market have begun to wring out the runaway inflation once endemic in our health care system .
More small businesses offer their employees health plans .
Schools have greatly improved their emphasis on physical education and nutritional content of meals offered in school cafeterias .
Obesity rates among the young and the disease they engender are stabilized and beginning to decline .
The federal government and states have cooperated in establishing backstop insurance pools that provide coverage to people hard pressed to find insurance elsewhere because of pre-existing illness .
Like the rest of nature that evolves remarkably to stresses in the environment , people will be able to adapt to high gas prices .
Really .
In many parts of Europe , people are paying upwards of $ 7 – $ 8 / gallon of gas .
Things will change here in the USA .
These changes will sometimes more difficult for some than others .
More of us are already using public transportation , riding bikes — even moving closer to where we work or pressuring employers to offer flextime ( to avoid rush hours ) or telecommuting from home .
In part thanks to the mushrooming energy costs , how much of business was done in the period of relatively inexpensive oil and other fossil fuels will morph into a new model of business model where energy costs are front and center .
Another trend : the explosion of people starting their own green business as an ecopreneur , operating their business without destroying the planet or exploiting people .
Energy conservation and efficiency are often the very DNA of these enterprises .
Eventually , the politicians in Washington DC might realize that opening up ANWR merely delays the reality that we need to cut our addiction to oil , for climate ’s sake .
We need to get back to 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide to maintain some degree of climate stability .
Burning more oil , coal or natural gas is not the way .
There are many financial benefits of becoming a business , depending on how you structure it .
Not only are businesses taxed after their expenses have been deducted , but many legitimate deductions are available to a small business that reduce its reported earnings — like the use of your personal car for business - related and documented use .
Owners of vehicles that are used for business purposes can deduct those miles associated with business use and be reimbursed for mileage by the business .
For example , when we drive to speak at a Green Festival , MREA Renewable Energy and Sustainable Living Fair , or to visit a client , we reimburse ourselves at the IRS specified rate .
Make sure to maintain a vehicle travel mileage log for each vehicle used for business purposes .
Making Money from your FUEL EFFICIENT Vehicle
One of our discoveries we write about in ECOpreneuring is the tax benefit of using our fuel - efficient vehicle for business purposes .
Every year , the IRS sets the reimbursable rate for the business use of your vehicle , based on national fleet repair and maintenance averages and fuel costs , both of which are rising .
We get the same rate whether we drive a super - fuel - efficient Toyota Prius or Volkswagen Jetta TDI ( diesel ) versus a low - mileage Hummer .
It turns out we ’ve managed to make money off each business mile we put on our Volkswagen Jetta TDI because the cost of operating and fueling it is less than for other new and less fuel - efficient vehicles .
How ?
First , we only buy used vehicles because as soon as most new vehicles are driven off the dealer ’s lot , they lose about 25 percent of their value .
Second , by the time we might sell our used vehicle with years of reimbursed business miles paid to us as owners , the cost of the vehicle would have broken even .
For example , one year we might have 7,193 business related miles put on our VW Jetta , multiplied by the IRS designated rate ( 2007 ) of $ .445 / mile , resulting in the business reimbursing us for the business use of the car to the tune of $ 3,200 .
Keep in mind that this expense item reduces the reported earnings of the business by $ 3,200 as well .
So if you have to drive , why not create a green business where you can at least deduct your miles related to business use of your vehicle ?
By the way , when we can , we put B100 ( 100 percent biodiesel ) or B10 ( locally secured from a Smart Station ) in our Jetta .
Our other vehicle exclusively used for business is an all - electric CitiCar .
We also work from our home office , completely powered by the wind and sun .

What ’s the paradox ?
Timothy Williamson ( 2000 b ) says the knowability paradox is not a paradox ; it ’s an “ embarrassment ” ––an embarrassment to various brands of antirealism that have long overlooked a simple counterexample .
He notes it ’s “ an affront ” to various philosophical theories , but not to common sense .
Others disagree .
The paradox is n’t that the Fitch proof swiftly threatens the middle way .
It ’s that the Fitch proof , employing minimal epistemic modal resources , collapses the middle way into the naive way .
The paradox , as articulated in Kvanvig ( 2006 ) and Brogaard and Salerno ( 2008 ) , is that moderate antirealism appears not to be expressible as a distinct thesis , logically weaker than naive idealism .
That is interesting and troublesome independently of one ’s attitude for or against moderate antirealism .
The great problem for the middle way is Fitch ’s paradox .
It is the proof that shows ( in a normal modal logic augmented with the knowledge operator ) that “ all truths are knowable ” entails “ all truths are known ” :
which says , formally , for all propositions \ ( p\ ) , if \( p\ ) then it is possible to know that \ ( p\ ) .
The operative concept of “ knowability ” remains elusive but is meant to fall somewhere between equating truth uninformatively with what God would know and equating truth naively with what humans actually know .
Equating truth with what God would know does not improve intelligibility , and equating it with what humans actually know fails to appreciate the objectivity and discoverability of truth .
The middle way , what we might call moderate antirealism , can be characterized logically somewhere in the ballpark of the knowability principle :
Fitch ’s paradox of knowability ( aka the knowability paradox or Church - Fitch Paradox ) concerns any theory committed to the thesis that all truths are knowable .
Historical examples of such theories arguably include Michael Dummett ’s semantic antirealism ( i.e. , the view that any truth is verifiable ) , mathematical constructivism ( i.e. , the view that the truth of a mathematical formula depends on the mental constructions mathematicians use to prove those formulas ) , Hilary Putnam ’s internal realism ( i.e. , the view that truth is what we would believe in ideal epistemic circumstances ) , Charles Sanders Peirce ’s pragmatic theory of truth ( i.e. , that truth is what we would agree to at the limit of inquiry ) , logical positivism ( i.e. , the view that meaning is giving by verification conditions ) , Kant ’s transcendental idealism ( i.e. , that all knowledge is knowledge of appearances ) , and George Berkeley ’s idealism ( i.e. , that to be is to be perceivable ) .
The literature on the knowability paradox emerges in response to a proof first published by Frederic Fitch in his 1963 paper , “ A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts . ”
Theorem 5 , as it was there called , threatens to collapse a number of modal and epistemic differences .
Let ignorance be the failure to know some truth .
Then Theorem 5 collapses a commitment to contingent ignorance into a commitment to necessary ignorance .
For it shows that the existence of truths in fact unknown entails the existence of truths necessarily unknown .
Formally ,
\ [\tag {Theorem 5} \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \vdash \exists p( p \wedge
eg \ Diamond Kp ) . \]
The converse of Theorem 5 is trivial ( since truth entails possibility ) , so Fitch goes most of the way toward erasing any logical difference between the existence of contingent ignorance and the existence of necessary unknowability .
It is however the contrapositive of Theorem 5 that is usually referred to as the paradox :
\ [ \tag{K Paradox} \ forall p( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp ) \vdash \ forall p( p \rightarrow Kp ) . \]
It tells us that if any truth can be known then it follows that every truth is in fact known .
The earliest version of the proof was conveyed to Fitch by an anonymous referee in 1945 .
In 2005 we discovered that Alonzo Church was that referee ( Salerno 2009 b ) .
His reports are published in their entirety in Church ( 2009 ) .
Fitch apparently did not take the result to be paradoxical .
He published the proof in 1963 to avert a kind of “ conditional fallacy ” that threatened his informed - desire analysis of value .
The analysis roughly says : \ ( x\ ) is valuable to \( s\ ) just in case there is a truth \ ( p\ ) such that were \( s\ ) to known \ ( p\ ) then she would desire \ ( x\ ) .
The existence of unknowable truths ultimately explains why he restricts the propositional variables to knowable propositions .
For an unknowable truth provides for an impossible antecedent in Fitch ’s counterfactual , and ultimately trivializes the analysis .
Since
Fitch ’s theory of value is not the context in which the paradox is widely discussed , we will say no more about it here .
Rediscovered in Hart and McGinn ( 1976 ) and Hart ( 1979 ) , the result was taken to be a refutation of verificationism , the view that all meaningful statements ( and so all truths ) are verifiable .
After all , if one accepts the knowability principle , \( \forall p( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp ) \ ) , she is committed to the absurd claim that all truths are known .
Mackie ( 1980 ) and Routley ( 1981 ) , among others at the time , point to difficulties with this general position but ultimately agree that Fitch ’s result is a refutation of the claim that all truths are knowable , and that various forms of verificationism are imperiled for related reasons .
Since the early eighties , however , there has been considerable effort to analyze the proof as paradoxical .
Why after all should it be that an epistemic theory of truth collapses possible knowledge into actual knowledge ?
Intuitively , that truth is to be understood in terms of the epistemic capacities of non-omniscient agents is at least a coherent position — a position distinct from and more plausible than the thesis that all truths are known .
Moreover , it has been thought strange that sophisticated versions of the epistemic theory of truth should fall prey to such swift deduction .
Hence , the Church - Fitch proof has come to be known as the paradox of knowability .
There is no consensus about whether and where the proof goes wrong .
We use this entry to lay out the proof and explore a range of proposed treatments .
Fitch ’s reasoning involves quantifying into sentence position .
Our propositional variables \ ( p\ ) and \ ( q\ ) will take declarative statements as substituends .
Let \( K\ ) be the epistemic operator ‘ it is known by someone at some time that . ’
Let \( \Diamond\ ) be the modal operator ‘ it is possible that ’.
Suppose the knowability principle ( KP ) — that all truths are knowable by somebody at some time :
\ [\tag {KP} \ forall p( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp ) . \]
And suppose that collectively we are non-omniscient , that there is an unknown truth :
\ [\tag {NonO} \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) . \]
If this existential claim is true , then so is an instance of it :
\ [ \tag{1} p \wedge
eg Kp. \ ]
Now consider the instance of KP substituting line 1 for the variable \ ( p\ ) in KP :
\ [ \tag{2} ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow \ Diamond K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \]
It follows trivially that it is possible to know the conjunction expressed at line 1 :
\ [ \tag{3} \ Diamond K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \]
However , it can be shown independently that it is impossible to know this conjunction .
Line 3 is false .
The independent result presupposes two very modest epistemic principles : first , knowing a conjunction entails knowing each of the conjuncts .
Second , knowledge entails truth .
Respectively ,
\ [ \begin{align} \tag {A} K( p \ wedge q ) &\vdash Kp \wedge Kq \\ \tag {B} Kp &\vdash p \end{align}\ ]
Also presupposed are two modest modal principles : first , all theorems are necessary .
Second , necessarily \(
eg p\ ) entails that \ ( p\ ) is impossible .
Respectively ,
\ [ \begin{align} \tag {C} &\text {If } \vdash p , \text {then } \vdash \ Box p. \\ \tag {D} &\Box
eg p \vdash
eg \ Diamond p. \end{align}\ ]
Consider the independent result :
\ [ \begin{align} \tag{4} K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) &\quad\text {Assumption [ for reductio ] } \\ \tag {5} Kp \wedge K
eg Kp &\quad\text {from 4 , by ( A ) } \\ \tag {6} Kp \wedge
eg Kp &\quad\text {from 5 , applying ( B ) to the right conjunct} \\ \tag{7}
eg K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) &\quad\text {from 4 - 6 , by reductio , } \\ &\quad \quad \text {discharging assumption 4} \\ \tag{8} \Box
eg K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) &\quad\text {from 7 , by ( C ) } \\ \tag{9}
eg \ Diamond K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) &\quad\text {from 8 , by ( D ) } \end{align} \ ]
Line 9 contradicts line 3 .
So a contradiction follows from KP and NonO .
The advocate of the view that all truths are knowable must deny that we are non-omniscient :
\ [\tag{10}
eg \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) . \]
And it follows from that that all truths are actually known :
\ [ \tag {11} \ forall p( p \rightarrow Kp ) . \]
The ally of the view that all truths are knowable ( by somebody at some time ) is forced absurdly to admit that every truth is known ( by somebody at some time ) .
In this section we inspect the prospects for treating Fitch ’s reasoning as invalid .
Is Fitch ’s epistemic reasoning in order ?
Is the logic of knowability classical logic ?
More to the point : does the knowability principle carry with it special considerations that warrant the revision of classical logic ?
If so , does this logical revision invalidate Fitch ’s reasoning ?
And if the reasoning is invalid , are there closely related paradoxes that threaten the knowability principle without violating the relevant logical standards ?
The problem with Fitch ’s reasoning is not with either of the epistemic inferences A or B .
Though some have argued that knowing a conjunction does not entail knowing the conjuncts ( Nozick 1981 ) , Williamson ( 1993 ) and Jago ( 2010 ) have shown that versions of the paradox do not require this distributive assumption .
And questions about the factivity of \ ( K\ ) may be defused rather quickly , since related paradoxes emerge replacing the factive operator “ It is known that ” with a non-factive operators , such as ‘ It is rationally believed that ’
( Mackie 1980 : 92 ; Edgington 1985 : 558–559 ; Tennant 1997 : 252–259 ; Wright 2000 : 357 ) .
Deep and interesting discussions of the epistemic operators and / or temporal analogs in the context of Fitch ’s paradox appear in many papers .
Burgess ( 2009 ) considers the temporal analogs .
van Benthem ( 2004 ; 2009 ) , van Ditmarsh , et al. ( 2012 ) , Berto et al. ( forthcoming ) and Holliday ( 2018 ) explore the problem in dynamic epistemic frameworks .
Palczewski ( 2007 ) , Kelp and Pritchard ( 2009 ) , Chase et al. ( 2018 ) , and Heylen ( forthcoming ) consider non-factive notions of knowledge and knowability .
Linsky ( 2009 ) , Paseau ( 2008 ) , Jago ( 2010 ) , Carrara et al. ( 2011 ) , and Rosenblatt ( 2014 ) debate the prospects for typing knowledge .
Williamson ( 1982 ) argues that Fitch ’s proof is not a refutation of anti-realism , but rather a reason for the anti-realist to accept intuitionistic logic .
Owing to a verificationist ( or constructivist ) reading of negation and existential quantification , intuitionistic logic validates neither the elimination of double negation ,
\[
eg
eg p \vdash p , \]
nor the following quantifier exchange rule :
\[
eg \ forall x \P[ x ] \vdash \exists x
eg \ P[x ] . \]
Without double negation elimination one cannot derive Fitch ’s conclusion ‘ all truths are known ’ ( at line 11 ) from ‘ there is not a truth that is unknown ’ ( line 10 ) .
Consider line 10 ,
\[
eg \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) . \]
From this we may intuitionistically derive
\ [ \forall p
eg ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) . \]
But notice without double negation elimination ,
\[
eg ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \]
does not entail
\ [ p \rightarrow Kp. \]
Suppose
\[
eg ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \]
and suppose \ ( p\ ) for conditional introduction .
And suppose \(
eg Kp\ ) for reductio .
We may conjoin \ ( p\ ) with \(
eg Kp\ ) to get
\ [ p \wedge
eg Kp \]
This contradicts our primary assumption .
So , by reductio , \(
eg
eg Kp\ ) .
Without double negation elimination , we cannot conclude \ ( Kp\ ) , and so , may not introduce the conditional
\ [ p \rightarrow Kp \ ]
The intuitionist is however committed , by conditional introduction , to
\ [ p \rightarrow
eg
eg Kp. \ ]
There is some debate about whether this consequence is sufficiently troublesome , but the intuitionistic anti-realist takes solace in the fact that she is not committed to the blatantly absurd claim that all truths are known .
Very interesting discussion concerning the hopes and dreams of intuitionistic antrealism in this context appears in Murzi ( 2010 ; 2012 ) , Murzi et al. ( 2009 ) and Zardini( 2015 ) .
Since Fitch ’s reasoning is intuitionistically valid through line 10 , the intuitionist anti-realist must accept that no truths are unknown : \(
eg \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) .
Arguably this is harmful enough , for it appears that the anti-realist cannot give credence to the truism that ( individually and collectively ) we are non-omniscient .
Williamson responds that the intuitionist anti-realist may naturally express our non-omniscience as “ not all truths are known ” :
\ [\tag {12}
eg \forall p( p \rightarrow Kp ) \]
This claim is classically , but not intuitionistically , equivalent to the non-omniscience thesis ,
\ [ \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) . \]
That is because in intuitionistic logic the quantifier exchange rule , \(
eg \ forall x \P[ x ] \vdash \exists x
eg \ P[x ] , \ ) is not unrestrictedly valid .
Importantly the expression of non-omniscience at line \( 12 ,
eg \ forall p( p \rightarrow Kp ) \ ) , is only classically , and not intuitionistically , inconsistent with line \( 10 ,
eg \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) .
So the intuitionist anti-realist can consistently give expression to the truism that we are non-omniscient ( with line 12 ) while accepting the intuitionistic consequence derived at line 10 .
In effect , the anti-realist admits both that no truths are unknown and that not all truths are known .
The satisfiability of this claim on intuitionistic grounds is demonstrated by Williamson ( 1988 , 1992 ) .
A deeper problem is said to remain for the intuitionist anti-realist .
Fitch ’s paradox rests on the assumption that there are unknown truths .
But consider the intuitionistically weaker assumption that there are undecided statements , that is , some \( p\ ) , such that \( p\ ) is unknown and \(
eg p\ ) is unknown .
Formally ,
\ [\tag {Und} \exists p(
eg Kp \wedge
eg K
eg p ) \]
If ( Und ) is true , then so is an instance of it :
\ [\tag{i}
eg Kp \wedge
eg K
eg p. \]
And notice that the intuitionistically acceptable conclusion at line \( 10 ,
eg \exists p( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) , is intuitionistically equivalent to the universal claim ,
\ [ \tag{ii} \ forall p(
eg Kp \rightarrow
eg p ) . \]
Deriving \(
eg Kp \rightarrow
eg p\ ) and \(
eg K
eg p \rightarrow
eg
eg p\ ) from ( ii ) , and applying the conjuncts of ( i ) , respectively , gives us the contradiction \(
eg p \wedge
eg
eg p\ ) .
The intuitionist anti-realist is forced to admit absurdly that there are no undecided statements :
\[\tag{iii}
eg \exists p (
eg Kp \wedge
eg K
eg p ) \]
The above argument is given by Percival ( 1990 : 185 ) .
Since it is intutionistically acceptable , it is meant to show that the intuitionist anti-realist is still in trouble .
In reply , the anti-realist again may utilize Williamson ’s strategy jointly to revise logic and reconstruct an expression of the epistemic truism .
Embrace only the intuitionistic consequences of KP ( in this case , that there are no undecided statements ) , and give expression to the truism about undecidedness by claiming that not all statements are decided :
\ [ \tag{iv}
eg \forall p( Kp \vee K
eg p ) . \]
The reinterpretation of the undecidedness intuition at line ( iv ) gives us a claim that is classically , but not intuitionistically , equivalent to Und .
And so , it is only classically , and not intuitionistically , inconsistent with the inference at line ( iii ) .
Related undecidedness paradoxes of knowability are discussed in Wright ( 1987 : 311 ) , Williamson ( 1988 : 426 ) and Brogaard and Salerno ( 2002 : 146–148 ) .
The undecidedness paradoxes give the anti-realist even further reason to revise classical logic in favor of intuitionistic logic .
When accompanied by a reconstrual of our epistemically modest intuitions , logical space for anti-realism is reclaimed .
What all this suggests is that intuitionist anti-realism is coherent .
But is the approach well motivated ?
Is either the revision of classical logic or the clever reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions ad hoc ?
The anti-realist ’s purported right to give up classical logic in favor of intuitionistic logic has been defended independently .
The argument finds its roots in Dummett ( 1976 , and elsewhere ) .
More recent interpretations of the anti-realist ’s argument for logical revision appear in Wright ( 1992 : Chp. 2 ) , Tennant ( 1997 : Chp. 7 ) , and Salerno ( 2000 ) .
The details and success or failure of the arguments for logical revision is a topic for another time .
For now it is enough to point out that the threat of Fitch ’s paradox is not the anti-realist ’s sole motivation for favoring a non-classical logic .
What about the reconstrual of our epistemic intuitions ?
Is it well motivated ?
According to Kvanvig ( 1995 ) it is not .
Why should we grant that the intuitionistic treatments of non-omniscience and undecidedness are better than our initial common - sense treatments ?
And how is the anti-realist to explain away the apparent triviality of these common - sense treatments ?
These questions have not been answered .
Moreover , some of the intuitionistic consequences of KP are thought to be bad enough .
Even if ‘ there are no unknown truths ’ or ‘ there are no undecided statements ’ are intuitionistically tolerable , the following appears not to be : If \( p\ ) is unknown then \(
eg p\ ) .
Formally , \(
eg Kp \rightarrow
eg p\ ) .
This claim follows intuitionistically from \( p \rightarrow
eg
eg Kp\ ) , which we have already established as an intuitionistic consequence of KP .
But \(
eg Kp \rightarrow
eg p\ ) appears to be false for empirical discourse .
Why should the fact that nobody ever knows \ ( p\ ) be sufficient for the falsity of \ ( p\ ) ?
See Percival ( 1990 ) and Williamson ( 1988 ) for further discussions of this and related problems surrounding the application of intuitionist anti-realism to empirical discourse .
DeVidi and Solomon ( 2001 ) disagree .
They argue that the intuitionistic consequences are not unacceptable to one interested in an epistemic theory of truth — indeed they are central to an epistemic theory of truth .
For these reasons an appeal to intuitionist logic , by itself , is generally taken to be unsatisfying in dealing with the paradoxes of knowability .
Exceptions include Burmüdez ( 2009 ) , Dummett ( 2009 ) , Rasmussen ( 2009 ) and Maffezioli , Naibo & Negri ( 2013 ) .
Another challenge to the logic of Fitch ’s paradox is mentioned in Routley ( 1981 ) and defended by Beall ( 2000 ) .
The thought is that the correct logic of knowability is paraconsistent .
In a paraconsistent logic contradictions do not trivialize a theory , because they do not ‘ explode ’ .
That is , in a paraconsistent logic the inference from \( p \wedge
eg p\ ) to an arbitrary conclusion \ ( r\ ) is not valid .
Owing to this consideration some contradictions are permitted and thought to be possible .
Beall contends that ( 1 ) Fitch ’s proof turns on the assumption that , for all statements \ ( p\ ) , the contradiction \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is impossible and ( 2 ) we have independent evidence for thinking \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) , for some \ ( p\ ) .
The independent evidence lies in the paradox of the knower ( not to be mistaken with the paradox of knowability ) .
The relevant version of the knower paradox may be demonstrated by considering the following self - referential sentence :
\ [ \tag{ \( k\ ) } k \text{ is unknown.} \]
Assume for the sake of argument that \ ( k\ ) is known .
Then , presuming that knowledge entails truth , \ ( k\ ) is true .
But \( k\ ) says that \ ( k\ ) is unknown .
So \( k\ ) is unknown .
Consequently , \( k\ ) is both known and unknown .
But then our assumption ( i.e. , that \( k\ ) is known ) is false , and provably so .
And , granting that a proven falsehood is known to be false , it follows that it is known that \ ( k\ ) is unknown .
That is to say , it is known that \ ( k\ ) .
But we have already shown that if it is known that \ ( k\ ) then \ ( k\ ) is both known and unknown .
So it is proven that \ ( k\ ) is both known and unknown .
It is provably the case that the full description of our knowledge includes both \ ( K ( k ) \ ) and \(
eg K( k ) \ ) .
That is the knower paradox .
Beall suggests that the knower gives us some independent evidence for thinking \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) , for some \ ( p\ ) , that the full description of human knowledge has the interesting feature of being inconsistent .
With a paraconsistent logic , one may accept this without triviality .
And so it is suggested that one go paraconsistent and embrace \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) as a true consequence of the knowability principle .
Beall concludes that Fitch ’s reasoning , without a proper reply to the knower , is ineffective against the knowability principle .
For Fitch ’s reasoning allegedly turns on the assumption that , for all \ ( p\ ) , it is impossible that \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) .
Notice that our presentation of Fitch ’s reasoning makes no explicit mention of the assumption that \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is impossible .
So here we attempt to pinpoint exactly where Fitch ’s reasoning goes wrong on the above account .
It is claimed at line 9 ( in the first section of this entry ) that \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is impossible .
Of course \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) entails the contradiction \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) .
And so , if the reasoning is that \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is impossible because contradictions are impossible , then Beall would be directly attacking the argument presented herein .
But notice the argument here is subtly different .
It goes like this .
\( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) entails the contradiction \( Kp \wedge
eg Kp\ ) .
So , by reductio , \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is false .
By necessitation , it follows that \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is necessarily false .
Depending on the paraconsistent logic , the paraconsistist may object to use of reductio , or may object to other inferences .
The claim that \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is impossible ( at line 9 ) is inferred from this claim that \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is necessarily false .
This may trouble the paraconsistentist .
By the lights of one living with contradiction , it may not follow that an inconsistent statement is impossible even if it is necessarily false .
After all , on this account a necessarilly false statement may be both false and true at some world , in which case the statement is both necessarily false and possible .
If this is right then the inference from \( \Box
eg p\ ) to \(
eg \ Diamond p\ ) has counterexamples and may not be employed to infer \(
eg \ Diamond K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) from \( \Box
eg K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) .
Beall ’s insights turn on a number of things : ( 1 ) the strength of the independent evidence for true epistemic contradictions , ( 2 ) the adequacy of the proposed resolutions to the knower paradox , ( 3 ) the question of whether Fitch ’s reasoning is ineffective without a resolution to the knower and ( 4 ) an interpretation for \( \Box\ ) and \( \Diamond\ ) that invalidates the relevant inference ( from \( \Box
eg p\ ) to \(
eg \ Diamond p ) \ ) while remaining true to the role played by \( \Diamond\ ) in the knowability principle .
We leave these problems for further debate .
But compare with Wansing ( 2002 ) , where a paraconsistent constructive relevant modal logic with strong negation is proposed to block the paradox .
More recent developments of the paraconsistent approach appear in Beall ( 2009 ) and Priest ( 2009 ) .
The remainder of proposals are restriction strategies .
They reinterpret KP by restricting its universal quantifier .
In effect , the restriction strategies invalidate Fitch ’s reasoning by prohibiting the substitution - instances of KP that lead to paradox .
In this section we examine semantic reasons for restricting the universal quantifer in KP .
Edgington ( 1985 ) offers a situation - theoretic diagnosis of Fitch ’s paradox .
She claims that the problem lies with the failure to distinguish between ‘ knowing in a situation that \ ( p\ ) ’ and ‘ knowing that \( p\ ) is the case in a situation ’ .
In the latter case , the situation is ( at least in part ) that which the knowledge is about .
In the former case , the situation is that in which the knowledge is had .
For instance , I may know in my actual situation that I would be in pain in a counterfactual situation where my tooth is pulled .
Importantly , the situation in which the knowledge takes place may be different from the situation that my knowledge is about .
In a situation in which my tooth is not pulled , I may know things that are about a situation in which my tooth is pulled .
What are situations ?
The above example seems to suggest that situations are worlds .
But situations may be less complete than worlds .
That is , they need not have truth - values fixed for statements that are irrelevant to the context .
Consider an example by Linstöm : I may know in a given perceptual situation \ ( s\ ) that John ( one of the participants of a card game ) has the best hand and that none of the participants knows this .
In this case my knowledge is of one situation \( s ^*\ ) , the card game , but my knowledge is acquired in a different situation \ ( s\ ) , my perceptual situation .
Situation \( s^*\ ) is not only determined , but its relevant information is limited , by the context of the card game .
And \( s\ ) is fixed and limited by the context of the perceptual situation .
Edgington prefers talk of situations rather than worlds , because knowledge of non-actual situations , unlike knowledge of non-actual worlds , does not require knowledge of an infinite amount of detail .
Making explicit the situation - theoretic distinction between ‘ knowing in ’ and ‘ knowing about ’ , we may reinterpret the knowability principle : for each statement \ ( p\ ) and situation \( s\ ) , if \( p\ ) is true in \ ( s\ ) then there is a situation \ ( s^*\ ) in which it is known that \ ( p\ ) is true in \ ( s\ ) .
Edgington requires of knowability the less general thesis : if \ ( p\ ) is true in an actual situation \ ( s\ ) then there is a possible situation \ ( s^*\ ) in which it is known that \ ( p\ ) is true in \ ( s\ ) .
Call this E - knowability or EKP :
\[\tag{EKP} \ A p \rightarrow \ Diamond K\A p , \]
where A is the actuality operator which may be read ‘ In some actual situation ’ , and \( \Diamond\ ) is the possibility operator to be read ‘ In some possible situation ’ .
As we see , EKP restricts the knowability principle to actual truths , by saying \ ( p\ ) is actually true only if there is a possible situation in which it is known that \ ( p\ ) is actually true .
The important suggestion is this .
Just as there may be actual knowledge of what is counterfactually the case , there may be counterfactual knowledge of what is actually the case .
In fact , in light of Fitch ’s proof , E - knowability requires the existence of such non-actual knowledge .
Let us see why .
Actual truths of the form \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) will have to be E - knowable .
But \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) cannot be actually known to be actually the case .
The reasoning here is exactly analogous to Fitch ’s reasoning .
The lesson is this .
Since , for some \( p , p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is actually the case , E - knowability commits us to possible knowledge that \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is actually the case .
Since this knowledge cannot be actual , E - knowability requires non-actual knowledge of what is actually the case .
E- knowability then denies the following assumption : given a statement \ ( p\ ) , if it is known that \ ( p\ ) in \ ( s\ ) , then in \( s\ ) it is known that \ ( p\ ) .
By Edgington ’s analysis it is exactly this implicit assumption that leads Fitch ’s reasoning astray .
The paradox is blocked without it .
Since the actuality operator rigidly designates actual situations , the truth - value of statements of the form \( \A p\ ) will not vary across possible situations .
‘\ ( \A p\ ) ’ entails ‘ in every situation \( \A p\ ) ’ .
Thus , as Edgington is aware , if \( \A p\ ) then it is necessary that \( \A p\ ) .
This by itself poses a problem for EKP .
The criticism is that Edgington ’s approach is not general enough .
Anyone who is likely to endorse the knowability principle is likely to think that it holds of all truths , not just those necessary truths involving the actuality operator .
EKP appears to be a very limited thesis failing to specify an epistemic constraint on contingent truth ( Williamson 1987a ) .
Further criticisms emerge when we attempt to say something informative about what constitutes non-actual knowledge of what is actually the case .
If there is such non-actual knowledge , there is non-actual thought about an actual situation .
So the non-actual thinker somehow has a concept of an actual situation .
But how is it possible for a non-actual thinker to have a concept that is specifically about situations in this the actual world .
It will not do for the thinker to express the thought ‘ actually \( p\ ) ’ , since ‘ actually ’ will designate rigidly only situations in her own world .
Moreover , since there is no causal link between the actual world \ ( w_1 \ ) and the relevant non-actual world \ ( w_2\ ) , it is unclear how non-actual thought in \ ( w_2\ ) can be uniquely about \ ( w_1 \ ) ( Williamson , 1987a : 257–258 ) .
Therefore , it is unclear how there might be non-actual knowledge about what is actually the case .
Of course actual knowledge about the non-actual is no better at singling out worlds .
The special problem for the non-actual knower is that the content of her thought must be precisely the content that we grasp when we consider the truth of \( \A p\ ) .
Being in the actual world we are able to single out this world uniquely .
When we consider the truth of \ ( \A p\ ) our context fixes the content of A specifically .
So if it really is \( \A p\ ) that is knowable by a non-actual knower , then it must be \( \A p\ ) that she grasps — that is , it must be the very same concept that we grasp .
But how this is possible is precisely the problem .
Related and additional criticisms of Edgington ’s proposal appear in Wright ( 1987 ) , Williamson ( 1987b ; 2000 b ) and Percival ( 1991 ) .
Formal developments on the proposal , including points that address some of these concerns appear in Rabinowicz and Segerberg ( 1994 ) , Lindström ( 1997 ) , Rückert ( 2003 ) , Edgington ( 2010 ) , Fara ( 2010 ) , Proietti and Sandu ( 2010 ) , and Schlöder ( forthcoming ) .
Kvanvig ( 1995 ) accuses
Fitch of a modal fallacy .
The fallacy is an illicit substitution into a modal context .
Consider a familiar modal fallacy .
For all persons \ ( x\ ) , there is a possible world in which \ ( x\ ) is not the inventor of bifocals .
( Even Ben Franklin , the actual inventor of bifocals , might not have invented them . )
Therefore , there is a possible world in which the inventor of bifocals is not the inventor of bifocals .
We can represent the argument formally .
Let our quantifiers range over persons , and let ‘ \ ( i\ ) ’ be the non-rigid designator ‘ the inventor of bifocals ’ .
Consider the argument :
\ [ \begin{align*} & \forall x \ Diamond
eg(x = i ) \\ &\quad\text {Therefore , } \\ & \Diamond
eg( i = i ) \end{align *}\ ]
Although anyone might not have been the inventor of bifocals , it does not follow ( in fact it is false ) that it is possible that the inventor of bifocals is not identical to the inventor of bifocals .
After all , it is necessary that the inventor of bifocals is the inventor of bifocals .
The lesson is that we may not substitute unrestrictedly into modal contexts .
Substitution into modal contexts , we might say , is permitted only if the substituting terms are rigid designators .
In the case of Fitch ’s result , our terms are sentences .
The knowability principle , \( \forall p( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp ) \ ) , apparently allows us to substitute any sentence whatsoever for \ ( p\ ) .
But notice that our quantifier has wide scope relative to \( \Diamond\ ) .
We would expect that the lessons of quantified modal logic carry over to quantified propositional modal logic .
If so , then we may not substitute for \ ( p\ ) any statement that does not designate rigidly .
On Kvanvig ’s diagnosis , the problem with Fitch ’s reasoning is that when he substituted the conjunction \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) for \ ( p\ ) in KP ( at line 2 of the result ) , he did not stop to determine whether \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is rigid .
Kvanvig maintains that \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is not rigid .
So Fitch ’s result is fallacious owing to an illicit substitution into a modal context .
But we may reconstrue \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) as rigid .
And when we do , the paradox evaporates .
Kvanvig proposes that quantified expressions are non-rigid .
The reason he gives is that quantifiers designate different objects in different possible worlds .
“ Everyone in Jon ’s Logic class must take the final ” is about different students in different possible worlds .
Were Sussie to have taken the class , the expression would have been about her .
But she decided not to take the class , so actually it is not about her .
\ ( Kp\ ) is an abbreviation for ‘ it is known by somebody at some time that \ ( p\ ) . ’
So , \ ( Kp\ ) is implicitly quantified .
Explicitly it reads \( \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) , \) which says there is a being \ ( x\ ) and a time \ ( t\ ) such that \ ( x\ ) knows that \ ( p\ ) at \ ( t\ ) .
Accordingly , on this account , the quantified expression that \ ( Kp\ ) abbreviates is non-rigid .
\( \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) \ ) is about different beings and times in different modal contexts .
For instance , the expression \( \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) \ ) is about actual beings and times .
But embedded in a modal context , e.g. , \( \Diamond \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) , \) the expression is about possible beings and times .
It says , ‘ there is a possible world in which there is a being \ ( x\ ) and time \ ( t\ ) such that \ ( x\ ) knows that \ ( p\ ) at \ ( t\ ) . ’
Now consider the relevant instance of Fitch ’s non-omniscience thesis : \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) .
Unabbreviated it reads , \( p \wedge
eg \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) , \) which says \ ( p\ ) is true but nobody ever knows that \ ( p\ ) .
The quantified expression is , on this view , a non-rigid designator .
Uttered in the actual world , it is about actual beings and times .
But , it is argued , embedded within the scope of a possibility operator the designation varies to be about possible beings and times .
When Fitch substituted the true conjunction , \( p \wedge
eg \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) , \ ) for \ ( p\ ) in the knowability principle , he substituted for \ ( p\ ) a non-rigid designator , thereby altering the reference of the conjunction and perpetrating a modal fallacy .
Alternatively , Kvanvig suggests , we may characterize \ ( Kp\ ) rigidly to say , ‘ there is an actual being \ ( x\ ) and actual time \ ( t\ ) such that it is known by \ ( x\ ) at \ ( t\ ) that \ ( p\ ) . ’
Since this expression designates rigidly ( i.e. , it makes reference to the actual world regardless of the modal context in which it appears ) , it may be substituted for \ ( p\ ) in the knowability principle .
The reinterpreted conjunction does not change its designation when embedded within the scope of \( \Diamond\ ) .
Moreover , on this reading of the conjunction , the paradox dissolves .
It is possible to know that the reinterpreted conjunction is true .
There is no contradiction in supposing that some possible being at some possible time knows that \ ( p\ ) is true but never known by an actual being at an actual time .
The paradox dissolves .
Further discussion of modal fallacies and non-rigid statements appears in Brogaard and Salerno ( 2008 ) and Kennedy ( 2014 ) .
Williamson ( 2000 b ) defends
Fitch ’s reasoning against Kvanvig ’s charge .
He suggests that Kvanvig has no grounds for thinking that Fitch ’s conjunction \( p \wedge
eg \exists x\exists t( Kxpt ) \ ) does not designate rigidly .
The reason Williamson gives is this .
An expression is non-rigid if , when uttered in a fixed context , it varies its reference with the circumstances under which it is evaluated .
But Kvanvig gives no convincing reason for thinking that Fitch ’s conjunction , as uttered in a fixed context , varies its reference in this way .
At best Kvanvig has shown that the conjunction varies its reference when uttered in varying contexts , since his argument is that a quantified sentence , when uttered at different worlds , will be about different objects .
To think that this is sufficient for non-rigidity , Williamson complains , is to confuse non-rigidity for indexicality .
Importantly , indexicality does not imply non-rigidity .
For instance , ‘ I am tired ’ is about me , and continues to be about me when I evaluate its truth - value in counterfactual circumstances .
The sentence might have been false .
Had I gotten enough sleep , I would not be tired .
Uttered in a fixed context , ‘ I ’ rigidly designates , even though it is an indexical .
That is , even though , had it been uttered in a different context by somebody else , it would have been about somebody other than me .
Analogously , even if quantified expressions are indexicals , it does not follow that they are non-rigid .
And so , even if Fitch ’s conjunction is an indexical expression , we have not been given a reason to think that it is non-rigid .
If this is correct , then we have no grounds for thinking that Fitch has committed the modal fallacy in question .
Kvanvig ( 2006 ) replies and develops other interesting themes in the Knowability Paradox , which is the only monograph to date dedicated to the topic .
The foregoing restriction strategies involved semantic reasons for limiting universal quantification .
In those cases , KP was restricted in light of considerations about situations , possible worlds , or rigid designation .
Another kind of restriction strategy is syntactic .
It limits the scope of universal quantification to those formulas that have a certain logical form or stand in a certain provability relation .
Most generally ,
\ [ p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp , \text { where } p \text{ has logical property } F. \]
\( F\ ) should then be a logical property that restricts the quantifier in some principled way .
Tennant ( 1997 ) focuses on the property of being Cartesian : A statement \ ( p\ ) is Cartesian if and only if \ ( Kp\ ) is not provably inconsistent .
Accordingly , he restricts the principle of knowability to Cartesian statements .
Call this restricted knowability principle T - knowability or TKP :
\[\tag {TKP} p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp , \text { where } p \text{ is Cartesian.} \]
Notice that T - knowability is free of the paradoxes that we have discussed .
It is free of Fitch ’s paradox and the related undecidedness paradox .
For both results substitute the problematic Fitch conjunction , \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) , for the variable in \( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp\ ) , giving us \(( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow \ Diamond K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) .
That is , they require that \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) be knowable if true ( line 2 of Fitch ’s result ) .
But \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) is not Cartesian , since \( K ( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \ ) is provably inconsistent ( entailing the contradiction at line 6 of Fitch ’s result ) .
In effect , TKP offers the most tolerant restriction needed to prohibit the bothersome substitution .
For it only prohibits substituting those statements for which it is logically impossible to know .
Dummett ( 2001 ) agrees that the knowability theorist ’s error lies in providing a blanket , rather than a restricted , knowability principle .
And he agrees that the restriction should be syntactic .
Dummett restricts the principle of knowability to “ basic ” statements and characterizes truth inductively from there .
For Dummett ,
\ [ \begin{array}{ll} p & \text{iff } \ Diamond Kp , \text { where } p \text{ is basic .} \\ p \text { and } q &\text{iff } p \wedge q ; \\ p \text { or } q &\text{iff } p \vee q ; \\ \text {if } p \text { then } q &\text{iff } p \rightarrow q ; \\ \text {it is not the case that } p &\text{iff }
eg p ; \\ F[ \text {Something} ] &\text{iff } \exists x F[x ] ; \\ F[ \text {Everything} ] &\text{iff } \ forall x F[x ] , \end{array} \ ]
where the logical constant on the right - hand side of each biconditional clause is understood as subject to the laws of intuitionistic logic .
Dummett ’s knowability principle or DKP , like Tennant ’s , is not threatened by the knowability paradoxes , and for the same reason .
It restricts the class of statements that are subject to knowability .
For Dummett ’s case , the problematic Fitch conjunction , \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) , being compound , and so not basic , cannot replace the variable in \ ( p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp\ ) .
The paradox is consequently averted .
The relative merits of these two restrictions are weighed by Tennant ( 2002 ) .
Tennant ’s restriction is the less demanding of the two , since it bars only the substitution of those statements that are logically unknowable , and so , only those statements that are responsible for the paradoxes .
Dummett ’s restriction , by comparison , bars not only the substitution of these propositions , but also the substitution of logically complex proposition that are clearly knowable .
Tennant also points out , if the knowability principle is the primary anti-realist motivation for revising classical logic , restricting that principle to basic statements can undermine arguments against a classical treatment of complex statements .
The main objections to the restriction strategies fall into two camps .
In the first camp we find the charge that a given syntactic restriction on the knowability principle is not principled .
From the second camp arise formulations of Fitch - like paradoxes that are not averted by the syntactic restrictions on knowable truth .
From the first camp Hand and Kvanvig ( 1999 ) protest that TKP has not been restricted in a principled manner — in effect , that we have been given no good reason , other than the threat of paradox , to restrict the principle to Cartesian statements .
( An analogous claim may be made of Dummett ’s DKP . ) Tennant ( 2001b ) replies to Hand and Kvanvig with general discussion about the admissibility of restrictions in the practice of conceptual analysis and philosophical clarification .
By drawing analogies between his own restriction and others that are clearly admissible , he maintains that the Cartesian restriction is not ad - hoc .
He also points out that TKP , rather than the unrestricted KP , serves as the more interesting point of contention between the semantic realist and anti-realist .
The realist believes that it is possible for truth to be unknowable in principle .
Fitch ’s reasoning , at best , shows us that there is structural unknowability , that is , unknowability that is a function of logical considerations alone .
But is there a more substantial kind of unknowability , for instance , unknowability that is a function of the recognition - transcendence of the non-logical subject - matter ?
A realist decrying the ad hoc nature of TKP ( or DKP ) fails to engage the knowability theorist at the heart of the realism debate .
Other complaints that Tennant ’s restriction strategy is not principled appear in DeVidi and Kenyon ( 2003 ) and Hand ( 2003 ) .
Hand offers a way of restricting knowability in a principled manner .
These concerns may be waived upon noticing versions of the paradox that do not violate the proposed restrictions on the knowability principle .
Williamson ( 2000a ) asks us to consider the following paradox .
Let \( p\ ) be the decidable sentence ‘ There is a fragment of Roman pottery at that spot . ’
Let \( n\ ) rigidly designate the number of books actually now on my desk .
Let \( E\ ) be the predicate ‘ is even . ’
Williamson constructs the conjunction ,
\ [ p \wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) , \ ]
and contends that it is Cartesian .
Knowing it , apparently , does not entail a contradiction .
If he is right , we can apply to it TKP , giving
\ ( ( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \rightarrow \ Diamond K( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) .
Additionally , if \ ( p\ ) is true and \ ( Kp\ ) is false , then Williamson ’s conjunction is true .
So ,
\ (( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow ( p \wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) .
Lines ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yield
\ (( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow \ Diamond K( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) .
Accepting the modest epistemic resources found in Fitch ’s reasoning , one can prove the following theorem :
\( K ( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \rightarrow En\ ) .
Here is why .
A conjunction is known only if its conjuncts are known .
So , if \( K ( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) , then \ ( Kp\ ) .
And only truths can be known .
So , if \( K ( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) , then \( Kp \rightarrow En\ ) .
Of course , \ ( Kp\ ) and \( Kp \rightarrow En\ ) jointly entail \ ( En\ ) .
So theorem 4 is valid , if Fitch ’s epistemic resources are .
Now , 4 is a theorem , and so , holds in all possible worlds .
So its consequent is possible if its antecedent is possible :
\( \Diamond K( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \rightarrow \ Diamond En\ ) .
From lines 3 and 5 we derive
\ (( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow \ Diamond En\ ) .
Since \( n\ ) designates rigidly , it is not contingent whether \ ( n\ ) is even .
It follows then that line 6 yields
\ (( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow En\ ) .
An analogous argument replacing ‘ odd ’ for ‘ even ’ gives us
\ (( p \wedge
eg Kp ) \rightarrow
eg En\ ) .
But then we have a contradiction resting on TKP and Fitch ’s conjunction , \( p \wedge
eg Kp\ ) .
The result involves substitutions of \( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) \ ) and \( p \wedge ( Kp \rightarrow
eg En ) \ ) for \ ( p\ ) in TKP , but Williamson maintains that neither violate the Cartesian restriction .
Paradox regained .
Tennant ( 2001a ) takes issue with Williamson ’s claim that \( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) \ ) is Cartesian .
In the case where \( n\ ) is odd , \ ( En\ ) expresses a necessary falsehood ( for instance , ‘ 13 is even ’ ) .
But then , line 4 tells us that \( K ( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) ) \ ) implies something that is necessarily false .
And if the falsity of ‘ 13 is even ’ is a matter of logical necessity , then \( p \ wedge ( Kp \rightarrow En ) \ ) cannot be consistently known and therefore is not Cartesian .
Hence , when \( n\ ) is odd , the first part of Williamson ’s proof ( involving the predicate ‘ is even ’ ) does in fact violate the Cartesian restriction .
By contrast , Williamson ’s conjunction is Cartesian when \ ( En\ ) is true .
But , analogously , if the truth of \ ( En\ ) is a matter of logical necessity , then \( p \wedge ( Kp \rightarrow
eg En ) \ ) cannot be consistently known and is therefore not Cartesian .
Hence , when \( n\ ) is even , the second part of Williamson ’s proof ( involving the predicate ‘ is odd ’ ) violates the Cartesian restriction .
Either way , Tennant argues , Williamson has not shown that TKP is an inadequate treatment of Fitch ’s paradox .
The debate continues in Williamson ( 2009 ) and Tennant ( 2010 ) .
Brogaard and Salerno ( 2002 ) develop other Fitch - like paradoxes against the restriction strategies .
Note that Dummett ’s knowability principle is a biconditional : \( p \leftrightarrow \ Diamond Kp\ ) , where \( p\ ) is basic .
Tennant ( 2002 ) agrees that the knowability principle should preserve the factive nature of \( \Diamond\ ) K .
So Brogaard and Salerno begin with the following strengthened knowability principle :
\[\begin{align}\tag{SKP} p \leftrightarrow \ Diamond Kp , \ , &\text {where } p \text{ satisfies the} \\ &\text {relevant syntactic condition} \end{align} \ ]
Moreover , pending further discussion of the logic of \ ( K\ ) , it is not implausible that the intuitionist knowability theorist wishes to validate the KK - principle :
\ [\tag {KK} \ Box ( Kp \rightarrow KKp ) . \]
The principle says , necessarily , if \ ( p\ ) is known then it is known that \ ( p\ ) is known .
One other resource is used , namely , the closure principle which says that the antecedent of a necessary conditional is possible only if the consequent is possible .
If these commitments are granted , one can derive Fitch ’s result without violating Tennant ’s Cartesian restriction :
\[\begin{array}{lll} 1 . & p \wedge
eg Kp & \text {Assumption ( Fitch conjunction ) } \\ 2 . & Kp \rightarrow KKp & \text {from KK} \\ 3 . & p \rightarrow \ Diamond Kp & \text {from SKP ( left - to - right ) } \\ 4 . & \ Diamond Kp & \text {from 1 and 3} \\ 5 . & \ Diamond KKp & \text {from 4 and 2 , by closure} \\ 6 . & \ Diamond KKp \rightarrow
Kp & \text {from SKP ( right - to - left ) } \\ 7 . & Kp & \text {from 5 and 6 } \\ 8 . & Kp \wedge
eg Kp & \text {from 1 and 7} \end{array} \ ]
SKP is applied at lines 3 and 6 to \ ( p\ ) and \ ( Kp\ ) , respectively .
And these substituends do not violate the Cartesian restriction .
Neither \ ( Kp\ ) , nor \( KKp\ ) , is self - contradictory .
Nonetheless , the anti-realist is forced absurdly to admit that no truth is unknown .
Arguably , this result threatens Dummett ’s restricted knowability principle as well .
But that depends on whether we have applied the principle to basic statements only .
\ ( p\ ) is basic , but Dummett ’s characterization of truth underdetermines the status of \ ( Kp\ ) .
Perhaps it is basic , since \ ( Kp\ ) is not truth - functionally complex .
Nonetheless , the issue cannot be resolved without a discussion of \ ( K\ ) .
Brogaard and Salerno demonstrate other paradoxes against the restriction strategies .
Those further results do not presuppose a commitment to the KK - principle .
They hinge ultimately on the knowability theorist ’s interpretation of \( \Diamond\ ) .
When \( \Diamond\ ) is metaphysical possibility or governed by a logic at least as strong as S4 , the strong knowability principle ( appropriately restricted ) , and taken as a necessary thesis , entails that there are no unknown truths .
When \( \Diamond\ ) is epistemic possibility , and the knowability principle is treated as a necessary thesis that is known , the knowability principle entails that , necessarily , there are no undecided statements .
Unlike the undecidedness paradoxes of Wright ( 1987 ) , Williamson ( 1988 ) , and Percival ( 1990 ) , the reasoning provided by Brogaard and Salerno does not violate Tennant ’s Cartesian restriction .
A response to Brogaard and Salerno appears in Rosenkranz ( 2004 ) .
Further discussion of the Cartesian restriction appears in Brogaard and Salerno ( 2006 , 2008 ) .
Tennant ( 2009 ) is a further development and defense of the Cartesian strategy .
A defense of the restriction strategy appears in Fischer ( 2013 ) .
Much of what has been written on the knowability paradox comes in the form of attempts to express the relevant form of anti-realism without paradox .
Proposals include Chalmers ( 2012 ) , Dummett ( 2009 ) , Edgington ( 2010 ) , Fara ( 2010 ) , Hand ( 2009 , 2010 ) , Jenkins ( 2005 ) , Kelp and Pritchard ( 2009 ) , Linsky ( 2009 ) , Hudson ( 2009 ) , Restall ( 2009 ) , Tennant ( 2009 ) , Alexander ( 2013 ) , Dean & Kurokawa ( 2010 ) , Proietti ( 2016 ) .
Chalmers ( 2002 , 2012 : chap. 2 ) , for instance , defends the idea that given enough qualitative information about the world we could in principle know the truth value of any claim .
More specifically , his scrutability thesis says , if \ ( D\ ) is a complete qualitative description of the world , then for all \ ( T\ ) , it is knowable a priori that \ ( D\ ) ( materially ) implies \( T\ ) .
Importantly , the knowability paradox does not threaten the claim that true Fitch - conjunctions are derivable a priori from a complete description of the world .
Dummett takes \( \forall p( p \rightarrow
eg
eg Kp ) \ ) to be the best expression of his brand of anti-realism and embraces its intuitionistic consequences with open arms .
Edgington defends her knowability principle ( viz. , if actually \ ( p\ ) then it is possible to know that actually \ ( p ) \ ) by making the case for some transworld knowability — specifically , in those cases where the merely possible knower shares the relevant causal history with the actual world .
Hand defends anti-realism by pointing to the distinction between a verification - type and its token performances , and argues that the existence of a verification - type does n’t entail its performability .
The lesson there is that the anti-realist should think about truth less in terms of the performability of verification procedures and more in terms of the existence of verification - types .
And Linsky regiments the epistemic principles and reasoning with a theory of types .
The debates surrounding the proper characterization of semantic anti-realism go far beyond the scope of this entry .
As for the knowability proof itself , there continues to be no consensus on whether and where it goes wrong .
Niche discussions of the paradox that do n’t fit well into any of the above sections include Salerno ’s ( 2018 ) new paradox of happiness ; Kvanvig ’s ( 2010 ) argument that the paradox threatens Christianity itself owing to its doctrine of the incarnation of Christ ; and Cresto ’s ( 2017 ) argument that the knowability paradox raises doubts about Reflection Principle as a requirement on rationality .
Nowhere are McCain 's regressive intentions for America more evident than in his fawning defense of Bush 's militarism in Iraq and in his indifference to the lessons learned from this administration 's reflexive use and support of military force as the solution to every conflict or ambition abroad .
Never before in the history of our nation have our government and military institutions been so stifled and neutered in their efforts to halt or stem the growing trend of violent acts of terrorism which has escalated in response to America 's heightened presence and initiative outside of our borders .
Yet , this administration , and , now , their protege ' McCain , have insisted on pressing forward with their dual , destabilizing occupations and posturing , indefinitely to some ' victory ' or ' success , as if we have n't already been witness to the limits of the use of the force of America 's military to effect whatever democratic change is promised or expected .
Despite the promises from this administration of political reconciliation in Iraq and assurances that democracy would blossom and flourish if just given some " breathing room " at the expense of the lives of nearly an additional thousand of our nation 's defenders , there have only been predictable expressions of sovereignty and impatience from the U.S. enabled Iraqi regime for the day when Washington finally gives them their own set of keys to their new military oligarchy .
Despite the most animated arguments of the administration and McCain that the " surge " of military force during the summer ' worked , ' there has been no concrete benefit from the increased assaults on Iraqi communities and the resulting " surge " of Americans and Iraqis killed in the process -- outside of our military forces ' demonstrated ability to conquer Iraqi territory and hold it .
And , if there are any credible ' successes ' in stemming the resistant and opportunistic violence in Iraq , most of credit must be given to those Iraqis who stepped up to forge their own reconciliation with their fellow citizens and to those Iraqis who walked away from their participation in the violence when directed to by their spiritual and political leaders .
That effort by Iraqis , themselves , actually began some four months before the " surge " was announced .
McCain has been anxious and eager to show voters that he 's ready and willing to press forward with his own macho , cowboy flexing of American muscle .
Earlier in the campaign McCain was taped while gleefully singing , ' bomb , bomb , bomb Iran , " even as he promised that his own prescription for the use of military force would require a credible threat to our national security , clear obtainable goals , and the application of overwhelming force , as he advised the administration ( and was rebuffed ) before their initial invasion of Iraq .
McCain 's hawkishness is an attempt to supplant his reservations about the correctness of the Vietnam War -- in which he served and was held captive -- with a popular , but incredible revisionism that , if we just push a little harder and expend and sacrifice more lives and resources , we will prevail .
How many times did Nixon try to convince Americans that he could ' win ' in Vietnam ?
Nixon , like Bush and Mccain , tried to deflect responsibility for his own escalation of his war by reminding Americans about Johnson 's role as he promised a victorious end to the conflict .
He called his own military muckraking , " winning the peace . "
The parallel is in Bush and McCain 's own strategy to remain in Iraq indefinitely and blame failure there on those who refuse to agree to let them run amok with our military forces .
Bush and McCain are telling Americans that they intend to keep our soldiers in Iraq until they can manage to declare some sort of victory in Iraq .
They say they 're waiting for Iraqis to unify .
They say they 're waiting for Iraqis to train their military and police .
They say they 're waiting for Iraqis to stabilize their government .
Bush says that " the only way to lose in Iraq is to leave before the job is done , " but , he also says he " will not put more pressure on the Iraqi government than it can bear . "
All of the burden for their failure in Iraq is , once again , thrown onto the backs of our soldiers who have never been equipped or prepared to transform Iraq into the ridiculously idyllic , democratic center of the ' New Middle East ' that Bush and his regime imagine it should become , just by virtue of their sacrifices .
Nixon 's lofty justifications for his continued involvement in Vietnam collapsed under the reality of a perpetual war that was being fueled by our very presence in Vietnam which only served to harden resistance to the U.S. and any forces allied with us .
At the end of decades of war , and thousands of American lives sacrificed , North Vietnamese forces took Saigon in 1975 .
Communist forces occupied the South , renaming Saigon Ho Chi Minh City .
It 's not hard to imagine Baghdad , in the future , under the control of the very forces our troops are battling today , much like the ' rebel ' leader Sadr was once able to ingratiate himself into the new Iraqi government and the manner in which Bush 's nemesis in Iran , has been able to ingratiate himself with the Iraqi regime .
McCain should be forced to tell Americans that he expects further sacrifices of life , limb , and American treasure to support the military aggression that his own special brand of bluster and swagger promises .
The scramble by McCain in the wake of Russia 's invasion of the Republic of Georgia to rattle and brandish sabers he does not yet possess or control devolved this week into a mimic of the Cold War as the Arizona senator revealed to the world that he intends to wield an even heavier , more dense hand than the warmonger - in - chief has brandished through this crisis .
Not only does a McCain presidency threaten to re-usher in a destabilizing chill with a Russian regime already on the defensive from Bush 's own scolding and maneuvering , a McCain presidency promises to manage disagreements or crisis with an initial threat of the exercise of our destructive forces .
The rest of McCain 's strategy promises to isolate Russia again and encourage other nations to adopt the same regressive , adversarial approach which kept our two nations at dangerous odds for decades .
Further demonstrating the ineptness of his judgment , the McCain says that he expects the UN Security Council ( in which Russia has a veto ) to act to join him in his strident condemnations of the former Soviet state .
In an amazing example of McCain 's knee jerk militarism , the Arizona senator had once proposed the creation of a creation of a " league of democracies " that would militarily meddle in world affairs where the UN refused to tread .
" We should form a league of democracies that can act with great influence and power , both economically and militarily , " McCain had said .
Even his diplomatic impulses are couched in his kneejerk militarism .
It will not serve those American interests of national security , the promotion of democracy abroad , or cooperation in any global effort to stem the tide of terrorist acts for McCain to re-adopt the old imperialistic isolationism of the past .
What McCain is asking of Americans is for us to reject the decades of progress which has been made in reforming relations between the ' Cold Warriors ' of the past and resign ourselves to the notion that our nation can do little except to try and dominate and intimidate the world by flailing our soldiers and weaponry around the globe .

The Republic on a Knife 's Edge
There are two ways of looking at the landmark 5 - 4 Supreme Court decision recognizing the habeas corpus rights of detainees at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba :
As a stirring victory for individual liberty over collective fear – or as a reminder that the one more right - wing justice could make George W. Bush ’s imperial presidency “ constitutional . ”
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly
At the heart of the June 12 decision was the majority ’s recognition that President Bush and his political allies have been playing games with the Constitution by turning Guantanamo into a legal black hole for the indefinite imprisonment ( or kangaroo - court trials ) of people Bush deems “ unlawful enemy combatants . ”
By the narrowest majority , the Supreme Court rejected Bush 's legal loophole , declaring that the U.S. government cannot evade the constitutional tradition of judicial oversight simply by citing an indefinite “ war on terror ” and by placing detainees off - shore at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay .
“ The laws and Constitution are designed to survive , and remain in force , in extraordinary times , ” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court ’s majority .
The majority also saw the Guantanamo loophole as a device used by the President and the Republican - controlled Congress of 2005 - 06 to evade the authority of civilian courts as well as the habeas corpus obligation for the Executive to justify a person ’s detention .
“ The writ of habeas corpus is itself an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers , ” the majority ruled , adding that it “ must not be subject to manipulation by those whose power it is designed to restrain . ”
In a concurring opinion , Justice David Souter also noted the duration of many Guantanamo imprisonments , “ some of the prisoners represented here today having been locked up for six years , ” he wrote .
However , four right - wing justices – Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas , John Roberts and Samuel Alito – saw nothing wrong in creating this modern - day Devil ’s Island outside the reach of traditional justice for the duration of the indefinite “ war on terror . ”
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee John McCain also has vowed to appoint more justices in the mold of Bush ’s selections , Roberts and Alito .
If another Roberts or Alito replaces one of the five more moderate justices , the new right - wing majority would be in position to reverse the latest ruling .
Imperial Presidency
The four sitting right - wing justices repeatedly have embraced the Bush administration ’s radical notion that at a time of war – even one as vaguely defined as the “ war on terror ” – the President possesses “ plenary ” or unlimited powers as Commander in Chief .
As expressed in classified memos by John Yoo when he was a key lawyer in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , there should be , in essence , no limits on what a war - time President can do as long as he is asserting his duty to protect the nation .
Alito also is associated with this concept of a “ unitary executive , ” holding that a President should control all regulatory authority , define the limits of laws via " signing statements " and – at his own discretion – override treaties , the will of Congress and even the Bill of Rights and the Constitution .
Under this theory , a President can cite his commander - in - chief powers to spy on citizens without warrants , imprison people without charges , authorize torture , order assassinations , and invade other countries without congressional approval .
With just one more Alito or Roberts , that view would claim control of the U.S. Supreme Court and allow a new five - to - four majority to , in effect , rewrite the Constitution .
The founding principles of the United States – that everyone possesses certain “ unalienable ” human rights and no one is above the law – would be history .
[ For details on these executive theories , see our book , Neck Deep . ]
Dissenting Justices
In their dissents to the June 12 ruling , entitled " Boumediene v. Bush , " the right - wing justices fashioned narrow arguments around the fact that previous courts had avoided extending habeas corpus – the right to challenge one 's detention – to non-citizens outside U.S. territory .
As Chief Justice Roberts wrote in his dissenting opinion : “ The majority is adamant that the Guantanamo detainees are entitled to the protections of habeas corpus – its opinion begins by deciding that question .
I regard the issue as a difficult one , primarily because of the unique and unusual jurisdictional status of Guantanamo Bay . ”
Writing the principal dissent , Justice Scalia sought to turn the argument about Bush ’s alleged manipulation of habeas corpus back on the court majority .
“ If the understood scope of the writ of habeas corpus was ‘ designed to restrain ’ ( as the Court says ) the actions of the Executive , the understood limits upon that scope were ( as the Court seems not to grasp ) just as much ‘ designed to restrain ’ the incursions of the Third Branch [ i.e. the Judiciary ] .
“ ‘ Manipulation ’ of the territorial reach of the writ by the Judiciary poses just as much a threat to the proper separation of powers as ‘ manipulation ’ by the Executive , ” Scalia continued .
“ The understood limits upon the writ deny our jurisdiction over the habeas petitions brought by these enemy aliens , and entrust the President with the crucial wartime determinations about their status and continued confinement . ”
In other words , the right - wing court minority believes that the President should have the unilateral right to decide who should be defined as an “ unlawful enemy combatant ” and the nature of their incarceration for as long as the “ war on terror ” continues .
Given the advanced ages and questionable health of some Supreme Court justices , Election 2008 may well decide more than just who will be the new occupant of the White House .
It may well decide whether Bush ’s imperial presidency outlasts his time in office – and whether the concept of “ unalienable rights ” survives .

TEHRAN ( Press TV ) --
An interview with legendary American essayist , author , social and political critic .
Press TV : We hear that Michael Mukasey is going to become the latest of the President ’s Attorney - Generals to be subpoenaed , this time over his conversations with Bush and Cheney -- does this show that Congress is serious about calling the executive to account ?
Gore Vidal : No , Congress has never been more cowardly , nor more corrupt .
All Bush has do is to make sure certain amounts of money go in the direction of certain important congressmen and that ’s end of any serious investigation .
After all , one of the bravest members of Congress is Denis Kucinich who brought the article of impeachment in to the well of the House of Representatives .
The House of Representatives must then try the president , and then after that it goes to the Senate for judgment .
However , none of these things will happen because there ’s nobody there except for Mr. Kucinich who has the courage to take on a sitting president who is kind of a Mafioso .
Press TV : How can it just be one person among so many hundreds of Congressmen who wants the impeachment of George W. Bush in these circumstances ?
Gore Vidal :
Well it ’s because we no longer have a country .
We do n’t have a republic any more .
During the last 7 or 8 years of the Bush regime , they ’ve got rid of the Bill of Rights , they ’ve got rid of habeas corpus .
They have got rid of one of the nicest gifts that England ever left us when they went away and we ceased to be colonies -- the Magna Carta -- from the 12th century .
All of our law and due process of law is based on that .
And the Bush people got rid of it .
The president and little Mr. Gonzales who for a few minutes was his Attorney General .
They managed to get rid of all of the constitutional links that made us literally a republic .
Press TV : You have often written about the United States ’ superpower status in terms of the history of previous superpowers .
Do you think we ’re witnessing the end of U.S. power as some suggest .
Will the White House be seen like Persepolis ?
Gore Vidal :
Well it wo n’t make such good ruins , no .
It ’ll be more like the tomb of Cyrus nearby .
They managed to destroy the United States -- why ?
Because they ’re oil and gas people and they ’re essentially criminals .
I repeat that this is a criminal group that ’s seized control of the country through what looked like an ordinary election .
But there ’s some very nice films and documentaries about what happened in the year 2000 when Albert Gore won the election for president and they saw to it that he could n’t serve .
They got the Supreme Court -- which is the Holy of Holies ordinarily in our system - to investigate and then accuse the thieves of being absolutely correct and the winners -- Mr. Gore and the Democrats -- of being the cheaters .
It ’s the first law of Machiavelli , whatever your opponent ’s faults are , you pick his virtues and you deny he has them .
That ’s what they did when Senator Kerry ran a few years ago for president .
He ’s a famous hero from the Vietnam War .
They said he was a coward and not a hero .
That ’s how it ’s done .
When you have a bunch of liars in charge of your government you ca n’t expect to get much history out of that .
But later on we ’ll dig and dig … and we will dig up Persepolis .
Press TV : Senator Obama talks about change but of course he has courting Wall Street as well as the Israeli lobby -- do you see any prospect of change with him as president ?
Gore Vidal : Not really .
I do n’t doubt his good faith , just as I do not doubt the bad faith of Cheney and Bush .
They are such dreadful people that we ’ve never had in government before .
They would never have risen unless they were buying elections as they did in Florida in 2000 , as they did in the State of Ohio in 2004 .
These are two open thefts of the Presidency .
When I discovered that this did not interest the New York Times or the Washington Post or any of the press of the country I realized our day was done .
We are no longer a country we are a framework for crooks to go in and steal money .
Knowing that they ’ll never be caught and they ’ll be admired for it .
Americans always take everybody on his own evaluation .
You say I ’m a state and they say “ oh , yeah yeah yeah , he ’s a state , is n’t that great . ”
And you accuse the other people of your crimes before you commit them .
It ’s an old trick which was known to Machiavelli who wrote about it in his handbook , the Prince .
Press TV : Finally that issue which is exercising so many minds in the Middle East and beyond .
You , yourself have written about so many Imperial wars of the United States .
Do you think Bush and Cheney would risk another war in what Mohammad ElBaradei of the IAEA calls a fireball ?
Gore Vidal :
They are longing to but they have spent all of the money .
They have got it in their own private companies like the Vice - President and a company called Halliburton which is stealing more money and should be on trial sooner or later before Congress .
But perhaps not , who knows ?
But it ’s well known in Washington , these people are leaking away the money of the country .
Well there ’s no more money .
They are longing for a war with Iran .
Iran is no more a harm to us than was Iraq or Afghanistan .
They invented an enemy , they tell lies , lies , lies .
The New York Times goes along with their lies , lies , lies .
And they do n’t stop .
When the public that ’s lied to 30 times a day it ’s apt to believe the lies , is not it ?
Despite the fact touch rugby rules were in force , some players decided to don protective headgear , and while it may have made them feel just a little less naked , it would have done little to ease the 15 degree chill .
Ok , this is pretty breaking news .
Apparently Apple ’s iTunes has been blocked by “ the great firewall of China ” ( awesome name btw ) , as a reaction to a pro-tibetan album that ’s been getting really popular there .
To be more exact The Art of Peace Foundation ’s Songs for Tibet compilation , featuring tracks by Alanis Morissette , Sting , Moby and 17 more artists .
The album was released as a download on the iTunes Store on August 5 – three days before the start of the Olympics – with the physical CD launched on Tuesday this week .
Funds raised by the non-profit Foundation are donated to peace - related projects “ that are dear to the Dalai Lama ” , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom China regards as subversive .
Furthermore , the album was given to athletes attending the Olympics , who were encouraged to put the songs on their iPod and play them as a form of protest .
This Monday , the pro-tibet organization announced that “ over 40 Olympic athletes in North America , Europe and even Beijing ” had downloaded the album .
This was enough to pull the plugg , apparently .
The same day , apple users who were momentarily expatriated in the Chinese space began to experience issues with their iTunes software .
The problem resonated across most of China .
Apple ’s customer forums contain numerous examples .
This goes even further .
A lot of Chinese internet users have been really offended by the Songs For Tibet album , released over iTunes , and intend on planning a boycott .
According to a report published in the semi-official Chinese news portal , china.org.cn :
“ angry netizens [ internet users ] are rallying together to denounce Apple in offering Songs for Tibet for purchase .
They have also expressed a wish to ban the album ’s singers and producers , most notably Sting , John Mayer and Dave Matthews , from entering China . ”
Can you guys , like , ban Dave Matthews from the entire world ?
That ’d be graaand !
Anyway , Chinese internet users are also planning on blocking anything related to Apple , including the new iPhone 3G , the device that ’s been turning head all around the world .
Apple officials are in talks with Chinese mobile phone operators to launch the highly successful mobile phone in the panda ’s home , but from the looks of it , their attempts might prove unfruitful .
The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion ... draws all things else to support and agree with it .
And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side , yet these it either neglects and despises ... in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate .
--, Novum Organum ,
Pace Will Rogers , I am not a member of any organized political party .
I am a libertarian .
As a fiscal conservative and social liberal , I have found at least something to like about each Republican or Democrat I have met .
I have close friends in both camps , in which I have observed the following : no matter the issue under discussion , both sides are equally convinced that the evidence overwhelmingly supports their position .
This surety is called the confirmation bias , whereby we seek and find confirmatory evidence in support of already existing beliefs and ignore or reinterpret disconfirmatory evidence .
Now a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study shows where in the brain the confirmation bias arises and how it is unconscious and driven by emotions .
Psychologist Drew Westen led the study , conducted at Emory University , and the team presented the results at the 2006 annual conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology .
During the run-up to the 2004 presidential election , while undergoing an fMRI bran scan , 30 men -- half self - described as " strong " Republicans and half as " strong " Democrats -- were tasked with assessing statements by both George W. Bush and John Kerry in which the candidates clearly contradicted themselves .
Not surprisingly , in their assessments Republican subjects were as critical of Kerry as Democratic subjects were of Bush , yet both let their own candidate off the hook .
The neuroimaging results , however , revealed that the part of the brain most associated with reasoning -- the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - - was quiescent .
Most active were the orbital frontal cortex , which is involved in the processing of emotions ; the anterior cingulate , which is associated with conflict resolution ; the posterior cingulate , which is concerned with making judgments about moral accountability ; and -- once subjects had arrived at a conclusion that made them emotionally comfortable -- the ventral striatum , which is related to reward and pleasure .
" We did not see any increased activation of the parts of the brain normally engaged during reasoning , " Westen is quoted as saying in an Emory University press release .
" What we saw instead was a network of emotion circuits lighting up , including circuits hypothesized to be involved in regulating emotion , and circuits known to be involved in resolving conflicts . "
Interestingly , neural circuits engaged in rewarding selective behaviors were activated .
" Essentially , it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope until they get the conclusions they want , and then they get massively reinforced for it , with the elimination of negative emotional states and activation of positive ones , " Westen said .
The implications of the findings reach far beyond politics .
A jury assessing evidence against a defendant , a CEO evaluating information about a company or a scientist weighing data in favor of a theory will undergo the same cognitive process .
What can we do about it ?
In science we have built - in self - correcting machinery .
Strict double - blind controls are required in experiments , in which neither the subjects nor the experimenters know the experimental conditions during the data - collection phase .
Results are vetted at professional conferences and in peer - reviewed journals .
Research must be replicated in other laboratories unaffiliated with the original researcher .
Disconfirmatory evidence , as well as contradictory interpretations of the data , must be included in the paper .
Colleagues are rewarded for being skeptical .
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .
We need similar controls for the confirmation bias in the arenas of law , business and politics .
Judges and lawyers should call one another on the practice of mining data selectively to bolster an argument and warn juries about the confirmation bias .
CEOs should assess critically the enthusiastic recommendations of their VPs and demand to see contradictory evidence and alternative evaluations of the same plan .
Politicians need a stronger peer - review system that goes beyond the churlish opprobrium of the campaign trail , and I would love to see a political debate in which the candidates were required to make the opposite case .
Skepticism is the antidote for the confirmation bias .
SAN FRANCISCO – Malicious hackers beware : Computer security expert Joel Eriksson might already own your box .
Eriksson , a researcher at the Swedish security firm Bitsec , uses reverse - engineering tools to find remotely exploitable security holes in hacking software .
In particular , he targets the client - side applications intruders use to control Trojan horses from afar , finding vulnerabilities that would let him upload his own rogue software to intruders ' machines .
He demoed the technique publicly for the first time at the RSA conference Friday .
" Most malware authors are not the most careful programmers , " Eriksson said .
" They may be good , but they are not the most careful about security . "
Eriksson 's research on cyber counterattack comes as the government and security firms are raising alarms about targeted intrusions by hackers in China , who are evidently using Trojan horse software to spy on political groups , defense contractors and government agencies around the globe .
The researcher suggests that the best defense might be a good offense , more effective than installing a better intrusion - detection system .
Hacking the hacker may be legally dubious , but it is hard to imagine any intruder - turned - victim picking up the phone to report that he had been hacked .
Eriksson first attempted the technique in 2006 with Bifrost 1.1 , a piece of free hackware released publicly in 2005 .
Like many so - called remote administration tools , or RATs , the package includes a server component that turns a compromised machine into a marionette , and a convenient GUI client that the hacker runs on his own computer to pull the hacked PC 's strings .
Using traditional software attack tools , Eriksson first figured out how to make the GUI software crash by sending it random commands , and then found a heap overflow bug that allowed him to install his own software on the hacker 's machine .
The Bifrost hack was particularly simple since the client software trusted that any communication to it from a host was a response to a request the client had made .
When version 1.2 came out in 2007 , the hole seemed to be patched , but Eriksson soon discovered it was just slightly hidden .
Eriksson later turned the same techniques on a Chinese RAT known as PCShare ( or PCClient ) , which hackers can buy for about 200 yuan ( about $ 27 ) .
PCClient is slightly better engineered than Bifrost , since it wo n't accept a file uploaded to it , unless the hacker is using the file explorer tool .
But , Eriksson found , the software 's authors left a bug in the file explorer tool in the module that checks how long a download will take .
That hole allowed him to upload an attack file the hacker had n't asked for , and even write it into the server 's autostart directory .
The software 's design also inadvertently included a way for the reverse attacker to find the hacker 's real IP address , Eriksson said .
He said its unlikely that the malware authors know of these vulnerabilities , though its unlikely that PCClient is still in use .
But he says his techniques should also work for botnets as well , even as malware authors start using better encryption , and learn to obfuscate their communication paths using peer to peer software .
" If there is a vulnerability , it is still game over for the hacker , " Eriksson said .

Followup to : Dissolving the Question , Causality and Moral Responsibility
Planning out upcoming posts , it seems to me that I do , in fact , need to talk about the word could , as in , " But I could have decided not to rescue that toddler from the burning orphanage . "
Otherwise , I will set out to talk about Friendly AI , one of these days , and someone will say : " But it 's a machine ; it can't make choices , because it could n't have done anything other than what it did . "
So let 's talk about this word , " could " .
Can you play Rationalist 's Taboo against it ?
Can you talk about " could " without using synonyms like " can " and " possible " ?
Let 's talk about this notion of " possibility " .
I can tell , to some degree , whether a world is actual or not actual ; what does it mean for a world to be " possible " ?
I know what it means for there to be " three " apples on a table .
I can verify that experimentally , I know what state of the world corresponds it .
What does it mean to say that there " could " have been four apples , or " could not " have been four apples ?
Can you tell me what state of the world corresponds to that , and how to verify it ?
Can you do it without saying " could " or " possible " ?
I know what it means for you to rescue a toddler from the orphanage .
What does it mean for you to could - have - not done it ?
Can you describe the corresponding state of the world without " could " , " possible " , " choose " , " free " , " will " , " decide " , " can " , " able " , or " alternative " ?
One last chance to take a stab at it , if you want to work out the answer for yourself ...
Some of the first Artificial Intelligence systems ever built , were trivially simple planners .
You specify the initial state , and the goal state , and a set of actions that map states onto states ; then you search for a series of actions that takes the initial state to the goal state .
Modern AI planners are a hell of a lot more sophisticated than this , but it 's amazing how far you can get by understanding the simple math of everything .
There are a number of simple , obvious strategies you can use on a problem like this .
All of the simple strategies will fail on difficult problems ; but you can take a course in AI if you want to talk about that part .
There 's backward chaining : Searching back from the goal , to find a tree of states such that you know how to reach the goal from them .
If you happen upon the initial state , you 're done .
There 's forward chaining : Searching forward from the start , to grow a tree of states such that you know how to reach them from the initial state .
If you happen upon the goal state , you 're done .
Or if you want a slightly less simple algorithm , you can start from both ends and meet in the middle .
Let 's talk about the forward chaining algorithm for a moment .
Here , the strategy is to keep an ever - growing collection of states that you know how to reach from the START state , via some sequence of actions and ( chains of ) consequences .
Call this collection the " reachable from START " states ; or equivalently , label all the states in the collection " reachable from START " .
If this collection ever swallows the GOAL state - if the GOAL state is ever labeled " reachable from START " - you have a plan .
" Reachability " is a transitive property .
If B is reachable from A , and C is reachable from B , then C is reachable from A .
If you know how to drive from San Jose to San Francisco , and from San Francisco to Berkeley , then you know a way to drive from San Jose to Berkeley .
( It may not be the shortest way , but you know a way . )
If you 've ever looked over a game - problem and started collecting states you knew how to achieve - looked over a maze , and started collecting points you knew how to reach from START - then you know what " reachability " feels like .
It feels like , " I can get there . "
You might or might not be able to get to the GOAL from San Francisco - but at least you know you can get to San Francisco .
You do n't actually run out and drive to San Francisco .
You 'll wait , and see if you can figure out how to get from San Francisco to GOAL .
But at least you could go to San Francisco any time you wanted to .
( Why would you want to go to San Francisco ?
If you figured out how to get from San Francisco to GOAL , of course ! )
Human beings cannot search through millions of possibilities one after the other , like an AI algorithm .
But - at least for now - we are often much more clever about which possibilities we do search .
One of the things we do that current planning algorithms do n't do ( well ) , is rule out large classes of states using abstract reasoning .
For example , let 's say that your goal ( or current subgoal ) calls for you to cover at least one of these boards using domino 2 - tiles .
The black square is a missing cell ; this leaves 24 cells to be covered with 12 dominos .
You might just dive into the problem , and start trying to cover the first board using dominos - discovering new classes of reachable states :
However , you will find after a while that you can't seem to reach a goal state .
Should you move on to the second board , and explore the space of what 's reachable there ?
But I would n't bother with the second board either , if I were you .
If you construct this coloring of the boards :
Then you can see that every domino has to cover one grey and one yellow square .
And only the third board has equal numbers of grey and yellow squares .
So no matter how clever you are with the first and second board , it can't be done .
With one fell swoop of creative abstract reasoning - we constructed the coloring , it was not given to us - we 've cut down our search space by a factor of three .
We 've reasoned out that the reachable states involving dominos placed on the first and second board , will never include a goal state .
Naturally , one characteristic that rules out whole classes of states in the search space , is if you can prove that the state itself is physically impossible .
If you 're looking for a way to power your car without all that expensive gasoline , it might seem like a brilliant idea to have a collection of gears that would turn each other while also turning the car 's wheels - a perpetual motion machine of the first type .
But because it is a theorem that this is impossible in classical mechanics , we know that every clever thing we can do with classical gears will not suffice to build a perpetual motion machine .
It is as impossible as covering the first board with classical dominos .
So it would make more sense to concentrate on new battery technologies instead .
Surely , what is physically impossible cannot be " reachable " ... right ?
I mean , you would think ...
Oh , yeah ... about that free will thing .
So your brain has a planning algorithm - not a deliberate algorithm that you learned in school , but an instinctive planning algorithm .
For all the obvious reasons , this algorithm keeps track of which states have known paths from the start point .
I 've termed this label " reachable " , but the way the algorithm feels from inside , is that it just feels like you can do it .
Like you could go there any time you wanted .
And what about actions ?
They 're primitively labeled as reachable ; all other reachability is transitive from actions by consequences .
You can throw a rock , and if you throw a rock it will break a window , therefore you can break a window .
If you could n't throw the rock , you would n't be able to break the window .
Do n't try to understand this in terms of how it feels to " be able to " throw a rock .
Think of it in terms of a simple AI planning algorithm .
Of course the algorithm has to treat the primitive actions as primitively reachable .
Otherwise it will have no planning space in which to search for paths through time .
And similarly , there 's an internal algorithmic label for states that have been ruled out :
worldState.possible == 0
So when people hear that the world is deterministic , they translate that into : " All actions except one are impossible . "
This seems to contradict their feeling of being free to choose any action .
The notion of physics following a single line , seems to contradict their perception of a space of possible plans to search through .
The representations in our cognitive algorithms do not feel like representations ; they feel like the way the world is .
If your mind constructs a search space of states that would result from the initial state given various actions , it will feel like the search space is out there , like there are certain possibilities .
We 've previously discussed how probability is in the mind .
If you are uncertain about whether a classical coin has landed heads or tails , that is a fact about your state of mind , not a property of the coin .
The coin itself is either heads or tails .
But people forget this , and think that coin.
probability == 0.5 , which is the Mind Projection Fallacy : treating properties of the mind as if they were properties of the external world .
So I doubt it will come as any surprise to my longer - abiding readers , if I say that possibility is also in the mind .
What concrete state of the world - which quarks in which positions - corresponds to " There are three apples on the table , and there could be four apples on the table " ?
Having trouble answering that ?
Next , say how that world - state is different from " There are three apples on the table , and there could n't be four apples on the table . "
And then it 's even more trouble , if you try to describe could - ness in a world in which there are no agents , just apples and tables .
This is a Clue that could - ness and possibility are in your map , not directly in the territory .
What is could - ness , in a state of the world ?
What are can -ness and able - ness ?
They are what it feels like to have found a chain of actions which , if you output them , would lead from your current state to the could - state .
But do not say , " I could achieve X " .
Say rather , " I could reach state X by taking action Y , if I wanted " .
The key phrase is " if I wanted " .
I could eat that banana , if I wanted .
I could step off that cliff there - if , for some reason , I wanted to .
Where does the wanting come from ?
Do n't think in terms of what it feels like to want , or decide something ; try thinking in terms of algorithms .
For a search algorithm to output some particular action - choose - it must first carry out a process where it assumes many possible actions as having been taken , and extrapolates the consequences of those actions .
Perhaps this algorithm is " deterministic " , if you stand outside Time to say it .
But you can't write a decision algorithm that works by just directly outputting the only action it can possibly output .
You can't save on computing power that way .
The algorithm has to assume many different possible actions as having been taken , and extrapolate their consequences , and then choose an action whose consequences match the goal .
( Or choose the action whose probabilistic consequences rank highest in the utility function , etc .
And not all planning processes work by forward chaining , etc . )
You might imagine the decision algorithm as saying : " Suppose the output of this algorithm were action A , then state X would follow .
Suppose the output of this algorithm were action B , then state Y would follow . "
This is the proper cashing - out of could , as in , " I could do either X or Y . "
Having computed this , the algorithm can only then conclude : " Y ranks above X in the Preference Ordering .
The output of this algorithm is therefore B. Return B. "
The algorithm , therefore , cannot produce an output without extrapolating the consequences of itself producing many different outputs .
All but one of the outputs being considered is counterfactual ; but which output is the factual one cannot be known to the algorithm until it has finished running .
A bit tangled , eh ?
No wonder humans get confused about " free will " .
You could eat the banana , if you wanted .
And you could jump off a cliff , if you wanted .
These statements are both true , though you are rather more likely to want one than the other .
You could even flatly say , " I could jump off a cliff " and regard this as true - if you construe could - ness according to reachability , and count actions as primitively reachable .
But this does not challenge deterministic physics ; you will either end up wanting to jump , or not wanting to jump .
The statement , " I could jump off the cliff , if I chose to " is entirely compatible with " It is physically impossible that I will jump off that cliff " .
It need only be physically impossible for you to choose to jump off a cliff - not physically impossible for any simple reason , perhaps , just a complex fact about what your brain will and will not choose .
Defining things appropriately , you can even endorse both of the statements :
" I could jump off the cliff " is true from my point - of - view
" It is physically impossible for me to jump off the cliff " is true for all observers , including myself
How can this happen ?
If all of an agent 's actions are primitive - reachable from that agent 's point - of - view , but the agent 's decision algorithm is so constituted as to never choose to jump off a cliff .
You could even say that " could " for an action is always defined relative to the agent who takes that action , in which case I can simultaneously make the following two statements :
NonSuicidalGuy could jump off the cliff .
It is impossible that NonSuicidalGuy will hit the ground .
If that sounds odd , well , no wonder people get confused about free will !
But you would have to be very careful to use a definition like that one consistently .
" Could " has another closely related meaning in which it refers to the provision of at least a small amount of probability .
This feels similar , because when you 're evaluating actions that you have n't yet ruled out taking , then you will assign at least a small probability to actually taking those actions - otherwise you would n't be investigating them .
Yet " I could have a heart attack at any time " and " I could have a heart attack any time I wanted to " are not the same usage of could , though they are confusingly similar .
You can only decide by going through an intermediate state where you do not yet know what you will decide .
But the map is not the territory .
It is not required that the laws of physics be random about that which you do not know .
Indeed , if you were to decide randomly , then you could scarcely be said to be in " control " .
To determine your decision , you need to be in a lawful world .
It is not required that the lawfulness of reality be disrupted at that point , where there are several things you could do if you wanted to do them ; but you do not yet know their consequences , or you have not finished evaluating the consequences ; and so you do not yet know which thing you will choose to do .
A blank map does not correspond to a blank territory .
Not even an agonizingly uncertain map corresponds to an agonizingly uncertain territory .
( Next in the free will solution sequence is " The Ultimate Source " , dealing with the intuition that we have some chooser - faculty beyond any particular desire or reason .
As always , the interested reader is advised to first consider this question on their own - why would it feel like we are more than the sum of our impulses ? )
Can Maths really save your life ?
Of course it can !!
Maths has applications to many problems that are vital to human health and happiness .
In this article we are going to describe how the mathematics of tomography has become one of the most important applications of mathematics to the problems of keeping you alive .
Modern medicine relies heavily on imaging methods , starting with the early use of X - rays at the start of the 20th century .
A CAT scan of the inside of a head .
Essentially these imaging methods take two forms .
X -ray and ultrasound methods use a source of radiation that lies outside the body .
The radiation is detected after it has passed through the body , and an image constructed from the way it has been absorbed .
When X - rays are used , this process is called computerised axial tomography or CAT for short .
( The word tomography comes from the Greek work tomos meaning " cut " or " slice " . )
This article will look at this process in detail .
Other imaging methods use a source inside the body .
These include magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) and single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) .
These methods have certain advantages over CAT , both in image resolution and in safety , as X - rays can easily damage soft tissue .
The basic mathematics behind tomography was worked out by the mathematician Johann Radon in 1917 .
Much later , in the 1960s Allan McLeod Cormack , working in collaboration with Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield , developed the first practical scanning device , the celebrated EMI scanner .
For this work , Cormack won the Noble Prize .
Early models could only scan an object the size of a human head , but whole body scanners followed shortly after .
Medical imaging works because of a combination of very careful measurement techniques , sophisticated computer algorithms , and powerful mathematics .
It is the mathematics that we will describe here .
We will also show that the mathematics of tomography has many other applications , including imaging the atmosphere , detecting land - mines and , slightly more frivolously , solving Sudoku puzzles .
Milk deliveries and Killer Sudoku
Before delving into the depths of medical science , we will start with a simple example which illustrates the principles of tomography , and which has a very nice link to the various types of Sudoku that have become very popular recently .
This example involves milk deliveries .
Imagine that milk and fruit juice is delivered in bottles that are placed in trays with 9 compartments arranged as a 3 × 3 grid .
Each compartment of the tray contains a bottle which may contain milk , juice or be empty .
The question is : which type of bottle is in which compartment ?
Unfortunately , other trays are above and beneath the one we 're interested in , so we can't look down on top of the tray .
At first sight it would seem impossible to solve this problem .
However , we can peer in through the sides and we can measure how much light is absorbed in different directions .
Different types of bottle absorb different amounts of light .
Careful measurements have shown that milk bottles absorb 3 units , juice bottles 2 units and empty bottles one unit .
If a light beam is shone through several bottles , then this absorption adds up .
If , for example , a light beam shines through a milk bottle and then a juice bottle , then 5 units are absorbed .
If it passes through three empty bottles then 3 units are absorbed .
In the example below we have indicated the total amount of light absorbed when shining light through each of the rows and each of the columns .
To solve this puzzle , we must place a bottle with 1,2 or 3 units of light absorption in each compartment , with the sum of the units in the first row equalling 5 , in the second row 6 etc .
The middle column contains 3 bottles and also absorbs 3 units of light .
The only way this can be done is for each compartment of the middle column to contain one empty bottle absorbing one unit of light each .
What about the other compartments ?
Unfortunately we do n't have enough information ( yet ) to solve this puzzle .
Here are two different solutions :
We are faced with a rather unusual situation for a mathematician in that we have two perfectly plausible solutions to the same problem .
Problems like this are called ill - posed and are common in situations where we are trying to extract information from an image .
To find out exactly how the bottles are distributed , we need to put in a little extra information .
One obvious extra thing we can measure is the light absorbed in the two diagonals of the tray .
We do this and find that 6 units are absorbed in the top left to bottom right diagonal , and 3 units in the bottom left to top right diagonal .
From this extra piece of information it is clear that the first solution , and not the second , corresponds to the measurements made .
It can be shown with a bit of extra maths , that if we can measure the light absorbed in the rows , columns and diagonals exactly , then we can uniquely determine the arrangement of the bottles in the compartments of the tray .
This problem may seem trivial , but it is very similar to the medical imaging problem we will describe in the next section , and shows how important it is to obtain enough information about a situation to make sure that we know what is going on exactly .
If any of this looks familiar to newspaper readers , then it is .
Killer Sudoku is an advanced version of the popular Sudoku puzzle .
In Killer Sudoku , as in Sudoku , the player is asked to place the numbers 1 to 9 in a grid with each number occurring once and once only in each row and column .
However , rather than giving the player some starting numbers ( as in Sudoku ) Killer Sudoku tells you how the numbers add up in certain combinations .
This is precisely the same as the problem described above .
CAT and the Radon Transform
Until relatively recently , if you had something wrong with your insides , you had to be operated on to find out what it was .
Any such operation carried a significant risk , especially in the case of problems with the brain .
However , this is no longer the case ; as we described in the introduction , doctors are able to use a whole variety of scanning techniques to look inside you in a completely safe say .
A modern Computerised Axial Tomography ( CAT ) scanner is illustrated on the left .
In this scanner the patient lies on a bed and passes through the hole in the middle of the device .
This hole contains an X - ray source which rotates around the patient .
The X - rays from this source pass through the patient and are detected on the other side .
The level of intensity of the X - ray can be measured accurately and the results processed .
The resulting fan of X - rays is illustrated in the following figure ( with a conveniently circular patient ) .
As an X - ray passes through a patient , it is attenuated so that its intensity is reduced .
The degree to which this happens depends upon what material the ray passes through : its intensity is reduced more when passing through bone than when passing through muscle , an internal organ , or a tumour .
A key step in reconstructing an image of the body from a set of X - ray measurements is to carefully measure exactly how different materials absorb X - rays .
When an X - ray passes through a body , it does so in a straight line , and its total absorption is a combination of the amounts to which it is absorbed by the different materials that it passes through .
To see how this happens , we need to use a little calculus .
Imagine that the X - ray moves along a straight line and that at a distanceinto the body it has an intensity .
Asincreases , sodecreases as the X - ray is absorbed .
Now , if the X - ray travels a small distanceits intensity is reduced by a small amount .
This reduction depends both on the intensity of the X-ray and the optical densityof the material .
Provided that the distance travelled is small enough , the reduction in intensity is related to the optical density by the formulaNow , when the X - ray enters the body it will have intensityand when it leaves it will have intensity .
We can combine all of the contributions to the reduction in the intensity of the X - ray given by all of the parts of the body that it travels through .
Doing this , we find that the attenuation ( the reduction in the intensity ) is given bywhere
This is the attenuation of one X - ray and it gives some information about the body .
Below we see an object irradiated by several X - rays with the intensity of the rays measured on a detector .
Here some X - rays pass through all of the object and are strongly absorbed so that their intensity ( recorded at the centre of the detector ) is low , while others pass through less of the object and are less strongly absorbed .
Effectively the object casts a shadow of the X - rays and from this we can work out its basic dimensions .
We illustrate this below .
The intensity of the X - ray where it hits the detector depends on the width of object and the length of the path travelled both through the object and the air .
This graph shows the intensity of the rays as they hit the detector .
Rays that travel through the full width of the object have lowest intensity , as we can see from the dip in the middle of the graph .
Rays that just miss the body have the highest intensity , because of all rays that are not absorbed they travel the shortest distance .
This is reflected by the two spikes of the graph .
Towards the edges the graph falls off , reflecting the fact that the corresponding rays have travelled a comparatively long distance .
Can we find the function if we know the function ?
Listen to our podcast on the Fourier transform .
However , the secret to computerised axial tomography is to find out much more about the nature of the object than just its dimensions , by looking at the attenuation of as many X - rays as possible .
To do this , we need to think of a number of X - rays at different anglesand distancesfrom the centre of the object .
A typical such X - ray is illustrated below .
This X - Ray will pass through a series of pointsat which the optical density is .
Using the equation for a straight line these points are given bywhereis the distance along the X-ray .
In this case we now havewhere The functionis called the Radon transform of the function .
The largeris , the more an X - ray of this particular orientation is absorbed .
This transformation lies at the heart of the CAT scanners and all problems in tomography .
It was first studied by Johann Radon in 1917 .
( Radon is also famous for some very important discoveries related to the branch of mathematics called measure theory , which is the basis of integration . )
By measuring the attenuation of the X - rays from as many angles as possible , it is possible to measure this function to a high accuracy .
The big question of mathematical tomography is then the problem of inverting the Radon transform , in other words Incidentally , this is exactly the same problem faced by our milk deliverer in the previous section .
The short answer to this question is YES , provided that we can make enough accurate measurements .
A complete explanation of this , together with a quick way of calculating , is given in this section ( for the brave ) .
However , a quick motivation will be given by the following example .
In the two figures below we see on the left a square and on the right its Radon transform in which the large values ofare shown as darker points .
The key point to note in these two images is that the four straight lines making up the sides of the square show up as points of high intensity ( arrowed ) in the Radon transform .
The arrowed points give both the orientation of the lines and their distances from the centre of the square .
The reasons that lines give large values forat certain points is that an X - ray passing straight through a line is strongly absorbed , whereas one which misses it , even slightly , is hardly absorbed at all .
Basically the Radon transform is good at finding straight lines in an image .
One method for finding , called the filtered back projection algorithm , works ( roughly ) by assuming that the original image is made up of straight lines and drawing those corresponding to the high values of .
This method is fast but not particularly accurate .
However , it is possible to find accurately and quickly , and algorithms to do this are implemented in the scanning devices .
The original development of such devices uses a mathematical object known as Fourier transform to invert Radon transforms .
If you 're up for some serious maths , read the section on how this is done .
Most of the maths here is university level , but the section contains some lovely mathematical ideas .
Tomography has many applications quite different from those in medicine .
An interesting example comes from archaeology , where tomography was used to determine the cause of Tutankhamen 's death .
A CAT scan of the mummy revealed a swelling in the knee , indicating that death was the result of a massive infection .
The cause of this was probably an injury inflicted by a fall .
Whether Tutankhamen was pushed or fell by accident , however , will have to remain a mystery which even a CAT scanner cannot solve .
More generally , we can apply tomography to any problem where we have information about the average of a function along a straight line .
It can also be used to find evidence for straight lines in an image ( such as the edge of an object ) .
We will now describe two examples of how tomography is used .
Tomography , GPS and how to land an aircraft safely
Orbiting the Earth are a large number of GPS satellites that are transmitting radio signals down to the ground .
If you can detect the signals and find the phase difference between the signals from several different satellites , then you can work out your location with a high degree of accuracy .
GPS positioning methods are very widely used by aircraft navigation systems , SATNAV devices and hikers .
However , one of the problems with this system is that variations in the ionosphere ( the upper part of the Earth 's atmosphere ) can affect the radio signals and change their phase by small amounts .
This phase change can lead to errors in the position given by the GPS system .
These are not very large and are perfectly acceptable for navigating .
However , when landing an aeroplane it is vital that its height is known to very high precision and even small GPS errors can have large consequences .
Here an accurate understanding of the state of the ionosphere is essential .
There are many other reasons why understanding the ionosphere is important .
Chief amongst these is that fact that the ionosphere has a very significant effect on the propagation of radio waves and on communication in general .
Roughly speaking , radio waves can bounce off the ionosphere , greatly increasing the range of a radio transmitter .
Remarkably , it is possible to monitor the state of the ionosphere using tomography .
In the problem of imaging a patient we shone X - rays through their body .
To image the ionosphere we use the transmissions from the GPS satellites .
These form a very convenient set of " straight lines " passing through the ionosphere .
The paths that they take are shown in the figure below .
The phase of the radio waves is affected by the electron content of the atmosphere , so that the total change in the phase is proportional to the integral of the electron density along the ray path .
If we can measure these phase changes , then we can estimate the electron density integrals and work out the Radon transform of the electron density .
We seem to be in exactly the same situation as in the medical imaging problem and hence able to work out the electron density at any point in the atmosphere .
Well , not quite .
There are two big differences between this problem and the CAT problem .
Firstly , the satellites are usually moving relative to the Earth .
Secondly , there are large parts of the Earth 's surface where we cannot make any measurements .
These include the oceans , where there are no receivers for the satellite signals , and the poles , which do not have satellites orbiting above them .
Thus we have a lot less information than we had in the case of the CAT scanner .
This means that we are often in the situation of the milk deliverer who could n't distinguish between two different arrangements of milk bottles , each of which led to the same set of measurements .
To get round this problem in the case of the ionosphere , we have to use a -priori information about the state of the ionosphere , or in other words a reasoned guess of what the solution should look like .
This will allow us to reject one solution which does n't look like this guess and to choose the solution which looks as much like the guess as possible .
Fortunately , we understand the physics of the ionosphere well enough for our reasoned guess to be pretty close to the truth .
By doing this ( together with some other clever refinements ) it is possible to use tomography to find the state of the ionosphere .
In the figures below we illustrate a calculation ( using the MIDAS software developed at the University of Bath ) of an ionospheric storm ( in red ) developing over the southern part of the USA .
Detecting land - mines
Can you find the three trip - wires hidden in this image ?
Anti-personnel land - mines are one of the nastiest aspects of the modern warfare .
They are typically triggered by almost invisible trip - wires attached to the detonators .
Any algorithm for the detection of trip - wires must work quickly and not get confused by the leaves and foliage that obscure the wire .
An example of the problem that such an algorithm has to face is given in the figure below , in which some trip - wires are hidden in an artificial jungle .
Finding trip - wires involves finding partly obscured straight lines in an image .
Fortunately , just such a method exists ; it is the Radon transform !
For the problem of finding the trip - wires we do n't need to find the inverse , instead we can apply the Radon transform directly to the image .
Of course life is n't quite as simple as this for real images of trip - wires , and some extra work has to be done to detect them .
In order to apply the Radon transform the image must first be pre-processed to enhance any edges .
Following the application of the transform to the enhanced image a threshold must then be applied to the resulting values to distinguish between true straight lines caused by trip - wires ( corresponding to large values of R ) and false lines caused by short leaf stems ( for which R is not quite as large ) .
Following a sequence of calibration calculations and analytical estimates with a number of different images , it is possible to derive a fast algorithm which detects the trip - wires by first filtering the image , then applying the Radon transform , then applying a threshold and then applying the inverse Radon transform .
The result of applying this method to the previous image is given on the left , with the three detected trip - wires are highlighted .
Note how the method has not only detected the trip - wires , but , from the width of the lines , an indication is given of the reliability of the calculation .
Maths truly does save lives !

…. the ( way ) the Occupation ( undermines the ) IDF ’s human character and ( exposes ) the corruption of the entire Israeli society .
We …. know that the Territories are not Israel , and that all settlements are bound to be evacuated in the end .
We hereby declare that we shall not continue to fight this War of the Settlements .
We shall not continue to fight beyond the 1967 borders to dominate , expel , starve and humiliate an entire people .
We hereby declare that we shall continue serving the Israel Defense Forces in any mission that serves Israel ’s defense .
The missions of occupation and oppression do not serve this purpose – and we shall take no part in them . ”
These are courageous men and some women , hundreds of them .
Their “ Courage to Refuse – Combatant ’s Letter ” web site lists 550 by name .
There are hundreds more as well .
Their numbers are growing , and their resistance is firm .
There are five separate refusenik groups .
They ’re listed below .
Courage to Refuse is one of them .
Yesh Gvul ( There is A Limit )
Yesh Gvul combats the “ misuse of the IDF for unworthy ends ” that includes the occupation of Palestine .
It was established during Israel ’s 1982 Lebanon invasion that they denounced as a “ naked ( act of ) aggression in which they wanted no part . ”
It supports imprisoned members and their families , holds vigils where they ’re held , informs the public of their status , and embraces a peace agenda .
They state that “ as responsible citizens ( they ) declare that ( they ) will take no part in the continued oppression of the Palestinian people ( nor will they ) participate in policing actions or in guarding the settlements . ”
They further say that as “ an Israeli peace group ” they oppose the occupation and support soldiers who refuse to be part of it .
They call the Israeli army ’s role “ brutal ” and “ subjugating . ”
It places servicemen “ in a grave and moral and political dilemma ( because it requires them ) to enforce policies they deem illegal , immoral and ultimately harmful to Israeli interests . ”
Many of their members are combat officers , they ’ve served with distinction , and they rank from sergeant to major .
They hold different political views , support peace but no one specific program , and they back a “ two - state ” solution they believe is “ key to ( peacefully resolving ) the Israeli- Palestinian conflict . ”
The Shministim
The Shministim is made up of high school seniors approaching age 18 after which Jewish and Druze men and women face mandatory military service , except for exemptions on religious , health and other accepted grounds .
The organization no longer maintains a web site .
Courage to Refuse ( The Combatants Letter )
The organization was founded in 2002 by a group of 50 combat officers and soldiers after its members realized that their missions had nothing to do with defending Israel .
They ’re to colonize Palestine and oppress its people .
They further believe that many commands issued them harm Israel ’s strategic interests and they refuse to obey them .
They ’ve served their country and support it , but they determined that “ fighting in Gaza and … .
West Bank ( was counterproductive ) : by obeying orders they would not be protecting the lives of their dear ones . ”
They believe “ the Occupation poses a threat to the security of Israel . ”
They stated their beliefs openly in “ The Combatant ’s Letter . ”
Hundreds of IDF members signed it and joined “ Courage to Refuse . ”
New members join weekly , and Yaffee Center for Strategic Studies surveys show that over 25 % of Israelis sympathize with their struggle .
They continue to perform reserve duty , but wo n’t serve in the Occupied Territories .
Over 280 of them have been court - martialed and jailed for up to 35 days .
Yet they ’ve “ won a warm place for the movement in the hearts of many Israelis ” who support their self - sacrifice and willingness to be imprisoned for their beliefs .
Hundreds of Israeli professors signed petitions for them .
Sami Michael is acting chairman of the Israeli Association for Human Rights .
He said that refusing the occupation is not just a moral act , it ’s the purest form of patriotism in Israel today .
Their reasons for not serving are stated above .
The Pilots Group
The Pilots Group maintains a web site in Hebrew only , so it ca n’t be monitored by non-Hebrew readers .
In September 2003 , 27 of their members ( including reserve Brigadier General Yiftah Spector ) published their statement for the first time .
It declared they would no longer fly missions against West Bank and Gaza civilians , that doing so is illegal and immoral , and they denounced targeted assassinations .
On Israeli television , one pilot said : “ We veteran pilots and active pilots alike ….are opposed to carrying out illegal and immoral attacks , of the type carried out by Israel in the Territories .
We ….love the State of Israel ( but ) refuse to take part in air force attacks in civilian populations centers .
We refuse to continue harming innocent civilians . ”
They knew they could be punished for their stance and for their “ illegitimate ” and “ forbidden ” statement , according to Israel ’s chief of army staff , Moshe Ya’alon .
Israeli Air Force ( IAF ) chief Dan Halutz downplayed their action , said announcing it on national television was “ inappropriate , ” and called it “ the mother of all dangers to our people . ”
Because of it , they were expelled from the IAF , denounced as traitors , and went public again two months later to explain further .
One captain ’s comment was typical : “ In the beginning , we were pilots who believed our country would do all it could to achieve peace .
We believed in the purity of our arms and that we did all we could to protect unnecessary loss of life .
Somewhere in the last few years it became harder and harder to believe that is the case . ”
A single incident changed them .
It was the bombing of Hamas military leader Salah Shehade ’s home that killed him and 14 members of his family , nine of whom were children .
One pilot called it “ murder , ” another “ state terrorism , ” still another “ vengeance , ” and all agreed they could no longer perform these missions .
Lt. Colonel Avner Raanan was one of them .
He ’s one of Israel ’s most respected and decorated pilots .
He signed the letter and stated : “ If you look at the past three years , you see that , if we had a suicide bombing , the Israeli air force made a big operation in which civilians were killed , and that looks to innocent eyes like revenge .
You hear it in the streets of Israel ; people want revenge .
But we should not behave like that .
We are not a mafia . ”
Referring to an attack on Gaza ’s Nuseirat refugee camp , another pilot added : “ Is it legitimate to take F - 15s and helicopters designed to destroy enemy tanks , and use them against cars and houses in one of the most heavily populated places in the world …. we have become blinded by the blood on our own faces .
We can not see that on the other side ….is a whole nation of innocent people . ”
The pilots ’ action and statements shook Israeli society .
Their superiors condemned them , but over 500 supportive letters disagreed , including one from a holocaust survivor and others from fellow pilots .
In addition , former left wing cabinet ministers also praised their courage .
Sayeret Matkal
This is an elite IDF commando unit that maintains no web site .
In December 2003 , 13 of its reservists and officers ( including one major ) wrote the Prime Minister declaring their refusal to serve henceforth in the Territories .
Their statement read : “ We say to you today , we will no longer give our hands to the oppressive reign in the territories and the denial of human rights to millions of Palestinians , and we will no longer serve as a defensive shield for the settlement enterprise . ”
Members of this commando group carried out the 1976 Entebbe , Uganda airport raid that rescued 100 hostages on an Air France hijacked plane .
They rarely serve in the Territories , but their announcement was significant because of the group ’s standing in Israeli society .
Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak once commanded them and led a raid against a 1972 hijacked Sabena plane at Tel Aviv airport .
He asked the signers to reconsider , called their letter a grave mistake , and said “ it ’s not too late to correct it …. ”
Other officials also condemned them , but Meretz Knesset Member ( MK ) Roman Bronfman believed they acted bravely , and Labor MK Ophir Pines said it requires that serious discussion be held .
In May 2004 , Haaretz journalist Gideon Levy was supportive .
He urged more soldiers to speak out , discuss their actions in the Territories , and ask why they serve there “ to protect groups of delusional settlers ( and ) what their systematic abuse of the Palestinians has to do with security …. how many innocent people ( have ) they killed and ( keep on ) killing . ”
He noted that Israelis do n’t know what goes on in the Territories , so it ’s up to soldiers to “ lift this screen … .
The Palestinians are n’t believed , the Israeli press ( keeps ) its distance from the Territories and the international press is perceived as hostile .
Only the soldiers can break the vicious circle … .
No one ( can ) deny their accounts ….it ’s time ( for them ) to stand up and speak out ….how they killed and jailed and humiliated for no good reason . ”
Excerpts From Soldiers Breaking the Silence
Breaking the Silence ( Shovrim Shtika ) dedicates itself to two purposes :
— exposing IDF oppression in occupied Palestine ; and
— providing discharged Israeli soldiers and reservists a platform to explain what they were ordered to do on the ground .
In their own words , hundreds of their testimonies tell shocking stories – the ordeal they faced , its moral price , and the corrupting erosion it had on their values .
They focus on orders gotten , rules of engagement and operational procedures that include frequent illegal commands :
— firing at civilians posing no risk ; — revenge operations for collective punishment ; and — intentionally attacking Palestinian rescue forces , including ambulances .
Their accounts are disturbing .
They portray institutionalized moral corruption , universal contempt for Arabs , and how it affects everyone from new recruits to commanders .
Rules of engagement are unrestrained , government oversight is non-existent , so reporting abuse is urgent .
They want it stopped and demand an independent body to do it .
It goes on everywhere in occupied Palestine with Hebron a prominent example because it ’s the only Palestinian city with an Israeli settlement in its center .
Sixty - four soldiers from the Nachal brigade spoke out , they were there during the Second Intifada , and their testimonies recount horrors on the ground they were ordered to commit .
They call their experiences “ shocking ” with photos for confirming evidence .
Their collective statement says : “ In coping daily with the madness of Hebron , we could n’t remain the same people beneath our uniforms .
We saw our buddies and ourselves slowly changing ….
We were exposed to the ugly face of terror …. an innocent family killed while at the Sabbath table .
Countless engagements , bereaved families , innocent civilians injured , chase and arrests .
The settlers ….rioted , occupied houses , and confronted the police and army … .
The constant curfew made Hebron into a ghost town … .
The school in Jebl Ju’ar has been an army post … .
We asked ourselves why an army platoon prevents children from going to school .
We found no answers .
We decided to speak out …. to tell ….
Hebron is n’t in outer space ….
But it ’s light years away from Tel Aviv … .
Come , see , hear and understand what ’s happening there . ”
Here are more paraphrased comments :
We man checkpoints , stop people from going somewhere , humiliate them , but “ I ’m doing my duty ( and ) inflicting pain on people , harming them unnecessarily . ”
It affects your mind , your sleep the longer you serve there .
Jews do as they please .
There are no laws .
Anything goes , breaking into shops , occupying Palestinian homes .
Your judgment gets impaired when everyday your enemy is an Arab .
You do n’t look at them as people .
But they ’re not dogs , not animals , not inferior , yet they simply do n’t count , and since they ’re your enemy you can kill them .
At checkpoints , our job was do n’t let them pass .
It was absurd , there were old ladies who had to get through to go home .
Why was it forbidden to pass ?
It was collective punishment .
“ You ’re not allowed to pass because you ’re not allowed to pass . ”
Then there are the curfews .
“ I ’m certain that 80 % of the time there was a curfew . ”
We closed all the stores and sent everyone home .
I ’m ashamed of myself because I realized I enjoy the feeling of power .
I ’m the Law .
It ’s a mighty feeling .
It ’s because you have a weapon , because you ’re a soldier , it ’s addictive .
You can do whatever you want , unsupervised , enter people ’s homes , conduct random searches .
Tell them what you want and they ’ll do it because they ’re afraid .
Palestinians feel you do n’t let them walk in the streets , work , live or breathe .
I have a machine gun , it ’s loaded , the safety catch is off .
I can shoot you any time , for any reason , split your head open with the gun butt and my commander will pat me on the back and say good job .
It ’s crazy , I ’m just a kid , but Hebron hardens you .
I say to myself I ’m doing something I do n’t believe in , and I ’m putting myself in a position where someone wants to kill me because of it .
You see things that could n’t possibly happen in your own home and should n’t happen .
But here everything is different .
Any time of day or night , whenever we feel like it , we pick a house , any house , and we go in .
We move all the men into one room , the women in another , and place them under guard .
We can do whatever we want .
There ’s no justification for it .
It should n’t be happening .
Then there are the settlers .
They run wild .
There ’s no law .
They do what they please .
So they burn another shop , trash another home , occupy another one , no big deal , happens all the time .
We just watch and do nothing .
If someone is sick and needs to go to the hospital , I ask my commander if I can let her pass .
No way if there ’s a curfew .
She ’s not going anywhere no matter how sick .
All these stories are my daily routine for over six months .
When it ended , I questioned whether I protected myself or my country .
I began watching out for myself because I did n’t believe in the ideology .
Serving in Hebron made me feel there ’s something different about being a Jew .
I ca n’t explain it .
I ’m supposed to guard the settlers who do n’t have the kind of morality I was raised to believe .
I reached a point where I did n’t know who the enemy was anymore , Jews or Arabs .
Maybe I need to protect the Arabs , not the Jews who attack them .
I feel emotionally injured .
If someone ’s caught breaking curfew , we can let them have it aggressively .
Hold them , make them wait eight hours with no water , sit and wait .
“ Why ?
Because he walked outside .
Because he dared go buy something .
Because he dared send his kid to school . ”
We can even shoot them .
Selected Israeli Organizations Supporting Refuseniks
Several important ones are covered below :
New Profile
New Profile is a pluralistic feminist organization that includes men and women .
It ’s goal is to transform Israel from a militaristic to a civil society .
It opposes occupation and supports all conscientious objectors – from pacifists opposed to war to refuseniks who wo n’t serve in occupied Palestine .
Its charter states that “ Israel is capable of a determined peace politics .
It need not be a militarized society . ”
It understands that “ the words ‘ national security ’ have often masked calculated decisions to choose military action for the achievement of political goals . ”
It no longer is “ willing to take part in such choices .
We are no longer willing to go on being mobilized , raising our children for mobilization …. while those in charge of the country go on deploying the army easily , rather than building other solutions . ”
It ’s “ hard to express this type opinion in Israel today … .
An attitude that dares question the fundamental principle of willing enlistment is almost incomprehensible in a soldiers ’ state . ”
We reject perpetuating war .
We prioritize and protect life .
“ We oppose the use of the army , police , ( and ) security forces in the ongoing oppression and discrimination of the Palestinian citizens of Israel ( and in the Occupied Territories ) , ” in demolishing their homes , “ denying them building and development rights , ( and ) using violence ” against them .
Thousands of young Israelis are opting out and refuse to serve .
They reject military service in Israel today .
The IDF states that only one - third of reserve forces in fact serve actively .
Israeli law does n’t recognize conscientious objection .
“ We regard Israeli conscription law as discriminatory and non-democratic , and call for ” recognizing every person ’s right to act according to his or her conscience .
They should have the right to fulfill their social commitment by alternative civic or community means , including through non-governmental , voluntary organizations .
The Refuser Solidarity Network ( RSN )
It was founded in 2002 to support Israel ’s growing “ Refuser Movement . ” RSN supports Courage to Refuse , Combatants for Peace , Yesh G’vul , the Shiministim , New Profile and other Israeli organizations advocating peaceful conflict resolution in Occupied Palestine .
Its original 2002 “ Call to Action ” declaration said : “ The time has come ” to act against growing violence .
Increasing numbers of Israeli soldiers reject serving in Occupied Palestine .
They ’ve seen what goes on , it has nothing to do with security , and its sole purpose is “ perpetuating our control over the Palestinian people . ”
They now declare they no longer will help “ dominate , expel , starve and humiliate an entire people . ”
The time has come “ to listen to our consciences , ” summon our courage , and publicly support them .
Israel can never have peace and security unless it withdraws from Occupied Palestine .
This is a “ crucial moment , a potential turning point . ”
Their campaign was initiated from Chicago , but it resonates across the country as a “ portal ” in support of the Refuser Movement in Israel .
Combatants for Peace
Former Palestinian and Israeli cycle of violence participants are the founders – IDF soldiers and Palestinian resistance fighters .
They believe their actions were futile , decided another way is crucial , and now work together for peace .
Henceforth , they “ refuse to take part ( in further ) bloodletting . ”
They will only act non-violently through dialogue and reconciliation and work together cooperatively to understand each other ’s aspirations .
Their goal – end the occupation , halt the settlement project , and establish a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem alongside the State of Israel .
They want to raise consciousness , educate both sides , and create political pressure to establish a constructive dialogue for resolution .
They hold meetings , conduct educational lectures and public forums , undertake joint projects , have bi-national media teams to get out their message , and participate in non-violent demonstrations against the occupation .
It ’s motto reads : “ Only by joining forces , will we be able to end the cycle of violence . ”
Israeli Laws Affecting Conscientious Objection and Refuseniks
Conscription existed since Israel became a state in 1948 .
Today , its legal basis comes under the country ’s 1986 National Defence Service Law .
It requires all Israeli citizens and permanent residents ( men and women ) to serve .
However , the Ministry of Defence has discretion under Article 36 to exempt all non-Jews , except the Druze .
Israeli Arabs may volunteer , but they ’re not encouraged , and very few do it .
Reserve service is also required up to age 51 for men and 24 for women .
Exemptions are possible for reasons of :
— educational requirements ,
— religion ( orthodox Jews are exempted ) ,
— health ,
— family considerations ,
— married or pregnant women or those with children ,
— persons convicted of crimes ,
— the undereducated ( until they complete at least eight years of school ) , and
— other considerations at the Ministry of Defence ’s discretion .
Israeli law rejects conscientious objection rights for men and only partly accepts them for women on the basis of religion .
Those who cite it and refuse to serve are in trouble .
They ’re subjected to unfair procedures and hearings that may , and most often do , recommend prosecution and imprisonment .
Israel signed the United Nations Charter and must , under its provisions , comply with the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
Its Article 18 guarantees everyone “ the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion . ”
So does the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under Article 18 where it repeats that “ Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion … ”
By denying refuseniks this right , Israel violates international law and a fundamental human right afforded everyone under it .
No official figures exist , but refusenik numbers have grown since the Second Intifada began in September 2000 .
Most opt out in the Territories , and estimates of their numbers range from 1100 well - documented cases to as many as double that number .
Here ’s what they face .
Article 35 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the National Defence Service Law states that :
— failure to fulfill a duty under the law is punishable by up to two years imprisonment ;
— evading military service is subject to five years in prison ;
— refusing to perform reserve duties calls for up to a 56 day sentence that ’s renewable if the objector refuses repeatedly ;
— helping someone avoid military service is punishable by a fine and up to two years in prison ;
— disobeying call - up orders means facing up to five years imprisonment , although most often sentences rarely exceed 12 months .
Refuseniks are generally sentenced on one of the following charges :
— refusing to obey an order ;
— absence without leave ;
— desertion ; or
— refusing to be mobilized .
Where exemption applications are denied , individuals are ordered to perform military or reserve duty .
Continued refusal can mean discipline or court - martial , and repeat offenders face re-imprisonment in violation of Article 14 , paragraph 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
It states : “ No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again for an offence for which he ( or she ) has already been finally convicted or acquitted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of each country . ”
Summary Comments
Peace activists , people of conscience and most notably Israeli refuseniks are in the front lines of a valiant struggle :
— to free Palestinians from 41 illegal occupation years ,
— end decades of abuse ,
— achieve a just and lasting peace , and
— protect everyone ’s fundamental human rights and freedoms that are guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for “ all members of the human family … . ”
Israel must no longer be exempted from international law , from being allowed to flaunt it brazenly , from ignoring over five dozen UN Resolutions going back decades .
Peace activists and refuseniks condemn the Jewish state for its actions , deplore it for committing them , and demand , call on and insist Israeli governments end them .
Its lawlessness must end , and collective resistance can achieve it .
It ’s no longer an option .
It ’s an obligation to assure that everyone has equal dignity and the right to life , liberty , security and freedom under universal international law .
May 14 is the 60th anniversary of Israel ’s founding .
Commemorations there and in the West will celebrate it .
People of conscience wo n’t participate .
Refuseniks may not either .
Use this time to demand an illegal occupation end and that Israel no longer be allowed a pass on the international law it disdains .

Our Reign Of Terror ( Israeli soldiers speak out )
Brandy au naturel , from her Web site brandysmassage.com .
I 'll be out of pocket for the next couple of days , and so will not be able to blog as normal .
There will be some catching up to do Monday , on the new Cave Creek raid and the series on Joe in the East Valley Tribune .
Interesting video the Trib has online .
Joe looks like a geriatric gangster , and PR flack Lisa Allen [ formerly Lisa Allen MacPherson ] , his past - her - prime gun moll .
I have n't had a chance to watch it all or read it all , so I 'll reserve judgment until I can .
I have a bit of nativist nuttiness for you in the meanwhile , a member of United for a Sovereign America and stalwart supporter of Sheriff Joe by the name of Brandy Baron .
A regular at anti-immigrant protests around town , Baron is a masseuse by trade , a practitioner of the art of the sensual touch , and though she strictly states on her Web site Brandysmassage.com that she will not perform any act of a sexual nature , she does offer " tandem " massages with an equally adipose skin - buffer by the name of Taylor .
Brandy is available by appointment at A Touch of Heaven Massage , which she 's informed me in the past that she owns .
The trade name is registered with the Arizona Secretary of State under the name Frank Baron , but the " Whois " for TOH 's Web site lists " Brandy Baron " as the contact person .
Interestingly , two of her fellow masseuses , Angie and Nicole , have elected to have their faces blurred out online .
Do n't know why these gals would be so shy .
Especially since the business '
Web site features a disclaimer , which says ,
" Anything of a sexual nature regarding massage is illegal so please do n't ask us to discuss it with you .
Rest assured you will have a pleasurable as well as relaxing experience with us . "
Barron writes on her blog that she 's of Hispanic descent , and is also firmly against any illegal immigration .
She 's particularly bitchy about immigration from Mexico ( Canadians are apparently a - OK ) , and she claims she wants all of the nation 's immigration laws enforced .
She frequently can be found demonstrating up at the Macehualli Work Center in north Phoenix as part of U.S.A.'s ongoing harassment of that day - laborer site .
Baron is intelligent enough , and though we disagree on many subjects , we agree on some others , such as the legalization of prostitution , which she advocates .
Indeed , in a blog called " BBW Brandy 's Blog , " on the site escortblogs.com , Baron writes about the differences between street hookers and the higher end of the trade .
" I do n't think that there is any more special service that can be offered to another person than pleasure , " blogs Baron in a 2005 post .
" Most outside of the profession think that it 's all about sex and money .
Those same people usually think of anything sexual between unmarried people as being dirty .
They have no idea how much caring , compassion and nurturing goes into providing intimacy .
A good provider offers herself as a companion which is far more than just a sex toy .
I have no respect or regard for those people who cheapen the profession by standing on street corners .
They are the main reason that so many have such a low opinion of sex work .
THEY are the ones that always get seen !
A good professional is very discreet for everyone 's protection . "
I had a little confab with her on this a while back , at the state Democratic convention , no less .
I was there reporting , and she was there doing a little observing for her camp .
Her adult daughter was with her , as were a couple of other nativists .
Below 's a sampling of the give and take from the impromptu interview I did with her .
I should state that I actually like Brandy as a person .
I 've found both her and her daughter to be civil with me , unlike most other U.S.A. members , such as alleged public urinator Buffalo Rick Galeener , Craig Tillman and others .
I think it 's hypocritical of her to be for the enforcement of all laws , save for those having to do with the world 's oldest profession .
But one 's own hypocrisy is always the easiest to justify , right , Brandy ?
Do you really believe in enforcing the law , BTW , Brandy ?
Brandy Baron : Absolutely .
Prostitution laws ?
BB : Absolutely .
You did n't say that on your blog .
BB : I would never -- I support prostitution .
I know .
I 'm all for it too , but it 's against the law .
Just like illegal immigration .
What 's the difference ?
BB : There is a big difference , because it is a victimless crime .
I do n't know .
Do you think the people at U.S.A. would agree with you about that ?
BB : Probably .
They know I do massage .
But you do n't give happy endings , do you ?
BB : Hell no .
Have you ever given a happy ending ?
BB : Absolutely not .
Not that there 's anything wrong with that .
Brandy 's daughter :
You 've got to get your action somewhere .
Yeah , at your mom 's massage parlor , maybe ...
Why are their faces blurred out ?
Why would they do that if what they 're doing is completely legal ?
BB : That 's their choice .
Hey , Sheriff Joe 's been in my place .
[ NB : As you can see in the following , she does n't seem to mean Joe 's been there in person , only that deputies have inspected the place . ]
Really ?
BB : He checked on it , when he was doing his sweeps .
He had his people in there checking us out too .
Just like everyone else .
But not personally , I 'll bet .
BB : I 've never ever had a problem .
We 've have vice in there .
You think he can get it up ?
BB : I have no idea what Sheriff Joe can do in the sack .
I 'm really not interested .
All I want him to do is get the illegals out .
But you know it 's not a cafeteria .
If you want all the laws enforced , then that 's a law too .
BB : But it 's not a federal offense .
Illegal immigration 's a federal offense .
A misdemeanor , only if they catch you crossing the border illegally .
Jaywalking is a misdemeanor .
Cranky old nativist dood :
You turn everything around , and you 're stupid .
Yeah , I 'm so stupid , I do n't have ( neo - Nazi and U.S.A. member ) Elton Hall as a problem .
Cranky old nativist dood : Elton 's my friend .
Well if he 's your friend , why are you so worried about him .
Why are you devoting whole meetings to him ?
Cranky old nativist dood : I was n't there at the time , but he 's my friend .
So you 've got no problem with neo -Nazis ?
BB : If it 's good enough for the pope , it 's good enough for us .
The pope was in the Hitler youth .
It 's a little different .
Elton has told you he will not renounce anything he 's done or believes in .
BB : I respect that .
Absolutely .
You respect the fact he 's a neo - Nazi ?
He 's still a neo -Nazi .
Pause .
Anyway , I do n't see the difference between supporting illegal aliens and supporting illegal prostitutes .
BB : There 's a big difference .
What is it ?
BB : We 're not taking anyone 's job away .
Nobody is having to support them with their tax dollars .
Do you check anyone 's I.D. when they 're in your massage parlor ?
BB : Why would I ask for anybody 's I.D. ?
You could be giving a massage to an illegal alien .
BB : If they can't speak English , they do n't get into our place .
Hi , my name is Donnie and welcome to my blog .
I , like a lot of you , have recently felt the need to find a place to vent my thoughts .
I needed a place to talk about my feeling and obsessions that was somewhat private .
However , it makes much more sense to me to use this platform instead of a journal as that feels more like shouting into the void .
At least when I ’m writing on here there ’s a chance someone is listening .
But less on existential crises , and more on me !
I ’m in my mid 30s and I ’m slightly obsessed with planes .
I ’m actually even training to become a pilot .
I have n’t flown alone yet , however , I ’m moving quickly toward my goals .
When I ’m not flying or wasting away at a pretty regular 9 to 5 job , I ’m outdoors .
I ’ve always been a little bit of an adrenaline junky so I spend a lot of time riding mountain bikes and bombing hills on my longboard .
I ’m into the punk and indie music scene in Chicago .
Some of my favorite bands right now are Twin Peaks and Ratboys .
I grew up going to warped tour so naturally I have to talk about my superior music taste on the internet , haha !
Japanese fleet carrier Hiryu is seen shortly before the United States Navy sank it during the Battle of Midway .
Courtesy Kazutoshi Hando , U.S. Navy 1942 : Without ever sighting one another , Japanese and American task forces engage near the Midway Atoll , marking the turning point of the Pacific war and ringing down the curtain on the battleship as a dominant offensive naval weapon .
The Battle of Midway began only a month after the inconclusive Battle of the Coral Sea , which was the first time two opposing fleets slugged it out without making visual contact .
Airplanes , specifically the dive bomber and the torpedo plane , were the weapons that made this possible and changed the nature of war at sea .
As a result , aircraft carriers now emerged as the most important ships in the fleet , relegating other surface ships to carrier - escort and picket duty , and – in the case of the battleship and heavy cruiser – to shore bombardment in support of troop landings .
At Midway , the Japanese committed most of their fleet to the battle they believed would sweep the Americans from the seas , giving them time to consolidate their burgeoning Asian empire and extend their defensive perimeter into the central Pacific .
Four fleet carriers – Akagi , Kaga , Soryu and Hiryu – formed two strike forces intended to reduce the American fleet , which would then be destroyed by the battleships .
The American aircraft carriers , which were spared destruction at Pearl Harbor by being at sea that Dec. 7 , were the primary targets .
The success of the complex Japanese plan – devised by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , architect of the Pearl Harbor raid – rested on deception .
Because of this it was bound to failure before a shot was fired , since , unbeknownst to the Japanese , the Americans had broken their naval code and were able to anticipate Yamamoto 's every move .
Coupled with this was the fact that Japan 's own intelligence proved poor , underestimating the size of the American fleet , and particularly the number of aircraft carriers available to the enemy .
The battle lasted three - and - a - half days .
When it was over , all four Japanese carriers had been lost , a number of other surface ships had also been sunk or damaged , and many of the best air crews were dead .
The Americans lost the aircraft carrier Yorktown and a number of air crews , but were in far better shape than the Japanese to make good their losses .
The Imperial Japanese Navy was effectively broken at Midway .
Although it would remain a formidable force into 1944 , it was no longer a dominant one .

SSL / TLS ( HTTPS ) is critical to user security and privacy on the Internet .
In recent news about SSL / TLS certificates surf jacking , “ HTTPS : Surf jacking makes it vulnerable , ” and could lead to major issues for internet users .
It ’s required to have human intervention to validate the authenticity of certain types of certificates .
This was obvious when Mozilla changed how its newest Web browser ( Firefox 3 ) handles Web sites with expired or self - signed SSL / TLS certificates .
If you visit a Web site with either an expired or a self - signed SSL / TLS certificate , Firefox 3 will not show that page at all .
Instead , it will display an error message , similar to any other browser error ( for example a “ page not found ” 404 message ) .
This was by far a good call on Mozilla ’s part to force ecommerce sites to update or renew expired certificates .
How does the error occur ?
The error occurs because Mozilla has decided to take SSL / TLS Web page security to the next level , challenging any certificate that is n’t in the Web browser ’s certificate database , has incorrect information , or is expired .
This is a good thing ; it will make Web browsing and online commerce a great deal safer .
In order to understand why , let ’s take a quick look at the SSL / TLS process .
SSL / TLS process :
SSL / TLS consists of two important and independent processes : authentication and data stream encryption .
With today ’s tough Internet environment , it ’s vital to have strong encryption to protect the data packets as they travel to their destination .
Thank goodness , using a SSL / TLS VPN is secure and working properly .
Authentication is a digital certificate is a data file that contains information about the Web site ’s certificate holder and used to verify that the Web site is indeed what it portrays to be .
The Web server ’s host name , issue and expire time , and the public key for the Web server are just a few of the details contained in a certificate .
That ’s it in a nut shell !
Whatever you do , kids , do not steal a donut truck and try to drive that bad boy through Tama County , Iowa .
They will make it positively rain police on you .
Frank Alvarado found this out the hard way when he stole a donut van from a Donut Delite driver on his rounds , and ended up on a five - and - a - half - hour run from the law .
Alvarado stole the van from Rock Island Hospital in Illinois , and then took off into Iowa , getting to Tama County before he was spotted .
Before he could say " Sprinkles ! " , the donut thief was being pursued by five Tama County sheriff 's deputies , plus four more officers from three other police agencies .
And get this : one of those other officers came in his personal vehicle .
As we said , you don ' t mess with the donuts in Tama County .
Their reward for catching this criminal : all the donuts in the van .
Actually , we really want to get Mr. Alvarado 's side of the story in this , because who steals a donut (! ) truck and then hauls tail hundreds of miles west ?
Sounds like a Cannonball Run ... or something ...
But we feel like Franky " The Donuts " Alvarado is the key to a story even better than this one .

A right - wing extremist and pedophile , who wanted to secure a future for white children and kept explosives at his Yorkshire , England , flat , has been jailed for 16 years .
Thirty - one - year - old Martyn Gilleard from Goole was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of preparing terrorist acts and of collecting information useful for an act of terrorism .
He had pleaded guilty at earlier hearings to possessing live ammunition and 39,000 indecent images of children .
Federal researchers are using satellite photos of a national park in the western Arctic to show how climate change is prompting vegetation from southern Canada to creep into the tundra , possibly threatening the northern ecosystem .
As part of International Polar Year research , Ian Olthof and his team at the National Research Council in Ottawa are poring over thousands of satellite photos of Ivvavik National Park , which straddles the tree line west of Aklavik , N.W.T .
The satellite images are being compared to similar photographs taken of the park 20 years ago in order to see how vegetation normally found in southern climates is slowly invading the tundra .
" What we 're primarily seeing is that there is an increase in vegetation in northern Canada , " Olthof , who is with the council 's Canada Centre for Remote Sensing , told CBC News in an interview .
" Areas that were normally occupied by herbs , for example , are becoming occupied by shrubs .
We 're seeing a migration of the tree line northwards .
These sorts of changes have implications on wildlife and the people who depend on wildlife in the North . "
Olthof said his team also expects to see shrubs and herbs displacing non-vascular plants , such as lichens and mosses , that have long existed on the tundra .
The researchers paid a visit to the park itself last month for a closer view of the plants that are there .
They will feed all the satellite images into a computer , then spend this winter analyzing the data .
They hope to have some preliminary results within a year .
He warned that the migration of trees and plants such as willows and alders could have a disastrous effect on northern animals such as caribou .
" If the tundra disappears , then these wildlife populations will disappear as well , and the whole way of life that goes along with it , " he said .
In a tightly controlled dieting experiment , obese people lost an average of just 6 to 10 pounds over two years .
The study , published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , was supposed to determine which of three types of diets works best .
Instead , the results highlight the difficulty of weight loss and the fact that most diets do not work well .
The researchers followed 322 dieters , 277 men and 45 women .
The dieters were assigned to follow one of three types of diets  a diet with about 30 percent fat , based on American Heart Association guidelines ; a Mediterranean diet ; and a low - carbohydrate diet based on the Atkins diet plan .
The study was partly financed by the Atkins Research Foundation .
The trial was conducted at the Nuclear Research Center in Dimona , Israel , an isolated workplace that has its own medical department .
This means that we get a nice close up of the camera that is used , but strangely it does n’t appear to be the same as the ones that have been caught elsewhere in either Paris or London .
As has been widely rumoured , it ’s possible that this second car is separately collecting 3D imagery using a special laser camera ( which bounces off nearby objects to create a 3D map , onto which the street view imagery can be laid ) .
The two cars rather quickly split up though , so they were probably just setting off from the same place .
Of course , there ’s always the possibility that new 720° imagery is just round the corner !

If his controversial company exits the private security business , Blackwater president Gary Jackson wants you to know exactly who ’s to blame : “ If you could get it right , ” he told the AP , referring to the journalists covering Blackwater , “ we might stay in the business . ”
According to the AP , which recently visited the company ’s Moyock , North Carolina headquarters , Blackwater is planning to refocus its operations on aviation , logistics , and training , moving away from the security work that has earned the firm hundreds of millions of dollars in federal contracts since 9/11 .
“ The experience we ’ve had would certainly be a disincentive to any other companies that want to step in and put their entire business at risk , ” Erik Prince , the company ’s founder and CEO , told the wire service .
The company has been a magnet for controversy , the subject of negative news coverage , sustained congressional scrutiny , and activist outcry .
Its shoot - first - ask - questions - later rep has at times obscured the company ’s better deeds , such as when Blackwater operators swooped in to Kenya to rescue three young American women who ’d gotten stranded in a part of the country that had descended into violence .
But while Blackwater has at times served , unfairly , as a stand - in for all the security contractors working in Iraq and Afghanistan — some of them fly by night operations that you probably would n’t want protecting your local Target — and as the Left ’s favorite punching bag , its bitter experience in the protection field has more often than not been of its own making .
Blackwater operators have been at the center of a number of questionable incidents , culminating with last September ’s shooting in Baghdad ’s Nisour Square that left 17 civilians dead and more than 20 wounded .
( The episode remains under investigation by the FBI , and the Justice Department is mulling whether to bring charges . )
Its aviation branch , Presidential Airways , meanwhile , is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit filed by the widows of three American soldiers who died when one of its planes crashed in Afghanistan , after its pilot allegedly took the aircraft on a low altitude joyride through mountainous terrain .
( Adding to the controversy , Blackwater has attempted to derail the case by requesting that it be decided using Islamic , or Shari ’a , law . )
Then there ’s Blackwater ’s shadowy sister company , Greystone , which has scoured the Third World for discount soldiers to supplement its ranks , dealing with some unsavory characters along the way .
Despite all this , business remains good for Blackwater ( though profit margins industry - wide appear to be slimming ) .
Since last September , Presidential Airways has snagged at least three Pentagon contracts , worth close to $ 160 million , to provide its services in Afghanistan , Kyrgystan , Pakistan , and Uzbekistan , the latest of which was awarded in April .
And , this spring , even as the company remained under investigation in connection with the Nisour Square shooting , the State Department renewed Blackwater ’s lucrative contract to provide security to diplomats in Iraq .
If Blackwater does ease out of the protection biz , bad PR likely has little to with it .
While other of Blackwater ’s competitors have focused almost exclusively on security , Prince has anticipated the day when the security boom created by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan inevitably begins to dry up .
He has spent recent years diversifying his operations , branching out into manufacturing ( of , among other things , armored vehicles ) , testing the waters in the humanitarian aid sector , and opening a private intelligence firm that caters to corporate clients .
Security work currently makes up about 30 percent of Blackwater ’s business , but according Gary Jackson , “ If I could get it down to 2 percent or 1 percent , I would go there . ”
With headlines like this one in today ’s Washington Post — ” Iraq Points to Pullout in 2010 ″ — Prince and Jackson probably see the writing on the wall and are plotting a graceful exit strategy , though not necessarily a prompt one .
After the AP story went out on the wire , Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell told the Virginia - Pilot that the company is not leaving the security business — or Iraq — in the near term .
“ As long as we ’re asked , we ’ll do it , ” she said .

At a recent conference for some of the area 's leading neurologists , San Francisco physicist Norbert Schuff captured his colleagues ' attention when he presented colorful brain images of U.S. soldiers who had returned from Iraq and Afghanistan and were diagnosed with post - traumatic stress disorder .
The yellow areas , Schuff explained during his presentation at the city 's Veterans Affairs Medical Center , showed where the hippocampus , which plays major roles in short - term memory and emotions , had atrophied .
The red swatches marked hyperfusion - increased blood flow - in the prefrontal cortex , the region responsible for conflict resolution and decision - making .
Compared with a soldier without the affliction , the PTSD brain had lost 5 to 10 percent of its gray matter volume , indicating yet more neuron damage .
Schuff , who was dressed in a Hawaiian shirt just as colorful as the brain images he'd brought , reminded his colleagues that while his findings were preliminary and the trials ongoing , researchers were at least inching closer to finding the biological markers that distinguish a brain affected by PTSD .
As the technology of brain imaging improves and the resulting data are refined , doctors believe that one day they will be able to look at a computer screen and see PTSD as clearly as they now see a brain tumor .
" But we 're still in the infancy of neuroimaging , " Schuff cautioned later in his office .
" Do you get PTSD because you have a small hippocampus ?
Or does a small hippocampus mean you 'll develop PTSD ?
That , we still do n't know . "
Schuff 's research is at the forefront of a bold push by the Department of Defense to address PTSD , the psychological disorder that will haunt an estimated 30 percent of the veterans returning from the current two wars , according to the Pentagon .
Forty thousand veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan , Pentagon officials say , have already been diagnosed with PTSD , which is defined as an anxiety disorder triggered by exposure to traumatic events ; symptoms can include nightmares , flashbacks and panic attacks .
Left untreated , clinicians say , patients with PTSD are more likely to engage in anti-social behaviors such as alcohol and drug abuse .
The disorder , neurologists are now learning , can also lead to long - term maladies , such as Alzheimer 's and dementia .
Manhattan Project urgency
The quest is to understand how the disorder begins inside the brain .
The Defense Department has invested $ 78 million in San Francisco 's Northern California Institute for Research and Education at the VA center in the past four years , making it the largest VA research institute in the country and the only one that specializes in neuroscience .
With 200 researchers on staff , and an estimated 40 ongoing studies that rely on 60 to 80 veterans as research participants , the center has the urgency of a Manhattan Project site , this time searching for a way to end a mental health crisis .
The Department of Defense " has such a compelling need for these answers , " said Dr. Thomas Neylan , an associate professor of psychiatry at UCSF and director of the post - traumatic stress disorder program at the VA center .
" They want to know these answers now , which is the right approach .
We want the answers now ; people are still going off to the war , coming back , and a lot of them are suffering for a long time . "
The search for PTSD biological markers through brain imagining is the primary concern of five research centers in the country , including teams at Harvard and Emory universities .
Researchers believe that once the markers are defined , successful treatments can be developed .
Since 1995 , magnetic resonance imaging , or MRI , has been used to explore the brain through mostly black - and - white images with fuzzy resolution .
But in the past few years , advances in computer - imaging technology have enabled neurologists to detect the smallest changes in brain activity .
At the San Francisco VA center , thanks to the installment five years ago of a $ 4 million MRI machine called the 4T - T stands for Tesla , a unit of magnetic field - Schuff and his colleagues are now able to look into the brain at 1 millimeter resolution , in color and in 3 - D .
By contrast , Schuff said a 1.5T MRI machine could not register atrophy on PTSD brains .
But the 7T MRI machine that was installed at the UCSF Mission Bay campus last year can detect microscopic neuron damage that a 4T is incapable of " seeing . "
" With each stronger magnet , we get a finer view of what 's going on in the brain , " Neylan said .
These advances allow neurologists not only to further understand PTSD , but to study its relationship with brain trauma , one of the leading injuries incurred by soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars .
The effects of IEDs
At the VA conference , titled " The Brain at War : Neurocognitive Consequences of Combat , " Col. Karl Friedl , director of the U.S. Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center , explained why brain injuries have become more prevalent .
The main cause : the improvised explosive device , or IED , a homemade device that has become the enemy 's signature weapon .
While some well - armored soldiers were able to survive the IED blasts , incurring no outward signs of damage , they later complained of dizziness and " having their bell rung , " symptoms consistent with the lesser - known mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) .
As many as 150,000 troops have been diagnosed with brain injuries , the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force reported last year , but it 's unknown how many suffer from mTBI .
Mild brain injuries are less often diagnosed because soldiers often believe getting knocked around is part of the job .
But over time , with each successive mild brain injury , the effects can become more severe .
The link between mild brain trauma and PTSD is being studied at the VA center in San Francisco by Dr. Gary Abrams , whose preliminary studies show that the overlap between PTSD patients and sufferers of mild brain trauma injury " is tremendous . "
Abrams has yet to release definitive numbers .
During the next two years , Neylan expects the center will produce a few major findings in terms of possible treatments and advances in neuroimaging .
One of the outcomes of the advanced brain imaging could be a prescreen test for soldiers to detect brains already showing PTSD tendencies .
Neylan , who specializes in the role sleep plays in a healthy mind , is working on a study of police officers who are resistant to PTSD .
" We 're using this opportunity to also see why some people are able to walk away from these situations and live healthy lives , " he said , " and why others are not . "
Recent attempts to estimate frequency Iraq and Afghanistan :
The number of post - traumatic stress disorder cases is in dispute .
The Pentagon estimates 30 percent of veterans from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars will be diagnosed with PTSD .
Vietnam War : In 1988 , a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated the rate of Vietnam vets with PTSD at 14.7 percent .
But the 1990 National Vietnam Readjustment Study calculated the rate at 30.9 percent .
Both relied mainly on self - reporting .
In 2006 , a paper in the journal Science added to the debate by estimating the rate at 18.7 percent .
World War II : Though there was no official PTSD diagnosis until 1980 , after World War II the term " shell shock " was reported by veterans troubled by combat experiences .
Researchers such as Dr. Charles Marmar at the San Francisco VA center 's Northern California Institute for Research and Education estimate the number of WWII vets with PTSD is consistent with the 1 - in - 5 figures found in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. - Justin Berton

14 February 2001 --
The eminent barrister Horace Rumpole has often noted that the “ golden thread running through the history of British justice ” is that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty by the prosecution “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” .
Of course , Rumpole is a fictional character created by writer John Mortimer .
As the verdict handed down in the Lockerbie bombing trial proves , the “ golden thread ” is just as fictional .
On January 31 , the three Scottish lords sitting in judgement on the charges against two Libyans accused of planting the bomb that felled Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland on December 21 , 1988 , found Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi guilty of the murders of the 270 people killed in the disaster .
Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah was found not guilty .
The nine - month trial was held in the Netherlands and conducted according to Scottish law .
It was the result of an agreement between Libya and the US and British governments that finally allowed the trial — which had been stalled for almost five years by London 's and Washington 's insistence that the case be held in either the United States or Britain — to be heard in a “ neutral ” third country .
In their 82 - page judgement , the three judges found that , despite “ uncertainties and qualifications ” , “ there is nothing in the evidence which leaves us with any reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the first accused [ Megrahi ] ” .
According to the judges , the evidence showed that Megrahi , Libyan Arab Airlines ' security chief at Malta 's Luqa airport , had purchased items of clothing from a shop in Malta that were of the same brand and type as those that forensics experts had determined were in the Samsonite suitcase that contained the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103 .
From the presence of these brands and types of clothes in the suitcase , the judges inferred that Megrahi had somehow succeeded in having the “ item of baggage ” , unaccompanied by a passenger , transferred from Malta , via Frankfurt , to London 's Heathrow airport , where it was loaded onto the doomed aircraft .
The judges added that with “ other background circumstances ” — such as Megrahi 's previous ( and seemingly continuing ) service with Libya 's security organisation ( JSO ) , his “ association ” with the Swiss company that manufactured a type of timer which the prosecution claimed was attached to the bomb and “ his movements [ between Malta and Libya ] under a false name at or around the material time ” — “ a real and convincing pattern ” formed .
Unexpected
Ian Bell wrote in the Scottish Sunday Herald on February 4 , “ Last week you would have been hard - pressed to find an Edinburgh lawyer willing to bet on any guilty verdict being reached at Camp Zeist .
The same belief was evident , it is reported , in Whitehall . ”
Robert Black QC , the highly respected professor of Scottish law at Edinburgh University who in 1994 first suggested the plan for a third country trial , told the BBC on February 4 : “ This was a very , very weak circumstantial case .
I am absolutely astounded , astonished .
I was extremely reluctant to believe that any Scottish judge would convict anyone , even a Libyan , on the basis of such evidence . ”
Michael Scharf , a law professor at the New England School of Law , agreed , telling the February 2 New York Times : “ It sure does look like they bent over backwards to find a way to convict , and you have to assume the political context of the case influenced them . ”
Even some of the British relatives of the Lockerbie victims were sceptical : “ All we know from this trial is that one of the two was innocent .
I think we should be grateful ...
But we have our doubts about the guilt of Megrahi ” , Martin Cadman , whose son was killed in the disaster , told the February 2 London Independent .
Beyond reasonable doubt ?
The prosecution case , and the judges ' verdict , rested fundamentally on two points : it was Megrahi who purchased the clothes which were packed into the suitcase that contained the bomb , and that suitcase began its fateful journey in Malta rather than either Frankfurt airport or at Heathrow .
Yet , Megrahi was never positively identified as the man who purchased the clothing , the prosecution did not provide any physical or documentary evidence to link Megrahi to the suitcase or the bomb components , and no evidence was offered to prove that the suitcase began its journey in Malta , let alone that it was Megrahi who sent it on its way .
The guilty verdict hinged most on the testimony of Tony Gauci , the owner of the clothes shop in Malta .
In their judgement , the judges stated : “ We are nevertheless satisfied that his identification so far as it went of the first accused as the purchaser was reliable and should be treated as a highly important element in this case . ”
In their verdict , the judges described the torturous path Gauci's “ identification ” of Megrahi had taken .
The shopkeeper was first interviewed by police on September 1 , 1989 , and described the purchaser as being “ six feet or more ” in height and well - built .
On September 13 , he told police the man was about 50 years old .
Megrahi is five feet , eight inches tall , of medium - build and was 36 - years - old in December 1988 .
On September 14 , 1989 , Gauci was shown 19 photos and identified a man as being “ similar ” to the purchaser but added that the purchaser was 20 years older .
The man 's photo — who was not Megrahi — was included because police thought he resembled an artist 's impression and an identikit portrait based on Gauci 's description .
On September 26 , 1989 , Gauci viewed more photos and pointed out another man included at the suggestion of German police .
On August 31 , 1990 , Gauci was shown 24 photos and pointed out a man who , he said , had a face with a similar shape and style of hair to the purchaser .
It was not Megrahi .
On December 6 , 1989 , and again on September 10 , 1990 , Gauci was shown photos but did not identify anybody .
Included both times were photos of Abo Talb , a Palestinian jailed in Sweden in 1989 for terrorist bombings .
Yet , Gauci told the court that in late 1989 or early 1990 his brother had shown him a newspaper article about the Lockerbie disaster which included a photo of a man with the word “ bomber ” printed across it .
Gauci said he thought it was the man that bought the articles from him or that it resembled the person who bought the clothes from him .
The man was Abo Talb .
On February 15 , 1991 , police showed Gauci 12 photos .
Gauci told police that all the men in the photos were younger than the purchaser .
The police pressed Gauci to “ allow for any age difference ” and look again .
He pointed to a photo and said the man “ resembles the man who bought the clothing ... of all the photographs I have been shown , this photograph 8 is the only one really similar to the man who bought the clothing , if he is a bit older , other than the one my brother showed me [ of Abo Talb ] . ”
Photograph 8 was Megrahi's 1986 passport photo .
Towards the end of 1998 or the beginning of 1999 , Gauci approached police after he was shown a magazine article about the Lockerbie disaster which named Megrahi as a suspect .
He told police that the photo of Megrahi in the article “ looks like the man ” he sold clothes to .
On August 13 , Gauci picked out Megrahi from an identification parade with the words : “ Not exactly the man I saw in the shop .
Ten years ago I saw him , but the man who look a little bit like exactly [ sic ] is number 5 ” .
At the trial , Gauci pointed to Megrahi and said he “ resembles him a lot ” .
The defence lawyers protested that Gauci 's eventual , less than positive identification of Megrahi had taken place after the defendant 's photo had been in the world news for years .
In their verdict , the judges admitted that Gauci “ never made what could be described as an absolutely positive identification ” .
The judges defended their assessment of Gauci's “ identification ” with the incredible statement that , “ There are situations where a careful witness who will not commit himself beyond saying that there is a close resemblance can be regarded as more reliable and convincing in his identification than a witness who maintains that his identification is 100 % certain . ”
Gauci was also unclear as to when the items were purchased .
On the witness stand , he agreed the date was either November 23 or December 7 , 1988 .
The prosecution insisted it was December 7 and in the verdict , the judges did too .
However , in his statements to police and in his testimony at the trial Gauci said that it had been , or was , raining when the purchaser entered the shop .
The nearby Luqa airport 's chief meteorologist testified that it did not rain on December 7 , but did so on November 23 .
Interestingly , before the indictment of the two Libyans , the press reported that the police had stated that the clothing had been purchased on November 23 .
Why is this important ?
First , because Megrahi was in Malta on December 7 but investigators could find no evidence that he was there on November 23 , and second , because Abo Talb , who Gauci first identified as the purchaser , might have been .
Talb had visited Malta from Sweden in late October 1988 .
When he left on October 26 , he flew to Sweden on a return ticket valid for one month , raising the possibility could have returned .
Talb , who testified at the Lockerbie trial , could only prove he was in Sweden until November 10 and most of December , including on December 7 .
Talb presented no evidence to prove he was in Sweden after November 10 and before December 5 .
It is therefore possible that Talb entered Gauci 's shop on November 23 .
In December 1989 , it was reported in several major newspapers that Scottish police , in papers filed with the Swedish legal authorities , had named Talb as the suspect “ in the murder or participation in the murder of 270 people ” .
The judges , however , chose to declare that “ there is some support for Abo Talb when he said that he remained in Sweden and did not return to Malta after 26 October 1988 ” .
PFLP-GC
Talb 's possible involvement is in line with the defence team 's argument that there was a more plausible — and simpler — theory of how the bomb - laden suitcase reached Heathrow than the prosecution 's convoluted speculations .
Talb was a member of the Syria - based Palestinian Popular Struggle Front , which worked closely with another Syria - backed terrorist group , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command ( PFLP - GC ) .
On October 26 , 1988 — less than a month before the Lockerbie disaster —
West German police raided PFLP - GC safe - houses and seized Toshiba radio cassette players , explosives , detonators , timers , barometric pressure devices , as well as Pan Am timetables and unused airline baggage tags .
The cache suggested a plot to bomb an aircraft .
A trade mark of the PFLP - GC's bombs at the time were that they were concealed within Toshiba radio cassette players .
The bomb that brought down Pan Am 103 had been concealed in a Toshiba player , although a different model from that generally used by the PFLP - GC .
That not all the PFLP - GC's stock of bombs had been discovered was proven when , in April 1989 , three explosive devices were seized in a raid .
At first , US and British investigators also were convinced that the PFLP - GC — with the backing of the Syrian and Iranian governments — was the prime suspect in the Lockerbie disaster .
The FBI in April 1989 leaked news that the PFLP - GC had smuggled the bomb onto flight in Frankfurt .
The Washington Post on May 11 , 1989 , reported that the US State Department had stated that the CIA was “ confident ” that the PFLP - GC had carried out the attack on behalf of the Iranian government .
The attack was said to be in retaliation for the 290 pilgrims massacred while returning from Mecca when a US warship blew a Iranian passenger jet out of the sky as it passed over the Persian Gulf .
On December 16 , 1989 , the New York Times reported that Scottish investigators had announced that they had “ hard evidence ” that the PFLP - GC was behind the bombing .
In October 1990 , US and British authorities suddenly did a backflip as the US build - up in the Gulf was gathering pace following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .
Investigators attention suddenly shifted from the Syria - backed PFLP - GC to Libya .
In 1991 , the two Libyans were formally indicted .
What changed between 1988 and 1991 ?
Syrian dictator Hafiz Assad was an enthusiastic participant in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq , whereas Libya 's leader Moammer Qadhafi opposed the war and campaigned for a peaceful settlement .
The judges rejected this alternative theory , although they did “ accept that there is a great deal of suspicion as to the actings of Abo Talb and his circle , but there is no evidence to indicate that they had either the means or the intention to destroy a civil aircraft in December 1988 ” .
This contention is based on the claim that the Lockerbie bomb was triggered by a Swiss - made timer of a type ( MST - 13 ) that had been supplied to the Libyan army in the mid-1980s .
Yet the owner of the company that made the devices testified that MST - 13s had also been supplied to the East German Stasi spy agency .
East Germany is known to have harboured the PFLP - GC .
Despite the judges ' proviso that “ we are unable to exclude the possibility that any MST - 13 timers in the hands of the Stasi left their possession , although there is no positive evidence that they did and in particular that they were supplied to the PFLP - GC ” , their verdict stated that “ the evidence relating to [ the terrorist activities of the PFLP - GC ] does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime ” .
` Major difficulty for Crown '
The judges ' verdict doggedly insisted that “ we are satisfied that it has been proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive devise was dispatched from Malta , passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow ” .
Yet , the judges contradict themselves by admitting that there were no records that showed any unaccompanied baggage was carried on the flight to Frankfurt and that all luggage in Malta was checked by military personnel for the presence of explosives .
The judges noted that the Luqa airport had a “ relatively elaborate security system ” and security procedures that “ seem to make it extremely difficult for an unaccompanied and unidentified bag to be shipped on a flight out ” .
The judges conceded that : “ If therefore the unaccompanied bag was launched from Luqa , the method by which that was done is not established , and the Crown accepted that they could not point to any specific route by which the primary suitcase could have been loaded ...
The absence of any explanation of the method by which the primary suitcase might have been placed on board KM180 [ the Malta to Frankfurt flight ] is a major difficulty for the Crown case . ”
The judges ' determination to deny that the bomb could have been introduced at a point other than Malta , and by a culprit other than Megrahi , led them to ignore that the security at Frankfurt airport was notoriously lax — something the US law enforcement authorities knew about at the time .
According to an October 30 , 1990 , US NBC television news report , “ Pan Am flights from Frankfurt , including 103 , had been used a number times by the [ US Drug Enforcement Agency ] as part of its undercover operation to fly informants and suitcases of heroin into Detroit as part of a sting operation to catch dealers in Detroit ...
Informants would put suitcases of heroin on the Pan Am flights apparently without the usual security checks ... through an arrangement between the DEA and the German authorities . ”
The report stated that the DEA was investigating the possibility that a young man who lived in the US and regularly visited the Middle East may have unwittingly carried the bomb aboard flight 103 .
An investigation commissioned by Pan Am 's insurance company in 1989 also concluded that the most likely source of the bomb was that the PFLP - GC had infiltrated the DEA 's protected drug smuggling operation and succeeded in having the bag containing the bomb placed on Pan Am 103 in Frankfurt .
Megrahi should have been found not guilty because the prosecution did not prove him guilty beyond “ reasonable doubt ” .
A terrible miscarriage of justice has taken place because the three loyal servants of the British imperialist ruling class who sat in judgement on the fate Megrahi and Fhimah had already decided to find one of them guilty regardless of the facts .
The lords knew that the political stakes were too high to allow both Libyans to walk free .
Such a verdict would have exposed the lies upon which nine years of UN sanctions , which have cost Libya US $ 33 billion and 10,000 lives , have been based .
It would have also shed some light on the cynical , sleazy and embarrassing political operations that the US government is involved in throughout the world .
• A daily summary of global reports on security issues .
Food riots and anti-US protests in Somalia are compounding the chaos in the long - suffering war zone in the Horn of Africa .
Meanwhile , an Amnesty International Report released Tuesday alleged that Islamist militants , as well as US - backed Ethiopian and Somali government troops , are committing widespread atrocities against civilians in the capital , Mogadishu .
And a recent US strike against what it says was an Al Qaeda leader in Somalia has sparked further protests .
The Associated Press reports that Tuesday saw a second day of protests over rising food prices , with hundreds of youths burning tires , throwing stones , and blocking roads .
Somalia is just the latest country to see riots over rising food prices , after others including Haiti , Egypt , Cameroon , and Burkina Faso .
The Financial Times has a map of the civil unrest sparked by the food crisis here .
The protests began when shopkeepers refused to accept some bank notes , over fear of counterfeiting .
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Monday , and troops fired into the crowds .
The Los Angeles Times said witnesses and officials reported five killed in clashes with government troops and armed shopkeepers .
The Times reports that soaring inflation is taking place against the backdrop of a civil war that has raged since 1991 , when the government collapsed and a bloody power struggle began .
A sharp rise in counterfeit currency over the last year , and the rise in global food prices , has fed skyrocketing inflation .
The devaluing of Somalia 's currency , the shilling , has exacerbated the problem .
Prices for basic cereals such as rice and sorghum are up between 100 percent and 400 percent from last year ; the price of a sack of rice has risen from US $ 32 to US $ 52 in just one month .
Adding to the problem , Somalia 's local crops were devastated by drought and flooding .
Somalia imports 60 percent of its grain .
The Agence France - Presse reported today that Islamist militants are urging shopkeepers to accept Somali shillings instead of US dollars to help curb inflation .
They also said they would " punish " those who refuse to comply .
Inflation began rising early last year when Somali government and Ethiopian forces began a push to drive out Islamic militants .
Voice of America interviewed Cindy Holleman , the chief technical adviser with the Food Security Analysis Unit of Somalia , about the country 's worsening humanitarian crisis .
In the past three to four months , there has been a 40 percent increase in people who need assistance , from 1.8 million to 2.6 million , Ms. Holleman says :
" There are three main factors that are driving it .
One is the skyrocketing food prices within the country .
The second is parts of the country are being affected by a drought , which is deepening because the rains have failed and have n't appeared yet .
And the third reason is civil insecurity , which is increasing , " she says .
Meanwhile , the BBC reports that human rights group Amnesty International is saying civilians in Somalia are " completely at the mercy of armed groups " who are targeting them for atrocities .
The report blames all sides – Somalian government troops , their US - trained Ethiopian allies , and Islamic insurgents – for being " out of control . "
But Ethiopian troops are singled out for committing especially grisly acts .
The Ethiopian government has denied the charges and demanded an apology , reports the BBC .
The Amnesty report uses detailed testimony from survivors to paint a picture of a humanitarian and political crisis .
Amnesty International 's Africa Program Deputy Director Michelle Kagari said :
The Independent writes that Amnesty is also calling for a probe into the US role in war crimes committed by its allies in Somalia .
It writes that US troops provided equipment to the Ethiopian military and trained Ethiopian forces that Amnesty says have carried out atrocities .
It gave further details on the Amnesty report , which described a pattern of violence .
Al - Shabaab – an Islamic insurgent group which the US has designated a terrorist group – has launched attacks on residential areas .
The Ethiopian troops then respond with a security sweep , with door - to - door checks in which civilians are often attacked again .
Some 700,000 civilians have fled such violence .
Agence France - Presse reported on further riots Sunday in Dhusamareb – 250 miles north of Mogadishu – in the wake of a US bombing there last Thursday .
That bombing killed at least 12 people , including Moalim Aden Hashi Ayro , who the Somali government and the US believe was the leader of Al Qaeda in Somalia .
One protest organizer told the Agence France - Presse that since the attack , residents had been vomiting .
" We believe the Americans used poisonous bombs , " said Abdirasak Moalim Ahmed .
Agence France - Presse writes that Mr. Ayro , who was targeted in the US attack , trained with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and was linked to the deaths of foreign aid workers in Somalia .
It wrote that the US Pentagon declined to say that Ayro was the target of Thursday 's attack , but did confirm an attack on what it called an Al Qaeda military leader in Somalia .
Garowe Online , the website of a community radio station based in the capital of northern Somalia 's self - governing Puntland region , reports that the Kenyan government has increased security measures on fears that Islamic militants could launch retaliatory attacks against US interests in Kenya to revenge Ayro 's death .
In its latest briefing on Somalia in January , the International Crisis Group called a late December offensive against Islamists by US - backed Somalia government and Ethiopian forces a " major success for Ethiopia and the US , who feared emergence of a Taliban - style haven for Al Qaeda and other extremists . "
In that " lightning offensive " , hundreds of Islamists were killed and the rest dispersed .
But the group cautioned that the attack had left a political vacuum in southern Somalia and warned of further guerrilla war by Islamic militants .
Canadian Officials Must Turn Over Interrogation Records To Prisoner 's Defense Lawyers
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2689 or 2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK - The Supreme Court of Canada ( SCC ) ruled today that Canadian officials violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – analogous to the U.S. Bill of Rights – by turning over interrogation records of Canadian citizen Omar Khadr to the United States .
The court reached this result after finding that , at the time Canadian officials interrogated him , Khadr was being detained and prosecuted at Guantánamo in violation of U.S. and international law .
Khadr was 15 when he was shot and captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in July 2002 .
The SCC , citing decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court , wrote that " the conditions under which Mr. Khadr was held and was liable for prosecution were illegal under both U.S. and international law at the time Canadian officials interviewed Mr. Khadr and gave information to U.S. authorities , " and it ordered Canadian officials to turn over the records of Khadr 's interrogations to his defense lawyers .
The following can be attributed to Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project : " Today 's decision by the highest court of Canada makes a clear statement that the legal system under which Omar Khadr was detained and charged was fundamentally unlawful .
While the Bush administration continues to argue that the U.S. Constitution does n't apply at Guantánamo and that prisoners held there do n't have the right to challenge their detention in court , the Canadian court 's decision is a declaration that Guantánamo is not an island without law .
Notably , the Canadian court 's decision is based in large part on the Guantánamo decisions that the U.S. Supreme Court has issued over the last four years . "
An ACLU report submitted earlier this month to the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) argues that the lack of protections for alleged foreign child soldiers in U.S. military custody violates international standards .
The report charges that the U.S. has prosecuted Omar Khadr in a trial that raises serious fairness concerns , including the use of testimony his attorneys claim was coerced through torture .
Yesterday , the CRC reviewed the United States government 's compliance with international protocol on children in armed conflict .
The following can be attributed to Jennifer Turner of the ACLU Human Rights Program : " In pursuing the prosecution against Omar Khadr , the United States is poised to become the first developed country since the Nuremburg trials to try a former child soldier for war crimes .
Yesterday , the United Nations expressed strong concern that the detention , treatment and prosecution of Omar Khadr violates international law and flies in the face of accepted international practice . "

Advertisement Rural households are now more likely to have a broadband connection than residents of towns , says Ofcom .
The regulator 's regional communications market report shows that 59 % of rural households have broadband compared to 57 % of urban homes .
It is the first time that the country has overtaken the town , according to the report .
Four years ago urban dwellers were twice as likely to have broadband as those living in the country .
Digital Britain in figures Ed Richards , Ofcom 's chief executive , said : " Our report highlights a closing of the geographical digital divide in the UK .
Rural households are today as well connected to broadband as their urban neighbours . "
The report also reveals big differences in take - up of modern communications across the UK .
What will deliver next - generation broadband ?
Sunderland appears to be the UK's most connected city , with 66 % of households having broadband and 96 % using digital television .
Glasgow has the lowest take - up of broadband in the UK at 32 % .
Ofcom could not explain why Sunderland was at the top of the broadband league but said Glasgow 's position probably reflected low levels of household income and computer ownership .
By contrast , in the Highlands and Islands , 62 % of homes have broadband , and Aberdeen , Edinburgh and Dundee are all well ahead of the UK average .
There has been a major drive to bring broadband to every corner of Scotland , partly to sustain the economies of isolated communities where many residents can now work from home .
Who would have thought that Sunderland would be Britain 's most connected city ?
Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan- Jones
Read more on the dot. life blog Ofcom 's report also shows just how rapidly new mobile technology is changing Britain .
About 20 % of UK households now rely solely on a mobile phone , and in Greater Manchester 28 % of homes use a mobile but have no fixed line telephone .
And 3G phones are also taking off rapidly .
Dundee is the city with the highest levels of 3G phone use , with nearly three in 10 people using one .
Ofcom also provides evidence that the mobile internet is now beginning to take off .
One in five UK adults has surfed the web on the move , but use is highest in London and Birmingham .
In Devon and Cornwall , where 3g phone coverage is pretty sparse , just 7 % of people have used the mobile internet .
Large numbers are also watching TV or video online , with a national rate of 30 % , but again there are big regional variations .
In London , 40 % have tried services like the BBC iPlayer , while the figure in Greater Manchester is just 16 % .
One more fact from the thousands sprinkled across this comprehensive survey of media habits across the UK - there are now 14,000 Wikipedia articles in Welsh , more than twice as many as the number in Gaelic .
Which is not a bad effort , considering that Wales has a lower rate of broadband take - up than the rest of the UK .

What are these ?
In July , Antifascist Calling reported on the imminent launch of U.S. Air Force Cyber Command ( AFCYBER ) .
With a unified organizational structure and a $ 2 billion budget for its first year of operations , and a projected $ 30 billion cost for the first five years of operations , AFCYBER promised an offensive capability that would deliver withering attacks on adversaries .
As I wrote , “ Eventually , if Air Force securocrats have their way , it ‘ will grow into one of the service ’s largest commands . ’
With a mission to ‘ deceive , deny , disrupt , degrade , and destroy ’ an enemy ’s information infrastructure , the potential for mischief on the part of American ‘ warfighters ’ and ‘ public diplomacy ’ black propaganda specialists should n’t be underestimated . ”
Now however , numerous reports reveal that the Air Force has suspended plans for the controversial unit .
NextGov broke the story Wednesday .
According to investigative journalist Bob Brewin ,
The Air Force on Monday suspended all efforts related to development of a program to become the dominant service in cyberspace , according to knowledgeable sources .
Top Air Force officials put a halt to all activities related to the establishment of the Cyber Command , a provisional unit that is currently part of the 8th Air Force at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana , sources told NextGov .
An internal Air Force e-mail obtained by NextGov said , “ Transfers of manpower and resources , including activation and reassignment of units , shall be halted . ”
Establishment of the Cyber Command will be delayed until new senior Air Force leaders , including Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz , sworn in today , have time to make a final decision on the scope and mission of the command .
( “ Air Force Suspends Cyber Command Program , ” NextGov , August 13 , 2008 )
Air Force spokesman Ed Gulick told Federal Times , the “ freeze ” was necessary “ because we have new leaders and they want to make sure they ’re on the right course . ”
But he said the Air Force “ remains committed to cyberspace . ”
With an October 1 launch date , it appears that aggressive efforts by Major General William Lord , the unit ’s commander , to hype its capabilities may have been its undoing .
Brewin reports the “ hard sell ” by Lord and other AF securocrats “ seemed to be a grab by the Air Force to take the lead role ” in U.S. cyberdefense efforts .
Bureaucratic in - fighting may play a significant role in pulling AFCYBER ’s plug .
Philip Coyle , a senior adviser with the Center for Defense Information ( CDI ) , a liberal defense think tank , told NextGov that he believes “ the Navy ’s Network Warfare Command and the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center have led the way in cyberspace .
The Army engages in cyberspace operations daily in Afghanistan and Iraq , said Coyle , who served as assistant secretary of Defense and director of its operational test and evaluation office from 1994 to 2001 . ”
Accordingly , Coyle believes the decision may have come from Adm .
Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , who wants to see a more “ robust role ” for the Navy in cyberspace .
Lord ’s high public profile and hard - sell may have shot - down AF plans to “ dominate cyberspace ” and the AF “ is now suffering from its own hubris . ”
It appears that AFCYBER ’s aggressive public posture and its assertion that cyberspace is a “ warfighting domain , ” may have angered Department of Defense bureaucrats who favor a “ softer ” approach when it comes to plans for imperialist domination .
In this light , recent Air Force scandals , including the unauthorized transfer of nuclear weapons in 2007 and the dismantling of the service ’s top command by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as a result , the Air Force ’s lax organizational structure may have been a deciding factor .
In June , Gates fired Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Mosley and Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne for their incompetence over the service ’s handling of nuclear weapons .
Many readers will recall that on August 30 , 2007 a B - 52 Stratofortress bomber flew nearly 1,500 miles from Minot Air Force base in North Dakota to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana with six nuclear - tipped cruise missiles fixed to its wings .
For nearly six hours the Air Force was unable to account for the weapons .
When Military Times broke the story , it elicited a yawn from major media outlets that amounted to self - censorship .
While brief media reports emphasized that the public was “ never in danger , ” as physicist Pavel Podvig reported ,
The point is that the nuclear warheads were allowed to leave Minot and that it was surprised airmen at Barksdale who discovered them , not an accounting system that ’s supposed to track the warheads ’ every movement ( maybe even in real time ) .
We simply do n’t know how long it would ’ve taken to discover the warheads had they actually left the air force ’s custody and been diverted into the proverbial “ wrong hands . ”
Of course , it could be argued that the probability of this kind of diversion is very low , but anyone who knows anything about how the United States handles its nuclear weapons has said that the probability of what happened at Minot was also essentially zero .
( “ U.S. loose nukes , ” Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists , 12 September 2007 )
In the wake of the scandal , Mosley and Wynne were forced to fall on their swords .
Similar forces may be at play regarding AFCYBER .
According to CDI researcher Chelsea Dilley ,
It is unclear what AFCYBER ’s exact mission is , what capabilities are being developed , what circumstances warrant a cyber attack , what actions will be taken in response to an attack , who can authorize an attack , what steps will be taken to prevent crisis escalation , what the budgets are and exactly where the money is coming from .
AFCYBER ’s relation to the Department of Homeland Security and to the Air Force Space Command is also hazy , which could prove problematic , as all have claimed some responsibility for maintaining control of cyberspace .
Alarmingly , there are many similarities in the ways used to promote AFCYBER and those used in the Air Force ’s increasingly belligerent counterspace mission .
The diction used in the 2004 Air Force Counterspace Operations Doctrine and the 2008 Air Force Cyber Command Strategic Vision is in many places exactly the same , and it is uncertain if the task that was given to the Air Force Space Command to maintain cyberspace has actually been transferred to or just appropriated by the new Cyber Command .
( “ Air Force Cyber Command : Defending Cyberspace , or Controlling It ? , ” Center for Defense Information , August 7 , 2008 )
Whether or not a bureaucratic tussle amongst competing branches of the military and the Department of Homeland Security may have played a role in AFCYBER ’s apparent demise , the Air Force is continuing to develop new and more hideous weapons to insure that the American Empire ’s dream of global domination remains a viable option for our capitalist masters .
New Scientist reported August 12 on an airborne laser weapon , dubbed the “ long - range blowtorch . ”
According to defense analyst David Hambling ,
The Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) is to be mounted on a Hercules military transport plane .
Boeing announced the first test firing of the laser , from a plane on the ground , earlier this summer .
Cynthia Kaiser , chief engineer of the US Air Force Research Laboratory ’s Directed Energy Directorate , used the phrase “ plausible deniability ” to describe the weapon ’s benefits in a briefing on laser weapons to the New Mexico Optics Industry Association in June .
( “ U.S. Boasts of Laser Weapon ’s ‘ Plausible Deniability ’ , ” New Scientist , August 12 , 2008 )
As readers are aware , “ plausible deniability ” is a term used to describe aggressive covert operations where those responsible for an event , say the assassination of a political opponent or the terrorist bombing of a civilian target , could plausibly claim to have neither knowledge nor involvement in the atrocity since command responsibility by design is highly compartmentalized .
According to Hambling , “ a laser is silent and invisible .
An ATL can deliver the heat of a blowtorch with a range of 20 kilometres , depending on conditions .
That range is great enough that the aircraft carrying it might not be seen , especially at night . ”
Whatever the eventual fate of AFCYBER rest assured , as Aviation Week reported back in December , “ U.S. Air Force leaders working on the nascent cyber command believe there will be a ‘ huge ’ need for contracted services to support the embryonic effort as it faces personnel , technology and funding headwinds . ”
Army , Navy , Air Force ?
Who cares !
Enterprising corporate grifters will certainly be there , pushing for “ full - spectrum dominance ” as they lunge after multiyear , high - end contracts that just might hit the corporatist “ sweet spot ” !

You do n't have time for that , you need to be using this time to get started on another of your interminable , self - absorbed rants . )
( You TextMate kiddies are n't even invited .
This is a war that started before you were even born .
Just keep licking your screens and eating paint chips . )
( And all you Windows users ... well , to start with you need to know that there 's this thing called the " Editor War " that 's been going on since 1976 , and it - - hmm .
You know what ?
Just skip this post .
Bye ! )
So ... the Editor War .
A couple of uncomfortable experiences at RailsConf made me realize that the war may have gone cold , but it is still very much alive .
Here 's my take on the whole which - editor - is - better thing :
First Point .
I use all three editors mentioned above .
I use emacs on my " real computers " : Windows and Linux desktops , and my MacBook Pro , because emacs will give you godlike editing power if you are willing to pay the price .
I use Vim on my PDA / cellphone because it 's tiny and fast ( and my PDA does n't have Ctrl or Alt keys ) .
And I use TextMate on my MBP whenever I need to share an editing session with my teammates .
They all use and love TextMate , so it 's the editor of choice for shared meaning .
Second Point .
There is a significant percentage of people out there using one of those editors who will now hate me because I use the other two .
You are the reason I need to get this off my chest , and for you my entire point is this :
You people need to shut the hell up .
Third Point .
As an illustration of what I mean in the Second Point , I hold no opinion as to which editor you should use .
At least , not without some more information about you and how you like to edit .
Do you consider an editor to be little more than a typing area with cursor keys and a clipboard ?
Any of those editors will be far more than you will want or need .
You should use Notepad , Nano , or TextEdit , whichever came with your OS .
Fourth Point .
If you are a power editor but you 've never really thought about your editor beyond how to get things done , like mass search and replace , keyboard macros , and syntax highlighting , then any of those editors will make you happy .
Vi was made to drop to bash and work with other unixlike " small , sharp " tools .
TextMate has a huge arrangement of very useful bells and whistles .
And Emacs can power edit all day long without breaking a sweat -- or even breaking into lisp .
Fifth Point .
If you are a totally crazy power editor , you 're going to want to start scripting your editor .
Here is where we start to lose the vi guys .
Not because they can't keep up , but because they think we 've left the realm of editing and entered the realm of programming .
They can do everything we 're going to do here , but they see it as a distinct activity : they 'll use vi to write a bash script then call it from vi ; they do n't consider this vi scripting .
TextMate takes the external script metaphor and wraps it in a clean , lickable interface ; you write a bundle in bash or Ruby or Python and TextMate lets you run it from whatever hotkey you want to assign .
And emacs ... well , emacslisp is an infinitely deep rabbithole full of LSD .
Sixth Point .
I forgot what the sixth point was , because I 'm still tripping out on emacslisp .
Woo .
Seventh Point .
I do n't have an opinion on what text editor you should use , but if you are a programmer , you should know your editor .
Learn its ins and outs .
Learn how it formats regular expressions , and use them .
Learn how it can be scripted , and script it .
At a minimum , you should be able to do all of the following in your sleep :
Replace every instance of " foo " with " bar " in every file your project , without trashing your .git or .svn indexes .
( If you do n't know what a .git or .svn index is , well , this is why I told you Windows users to skip this post .
Shoo , shoo ! )
Replace every 8 - digit date like 20080607 with a hyphenated date like 2008 - 06 - 07 .
Take a list of usernames like " ' alice jones ' , ' bob smith ' , ' carol johnson ' " and turn them into a hash like " ALICE_JONES => ' alice jones ' , BOB_SMITH => ' bob smith ' , CAROL_JOHNSON => ' carol johnson ' "
If you 're editing code , you should also be able to
Select a block of code and comment it in or out .
Jump to the definition of a class , symbol or function .
Compile your code .
Run your unit tests .
Launch your debugger .
Those last three are more of an IDE thing than an editor thing , but all three editors can do them , and if you 're not using them , you 're not using the power available to you .
For all intents and purposes , this means that you are stupid .
Eight Point .
There are people out there who are smarter than you who use emacs .
Deal with it .
Ninth Point .
There are people out there who are smarter than you who use vi .
Deal with it .
Tenth Point .
There are people out there who are smarter than you who use TextMate .
Deal with it .
Eleventh Point .
Emacs is the most powerful of the three by a full order of magnitude .
If you do n't believe this , you do n't know what the hell you are talking about .
Vi users will freely concede this , they do n't think an editor should do all those things .
TextMate can run scripts but it bundles features together rather than forcing every feature to be fully composable with all the other features .
Example : Can you Go To File using fuzzy matching anywhere on your hard drive ?
Twelfth Point .
The good news for emacs haters is this : if you do n't like it , you do n't ever have to learn it .
Hard work pays off in the end , laziness pays off now .
See point 18 before you stop reading , though .
Thirteenth Point .
Emacs is the hardest editor to get full use out of .
It may be ten times more powerful than TextMate , but it 's a hundred times harder to get used to .
In TextMate , you click Preferences and choose colors .
In emacs , you have to write a file called .emacs .
This file is a lisp program .
Your first time using emacs you 'll just cadge someone 's .emacs file and pray you never have to understand all those parentheses .
But you 'll have to , before you can witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational text editor .
If you want to have conversations with your code , and have your code talk back meaningfully , you should look at emacs .
Fourteenth Point .
Sorry , tripping out on emacslisp again .
Fifteenth Point .
If you use Linux , you have to know Vi .
It 's on every system , requires no special configuration , and lives up to it's " small , sharp " heritage .
If you can't bring yourself to memorize the keys , print out the cheatsheet and keep it handy for when you have to do some emergency editing .
Sixteenth Point .
Vim is not a toy .
It is a full power editor in its own right .
It has syntax coloring , smart indentation , and a clean separation between command and editing modes that make it possible to shovel text around wholesale .
If you 're a power editor who wants the code to line up , sit down , and not talk back , Vim can make you happy .
Seventeenth Point .
When it comes to sheer editing power , TextMate sure has a pretty interface .
Actually , it 's also powerful enough to stand unashamed next to vi and emacs .
Like vi , TextMate lets you go off and script modules to do anything you want .
But also like vi , those modules are siloed from one another and from the editor , so mixing and matching partial features does n't happen .
Unlike emacs and vi , however , you can make those modules look dead sexy with html , css , and even javascript in the UI .
Eighteenth Point .
If you are bumping your head on the ceiling of your editor , you need to learn emacs .
Emacs is an order of magnitude more powerful , and two orders of magnitude harder to learn .
But if you are frustrated with your editor 's inability to keep up , saving time by not learning emacs is a false economy .
Once you pay the price to learn it , you get to reap the benefits of its power .
And the longer you put up with a frustrating editor , the longer you risk believing that what you are getting is all there ever is .
Which editor is the best ?
It exactly like asking which spaghetti sauce is best : different people like different things .
( And everybody who does n't like chunky vegetable marinara is ugly and stupid . )
Life is too short to not be happy with your editor .
And it's way the hell too short to not be happy with anybody else 's choice of editor .

Adam " Pacman " Jones and the Dallas Cowboys got what they were hoping for Monday -- a partial reinstatement of the suspended cornerback .
Commissioner Roger Goodell informed Jones on Monday he may participate in organized team activities , and the bonus includes training camp and preseason games .
While that decision finally gives
Jones the chance to earn his way back into the league , Goodell did n't guarantee he would be reinstated .
" This limited reinstatement is a step in the process , " Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said .
" Adam is aware of the things that need to be done in order to take the next step . "
A final determination will be made by Sept. 1 . Jones will have to be on perfect behavior in order to be eligible for the 2008 season .
" Commissioner Goodell told Jones that his continued participation in the NFL depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner , " the NFL said in a release Monday .
" Jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the NFL and the Cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement . "
Getting Pacman back for so long , so soon is good news for Dallas .
Hours later , the club had more reason to celebrate , agreeing to a new deal with Terrell Owens that keeps the receiver under contract through 2011 .
Jones , who has been arrested six times and has been involved in 12 incidents requiring police intervention since being drafted , was the main player involved in the league 's player conduct policy , which was created to discipline players who have had repeated confrontations with the law .
Jones missed all of last season under the player conduct policy and could miss all or part of the 2008 season if he has another incident .
Less than two weeks ago , Jones met with Goodell to discuss his status with the league .
By giving Jones the chance to work at the Cowboys facility , Goodell apparently accepted Jones ' explanations for allegedly giving money to a suspect in a shooting incident in Las Vegas .
Goodell also must have accepted Jones ' explanation for a $ 20,000 marker at a casino that was just recently paid .
Since being traded to the Cowboys , Jones has tried to surround himself with a better support group .
He 's befriended former Cowboys Michael Irvin and Deion Sanders .
Now that he 's allowed to be at the Cowboys facility , Jones will be able to work with Calvin Hill , a consultant who works with player development .
Jones also has become friends with several of his new teammates , including Tank Johnson , whom the Cowboys helped return from a similar suspension last season .
" The important thing is getting him here and getting him acclimated , " Johnson said .
" I have told him you are a good kid , we know you and we 're looking forward to having you on the team and we 're excited about you proving everybody wrong . "
The Cowboys could use another good cornerback , but they 're not hanging their hopes on Jones , having spent a first - round pick on Michael Jenkins .
Jenkins and fellow first - rounder Felix Jones also can handle kick returns if Pacman is n't around -- or even if he is .
Basically , the team is n't getting its hopes up , considering Pacman 's availability a bonus .
" If [ Pacman ] can come out and help us here , great , " said linebacker Bradie James , the defensive captain last season .
" But if he does n't , we 've got enough guys to make it happen . "
Jerry Jones has even talked about using Pacman as an extra wide receiver .
That 's fine by Owens , who expects Pacman to be committed to staying out of trouble .
" I think now with a year out of football , he has to really put his life and career in perspective , " Owens said .
" I have n't seen him play offense .
Obviously he has some return skills .
Any time you can get a guy like [ that ] to get their hands on the ball , it 's going to help your offense . "
Terence Newman , the team 's top cornerback , is looking forward to the help , too .
" We 're all waiting for him to get here .
The sooner the better , " Newman said .
" It will definitely be a little shock when he gets back because the speed of the game is what you 're not used to .
You can play basketball , can do a lot of things , but you can never simulate going against a receiver , pressing a guy and having a guy run full speed at you . "
Secondary coach Dave Campo expects Jones to adapt quickly .
Campo figures the biggest obstacle will be learning Dallas ' terminology .
Jones was n't allowed to have a playbook while banned from the facility .
" Pretty much , coverage is coverage , " Campo said .
" I 've looked at some tape of him and I 've put a couple tapes together for him when he comes in to show him some stuff .
But I saw him up close and personal in Jacksonville .
He beat us single - handedly in a game so I know him pretty well . "

I really , really , really like the Bourne movies .
I tell you this because if I did n't , I 'm not sure I would have even tried to review The Bourne Conspiracy , or even play it .
Were it not for the fact that I could re-enact the scene where Jason Bourne stabs a guy in the hand and arm with a ballpoint pen no fewer than three times , I probably would n't be all that interested in The Bourne Conspiracy .
But since I am the type of guy who relishes the opportunity to re-enact those moments from one of my favorite trilogies , I thought I 'd take the plunge with this sadly Matt Damon - less entry in the Bourne saga .
But was it any good ?
I suppose you 'll find out , if you hit the jump .
The Bourne Conspiracy ( PS3 , Xbox360 Reviewed )
Developed by Sierra Entertainment
Released on June 3 , 2008
Games like The Bourne Conspiracy make me absolutely hate the numerical score system in game reviews .
Its gameplay mechanics are abysmal in almost every conceivable way .
Its story is nonsensical at best , sacreligious at worst .
Its entire running time is completely disrespectful to the player 's intelligence , assuming that if the character models and locations change , the player wo n't realize he 's getting into the exact same gun battles and fistfights he engaged in at the very start of the game .
Looking at The Bourne Conspiracy as a list of bullet points , it is an undoubtedly awful game .
But why , then , did I have fun with it ?
For better or for worse , Conspiracy attempts to marry the visual sensibilities of the first Bourne film with the limited interactivity of a bad videogame .
Every action the player takes is bookended by short , noninteractive cut scenes ; if the player wants to jump onto a platform , he runs toward the platform , presses A , watches a heavily - edited cut scene where Bourne jumps onto the platform , maybe has to engage in one or two QTEs , and then finally gets control of the character back .
The entire game follows this format , as cut scenes and QTEs take over for any and all player actions that are n't shooting or hand - to - hand fighting .
This may sound abysmal , but ( for the first third of the game , at least ) it kinda works : the transition between player action to cut scene to QTE and back happens so quickly , and so seamlessly , that I initially felt like I was watching a cool action movie and just happened to be helping it along with my occasional input .
The actual stuff I was being asked to do was pretty ridiculous ( there 's a protracted sniping sequence which , rather than allowing the player to control a sniper rifle as a normal game would , reduces the entire thing into one elongated QTE ) , but its pacing and seamless integration with the rest of the gameplay never really gave me enough time to realize how absurd my actions ( or lack of them ) were .
The Bourne Conspiracy was feeding me anchovies , but I was chomping it all down so fast that I initially could n't distinguish it from King Salmon .
Yes , that was a metaphor .
I 'm trying to expand .
The player only does two things in Conspiracy outside of the cut scenes : punching and shooting .
The fighting system is incredibly simplistic but , thanks to the fantastic character animations and innumerable environmental takedowns , much more visually stimulating and therefore entertaining than it really has any right to be .
As with the rest of the game , you 'll only be pressing a few buttons at a time , but the visual rewards make the experience a lot more satisfying than the actual gameplay might suggest .
The shooting mechanics just plain blow .
There 's also one driving mission in the game , ripped straight from The Bourne Identity .
It 's pretty silly , but appears at just the right point in the game ( about halfway ) to feel like a welcome change of pace from all the shooting and slapping the player has engaged in for the past two hours .
After the chase , however , everything goes sour .
Not because the actual game mechanics get worse , or because the story takes some sort of disappointing turn , but because the repetitive , samey , intrinsically boring game mechanics simply wear out their welcome .
For up to two hours , I had no problem with the fact that every single hand - to - hand fight felt exactly the same , regardless of how many enemies surrounded me or how well - armed my opponent seemed to be .
For up to two hours , I was willing to slog through the boring , derivative gunfights .
For two hours , I thought the integration of QTEs with cut scenes with regular gameplay fun , cool , and charming .
None of it was charming after two hours .
I could predict every combat animation before it happened ; every enemy 's placement in a gunfight ; every QTE event in a bombastic cut scene that generally had nothing to do with the events of the film .
Conspiracy 's ability to gussy up horrendous gameplay with cool visuals and slick pacing completely breaks down around the game 's halfway point , at which time the entire package becomes so frustrating and dull that I was actually happy to find that the entire game was only about four or five hours long , if only to keep the tedium at a minimum .
Overall , The Bourne Conspiracy is not really worth a purchase , and probably not a rent , either .
If you 're a huge fan of the Bourne movies , you 'll be irritated at the liberties they take with the characters and themes ; if you 're not a Bourne fan , you 've got no real reason to care about the character or what little story there is .
The kinetic visuals and fast pacing make the game almost a joy to behold in its first half , but even the veneer of cool editing can't mask the fact that , sooner or later , the crappy , repetitive nature of the actual game mechanics becomes totally overhwelming .
I had fun , but not enough fun to warrant the $ 60 I spent on the game .
If you 've got access to Xbox Live or PSN , then just play the demo ; it 's got the single best level in the game ( the Zurich Embassy ) , and includes enough of the underwhelming gunfighting and driving levels to likely dissuade most consumers from actually purchasing the game .
Score : 3.0 ( Bad - Some aspects are terrible , others are either so - so or kind of fun . )
Snap the stem ends of the green beans , or cut them off in a big bunch with a knife if you ’d like .
Just do n’t tell Granny .
Melt bacon grease in a skillet over medium low heat .
Add garlic and onions and cook for a minute .
Then add green beans and cook for a minute until beans turn bright green .
Add the chicken broth , chopped red pepper , salt and black pepper .
Turn heat to low and cover with a lid , leaving lid cracked to allow steam to escape .
Cook for 20 to 30 minutes or until liquid evaporates and beans are fairly soft , yet still a bit crisp .
You can add more chicken broth during the cooking process , but do n’t be afraid to let it all cook away so the onions and peppers can caramelize .

PW ’s Fresh Green Beans Printable Recipe
Okay , I have to get something off my chest .
YUM .
YUM YUM YUM .
YUM .
* Groan * * Ugh * YUM .
I ’m back now .
Sorry .
But I just had to release the sounds and emotions I felt when I first tasted these deliciously simple green beans .
Yum .
Did I say that already ?
I think I did .
It ’s green bean season , which means either your garden is bursting with them or your local grocery store has piles and piles of them for you to grab at will .
I love fresh green beans — also known as “ string beans ” or “ snap beans ” — and while they ’re totally versatile , it ’s sometimes hard to know what to do with them beyond just cooking them in a pot of water .
I love preparing the crisp little babies in a skillet with delicious ingredients , allowing them to cook down and become both colorful and slightly caramelized .
To me , that brings out the natural culinary beauty of a green bean much more than allowing it to become soggy in a bunch of liquid .
My homegirl Hyacinth make these with me last week , so you ’ll be seeing her petite , lovely hands in the photos .
I want her hands to be mine , and I ’m trying to figure out how I can make that happen .
You ’ll need a bunch of fresh green beans .
Just go to the store , grab a big , sweaty handful , and put them into a bag .
For this recipe , I used about a pound .
When you ’re ready to cook ’em , just wash ’em and begin snapping off the ends , removing the tough string if one is present .
I used to wonder — and still do wonder somewhat — why you ca n’t just grab a big handful of beans , line them up , and chop off the ends with a sharp knife ?
Why spend the time snapping them ?
Is it just to feel old fashioned and traditional ?
Or is there some practical benefit to snapping the end ?
I think it might be so that one can tear off the tough string if one is present … but I ’d prefer to think of the whole thing as a conspiracy to cause homemakers to spend as much time as possible in the kitchen .
It ’s all a conspiracy , I know it !
The next thing they ’ll want us to do is tie a grosgrain ribbon in our hair and wear an eyelet apron .
And bring our husbands his slippers when he walks in the door .
And call him “ dear . ”
Okay , so I already do that stuff .
But only because I want to .
So anyway , snap off the end if you must .
Hyacinth would like me to tell you that she does it that way because Granny did .
Hyacinth is such a follower .
Some people snap off both ends , but it is n’t necessary .
And that ’s it !
That ’s how I make my fresh green beans .
Now go feed them to your family and ENJOY !
Goodbye .
Oh , I just love doing that .
Okay , you ’re also going to want to chop up some red bell pepper and onion .
We used about 1 /2 to 3/4 cup of red pepper and 1 cup onion .
Begin by plopping about 2 tablespoons bacon grease in a skillet over medium low – medium heat .
Yes , I said bacon grease .
Yes , I said bacon grease .
I ’m sorry , but it tastes magical and there ’s just nothing like it .
But if you ’d prefer to stay away from its grasp , use 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter .
The butter will provide some nice color and flavor .
But I think you should use bacon grease .
If for no other reason than none of your neighbors are .
It ’s important to be different !
Next , chop or press 2 cloves of garlic and add it to the skillet .
Note the tiny bits of bacon that were present in the bacon grease .
Yikes .
Is that even legal ?
Then add in the onion , stirring around and cooking it for a moment .
Now add the green beans …
1 cup of chicken broth …
And the red pepper .
Stir it around …
Then add 1/2 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon kosher salt .
Hyacinth used 1 teaspoon and it was plenty salty … but that was part of what made it so good .
Also add in some black pepper to taste .
NOW — important : Turn the heat to low / medium low and cover with a lid , but CRACK THE LID so the steam escapes .
Cook for 20 - 30 minutes until the liquid totally evaporates and the beans are fairly soft , but still have a bit of a bite to them .
Do n’t be afraid to let the chicken broth cook away , because the onions and beans will begin to caramelize , which means flavor - flavor - flavor !
Here ’s what they looked like about 15 minutes into cooking .
Notice the chicken broth has fled the scene .
And here ’s the finished product .
Absolutely , positively delicious , and I ai n’t lyin’ .
The beans were definitely cooked but still slightly crisp , and the onions and red pepper were caramelized and beautiful .
And the flavor of the bacon grease was definitely there .
Here was a surprising development : our kids — all seven of the little punk whippersnappers — loved them .
They gathered around the platter one by one and soon it was a mass of kid fingers , grabbing individual green beans as if their lives depended on it .
Marlboro Man even joined in the swarm .
Then I grabbed a wooden spoon and began rapping knuckles .
Hey , I would n’t have gotten my fair share otherwise .
These green beans are good , folks !
They ’re really that good .
Fresh Green Beans , One Way
1 lb green beans
1 cup chopped onion
2 cloves garlic
1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
2 tablespoons bacon grease ( can substitute 1 T butter and 1 T olive oil )
1 cup chicken broth
1/2 to 1 teaspoon kosher salt ( can substitute regular table salt ; use 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon )
Ground black pepper
Snap the stem ends of green beans , or cut them off in a big bunch with a knife if you ’d like .
Just do n’t tell Granny .
Melt bacon grease in a skillet over medium low heat .
Add garlic and onions and cook for a minute .
Then add green beans and cook for a minute until beans turn bright green .
Add the chicken broth , chopped red pepper , salt , and black pepper .
Turn heat to low and cover with a lid , leaving lid cracked to allow steam to escape .
Cook for 20 to 30 minutes or until liquid evaporates and beans are fairly soft , yet still a bit crisp .
You can add more chicken broth during the cooking process , but do n’t be afraid to let it all cook away so the onions and peppers can caramelize .
Have a wooden spoon handy to protect your fair share .

The United States of America is the Next Argentina
DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA SAVE YOUR TEARS FOR YOURSELF - While bankers do control the issuance of credit , they cannot control themselves .
Bankers are the fatal flaw in their deviously opaque system that has substituted credit for money and debt for savings .
The bankers have spread their credit - based system across the world by catering to basic human needs and ambition and greed ; and while human needs can be satisfied , ambition and greed cannot — and the bankers ' least of all .
I have a bad feeling about what 's about to happen .
The Great Depression is the closest that comes to mind .
I , like most , was not alive during the 1930s when it happened .
Nonetheless , what once was feared in private is now being discussed in public .
It 's going to be bad .
It 's going to make high school seem like fun .
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE NEXT ARGENTINA
This Time is Different : A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises by University of Maryland ‘s Carmen Reinhart and Harvard 's Kenneth Rogoff makes for perfect reading when flying between the US and Argentina .
There is perhaps no better analysis than Reinhart and Rogoff's on the history of sovereign defaults ; and , as such , Reinhart and Rogoff 's paper was ideal reading material when traveling between the US and Argentina , for the sovereign defaults that happened in the past to Argentina will soon be happening to the US .
But a US default will make Argentina 's debt defaults pale both by comparison and consequence .
The US , unlike Argentina , is the world 's largest economy , the issuer of the world 's reserve currency and the world 's largest debtor — and a default by the US on its debt will shake the very foundations of our increasingly fragile global economy .
SOVERIGN DEBT LIQUIDATING
AMBITION
The power of ambition is extraordinary .
The power of ambition transformed the US from the world 's only creditor after WWII into the world 's largest debtor in less than fifty years .
Wanting to emulate England 's 19 th century empire in the 20 th , the US instead has mirrored England decline in the 20 th century here in the 21 st .
Credit and borrowing fueled America 's ambitions in the 20 th century as it had England 's in the 18 th and 19 th .
During the 1980s , to pay for President Reagan expansion of the military , the US quadrupled its national debt in less than a decade by borrowing three trillion dollars during a presidency pledged to balance the budget .
When Reagan took office , US debt totaled one trillion dollars .
When Reagan left office , US debt totaled four trillion dollars .
Reagan 's vaunted slogan of fiscal conservatism was just that — a slogan ; and while talk is cheap , the debts now have to be repaid .
Just as the costs of WWI forced England to abandon the gold standard in the early 1900s , post WWII military spending forced the US to suspend the convertibility of the US dollar to gold in 1971 ; and the consequences , e.g. burgeoning trade deficits and global currency instability , are now putting unsustainable strains on a financial system already in extremis .
Ambition has its price and the bill is now due and owing .
The question is : how will the US pay what it owes ?
In Hyman Minsky 's Financial Instability Model , the US is close to “ Ponzi status ” if not already there since the US is having to roll its debt forward and borrow from others to pay the interest as it can no longer pay down the principle .
In 2006 , in an article published by the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank , Professor Laurence Kotlikoff stated the US was “ technically bankrupt ” as there was no way the US could pay the $ 65.9 trillion it owed .
Evidently , Professor Kotlikoff was conservative in his estimate or we 're going downhill faster than he knew .
Just three months ago , on May 28 , 2008 Richard W. Fisher , President and CEO of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank estimated the obligations of the US to be actually $ 99.2 trillion , 50 % higher than Kotlikoff 's figures .
Fisher stated :
In the distance , I see a frightful storm brewing in the form of untethered government debt .
I choose the words — “ frightful storm ” — deliberately to avoid hyperbole .
Unless we take steps to deal with it , the long - term fiscal situation of the federal government will be unimaginably more devastating to our economic prosperity than the subprime debacle and the recent debauching of credit markets that we are now working so hard to correct .
Fisher should know what the US owes and the danger that sum represents .
As President and CEO of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank , Fisher is a part of the Federal Reserve
System — the very system that has indebted America into perpetuity when its credit - based money forced out gold and silver based money in 1913 .
But in his speech Fisher said nothing about the role the Federal Reserve has played in America 's fatal dance with debt , warning instead about the increasing costs of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare .
Fisher is part of a larger effort to now blame America 's entitlements as the primary cause of our problems , assiduously avoiding the role his own Federal Reserve Bank has played in sinking our once wealthy nation into perpetual indebtedness .
In truth , the entitlement program that poses the greatest threat to America is — and always has been — the Federal Reserve System .
Without the Federal Reserve 's credit - based money whose compounding interest ( paid to the bankers ) is obliged to be paid for by a possibly unconstitutional US income tax [ note : the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Income
Tax were both instituted the same year in 1913 ] , the US would not be indebted and bankrupt as it is now .
If Ben Bernanke and Richard Fisher et. al. at the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank resigned and stopped plundering the US for their own benefit at the expense of the public in order to line the pockets of their banker friends with public funds , the US might have a chance of successfully getting out of this mess .
But , of course , they wo n't and the now privately controlled US government will continue to indebt the American public so insiders can continue to profit immensely at the public trough .
But the question still remains , how will the US pay its unpayable debt ?
The answer is as clear as it is obvious .
It wo n't because it can't .
DEBT & DESTRUCTION SOUTH OF THE BORDER
In their well - researched paper , Serial Defaults and Its Remedies , Reinhart and Rogoff write “ Cycles in capital flows to emerging markets have now been with us for two hundred years ” .
If we are to understand the dynamics of serial default , it would do us well to look at these cycles and their relevance to what is happening today .
Serial Defaults and Its Remedies , Section 2 . Capital Flow Cycles and the Syndrome of “ This Time Is Different ” :
.. a pattern of borrowing followed by crisis is evident in the string of defaults during 1826 - 28 in Latin America that come on the heels of the first wave of massive capital flows from Britain into Latin America in 1822 - 25 … A second wave of capital flows from Britain came during the 1850s and 1860s .
The cycle ended with the crisis of 1873 .
The next wave of capital flows into emerging markets coincided with the shift of the financial epicenter of the world from London to New York .
Among Latin American countries , the borrowing binge of 1925 - 28 was [ financed ] with “ cheap ” money from New York .
Capital flows peaked in 1928 , the year before the U.S. Stock market crash ushered in financial and currency crises around the world and eventually an international debt crisis during 1929 - 33 .
Argentina is at the very epicenter of Latin America borrowings and defaults and a cursory judgment may well lay the blame for such on Argentina .
But understanding the past is akin to sedimentary sampling and a deeper reading of events reveals far more than the too familiar story of a spendthrift deadbeat nation borrowing more than prudence would otherwise dictate .
The capital flows from England and the US in the last two hundred years to Latin America were flows of credit , not money .
The distinction is critical in understanding what has happened during the last two centuries .
It explains the basis of the British Empire and current American power .
It also explains the exploitation of Argentina .
The British Empire was founded on the central bank invention of credit - based money and the subsequent ability to substitute this new “ money ” for costly gold and silver ; and the issuance of paper money allegedly backed by gold and silver is a critical component in the confidence game of central bankers to pass off their printed coupons as the real thing .
What the private bankers accomplished with the creation of the Bank of England was the government 's “ legitimization ” of the bankers ' new credit based coupons , sic paper money — coupons upon which the private bankers could now charge interest just as they had when loaning actual gold ( what a wonderful scam ) .
The new coupons were a lot easier to come by , especially when the king gave them a monopoly over its issuance .
The advantage to the king was that the king now had an unlimited supply of “ money ” that could be used to finance his wars — wars which led to the establishment of the British Empire ; the cost of which was transferred directly as a burden to the people as the new counterfeit debt - based money was now an obligation of the state , not of the king .
This was the genesis ( genius to the bankers and government ) of the modern income tax where the people are forced to pay interest on the credit - based money issued by their own government .
This was also the beginning of credit - based markets , deceptively called capitalism in order to closely identify the newly counterfeit credit based economy with the real money it had replaced .
CAPITALISM THE SPREAD OF DEBT IN DISGUISE
The flow of credit from England and then from its surrogate successor , the US , to developing nations such as Argentina was but the flow of printed coupons designed to harness and indebt the wealth and productivity of new lands .
The “ capital ” was really only credit , thinly disguised debt in the form of paper money originally issued by central banks , the Bank of England in Britain and the Federal Reserve Bank in the US , the twin towers of monetary Mordor .
The wonderfully sounding idea of unfettered capitalism is but a smokescreen for bankers to leverage their coupons in the form of credit and thereby indebt and control the productivity and wealth of others .
As such , it has accomplished its goal admirably but its success will now cost the bankers dearly .
Three centuries of indebting nations , businesses , and the citizenry with constantly compounding debt is no longer sustainable .
This is why central bankers in London , New York , Paris , and Tokyo are in such distress .
Debtors can no longer pay their debts , defaults are on the rise and bankers may actually have to find real jobs if their confidence game continues to disintegrate .
BANKERS ' FEARS
Lawrence Summers ' credentials as a banker are impeccable .
Educated at MIT and Harvard in economics , Summers has served as Chief Economist for the World Bank , US Secretary of the Treasury and President of Harvard University .
Recently , in March 2008 , Summers stated :.. we are facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses that the U.S. has faced in a generation -- and possibly , much longer than that …
It 's a grave mistake to believe in the self - equilibrating properties of economies in the face of large shocks .
Markets balance fear and greed .
And when fear takes over , the capacity for self - stabilization is not one that can be relied upon .
On June 29 , 2008 the Financial Times quoted Summers : ... we are in an economic environment where we have more to fear than fear itself …
Lawrence Summer 's fears are not to be taken lightly .
They are the banker 's equivalent of Jim Cramer 's televised fit of fear when interviewed on CNBC last year , see http://www.youtube.com/watch?
While Summers is rightfully fearful of the current economic environment , the rest of us have far more to fear from bankers like Lawrence Summers and others like him .
Summer 's role in the manipulation of the price of gold is found in his 1988 paper Gibson 's Paradox and the Gold Standard co-authored with Robert Barsky , published in the Journal of Political Economy ( vol. 96 , June 1988 , pp. 528-550 ) .
The hubris of bankers such as Summers is stunning .
Fixing the price of gold hoping to control interest rates and prices is like fixing the temperature of thermometers hoping to control global warming .
Such is the short reach of Summers ' considerable intellect .
EVIL BANKERS FACT OR FICTION ?
But the real danger of bankers like Lawrence Summers lies not in their untethered intellect but in their cold ambition and selfish greed that sees nations and people as but living fodder to be milked , used and discarded as they and others profit .
In 1991 , Summers issued the following memo while serving as Chief Economist at the World Bank :
… developed countries ought to export more pollution to developing countries because these countries would incur the lowest cost from the pollution in terms of lost wages of people made ill or killed by the pollution due to the fact that wages are so low in developing countries … the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that .
As the World Bank 's Chief Economist , Summer 's memo is a chilling reflection of the heartlessness that lies at the core of bankers and banking establishments .
The World Bank itself seems to be a favorite watering hole for those of questionable intent .
Robert McNamara , the architect of the Vietnam War was President of the World Bank as was Paul Wolfowitz , the architect of the Iraq War .
The current President of the World Bank , Robert Zoellick , is also an ardent supporter of the Iraq War ( also on Zoellick 's considerable list of “ credits ” is his service as advisor to Enron , his membership on the Council on Foreign Relations and Trilateral Commission and his attendance at the secretive Bilderberg meetings from 1991 to the present and his role as Senior International Advisor to investment bank Goldman Sachs ) .
It is no coincidence that those heading the World Bank are closely associated with America 's vast war machine .
Bankers have profited from fueling the military ambitions of both England and the US for the past two centuries and continue to do so today .
But perhaps the most damning indictment yet of the World Bank and today 's bankers is John Perkins 's Confessions of an Economic Hitman ( Barrett Koehler , 2004 ) in which Perkins reveals the hidden intent of the World Bank and US bankers to cold - bloodedly indebt third world countries such as Argentina and profit by their misery .
In their review of Confessions of an Economic Hitman , Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman write :
Remember Smedley Butler ?
He was perhaps the most decorated Major General in Marine Corps history .
In the early part of this century , he fought and killed for the United States around the world .
Butler was awarded two Congressional Medals of Honor .
Then , when he returned to the United States he wrote a book titled “ War Is A Racket ” which opens with the memorable lines : “ War is a racket .
It always has been . ”
“ I was a high class muscleman for Big Business , for Wall Street and for the Bankers , ” Butler said .
“ In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism . ”
In a speech in 1933 , Butler said the following :
“ I helped make Mexico , especially Tampico , safe for American oil interests in 1914 .
I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in .
I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street .
The record of racketeering is long .
I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909 - 1912 .
I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests in 1916 .
In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested . ”
Smedley Butler , meet John Perkins .
Perkins has just written a book , “ Confessions of an Economic Hit Man ” ( Barrett Koehler , 2004 ) .
It is the War is A Racket for our times .
Some of it is hard to believe .
You be the judge .
In 1968 , after graduating from Boston University , Perkins joined the Peace Corps and was sent to Ecuador .
There , he was recruited by the National Security Agency ( NSA ) and hired by an international consulting firm , Chas .
T. Main in Boston .
Soon after beginning his job in Boston , “ I was contacted by a woman named Claudine who became my trainer as an economic hit man . ”
Perkins assumed the woman worked for the NSA .
“ She said she was sent to help me and to train me , ” Perkins said .
“ She is extremely beautiful , sensual , seductive , intelligent .
Her job was to convince me to become an economic hit man , holding out these three drugs –- sex , drugs and money .
And then she wanted to let me know that I was getting into a dirty business .
And I should n't go off on my first assignment , which was going to be Indonesia , and start doing this unless I knew that I was going to continue doing it , and once I was in I was in for life . ”
Perkins worked for Main from 1970 to 1980 .
His job was to convince the governments of the third world countries and the banks to make deals where huge loans were given to these countries to develop infrastructure projects .
And a condition of the loan was that a large share of the money went back to the big construction companies in the USA – the Bechtels and Halliburtons .
The loans would plunge the countries into debts that would be impossible to pay off .
“ The system is set up such that the countries are so deep in debt that they can't repay their debt , ” Perkins said .
“ When the U.S. government wants favors from them , like votes in the United Nations or troops in Iraq , or in many , many cases , their resources – their oil , their canal , in the case of Panama , we go to them and say – look , you can't pay off your debts , therefore sell your oil at a very low price to our oil companies .
Today , tremendous pressure is being put on Ecuador , for example , to sell off its Amazonian rainforest -– very precious , very fragile places , inhabited by indigenous people whose cultures are being destroyed by the oil companies . ”
When a leader of a country refuses to cooperate with economic hit men like Perkins , the jackals from the CIA are called in .
Perkins said that both Omar Torrijos of Panama and Jaime Boldos of Ecuador -– both men he worked with – refused to play the game with the U.S. and both were cut down by the CIA -– Torrijos when his airplane blew up , and Roldos when his helicopter exploded , within three months of each other in 1981 .
If the CIA jackals do n't do the job , then the U.S. Marines are sent in –- Butler 's “ racketeers for capitalism . ”
Perkins also gives lurid details of how he pimped for a Saudi prince in the 1970s , in an effort to get the Saudi royal family to enter an elaborate deal in which the U.S. would protect the House of Saud .
In exchange , the Saudis agreed to stabilize oil prices and use their oil money to purchase Treasury bonds , the interest on which would be used to pay U.S. construction firms like Bechtel to build Saudi cities .
For years , Perkins wanted to stop being an economic hit man and write a tell - all book .
He quit Main in 1980 , only to be lured back with megabucks as a consultant .
He testified in favor of the Seabrook Nuclear power plant ( “ my most infamous assignment ” ) in the 1980s , but the experience pushed him out of the business , and he started an alternative energy firm .
When word got out in the 1990s that he was starting to write a tell - all book , he was approached by the president of Stone & Webster , a big engineering firm .
Over seven years , Stone & Webster paid Perkins $ 500,000 to do nothing .
“ At that first meeting , the president of the company mentioned some of the books that I had written about indigenous people and said –- that 's nice , that 's fine , keep doing your non-profit work , ” Perkins told us .
“ We approve of that , but you certainly would never write about this industry , would you ?
And I assured him that I would n't . ”
Perkins assumes the money was a bribe to get him not to write the book .
But he has written the book .
You be the judge .
Evil bankers ?
Fact or Fiction ?
You be the judge .
DEFAULT OR JUST DEADBEATS
While Reinhart's and Rogoff 's work on sovereign default is worthwhile and important , their glaring avoidance of the geopolitical aspect of credit flows from England and the US to Latin America and other developing regions is indicative of the blind eye scholars turn to the activities of those who pay them .
Lawrence Summers was President of Harvard University where Kenneth Rogoff is now employed .
It is not likely those who hired the likes of Summers would look kindly upon Rogoff should he begin asking questions whose answers would lead to truths Harvard 's trustees would rather not see the light of day .
So instead of dealing with the critical issues raised by John Perkins , Reinhart and Rogoff consider the phenomena of sovereign defaults as an innocent rite of passage much like high school through which developing economies must pass .
Perhaps it is so , perhaps not .
But their “ trained ” eye wanders a bit , even to an untrained eye such as mine .
According to Reinhart and Rogoff , the US is a “ default virgin ” , sic the US has never missed a debt repayment or rescheduled on at least one occasion .
While this is strictly so , the US is nonetheless at the center of the largest default in monetary history .
In the 1970s , the US defaulted on its gold obligations under the Bretton - Woods Agreement .
After overspending the greatest hoard of gold in history , 21,775 tons , between 1949 and 1971 , the US had 7,000 - 8,000 tons of gold left and still owed perhaps over 31,000 tons to others .
In 1973 , when the US officially refused to convert US dollars held by other countries to gold , it was the biggest monetary default ever .
In that one act , as a consequence the entire global monetary system shifted from a gold - based system to a fiat - paper system .
Of the US default on its gold obligations , Professor Antal Fekete wrote in June 2008 :
http://www.professorfekete.com/articles%5CAEFItsNotADollarCrisisItsAGoldCrisis.pdf
Thirty - five years ago gold , symbol of permanence , was chased out from the Monetary Garden of Eden , replaced by the floating irredeemable dollar as the pillar of the international monetary system .
That 's right : a floating pillar .
The gold demonetization exercise was a farce .
It was designed as a fig leaf to cover up the ugly default of the U.S. government on its gold - redeemable sight obligations to foreigners .
The word ‘ default ' itself was put under taboo even though it punctured big holes in the balance sheet of every central bank of the world , as its dollar - denominated assets sank in value in terms of anything but the dollar itself .
These banks were not even allowed to say ‘ ouch ' as they were looking at the damage to their balance sheets caused by the default .
They just had to swallow the loss , obediently and dutifully join the singing of the Hallelujah Chorus of sycophants in Washington praising the irredeemable dollar and the Nirvana of synthetic credit .
Debt virgin ?
Hardly , and whether the US defaulted or not is not just a question of semantics , it is a matter of truth — which , like credit , is now surprisingly hard to come by .
THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT
Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff 's paper , This Time It 's Different , refers to the idea that sovereign defaults are a thing of the past .
That we have somehow fixed what was wrong and it wo n't happen again .
Reinhart and Rogoff think otherwise .
But this time , in a different way it really is different .
This time default will come to both banker and debtor alike .
The bankers ' system itself is now collapsing under the weight of debt that the bankers ' debt - based money has produced .
Banks are finding themselves increasingly bankrupt as are the governments the bankers used to debase the world 's currencies .
This time , not only will Argentina possibly suffer another sovereign default , so too will its creditor , the US , as will many of the US banks that issued that debt .
The default of the US will remain , however , outside the limited definition of default used by Reinhart and Rogoff .
The US will not miss a payment or reschedule its debt .
Unlike Argentina , the US prints the currency in which the Argentine and US debt is denominated .
The US will print its way out of its debts .
Argentina cannot .
Because of the enormity of the US debt , the amount of dollars necessary to print to pay down the debt will lead to the hyperinflation in the US and the destruction of the US dollar .
Those who live by the sword sometimes die by the sword — though not often .
In that same article where Professor Kotlikoff estimated US liabilities to be $ 65.9 trillion , Kotlikoff also wrote :
The United States .. appears to be running the same type of fiscal policies that engendered hyperinflations in 20 countries over the past century .
Maybe this time it is n't different ..
DON'T CRY FOR ME ARGENTINA
SAVE YOUR TEARS FOR YOURSELF
In 1976 , the Argentine military overthrew the democratically elected Argentine government .
The first to recognize the dictatorship was the US .
The second was the International Monetary Fund , and within 24 hours of recognizing the soon - to - be most brutal regime in recent history , the IMF arranged a loan to the military junta .
At the time , Argentina 's external debt totaled $ 7 billion .
When the bloody dictatorship ended with the return of democracy six years later , Argentina 's debt totaled $ 43 billion , a debt owed mainly to US banks .
The common law concept of caveat emptor has particular relevance here , caveat emptor — Latin , “ let the buyer beware " , is a legal precept that buyers must take responsibility for the conditions under which the sale was made .
If you loan to a dictatorship , do n't expect to be repaid if a democracy emerges .
Richard Perle , former US Assistant Secretary of Defense and neoconservative lobbyist
Richard Perle who supported the Iraq
War said those words shortly after the US invaded Iraq .
While it is doubtful Perle believes the same applies for debts incurred by the US supported dictatorship in Argentina , the truth of Perle 's words extend beyond Perle 's situational principles or a lack thereof .
In a court of law , an illegal contract cannot be enforced — unless , of course , the court has been bought off .
A critical distinction between the debt “ owed ” by Argentina and the debts owed by the US is that Argentina 's debt was illegally imposed upon Argentina by the IMF , the US and international bankers without the consent of the Argentine citizenry , The US debt , however , was incurred with the consent of the American people — or was it ?
That , my fellow Americans , is a $ 99.2 trillion question .
BANKRUPT BE THE BONDS THAT BIND
Americans with their outstanding obligations now measured in trillions of dollars of outstanding US bonds have much in common with the Argentine people .
We have both been enslaved and bankrupted by the same financial system .
While it is impossible for the debt burdened Argentines to do something about US banks , it is not impossible for Americans to do so .
The US Federal Reserve Bank — the largest emitter of debt - based money in the world — while not an official US government agency is nonetheless still subject to the rules and laws of our land .
STIRRINGS IN THE ELECTORATE
Dissatisfaction , the beginning of change , is now occurring .
The two political polarities are finally awakening to the fact that both have been callously used by those in power .
The US has lurched right then left then right again , but it continues to go in the same disturbing direction , a direction now equally distasteful to those on the left and on the right .
In modern democracies , successful politicians must possess two qualities :
They must say what the people want to hear and they must do what those in power want done .
It has been easy to manipulate those on the right as well as those on the left .
The Republicans and Democrats have done so for years .
But where 's the beef ?
The nation 's finances have been even more badly managed by the Republicans than the Democrats — and Iraq ?
Sure , vote for the Democrats and stay mired in a conflict they promised they would end .
Both parties are controlled by the same money , the same money that now controls global governments and institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF , the same money that buys politicians , scholars , the military , lawyers , TV anchors , radio talk show hosts and anyone else whose influence they can use for their own ends .
There is a reason why we are indebted as we are and there is a reason why we are mired in a war that one wants except the few that do , the few that now control our nation and many others .
In the midst of this most unreasonable world , there are reasons — whether you want to know them or not .
Humanity now finds itself at the beginning of a profound shift , a shift that will force us — if we are to survive , if we are to triumph — to put aside our differences to accomplish together what we obviously cannot accomplish apart .
The two political polarities must find common ground or they will soon find there is no ground at all .
What is happening is bigger than money and power although it involves both .
It involves humanity , it involves all of us and unless we find each other we will soon find there will be nothing left to find at all .
We are closer to the end than to the beginning .
Keep your own counsel .
Buy gold and silver .
Keep the faith .
In Argentina , I read in a recent issue of Scientific American that physicists now believe that in the beginning of time the Universe was only one centimeter across .
That knowledge heartened me .
We have come a long way .
Note : I will be speaking at Professor Fekete 's last session of Gold Standard University Live to be held in Canberra , Australia from November 11 th to the 14 th .
The focus of the session will be trading the gold and silver basis for profit .

About Darryl Robert Schoon
In college , I majored in political science with a focus on East Asia ( B.A. University of California at Davis , 1966 ) .
My in - depth study of economics did not occur until much later .
In the 1990s , I became curious about the Great Depression and in the course of my study , I realized that most of my preconceptions about money and the economy were just that - preconceptions .
I , like most others , did not really understand the nature of money and the economy .
Now , I have some insights and answers about these critical matters .
In October 2005 , Marshall Thurber , a close friend from law school convened The Positive Deviant Network ( the PDN ) , a group of individuals whom Marshall believed to be " out - of - the - box " thinkers and I was asked to join .
The PDN became a major catalyst in my writings on economic issues .
When I discovered others in the PDN shared my concerns about the US economy , I began writing down my thoughts .
In March 2007 I presented my findings to the Positive Deviant Network in the form of an in - depth 148 - page analysis , " How to Survive the Crisis and Prosper In The Process . "
The reception to my presentation , though controversial , generated a significant amount of interest ; and in May 2007 , " How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process " was made available at www.survivethecrisis.com and I began writing articles on economic issues .
The interest in the book and my writings has been gratifying .
During its first two months , www.survivethecrisis.com was accessed by over 10,000 viewers from 93 countries .
Clearly , we had struck a chord and www.drschoon.com , has been created to address this interest .

We knew that the Air Force Cyber Command is supposed to fight against enemy computer attacks using their skillz , computer programs , and massive PlayStation 3s networks .
Now Christian Lowe at Defense
Tech reveals that , if they can't stop the attacks using a terminal , the US military hackers can actually order a cruise missile attack or drop a couple of MK84 bombs on the hacker at the other side of the line .
Or like Col. Tony Buntyn , vice commander of Air Force Cyber Command , euphemistically refers to as " kinetic warfare . "
You can find , fix , target , and engage an enemy .
A target could be a [ computer ] network ... or it could be physical , with a [ geographical ] location .
But we need the capabilities , just like we have in kinetic warfare , to engage targets when necessary .
It could be either a kinetic or non-kinetic effect you want to achieve .
And we need the ability to provide either .
It depends on our target ; it depends on our rules of engagement — are we conducting open warfare with an adversary ?
If that 's the case , then we do n't really need to be discreet about it .
When we drop a JDAM [ Joint DIrect Attack Munition aka " big mofo guided bomb " ] and leave a big smoking hole , that 's not very discreet .
If I can [ locate ] it and I can take it out with a kinetic attack ... and it meets the rules of engagement , then that might be the preferred method .
Google plans to set up an 8,000 square foot headquarters at the Democratic convention this year to enable hundreds of bloggers to better cover the event .
Around 500 citizen journos attending the convention in Denver each paid $ 100 to use the facilities , which include Google software and services and a public kiosk where anyone can upload videos to YouTube – hard to believe , but this will be the first presidential year for Google 's video sharing service , which debuted in 2005 .
Google will also be demoing new tools , including a real - time keyword search of convention speech videos .
Two hundred are signed up for the GOP convention in Minneapolis - St.
Paul , where they will offer similar facilities .
The Google media denizens will be competing with nearly
15,000 MSM reporters deployed to cover the conventions , which some media critics have deemed a “ waste . ”
The networks spend millions on these increasingly newsless events and while print outlets shell out considerably less it still costs them considerably more for the infrastructure the " amateurs " are getting for a single Benjamin .
From a signal to noise ratio , that seems to make a whole lot more sense .
Washington Post and Newsweek announced yesterday that they will be experimenting with some new media themselves , with their correspondents live streaming video from cell phones , in a bid to tap into that massive market of those who favor raw viral videos over packaged pieces .
But even though it just means more reporters descending on a non-event this is n't just more of a bad thing , since it could be among the driving forces that eventually cause a total re-think of what is news and how it " has " to be covered .
Google , which coyly continues to eschew the notion that it is a media company , is greasing the skids of a what could some day ( another four years ? ) lead to a paradigm shift :
This is a direct challenge to the pro press corps on strategy and tactics as well a competition for the stories and tidbits that actually will resonate from the hall but to define .
Our money in on the " amateurs " to both make and break news .

There is a new poll in the sidebar folks .
This one is about Content Management Systems ( CMS ) .
There was a pretty good comment thread going a little while ago which sparked the idea for this poll .
I ’ve always been a WordPress guy , and now with the ability to easily create different page templates for different page styles , I feel like it really has evolved into a “ real ” CMS instead of just a blogging platform .
However , I am extremely curious and interested in other CMSs and what they have to offer .
To me , it seems like Drupal or Joomla would be a smarter route to take if you were creating a site that was segmented into different major areas , each with kind of a life of it ’s own .
For example , DZone has sub-sites like Javalobby and Eclipse Zone .
Each of these have different leaders , different RSS feeds , different looks …
I think that would be hard to do with WordPress , much easier with Drupal .
Am I right ?
Cast your vote in the sidebar and let ’s see which CMS reins supreme favorite amongst CSS - Tricks readers .
Remember you can view and participate in past polls on the Polls page .
There 's only one patientcable .com domain .
Once purchased , it may never become available again .
Regular readers may have noticed that I occasionally get hostile comments in my blog .
I would be shocked if I did n’t – in fact I would worry that I was not doing my job if I did not regularly infuriate the purveyors of nonsense and promoters of anti-science .
I frequently respond , even to the most inane of such comments , if I think it will be instructive to point out common fallacies and misconceptions .
Sometimes I view comments from a sociological point of view – they may demonstrate a social phenomenon worthy of discussion .
I recently received this comment in response to my blog on facilitated communication .
Gigi Jordon ( writing as “ Holly Light ” ) commits so many fallacies that any meaningful treatment requires a separate blog entry , so here it is .
She begins :
Hey Steve Novella ,
What a load of arrogant pseudoscientific self aggrandizing tripe .
Truly !……..
First of all I used to observe from an relatively anonymous standpoint patients being seen at the most elite levels of academic medicine on the east coast over a period of 10 years being treated for lets say motor neuropathies .
These patients , inevitably would become frustrated with the limits of either the treatments offered or the bedside manor of their physicians or some combination of both , and go to another equally pedigreed academic neurologist say ………. Latov or Dalakis , et. all ………… .
It was a big joke among my cohorts at the time that every time the patient switched to a new big wig in academic neurology , say every 3 - 5 years on average , and for the lay audience , I ’m talking the best neurologic specialists in this highly specialized field of medicine in the world , people Steve Novella would look up to by the way ……..
The patient would get a new diagnosis !
MMN ( multi motor neuropathy ) ,
No wait – now it ’s CIDP !
( chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy ) , no , no , wait its dermatomyocytis !
So brilliant are you all at the mental masturbatory facility of your “ science ” .
So very objective !
Holly opens up with the “ arrogant ” gambit .
This is a cheap shot that anti-intellectuals frequently trot out because it ’s easy .
Any pretense to knowledge can be attacked as “ elitist ” and “ arrogant ” – it is an attempt to get people on your side by implying , “ This person is not one of us regular folks , they think they are better than us . ”
It is a dismissive ad hominem logical fallacy – attempting to dismiss a person ’s position by attacking the person .
Here Holly is n’t even addressing the point of the blog post , facilitated communication , but rather is going off on an irrelevant rant about neuromuscular disease .
In her attempt to “ poison the well ” by denigrating me professionally and intellectually , she is attacking academia , scientific medicine , and my specialty .
At least she is exposing herself to any discriminating reader .
Holly also demonstrates the true arrogance of those who equate their tangential knowledge with expertise .
One theme I promote in this blog is proper humility when dealing with areas of knowledge in which one is not an expert .
This does not mean you cannot have an opinion – but one should fairly account for the consensus of expert opinion and be wary of those who casually dismiss it .
Holly seems to be impressed with her knowledge of neuromuscular disease , but demonstrates that ( as she admits ) she has the limited knowledge of an outsider who does not truly understand the subject .
She criticizes the fact that neuromuscular patients are often given different diagnoses by different recognized academic experts – as if this calls into question the entire field .
Here ’s the real story ( and just FYI – this is my particular area of expertise ) .
There is a category of diseases known as immune mediated neuropathies – auto - immune diseases in which nerves are the target .
All auto - immune diseases are difficult to categorized specifically because they are not discrete diagnostic entities – one disease tends to blend into the next .
This is particularly true of immune - mediated neuropathy .
Add to this is the fact that there are different ways to classify them – by clinical syndrome , by physiological characteristics on nerve conduction study , or by the presence of specific pathological antibodies .
These various classification schemes do not overlap very well – meaning that patients with the same antibody may have different clinical syndromes , for example .
For this reason there have been confused , evolving , and at times competing schemes for specifically classifying these diseases .
One person ’s MMN might be another person ’s CIDP .
But progress is slowly being made , and efforts are underway to standardize the diagnostic scheme as much as possible .
Further – the patients that are being referred from one specialist to another are the ones that are slipping through the cracks in the current diagnostic scheme .
If someone has typical MMN and responds to the accepted treatment for MMN – they do n’t get referred for a second opinion .
So Holly is referring to particularly challenging patients with a particularly challenging category of diagnoses .
She does not put her example into any meaningful context – I suspect because she does not understand the context , and she seems content with her self - serving interpretation and gives no evidence of having tried to understand the context .
And yet this is all supposed to vaguely call into question what ?
– scientific medicine ?
Holly continues :
Then let ’s move on to the vast array of medications that you utilize to treat these ( and all ) patients ( this will get to facilitated communication later my friends worry you not ! ) .
If you look at the PDR ( again to the lay audience , the “ bible ” of prescription medications it ’s basically listing of all of the FDA required information for approved prescription and over the counter medications in the US ) , and look under mechanism of action ( or how does this drug work ? ) , you will find that in over 85 % of the drugs in use today helping patients cope with disease , they ( read medical community ) have absolutely no idea how the drug works .
They usually venture a guess but are very cautious to disclaim not really knowing the true bio-physiological effect of the drug .
So they have no idea .
The ignorance false dichotomy – equating not knowing everything with knowing nothing .
And again this is just an attempt at impugning by association my arguments regarding facilitated communication .
The PDR is indeed a key reference for medications .
Holly calls it the “ bible ” of medications – which is an attempt to portray it as a dogmatic source , rather than a systematic reference of scientific data .
But she also does not get it quite right – there is a great deal of information on many medications not contained in the PDR .
The PDR contains essentially the official required FDA package insert of information for each drug , but many drug studies are done and published in the peer - reviewed journal outside the context of FDA approval .
In practice the PDR is just a slice of the scientific information on pharmacotherapy .
Holly ’s clearly stated point is to exaggerate the apparent ignorance of scientific medicine when it comes to drug mechanism .
This is a flawed line of reasoning on many levels .
I have already addressed that her factual premise – the PDR contains all relevant information – is wrong .
I also pointed out that she is equating lack of complete knowledge to “ they have no idea . ”
Let me address this point .
Any honest reading of the PDR – a thick and ever growing tome – reveals how incredibly much we do know ( at a minimum ) about all the drugs we prescribe .
The PDR is a testament to our vast knowledge , not our ignorance , as Holly would have you believe .
But it certainly is true that we do not know the precise mechanism of action of every drug .
That is not the same thing as having no idea , however .
For most drugs we at least know some or all of their physiological actions .
For example , we may know what receptors they bind to , the effect of the drug on that receptor , and the physiological function of that receptor .
We may not know , however , how that action has its ultimate effect on the symptom or disease that is being treated ( these are areas ripe for further research ) .
Also most drugs have more than one effect , and we simply may not know which effect is the important one for any specific application .
For the vast majority of drugs we have a great deal of information about how they work , and a good idea about their specific effects on the symptoms and diseases we use them to treat .
In fact many drugs are classified by their mechanism of action ( like beta - blockers , for example ) .
Others are classified by their use , but knowledge of their basic mechanism of action is key to their use .
I lecture on neuropharmacology and I emphasize the importance of understanding the known mechanisms of action of the drugs we use , while also recognizing the limits of our current knowledge .
Summarizing all this as “ we have no idea ” is absurd – it is the kind of statement that someone who is overly impressed with their own limited knowledge would make .
Now that she has mangled her premise , she follows up with the logical fallacy ( and another false premise ) :
In fact , in the “ old days ” ( think pre–1990 ’s ) the academic medical community actually had some balls and were willing to humbly defer to the fact that we do n’t and ca n’t know everything but should offer the benefit of exploiting and using drugs that are helpful even if we do n’t know exactly HOW they work .
Now , ( read post 1990 or so ) our cowardly doctors in the name ( and spirit of Novella above ) have taken up the shield of “ evidence based medicine ” to cower from pressure the insurance companies and HMO ’s , setting new standards for the use of new discoveries to not help patients saying it ’s not enough that a drug works , we have to know how it works to offer it to patients !
The truth is the doctors gave yup fighting the insurance companies using this new ” standard ” and adopted it as their own to not look as insipid and cowardly as they really are .
Give it a big harvard name “ evidence based ” and all is well , do n’t worry about what we ’re supposed to be doing in life like , oh yea curing disease .
just publish papers about nothing ( read of no clinical significance , i.e to help anyone get better or lead to true clinical advancement in treatment ) .
Then you ’ll do real well in medicine .
Oh , and then write some sniping articles about pseudoscientific practices like FC and sneer all the way home thinking how you do n’t make as much money as your fathers generation when adjusted for inflation – gee I wonder why ?
Here Holly is simply making stuff up – or regurgitating anti-scientific propaganda that others have made up .
This is a complete rewriting of history from a rather bizarre point of view .
First – the FDA does not require that any information pertaining the mechanism of action be presented in order to approve a drug ( which ironically was her previous point ) .
The FDA requires only that the drug is proven safe and effective for a specific indication .
That ’s it .
So it is simply not true that in the past we did not require knowledge of mechanism but now we do .
As long as there is adequate evidence for safety and efficacy it is reasonable to use a drug ( or any treatment ) .
Knowledge of mechanism makes it easier to use a drug rationally and effectively , and of course this also helps progress our medical knowledge , but it has never been a pre-requisite to accepting a treatment .
This is a straw man preferred by promoters of unscientific medicine – it is an attempt to make the rejection of their fake treatment or claims on the part of scientific medicine seem unreasonable .
But it is simply a fiction .
Next Holly completely misrepresents evidence - based medicine .
This is a new one on me – EBM was invented by the insurance companies and adopted by physicians out of laziness .
Wow .
That will come as a surprise to the Cochrane Collaboration .
The goal of EBM , ironically , is to focus on evidence for efficacy – not mechanism of action .
In fact , even more ironically , that is my primary criticism of EBM , that it does not adequately consider mechanism of action when dealing with highly improbable therapies .
Finally , Holly gets to FC :
Now to facilitated communication , Steve , motor planning 101 .
I had a friend who was a professor of psychiatry he was 80 at the time but still played tennis every week , unbelievable fit , looked like 60 .
So we used to meet and 1 week he does n’t show up .
Brusk message on my voice mail sounding irritated from him instead of apologetic about canceling after the fact .
Next week I go to meet him and I see him in his car outside the tennis club parked just sitting and not getting out of his car .
I go and knock on the window .
He looks startled and peels out of his parking spot leaving me in the street .
@ weeks later he ’s diagnosed with a frontal lobe tumor which was thankfully removed and he recovered nicely .
He later told me that he had been very irritable and found himself in multiple situations where he would go somewhere to do something and was then paralyzed in an inexplicable way from initiating the activity at hand , in my case it was getting out of the car .
He knew why he was there he knew what he wanted to do – HE COULDN ” T INITIATE THE VOLITIONAL ACTIVITY REQUIRED TO CONDUCT THE MOTOR PLAN STEVE .
Volitional inhibition , ever heard of it Steve ?
The list of specific dyspraxic disorders are legion .
So the crime of ignorance you commit as as an “ expert neurologist ” is harmful in the extreme to so many people locked in a world of silence by ill informed opinions that have given so little thought to the issues at at hand .
It annoys me to no end ( this I ’m certain you ARE aware of by now ) because your have the training and background of thought to give so much more sensitive consideration to the subject were you not blinded by arrogance .
You assume cognitive dysfunction where in fact there is nothing more than a global dyspraxia of volitional movement .
Just another ill defined motor disease Steve .
Holly ’s unstated major premise here is that disorders of communication are motor dyspraxias – the inability to speak due to a motor problem , even when the cognitive ability is there .
She gives a long wind - up to this basic premise , but it is all a huge non-sequitur .
Yes – there are many neurological disorders that involve a problem with the motor aspects of speech and not the cognitive aspects of language .
Neurologists are very careful to distinguish such things .
I treat many patients with various motor problems impairing speech , and there are a number of legitimate methods for helping them to communicate – none involve FC .
Other patients have impaired language – a cognitive impairment involving the language centers in the brain .
These patients require different interventions , like speech therapy , or augmenting their communication with non-verbal methods .
Again , FC is not useful .
And a third category have neither an isolated motor or language problem but an impairment of global cognition .
It may be their ability to think that is impaired – not their ability to express what they think .
What , exactly , is Holly ’s point ?
She does not make it clearly .
Is she saying that there is no such thing as a language disorder or global cognitive impairment ?
That all non-verbal patients have a motor problem and not a language problem ?
How does she presume to know this , and why should anyone think that her knowledge is superior to the experts in the field ?
Oh yeah – that ’s right .
Anyone who disagrees with her is an arrogant coward , while she has enough tangential knowledge to use the occasional technical term .
Even if she is only claiming that in some cases a motor disorder is mistaken for a language or cognitive disorder – again how would she know this and why would she presume that dedicated clinicians are not making a serious effort to make such distinctions .
She continues :
Of course they ca n’t be put in a stringent double blinded testing environment with a wall between their helper and them .
It ’s antithetical to the process .
That ’s like taking a post stroke patient who cant talk and trying to grill them in an “ objective testing environment ” to see whether gentle supportive encouragement and therapy to help them retrieve words and produce speech using patience and multisensory reinforcement helps them to talk .
But if they ca n’t perform as well when stripped of that support in a cold and advesarial testing , let ’s say sitting in a room with a tester being drilled on vocabulary , claiming that supportive speech therapy is a hoax if the patient did n’t perform nearly as well as within the confines of a known trusted speech therapist providing support and giving the person needed cues or time .
This is the “ My woo can not be tested by your cold indifferent science ” gambit .
This is a straw man and amounts to nothing more than a lame excuse for the absence of compelling scientific evidence for FC .
FC makes a specific claim – that the non-verbal client has hidden language ability that can be tapped into with help .
I have nothing a priori against this claim – I just recognize that it is important to find out if it is really true , in general and in specific cases .
This is especially important if allegations of sexual abuse are going to be based upon this assumption .
The claim of FC , ( again – in general and in specific cases ) can easily be tested – simply give specific information to the client while the facilitator is out of the room , then allow the facilitator to use FC in whatever way they feel comfortable to convey that information back .
No walls are necessary , no artificial controlled environment .
The only thing that needs to be controlled is the access of the facilitator to the information you are testing for .
When tested in this simple way , FC completely fails .
A rational response to this utter failure is to question the assumptions underlying FC .
An irrational , ideological , arrogant response is to rant about “ cold and adversarial testing . ”
She finishes :
Let ’s just throw out speech therapy too , why should we presume that the person has the cognitive ability to speak ?
Why because they did it before ……….. Ignorance guides your thinking about people with communicative dysfunction related to “ developmental delay ” .
They have voice you just refuse to hear it .
Let me see if I have her logic correct – we can know that people who lost the ability to speak have the cognitive ability to speak because they had it before they lost the ability to speak .
OK – but what if they lost the ability to speak because they lost the cognitive ability , and not just the motor ability ?
What if a patient has aphasia because a stroke destroyed the language center of their brain ?
That is not a motor problem – that is a language problem .
But also – this does not mean that there is no role for speech therapy – and all patients with aphasia do get speech therapy because the brain has plasticity and perhaps the aphasic patient may be able to recover some speech .
But sometimes they do n’t .
Holly then draws an analogy between someone who was cognitively normal at baseline and then suffered a stroke or some damage to their language center and those who are developmentally delayed .
She seems to be concluding that we should therefore assume that even those who have a completely distinct neurological situation ( developmental delay ) also have normal cognition and an isolated impairment of language .
She gives no justification for this assumption .
Common sense tells us that such an assumption is not warranted , and this is backed up by the evidence .
I , on the other hand , am not making any assumptions that any individual does have impaired cognition .
My education and experience tells me that every permutation is out there – including those who have relatively normal cognition but impaired communication or language , as well as those who have impaired communication because they have impaired cognition .
Each individual needs to be assessed individually .
Holly is just dodging the real question by attacking her straw man .
The question is – in any situation does FC work ?
How can we be sure that the facilitator is not the one doing the communicating ?
Holly and other FC apologists would have you believe that by asking such questions we are being cold , we are refusing to listen to the evidence , and we are being mean to these children .
The truth is , not asking these critical questions is neglectful , irresponsible , and sometimes tragic .
I want people with all kinds of neurological impairments and challenges to be helped by methods that actually work – ones that are based upon science , not wishful thinking and sloppy logic .
Is this the best I can do ?
I ’ve paid for the rent and the furnishings and the menus and the staff and the insurance … is this plate of food worthy of what went before it ?
I ’ve flown across the country to visit this museum–a building that cost more than a billion dollars to create and fill and maintain .
Is my attention focused enough ?
We paid $ 300 in marketing costs just to get this phone to ring this one time .
How shall we answer it ?
I ’ve had a great education , suffered and scraped and scrounged to get this point … is this diagnosis , this surgery , this prescription , this bedside manner the end that justifies that effort ?
We live in a stable democracy , a place where people have lived and died to give us the freedom to speak out … is that talking head or this spinning pundit the best we can do ?
Or is he just trying to make a profit and air another commercial ?
Is cutting corners to make a buck appropriate when you consider what you could have done ?
What would someone with a bigger vision have done instead ?
Is being negative or bitter or selfish within reason in face of how extraordinarily lucky we were to have been been born here and born now ?
I take so much for granted .
Perhaps you do as well .
To be here , in this moment , with these resources .
To have not just our health but the knowledge and the tools and the infrastructure .
What a waste .
If I had n’t had those breaks , if there were n’t all those people who had sacrificed or helped or just stayed out of my way … what then ?
Would I even have had a shot at this ?
What if this were my last post ?
Would this post be worthy ?
The object is n’t to be perfect .
The goal is n’t to hold back until you ’ve created something beyond reproach .
I believe the opposite is true .
Our birthright is to fail and to fail often , but to fail in search of something bigger than we can imagine .
To do anything else is to waste it all .

ICFP 2008 Programming Contest
Task Description ( Version 1.5 )
1 Overview
Recent breakthroughs in higher - order , statically - typed , metaspatial communication will enable data to be transferred between Mars and Earth almost instantaneously .
As such , NASA is seeking examples of real - time control software to operate its latest model Martian rovers from control centers on Earth .
Since it is well known that the ICFP contest attracts the crème de la crème of programmers from around the world , NASA has decided to use the current contest as a means of gathering software prototypes for their new control system .
We are pleased to announce that this year ’s winning entry will in fact be used to control the rover on NASA ’s very next mission to Mars !
1
Your control software will communicate with the rover over a network socket .
Its object is to guide the rover safely from a given starting location to its home base .
The controller ’s primary function is to avoid the boulders and craters that litter the Martian surface .
As an added nuisance , the local inhabitants , who are decidedly hostile , will immediately destroy any rover they can get their fourteen sticky fingers on .
Note that Martians , like dogs , vary in intelligence .
Control software prototypes will be evaluated according to their performance in a series of trials , the details of which are given below .
Each trial consists of five runs on a given region of Mars .
As a means of preparing for these trials , this document and its accompanying software provide sufficient details and infrastructure for the development of prototype candidates .
Good luck , and may yours be the winning entry , to be used on Mars itself .
2 Mars rover behavior
The rover is a circular vehicle of radius 0.5 m , which your controller must guide across the Martian terrain .
To do so , your controller must establish a connection to the rover over a TCP / IP socket .
This socket it used for all communication to and from the rover .
While metaspatial communication is very fast , there is some latency in the connection ( on the order of 75 microseconds ) .
Once the connection is established , the controller will be sent an initial message about the dimensions of the world and the physical characteristics of the vehicle .
The world is modeled as a rectangular segment of the xy - plane centered at the origin .
The home base — the rover ’s intended destination — is a circle ( radius 5 m ) located at the origin .
The vehicle ’s characteristics include its maximum speed , its maximum rotational speed when turning , and a few other facts .
NASA is testing various different models of rovers , which have varying performance .
They are also testing different regions of Mars , with a wide range of characteristics .
For a given trial , the rover ’s performance and the map will be fixed , but these will vary from trial to trial .
Complete information on the initial message is furnished in Section 3.1.1 below .
About one second after the initial message is sent , the first run starts and the server begins sending a stream of vehicle telemetry data to the controller .
Telemetry data consists of location , speed , and information about the local terrain ( see Section 3.1.2 for full details ) .
At any time after the telemetry data has started streaming to the controller , the controller may issue commands back to the server to direct the vehicle towards home base .
The rover must avoid three kinds of perils on its way home .
If the rover hits a boulder , or the edge of the map , it bounces off and loses speed .
Hitting a boulder happens if the distance between the center of the boulder and the center of the rover is less than the sum of their radii .
If the center of the rover enters a crater , it falls in and explodes .
If a vehicle is caught by a Martian , it is destroyed and its remains are sacrificed to the Gods of Barsoom , of whom it is best not to speak further .
Martians , while hostile , possess no special physical abilities ; that is , they cannot drive through craters , pass through objects , or escape the boundary of the map .
The physics of Martian movement is the same as for the rover , although they may be faster or slower , etc .
Martians are slightly smaller than the rover , having a radius of 0.4m .
An illustration of a typical Martian region appears in Figure 1 .
Boulders , craters and home base are marked b , c and h respectively .
The rover ’s visual sensors cover an elliptical area that extends further in the direction that the rover is facing .
Figure 2 depicts this region .
The rover is oriented toward the right in this illustration .
Implicitly , there is an ellipse defined by min and max , with the rover always positioned at one of the foci .
The rover can see everything within this ellipse , with the exception of those objects that are occluded by boulders .
In the figure , the rightmost boulder is not visible to the rover because of the larger boulder blocking it .
The lowermost boulder , on the other hand , is visible , since craters do not occlude vision .
The linear speed of the rover at time t′ ( s t′ ) is computed according to its speed at its predecessor time t according to the following formula .
s t′ = max(s t + ( t′ − t ) a − k ( t′ − t ) s t 2 , 0 )
The latter term is the simulated drag on the vehicle .
Note a , the acceleration , can be negative if the rover is braking .
The rover ’s acceleration and braking rates are not known , although they can be determined by experiment .
The effect of drag is to limit the maximum speed of the rover .
The maximum speed is known ( it is communicated as part of the initial message ) , but the drag coefficient is not known .
The rover has two turning speeds — regular turns and hard turns — in both directions .
When the rover receives a command to turn left , its turning state moves one “ notch ” in the leftward direction ; likewise for right .
Note that while the turn rate and hard - turn rates are known , the rotational acceleration of the vehicle is finite and thus it will take some time change from one turning mode to another .
Section 3.2 addresses the mechanics of steering messages in greater detail .
3 Network protocol
Communication between the server and controller will be over a TCP / IP socket using plain - text messages encoded in ASCII .
The controller will be given a server hostname and port number as command - line arguments at the beginning of each trial .
The controller should establish a client - side TCP / IP connection to the server ; this socket will be used by the controller to send commands to the vehicle and by the server to send telemetry data to the controller .
A message is a sequence of tokens delimited by the ASCII space character ( 0x20 ) and terminated by a semicolon .
The tokens in a message represent quantities of various kinds and have the following formats :
Distances , lengths , and locations ( x and y coordinates ) are given in meters in fixed - point representation rounded to the nearest thousandth ( millimeter ) .
and coordinates ) are given in meters in fixed - point representation rounded to the nearest thousandth ( millimeter ) .
Angles are given in degrees in fixed - point representation rounded to the nearest tenth .
Angular velocities are given in degrees per second in fixed - point representation rounded to the nearest tenth .
Speeds are given in meters per second in fixed - point representation rounded to the nearest thousandth .
Durations are given in whole milliseconds ( since the start of the simulation ) .
3.1 Messages from the server to the controller
There are a variety of messages that the rover sends to the controller .
Each message begins with a single character that denotes the message kind .
The exact characteristics of the vehicle are unspecified and may differ between trials , but information about the vehicle will be given at the beginning of each trail .
Once the connection to the server is established , the controller will receive an initial message with the following format :
I dx dy time - limit min-sensor max - sensor max - speed max - turn max - hard - turn ;
I is the message tag signifying initialization .
dx is the span of the map ’s x-axis ( meters ) .
A map with dx 100.000 extends from - 50.000 to 50.000 on the x -axis .
dy is the span of the map ’s y - axis ( meters ) .
A map with dy 100.000 extends from - 50.000 to 50.000 on the y - axis.
time - limit is the time limit for the map ( milliseconds ) .
Map time limits are discussed in Section 4 below .
min-sensor is the minimum range of the vehicle ’s visual sensors ( meters ) .
See the discussion of the vision model in Section 2.1 above .
max - sensor is the maximum range of the vehicle ’s visual sensors ( meters ) .
See the discussion of the vision model in Section 2.1 above .
max -speed is the maximum speed of the vehicle ( meters per second ) .
max -turn is the maximum rotational speed when turning ( degrees per second ) .
max - hard - turn is the maximum rotational speed when turning hard ( degrees per second ) .
3.1.2 Telemetry stream
During a run , the server sends a steady stream of telemetry data to the vehicle controller ( roughly one message every 100 milliseconds ) .
This data includes information about the vehicle ’s current state ( control - state , heading , velocity , etc. ) as well as information about the local map conditions ( obstacles and enemies ) .
T time - stamp vehicle - ctl vehicle -x vehicle -y vehicle - dir vehicle - speed objects ;
where
T is the message tag signifying telemetry data .
time - stamp is the number of milliseconds since the start of the run .
vehicle - ctl is the current state of the vehicle controls .
It is a two - character sequence with the first character specifying the acceleration state ( a for accelerating , b for braking , or - for rolling , i.e. , moving at a constant speed ) and the second character specifying the turning state ( L for hard - left turn , l for left turn , - for straight ahead , r for right turn , and R for hard - right turn ) .
Note that the rover will gradually slow down when rolling , because of drag .
vehicle -x is the x-coordinate of the vehicle ’s current position .
vehicle-y is the y - coordinate of the vehicle ’s current position .
vehicle - dir is the direction of the vehicle measured as a counterclockwise angle from the x-axis .
vehicle - speed is the vehicle ’s current speed ( meters per second ) .
objects is a sequence of zero or more obstacles and / or enemies that are visible to the vehicle .
An item is visible if it falls in the range of the vehicle ’s visual sensors ; recall that range is part of the rover characteristics given in the server ’s initial message .
Object messages have two different formats depending on the type of object .
If the object is a boulder , crater , or home base , the format is object - kind object -x object -y object- r where object - kind is one of b ( for a boulder ) , c ( for a crater ) , or h ( for home base ) .
object-x is the x-coordinate of the object ’s center .
object-y is the y - coordinate of the object ’s center .
object -r is the radius of the object .
If the object is a Martian , the description has the format m enemy -x enemy -y enemy - dir enemy - speed
Here is an example telemetry message .
Note that we have split this message over multiple lines to improve readability — the actual message would not contain any newline characters .
T 3450 aL - 234.040 811.100 47.5 8.450
b -220.000 750.000 12.000
m -240.000 812.000 90.0 9.100 ;
This message describes the vehicle ’s state at 3.45 seconds after the start of the run .
It is currently accelerating and turning hard to the left .
Its position is ( −234.040 , 811.100 ) , its direction is 47.5 degrees ( roughly NE ) , its velocity is 8.450 meters per second , and it sees one boulder and one Martian .
3.1.3 Adverse events
There are also messages to signal unhappy occurrences .
These messages have the format :
message - tag time - stamp ;
where the message - tag is one of
B for a crash against a boulder or the map edge .
When the rover crashes into a boulder , it bounces off and loses speed .
Each crash message is immediately followed by a telemetry message so that the controller can update its state .
C if the vehicle fell into a crater .
Falling into a crater destroys the rover and ends the run .
K if the vehicle was killed by a Martian , which ends the run .
3.1.4 Success message
The server sends the message “ S t ; ” when the vehicle reaches home base safely .
The current run is terminated on success .
At the end of a run , the server sends the message “ E t s ; , ” where t is the time since the beginning of the run , and s is the score ( i.e. , the run time plus any penalties ) .
Note that each run will end with exactly one of the following sequences of server messages :
C t ; , then E t s ;
, then K t ; , then E t s ;
, then S t ; , then E t s ;
, then E t s ; preceded by none of C , K , or S , indicating that the time limit has been reached
Once a run has terminated , there will be a pause of at least one second before the start of the next run .
Note that the controller should not exit at the end of the run , but instead should prepare for another run .
Also note that the initialization message described in Section 3.1.1 is only sent once per trial .
Each run of the trial uses the same map , although the rover ’s initial position and the number and location of Martians can vary from run to run .
3.2 Messages from the controller to the server
The rover behavior is controlled by a pair of state machines ( Figure 3 ) , which , in turn , are controlled by commands sent by the controller .
Each command consists of an optional acceleration ( a ) or braking ( b ) command , followed by an optional turning command ( l for left and r for right ) , and followed by a semicolon ( ; ) .
Thus , the grammar of controller - to - server messages is
Message ::= ; | a ; | b ; | l ; | r ; | al ; | ar ; | bl ; | br ;
No other characters ( including whitespace ) should be sent over the command stream !
While communication with the rover is fast , there may be some latency ( less than 20 milliseconds ) in processing the commands .
The controller may send messages as often as it likes , although flooding the network can negatively affect performance .
We recommend only sending messages in response to telemetry data , although you may need a sequence of messages to reach the desired control state .
4 Contest organization and scoring
The contest is run as a series of trials of varying difficulty .
A trial consists of five runs on the same map .
Each map has an associated time limit of some number of milliseconds .
A limit -n map has an upper limit of n milliseconds .
The score for a run is the amount of time it takes to complete the run or be destroyed , plus any penalties .
If a rover reaches home base on a given limit- n map in some t ≤ n number of milliseconds , the run score is t .
map in some ≤ number of milliseconds , the run score is .
If the rover fails to reach home base on a given limit- n map , the run score is given by the equation 2 n − t + p , where t is the elapsed time , and p is the penalty as follows : 100 if the time limit has been exceeded , 600 if the rover was destroyed by a Martian , or 1000 if the rover fell into a crater .
Note that t is at most n in this formula , since the run is halted when t exceeds n .
Therefore ( 2 n − t ) will always be between n and 2 n inclusive .
map , the run score is given by the equation 2 − + , where is the elapsed time , and is the penalty as follows :
Note that is at most in this formula , since the run is halted when exceeds .
Therefore ( 2 − ) will always be between and 2 inclusive .
As in ski racing , lower scores are better .
The trial score is the sum of the three lowest scores in the trial .
The winner of the contest will be determined by a series of heats .
A heat consists of all remaining competitors being subjected to the same trial .
After each heat , the competitors are ranked by their trial score and some fraction of the better competitors will advance to the next heat , while the remaining competitors will be eliminated .
Heats will continue until there is a single winner remaining .
From one heat to the next , the given trial may differ arbitrarily .
Programs that core dump will be disqualified .
Programs that attempt to subvert the host or server , or that generate illegal messages will be disqualified .

a directory bin , inside icfp08 , containing whatever executables and scripts support the running of your controller .
, inside , containing whatever executables and scripts support the running of your controller .
an executable file run , inside bin , which runs your client .
It may be an executable , or it may be a shell script that manages running your client .
It must take two command - line arguments , the server ’s hostname and the port number , in that order .
That is , the judges must be able to execute your client with bin / run hostname port from inside the icfp08 directory .
Your tarball may include other files as well , including code for general - purpose third - party libraries , with your submission as long as your README enumerates those libraries .
Teams may not use code written by other teams working on the contest as a “ library . ”
Only generic libraries , e.g. , one that provides matrix operations , may be used .
Teams who use libraries as a means of sharing code with one another will be disqualified .
The structure of a contest entry is illustrated in Figure 4 .
In addition , your archive may contain an optional installation script install in the bin directory .
If this script is present , it will be executed using the command
bin/install
from inside the icfp08 directory .
The PWD shell variable and pwd command can be used to determine the path to the icfp08 directory ( and thus to your scripts , etc. ) .
The layout of your submission is not checked until after this program is run , so it may be used to generate or modify the files in your submission , but it should not attempt to copy files outside the icfp08 directory .
The process of running your client for a given trial will involve the following steps :
tar - xzf icfp08.tgz
cd icfp08
if test -r bin / install ; then
chmod +x bin/install
bin/install
fi
chmod +x bin/run
bin /run hostname port
These commands will be run as user knoppix ( not root ) in a temporary directory .
The specifications above must be matched exactly , since contest entries will be processed by scripts depending on the exact structure presented here .
Failure to meet the specifications is grounds for disqualification .
6 How to test your program
NASA is providing a Martian simulator and sample maps for contestants to test their code on while developing their contest entries .
Note that while this simulator is a physically accurate simulation of the Martian environment , the vehicle characteristics may vary in the actual trials .
Furthermore , the environment used to test your controller may be harsher ( i.e. , more obstacles ) than the samples and the Martians therein may be faster and smarter .
Prepare for the worst !
The sample simulator and maps are available for download from
http://smlnj.org/icfp08-contest/simulator.html
To run the server , you must supply it with the name of a map file .
Details on the map file format appear on the web site .
7 Implementation hints
Because the controller program is sensitive to network latency , you should disable Nagle ’s algorithm for the socket .
You can do this using the setsockopt system call with the TCP_NODELAY option .
Implementations may use information gathered in early runs of a trial to improve their score in later runs .
Note that since a single execution of the controller program is used for the whole trial , you do not need to use disk storage to communicate information between runs .
No information can be communicated between trials .
Good luck !

Article I , section 8 , clause 11 of the US Constitution says that Congress has the enumerated power of declaring war and clause 12 says that Congress has the enumerated power to raise and support armies .
Some argue that the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are not wars because Congress did not declare war in either case , but calling something a war or an illegal occupation is merely an exercise in semantics , because people are dying just like it 's a war .
Why , after all these years and all the proof that these military excursions were based on deliberately false information , does the US still have troops on the ground in the Middle East ?
Where does the responsibility lie in bringing our troops home ?
Which federal agency or branch of the government is now covered in the most gore ?
And whose war is it anyway ?
Frankly , the why part of the question seems obvious .
There is still money to be made by the Military Industrial Complex ( MIC ) .
Cheney 's company Halliburton and the Oil - garchy are realizing enormous profits while ordinary citizens are paying a heavy price at the pump and for other consumer goods that rely on petroleum to be delivered to the stores .
Oh , is that everything ?
I think it is .
Blood is being poured into the bank accounts of the ruling elite while it is being drained out of our soldiers , families and communities .
There is no indication from the arrogantly evil Executive Branch ( that has now been co-opted by the most corrupt and criminal administration in
US history ) that they are seeking an end to the obscene occupations .
Their buddies are profiting and that 's good enough for them .
While the Bush Crime Family planned a wedding for May , many families not of the Bush economic stratosphere or legendary ignominy , are planning funerals .
Instead of working overtime to see which party can exploit US troops better and harder than the other , ( their pretend opposition and political playacting is exactly like watching pretend wrestling on TV where two foes spit epithets at each other and then fake - wrestle for a faker prize )
Pelosi , et al , should be burning the midnight oil to craft a humane solution to the problem that has become the Democrats ' as much as the Republicans ' .
Instead of putting provisions for extended timelines or tying guns and butter ( the very phrase makes me want to vomit at the sheer callousness ) , Pelosi must use her enumerated power to end these illegal occupations .
It would be a lot less work to tell BushCo to use the money that has already been borrowed from China to start bringing our troops home ( not redeploy to Iran or Pakistan ) and if BushCo does not , and then it is truly a Republican conflict .
Iraq and Afghanistan are Democratic and Republican mistakes .
To cater to  Blue Dog Dems  over the will of the American public , or to incredibly blame the people of Iraq for not having the guts to come to a peaceful political solution is abominable , but how does these occupations belong to  We the People ?.
First of all , we allow anti-war groups like MoveOn.org to set the dialogue and discourse .
MoveOn.org is not so much anti-war as they are  pro-Democrat . 
Tactics that MoveOn.org found outrageous under the Republican Congress , they find frustrating  but understandable under Democratic leadership .
The anti - war issue is non-partisan in its scope by the very name anti-war .
The Democrats are responsible for every war in the last 108 years , excluding the two Bush wars and the Reagan Grenada farce .
Democrats are responsible for dropping , not one , but two atomic bombs on the innocent citizens of Japan .
Democrats deserve no slack , and should be given none .
Secondly , during elections the anti- war movement loses its focus and works for candidates that promise peace or change , but previous actions , votes , or rhetoric do not match the campaign rhetoric .
From Obliteration to Redeployment to Hundred Years , none of the duopoly candidates are promising anything different than BushCo .
After almost eight years of two - party collaboration that has undermined freedom , democracy , peace and prosperity , one would think that the US electorate would have developed some kind of sophistication regarding the throttlehold of sameness that the Republicrats or Demopublicans offer .
We have a clear choice instead of the lesser of two evils politics .
There are at least two candidates for President that present a clear alternative to violence and corporate oppression : Cynthia McKinney ( Green Party and Power to the People Party ) and Ralph Nader ( Ind . ) .
Do you want someone who is a smidgeon less evil at the helm of our country , or do you want someone who is committed to true peace and true mastery over the corporations and true environmental integrity ?
The choice is yours .
Stand up courageously and cast your vote for the person that more closely matches your ideologies and beatitudes , or hold your nose with one hand and push the button for one of the corporate tools with the other .
I personally know that war is a living hell that is constantly present and my pain can only begin to touch in a small way the misery of the people of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Our nation 's leaders who are misguided and led in the wrong direction of their master , the War Machine , have no idea , for the most part , of this devastation .
They have no business being trusted with the public trust and 95 % of them should be sent packing back to their homes if not imprisoned for war crimes .
It is up to  We the People to exercise our sovereignty to finally bring peace and prosperity back to  We the People . 
Whose war is it ?
It belongs to us all and it is up to us all to have a hand in ending it .

Moving highways underground probably wo n't result in the discovery of bestial sub-humans , but it could pay off in other ways .

In the­ science fiction novel " The Time Machine , " author H.G. Wells envisioned a distant future in which humans had devolved into two distinct races :
The beautiful Eloi , who live an idyllic life in the English countryside , and the brutal Morlocks , who labor underground to sustain the Eloi 's way of life on the surface .
Even if you overlook the Morlocks ' cannibalistic attacks on the surface world , this clearly is n't an ideal arrangement .
Yet the idea of pushing the less attractive elements of our lives underground is n't entirely without merit .
After all , if we can bury power and communication lines , why can't we do something similar with our highways ?
And while no one at HowStuffWorks will make an argument in favor of creating a race of subterranean monsters to do our bidding , is n't it nice to have someone else do the work ?
Why can't we pass the wheel over to some manner of mechanical Morlock when we need to take a long trip ?

This is exactly the theory behind the creation of an underground automated highway ( UAH ) .
Need to travel cross-country to visit your parents ?
You would simply drive down into the nearest UAH entrance and let your specialized vehicle 's automated guidance system sync up with the highway system .
You 'd turn the controls over to the vehicle , which would allow you to sleep , work or play for the remainder of the drive .
There would be no tracks , no moving platforms -- just your vehicle driving itself in formation with other automated vehicles .
Upon reaching your destination , the vehicle would follow the proper exit , and you 'd take the wheel to manually drive the last few miles .
­
Such a system would be safer and less congested than current highway systems .
In addition , the land that might otherwise be used for highways , interstates and related infrastructure could be reclaimed .
Imagine if just half of the world 's highway systems could be reserved for oxygen - producing wild plant life ?
Think about all the hungry mouths you could feed if that land was used for agricultural production ?
Are automated highway systems the future of transportation ?

Scientists are one step closer to understanding the recent demise of billions of honey bees after making an important discovery about the transmission of a common bee virus .
Deformed wing virus ( DWV ) is passed between adult bees and to their developing brood by a parasitic mite called Varroa destructor when it feeds .
However , research published in the July issue of the Journal of General Virology suggests that the virus does not replicate in Varroa , highlighting the need for further investigation .
Deformed wing virus has been linked to the collapse of honey bee colonies in Britain .
In recent years the prevalence of the virus has increased globally in colonies infested with Varroa .
It is widely accepted that the virus replicates in the mite and is then transmitted to bees when it bites .
However , researchers at Rothamsted Research and the University of Nottingham have found that the virus does not replicate in the mite , suggesting an alternative means of transmission .
" Experiments and field observations have shown that V. destructor is able to transmit several different unrelated honey bee viruses , like acute bee paralysis virus and Kashmir bee virus as well as deformed wing virus , " said Professor Teresa Santillan - Galicia from Rothamsted Research .
" But we still do n't know exactly how these viruses are passed from the mite to the bee . "
The researchers wanted to find out whether the virus replicates in the mite and if so where this occurs , to understand how the virus is transmitted .
They used a process called immunohistochemistry which involves using antibodies which bind to specific surface proteins , enabling the virus particles to be located .
There was no evidence of virus replication within the cells of the mite ; the virus was found only in the lumen of the gut , suggesting it was merely eaten .
" The presence of deformed wing virus in large amounts in mite faeces suggests it is picked up during feeding on an infected bee , " said Professor Santillan - Galicia .
" However , one important question remains -- how is the virus transmitted to bees ? "
One possibility is that the mouthparts of the mite could become contaminated with the virus during feeding , but this is an unlikely answer .
Varroa mites cannot regurgitate their gut contents as there is a membrane in the oesophagus that acts as a non-return valve , so they could not pass the virus on this way either .
Unfortunately , not enough is known about the anatomy of the mite , or their feeding mechanism , to suggest other routes of transmission .
" It is likely that the amount of virus acquired by the mite plays an important role in the interaction between deformed wing virus and the Varroa mite , " said Professor Santillan - Galicia .
" Full understanding of the interaction between deformed wing virus and the Varroa mite will provide basic information for the future development of more sustainable control strategies against the mite and the virus .
Our work provides elements of understanding but further research in this area is needed . "
Britain will overtake Germany and France to become the biggest country in the EU in 50 years ' time , according to population projections unveiled yesterday .
A survey of demographic trends finds Britain 's positive birth rate contrasting strongly with most other large countries in Europe .
The impact of population shrinkage , coupled with the ageing of key European societies , spells big problems for pensions , health and welfare systems across much of the union , says the report , published by Eurostat , the statistical service of the European commission .
But Britain , it says , is likely to suffer less because of its strong population growth and the younger average age of British society .
Immigration is singled out as the sole mitigating factor , seen as crucial to maintaining population growth .
But the report says this probably will not be enough to reverse the trend of population decline in many countries .
The survey predicts that Britain 's population by 2060 will increase by 25 % from the current figure of just over 61 million to almost 77 million .
Germany is the biggest country in the EU , with more than 82 million people , but it is likely to shed almost 12 million by 2060 , says the report .
The widely praised family policies and support of working women in France means that the French population will rise to almost 72 million by 2060 .
With the British birth rate now at its highest in a generation - 1.91 children per woman according to the Office for National Statistics last week - the UK has less to fear about any " generation wars " brought on by the " demographic timebomb " of ageing and shrinking populations where those in work cannot support the pension needs of retired citizens .
" With climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges Europe must face , " said Amelia Torres , a commission spokeswoman .
Of the biggest six EU countries ( Germany , France , Britain , Italy , Spain and Poland ) Britain has by far the greatest birth rates .
Only Luxembourg , Cyprus , and Ireland are growing faster than the UK .
The average age of Europeans is now just over 40 ; this will be 48 by 2060 .
The average age for Britons is 39 and will be 42 in 2060 - the lowest age in Europe with the exception of Luxembourg .
The EU 's population now stands at 495 million and is projected to rise to more than 520 million by 2035 , before falling to 505 million by 2060 .
" From 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births , and population growth due to natural increase , would cease , " says the survey , assuming a net migration inflow to the EU of almost 60 million over the next 50 years .
" Positive net migration would be the only population growth factor .
However , from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change . "
Across the EU 's 27 countries there are now four people of working age for every person over 65 , but by 2060 that ratio will be 2:1 , causing stress on welfare and pension systems .
Torres said pension and health systems had to be reformed .
Fourteen of the 27 countries are projected to have smaller populations in 50 years ' time .
The survey reveals striking contrasts , between eastern and western Europe and between the north and south , with Scandinavia and Britain comparing positively with Mediterranean Europe , while central and eastern Europe see chronic population depression .
The number of people aged 65 or more broadly doubles across the EU , with Britons of retirement age being almost 19 million .
While the number of Germans of working age is predicted to decline from 54 million now to 39 million by 2060 , in Britain the figure rises by more than 4 million .
Across the EU , the number of children under 14 will drop from 77 million to 71 million , but in the UK the number rises by 2 million .
In Britain the proportion of over - 80s will double to 9 % while across the EU it will triple to 12 % .
The UK population is increasing at a rate of around 1,000 people a day according to figures released by the National Statistics agency earlier this month .
Children aged under 16 represent around one in five of the total population , around the same proportion as those of retirement age .
UK fertility rates dropped steadily during the 1980s and 1990s but began to increase again from 2003 .
People power
By 2060 , the population of major Europen countries will be :
UK 77 million
France 72
Germany 71
Italy 59
Spain 52
Increases in population by 2060 :
Cyprus 66 %
Ireland 53
Luxembourg 52
UK 25
Decreases in population by 2060 :
Bulgaria 28 %
Latvia 26
Lithuania 24
Romania 21
The strongly Roman Catholic countries of Europe are having fewer babies .
The Italian population will stay the same over the next 50 years , while Poland 's and Lithuania 's will shrink considerably .
Spain 's population is forecast to increase by 6 million .
Life expectancy is also rising .
In Ireland , women will live to 89 and men to 85 .
Almost one in three Europeans will be of pensionable age if 65 remains the threshold .
MILWAUKEE  Mildred and John Fischer thought their retirement years would be a time for traveling and visiting their grandchildren .
Then last September , just as Mr. Fischer was retiring as a postal carrier , Mrs. Fischer ’s mother , who has Alzheimer ’s disease , came to live with them .
While friends and neighbors enjoyed carefree time , Mrs. Fischer said she felt that her world was closing in on her .
She could sense her heart palpitating from the constant stress .
It got so bad one day , she said , “ I needed to go down to the basement and just sit . ”
Finally , with some feelings of guilt , the Fischers did what most other people in their position never try : they got away , leaving Mrs. Fischer ’s mother , Mildred Gordon , for the weekend at a new nine - bed “ respite care ” center here .
It is a measure of health care aimed not at the sick or frail person , but at the exhausted spouse , child or friend .
While nurses cared for her mother in a small unit designed to resemble a European village , the Fischers traveled to Green Bay , Wis. , with their grandchildren for a few days of unencumbered time together .
“ I did n’t know what respite was , ” Mrs. Fischer , 63 , said .
“ But we really need it . ”
Olbermann : ' McCain 's top guy on the economy made it easier for bin Laden ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday June 3 , 2008

Print This Email This Last week , MSNBC 's Keith Olbermann revealed that the co-chair of Senator John McCain 's presidential campaign , the fiercely pro-deregulation Phil Gramm , had been lobbying for a Swiss bank this spring to head off relief for victims of the mortgage crisis at the same time that he was acting as a leading McCain economic advisor .
Now Olbermann reports that McCain's Phil Gramm scandal has widened , explaining that the former Republican senator from Texas " made it easier for bin Laden .
...
In the Senate he blocked legislation that would have enabled the Bush administration to force foreign banks into cooperating on anti-terror measures before and after 9/11 . "
" Gramm 's bank is under investigation for alleged use of overseas tax havens to hide assets of the wealthy from US authorities , " Olbermann began , citing a current story in Newsweek .
Olbermann went on to point out that " on September 20 , 2001 , the New York Times reported that a single senator had blocked legislation that would have helped US investigators track Osama bin Laden 's financial network before 9/11 .
It was Phil Gramm -- who still defended these tax havens after 9/11 , whose bank was still lobbying Congress on behalf of tax havens as recently as last year . "
This fresh controversy about Gramm arose as McCain was blasting Obama for his promise to talk with Iranian leaders and the Obama campaign was responding that McCain " continues to cling to a foreign policy that 's failed to make the U.S. or Israel safer . "
" How does McCain run on being tough on Israel 's enemies ? " Olbermann asked Chris Hayes of The Nation .
" What this reveals is really a profound contradiction at the heart of the Republican coalition , " Hayes replied .
" It 's home to the most sort of chest - beating , self - righteous moralists about foreign policy .
...
At the same time , it 's a party whose agenda is run by global conglomerates that pursue dollar and profit with no regard for any kind of sense of morality .
...
It blows apart this entire moralistic rationale . "
Hayes added that McCain 's latest proposal for putting pressure on Iran is an " international campaign towards divestment . "
However , when " Senator Obama proposed divestment legislation in the Senate and ... it was blocked by a Republican senator because it would have required the government to report on what businesses have dealing with Iran ... [ McCain ] was unwilling to lift a single finger to make it happen . "
A full transcript of the segment is available here .
This video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast June 2 , 2008 .
The Federal Government is considering overturning a ban on Australian aid being spent on abortion advice in developing nations .
Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith has the power to change the guidelines and has asked Labor to debate whether the 12 - year ban imposed by the former Coalition government should be lifted .
But Nationals Senator Ron Boswell has warned that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd can expect a voter backlash from Christian groups if the ban is overturned .
" All bets will be off with the churches as far as Mr Rudd is concerned , " he said .
" He cuddled up to the churches for the last election .
If he does this to them then they 'll turn upon him . "
" I do n't want this to happen and there has been no country that 's come to us and specifically said we want aid to fund abortions , " he added .
" If we 're going to give money , there 's plenty of ways to give it - health , clean water , food .
But [ if ] someone wants to fund abortion , let it not be us .
Parliamentary secretary for international development assistance Bob McMullan says the decision cannot be based on scoring political points with Australian voters .
" There 's only two countries in the world that have guidelines like this , us and the United States , " he said .
" There are people who share Senator Boswell 's reasonably extreme view of this but there are people , the large bulk of people , who do n't feel so passionately and there are some people who passionately feel the other way .
" Of course it leads to some pretty robust discussion but you would n't want people in parliament who did n't have strongly held views . "
Cross -party support
Greens leader Bob Brown says the Federal Government should overturn the ban because that is what the majority of Australians want .
Senator Brown says the policy was a mistake which should be corrected .
" I think there 'll be a big backlash against Senator Boswell and others by the majority in Australia who would support this very civilised way of behaving , " he said .
" That is , treat people overseas the way we treat people here in Australia , give them the same rights where we can . "
And federal Liberal backbencher Mal Washer says he supports the Government 's decision to consider overturning the ban .
Mr Washer says there is a 13 per cent death rate for women who have unsafe or illegal abortions in developing nations .
" Now I understand that if you 're going to ... put morality aside and worry about who 's going to vote for you , well that 's an issue , " he said .
" And a lot of senators , if that 's what they 're saying they are worried about , then I think they should go find another job quite frankly . "
SDEROT , Israel ( Reuters ) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama assured Israel and its U.S. Jewish supporters on Wednesday he was a friend who would not press for peace concessions that would compromise its security .
Hailing Israel as a “ miracle ” , he vowed staunch support and held only a low - profile meeting with Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank .
Obama , seeking to allay wariness among some U.S. Jewish voters about his policy towards Israel , flew to Sderot , a town hit by rockets fired from the Hamas - run Gaza Strip , saying he hoped to bring peace but would not dictate the terms of a deal .
“ I am here to say as an American and as a friend of Israel that we stand with the people of Sderot and all of the people of Israel , ” Obama told reporters in the town ’s police station , with mounds of empty rocket casings stacked behind him .
Republican candidate John McCain visited Sderot in March but did not go to the West Bank .
Rocket fire on Sderot has largely stopped since a ceasefire with Hamas went into effect in June .
In an apparent jab at U.S. President George W. Bush ’s last - minute efforts to secure peace before leaving office , Obama said he would not “ wait a few years into my term or my second term if I ’m elected ” to press for a deal .
“ We do n’t need a peace deal just to have a piece of paper , ” he said .
“ We need something that ’s meaningful . ”
Israel and the Palestinians launched U.S. - backed talks in November aiming to reach a deal by the end of 2008 .
But Israeli officials have said any accord would likely provide only a framework for statehood and would not be implemented for years .
Obama brushed aside critics who fear he may pressure Israel to make concessions .
He said he did not believe that Israeli leaders came away from his meetings with them with “ any sense that I would be pressuring them to accept any kinds of concessions that would put their security at stake ” .
“ MIRACLE ”
The Illinois senator , meeting Israeli President Shimon Peres in Jerusalem earlier , described Israel as a “ miracle that has blossomed ” over 60 years .
Wearing a Jewish skullcap , he laid a white wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial museum .
Avoiding turning a trip to the West Bank into a high - profile visit that could alienate Jewish voters , Obama made no statement in Ramallah after his hour - long meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad .

But meeting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert later for dinner , he told reporters that he had found among the Palestinians “ a strong sense that progress is being made and honest conversations are taking place ” in the peace talks .
“ Indeed , that ’s right , ” answered Olmert , who has pursued several diplomatic initiatives even as a corruption probe threatens to force him from office .
Hundreds of helmeted Palestinian security officers with automatic rifles lined Ramallah ’s streets as Obama drove into the city from Jerusalem .
His motorcade passed Israel ’s towering West Bank barrier and hilltop Jewish settlements en route .
Slideshow ( 41 images )
Obama urged support for Abbas and Fayyad , who support a two - state solution to the conflict , and played down the chances of negotiating with their Hamas rivals unless the Islamist group renounced violence and recognized Israel ’s right to exist .
Last month , Obama dismayed Palestinian leaders when he said that Jerusalem should be Israel ’s “ undivided ” capital .
Palestinians want Arab East Jerusalem , captured by Israel in 1967 , as the capital of a future state .
Obama later said he used “ poor phrasing ” when he made the remarks .
An Obama aide said Iran ’s nuclear program and the peace process dominated his discussions with Israeli leaders , while the Palestinians focused on the negotiations with Israel and aid for their economy .
Obama , in his remarks in Sderot , said : “ A nuclear Iran would pose a grave threat and the world must prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon . ”
The candidate arrived in Israel just hours after a Palestinian rammed a bulldozer into vehicles on a busy Jerusalem street near the hotel booked for his stay .
The attacker wounded at least 16 people before being shot dead .

Engineers have started flowing chemical fuel through the laser to test its sequencing and control .
This will set up the first test firing of the weapon aboard the aircraft while it is on the ground .
The US Air Force 's Airborne Laser ( ABL ) is designed to shoot down enemy ballistic missiles in the early stages of their flight .
" The Airborne Laser team has done a great job preparing the high - energy laser for these fuel tests , which will lead the way toward achieving ' first light ' of the laser aboard the aircraft , " said Mike Rinn , vice president of Boeing , which is prime contractor on the project .
" Once again , we made and demonstrated enormous progress toward ushering in a new age of directed - energy weapons . "
Airborne intercept
The ABL illuminates the missile with a laser tracking beam , while computers measure its distance and calculate its course and direction .
After acquiring and locking onto the target , a second , high - power laser fires a three - to - five - second burst from a turret located in the 747's nose .
The beam heats up the pressurised fuel tank of the outbound missile and causes it to rupture , destroying the missile .
The high energy laser is fired from a turret in the aircraft 's nose
The high - energy weapon is a Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser ( COIL ) capable of producing megawatts of power .
Built by defence giant Northrop Grumman , it is designed to destroy " all classes " of ballistic missiles , including tactical ballistic missiles ( TBMs ) and intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) .
Its fuel consists of chemicals found in hair bleach and drain cleaner - hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide - which are then combined with chlorine gas and water .
The COIL is housed in the back half of the 747 .
The aircraft 's front half contains the beam control / fire control system , developed by Lockheed Martin , and the battle management system , built by Boeing .
Pros and cons
After the laser has undergone a series of test firings on the ground , the entire system will be flown to carry out functional check - outs .
The first airborne intercept of an in - flight ballistic missile is planned for 2009 .
Destroying ballistic missiles during their boost phase - while their rockets are firing - carries several advantages .
The bright , hot rocket exhaust aids detection , discrimination and targeting of the missile .
And it is much more difficult to use countermeasures , such as decoys , during this phase of flight .
The beam control system will acquire and track targets
The wreckage will usually land in enemy territory , although collateral damage in surrounding countries could be a concern .
However , it may be difficult to position the intercept weapon - in this case the aircraft - to shoot down the missiles .
There is also limited time in which to destroy the missile in this early stage of flight .
The ABL 's range is limited by the distance its beam can propagate through the atmosphere and remain focused .
This is affected by atmospheric conditions , turbulence ( changes in air density as the result of heating and cooling ) , humidity , clouds and the time of day .
According to an American Physical Society report in 2004 , the Airborne Laser could shoot down a typical liquid - fuel intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) from up to 600 km away .
However , against solid - fuel ICBMs , which are more resistant to heating , the useful range would be about 300 km .
This would be too short to defend against solid - fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles launched from Iran or North Korea , the US report explained .
The system will shoot down ballistic missiles in their " boost - phase "

What are these ?
Acoustic microwave armaments ?
Laser induced plasma channels ?
Vortex ring guns ?
Are these high - tech MacGuffins spiffing - up the latest Hollywood near - future thriller ?
Regrettably , no .
Welcome to the twisted world of “ non-lethal ” weapons research brought to you by the “ fun ” folks at the Pentagon ’s Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate ( JNLWD ) .
Like a newborn ’s proud parents , the JNLWD is heralding the successful phase two testing of Raytheon ’s Active Denial System ( ADS ) , a directed energy weapon used for “ crowd control . ”
Known for its “ goodbye effect , ” it functions as a primitive , though highly - effective “ pain ray ” by heating the skin to around 130 degrees F .
According to a blurb on the JNLWD website , the ADS is “ helping to fill the gap between the ‘ shout ’ and ‘ shoot ’ alternatives faced by our troops . ”
ADS “ represented the first integration of the key technology elements such as the millimeter wave source , cooling system , and antenna , among other things . ”
With a range of some 550 yards , the ADS can penetrate clothing .
Its effects have been described by test subjects as “ excruciating . ”
A domestic version of the system known as the Silent Guardian is being hawked to law enforcement by Raytheon for its alleged ability to provide “ a zone of protection that saves lives , protects assets and minimizes collateral damage . ”
According to some reports , ADS has “ been present ” at some public events in the United States .
How comforting .
But as disturbing as Raytheon ’s ADS may be , there are systems about to come “ on - line ” that are far , far worse .
New Scientist recently described how one enterprising outfit of capitalist grifters , the Sierra Nevada Corporation , is “ ready to build a microwave ray gun able to beam sounds directly into people ’s heads , ” David Hambling reports .
Touted as the “ next big thing , ” MEDUSA ( Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio ) will eventually be deployed for “ crowd - control ” applications in U.S. military “ operations other than war . ”
According to Hambling , MEDUSA
exploits the microwave audio effect , in which short microwave pulses rapidly heat tissue , causing a shockwave inside the skull that can be detected by the ears .
A series of pulses can be transmitted to produce recognisable sounds .
( “ Microwave Ray Gun Controls Crowds with Noise , ” New Scientist , July 3 , 2008 )
Sierra Nevada Corporation ’s Lev Sadovnik is working on the latest in a series of “ active denial systems ” under contract with the U.S.
Navy which said in a preliminary report that the device “ was shown to be effective . ”
According to its manufacturer , MEDUSA involves an “ auditory effect ” loud enough to “ cause discomfort or even incapacitation . ”
While the technology is ballyhooed by weapons designers as an “ advance , ” its effects are wholly insidious since “ normal audio safety limits do not apply since the sound does not enter through the eardrums . ”
Sadovnik told New Scientist , “ The repel effect is a combination of loudness and the irritation factor .
You ca n’t block it out . ”
Another technological “ breakthrough ” that greatly impressed Sierra Nevada ’s Pentagon “ customer ” is “ a new reconfigurable antenna developed by colleague Vladimir Manasson .
It steers the beam electronically , making it possible to flip from a broad to a narrow beam , or aim at multiple targets simultaneously . ”
In other words , a “ target ” could be one person , say a union leader speaking outside a plant gate to “ disruptive ” strikers challenging the corporatist paradigm , or a range of “ targets ” engaged in “ anti- social behavior ” such as nonviolent civil disobedience by concerned citizens blocking the entrance to a major polluter ’s factory –or weapons manufacturer , for that matter .
With one eye on his corporate masters ’ bottom line while the other is focused on potential adverse publicity that might accrue from fabricating a product that creates a shockwave inside someone ’s skull , Sadovnik resorts to the old “ dual-use ” public relations ploy to cover his ass - ets , so to speak .
Without skipping a beat , Sadovnik claims the technology could have “ non-military ” applications such as scaring away pesky flocks of birds or even as a means to “ help ” people with impaired auditory functions !
While the system may be feasible , James Lin of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois in Chicago told Hambling that a high - power system such as MEDUSA “ would mean much more powerful–and potentially hazardous–shockwaves . ”
“ I would worry about what other health effects it is having , ” says Lin .
“ You might see neural damage . ”
Damaging or not , the next phase in acoustic weapons development will almost certainly entail human testing .
According to Wired , a military - funded lab “ is pushing to get approval to conduct human testing at 130 Db to see if , in that range , sound could have a ‘ deterrent effect ’ . ”
At a “ non-lethal ” weapons conference back in December , Nicholas C. Nicholas , the Chief Scientist at Penn State ’s Applied Research Laboratory , told his audience that “ Behavior modification is next logical step [ in testing ] . ”
Sharon Weinberger reported ,
You would think for all the talk of acoustic weapons , there ’s tons of data .
Not true , says Nicholas .
There is n’t really any reliable data on the effects on human as you move up the decibel range .
The big problem is safety standards .
“ Current standards are far too conservative , ” argues Nicholas , whose lab works on a number of projects for the Pentagon ’s Joint Nonlethal Weapons Directorate .
OSHA standards , Nicholas says , are for occupational hazards that cover up to 30 years of exposure , and should n’t be used for testing weapons .
( “ Lab Pushes for Sonic Blaster , ” Wired , December 12 , 2007 )
Despite the potential of acoustic weapons inflicting permanent injuries , Nicholas was not concerned in the least : “ Some injury has to be tolerated or you cannot develop nonlethal weapons . ”
Nevertheless , their implicit dangers are already well - known .
When the U.S. Army ’s Intelligence and Security Command ( INSCOM ) was forced to release a study under the Freedom on Information Act , it did just that , documenting a multitude of hazardous side - effects .
Under the heading , “ Incapacitating Effect : Microwave Hearing , ” we discover the following :
Microwave hearing is a phenomenon , described by human observers as the sensations of buzzing , ticking , hissing , or knocking sounds that originate within or immediately behind the head .
There is no sound propagating through the air like normal sound .
This technology in its crudest form could be used to distract individuals : if refined , it could also be used to communicate with hostages or hostage taken directly by Morse code or other message systems , possibly even by voice communications .
The mechanism described by INSCOM analysts refer to the so - called “ Frey effect , ” named after Allan H. Frey , a Cold War neuroscientist who first published his 1962 findings in the Journal of Applied Physiology .
While some of the technologies are still in the conceptual stage , how does INSCOM view their possible deployment as a “ crowd control ” weapon ?
The following passage sets the tone ( if you ’ll pardon the pun ) of the sinister nature of these systems and those who design them .
Under the heading , “ Microwave Hearing : Possible Influence on Subject (s ) , ” INSCOM analysts hypothesize :
Application of the microwave hearing technology could facilitate a private message transmission .
It may be useful to provide a disruptive condition to a person not aware of the technology .
Not only might it be disruptive to the sense of hearing , it could be psychologically devastating if one suddenly heard “ voices within one ’s head . ”
( “ Bioeffects of Selected Nonlethal Weapons , ” U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command ( INSCOM ) , 17 February 1998 )
Although “ non-lethal ” microwave acoustic weapons have yet to be deployed , they have been field tested .
According to New Scientist ,
It is claimed that the so - called “ Frey Effect ” –using close - range microwaves to produce audible sounds in a person ’s ears –has been used to project the spoken numbers 1 to 10 across a lab to volunteers ’ . …
In 2004 the US Navy funded research into using the Frey effect to project sound that caused “ discomfort ” into the ears of crowds .
( David Hambling , “ U.S. Army Toyed with Telepathic Ray Gun , ” New Scientist , March 21 , 2008 )
While Hambling may believe such systems are “ outlandish , ” given time–and virtually unlimited resources courtesy of their intended “ targets ” –U.S. citizens , I ’m far less sanguine .
Despite all the hoopla , it should be clear by now that descriptors such as “ non-lethal ” or “ less - than - lethal ” are , strictly speaking , Orwellian constructs that mask their application as repressive tools for domination .
Their primary purpose is not to “ save lives ” but to be used as instruments of social control .
What other horrors are Pentagon contractors literally cooking - up ?
According to Wired , the Wattre Corporation has created an “ active denial system ” called Hyperspike .
Sharon Weinberger reports ,
Imagine being hit by a nonlethal blast that seems to explode in front of you–a deafening and blinding combination of light and sound .
As the battle for “ sonic blasters ” heats up , a number of companies are looking at innovative ways to combine light and sound into new , nonlethal devices .
( “ Sonic Blaster + Laser = New Weapon , ” Wired , March 31 , 2008 )
According to Wattre ’s president Curt Graber , Hyperspike combines a “ collimated beam of sound ” with corporate grifter Stellar Photonics “ dynamic pulse detonation ” laser to create a combined effect that Graber describes as a “ psycho - acoustical event . ”
The new weapon creates a “ mid- air plasma ball ” that that “ basically ignites the air in front of the person , ” Graber says .
“ It creates fireworks right in front of you . ”
What will they think of next !
A fireworks show just before the cops bash your head in .
How ’s that for American innovation and know - how !
With a multitude of uses in the coming period as the American economy tanks and “ restless natives ” in the “ homeland ” take to the streets in protest against endless imperial wars and assaults on our economic and social rights , Hyperspike seems just the thing to “ keep the rabble in line . ”
As touted by Wattre Corporation , the Plasma Accoustic Shield System ( PASS ) “ will eventually combine a dynamic pulse detonation laser with a high power speaker for hailing or warning , and a dazzler light source . ”
But Keith Braun of the U.S. Army ’s Advanced Energy Armaments Systems Division , based at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey , told New Scientist last year that the PASS is not quite ready for prime time .
According to David Hambling ,
Braun puts the maximum range of the system at around a hundred metres .
But he says the PASS laser is unlikely to be used as a weapon , in its current format , since it lacks sufficient power .
Unlike other high - power lasers which burn a target , the DPD relies on a shockwave .
Braun says it would take several minutes to burn through a piece of paper using the laser .
“ It is fair to say that any stunning or disabling of a target individual would require additional force on target , ” says Braun .
“ The current state - of - the - art in portable , rugged laser systems is not at the point of sufficient power . ”
( “ Plasma Shield May Stun and Disorient Enemies , ” New Scientist , April 26 , 2007 )
Indeed , PASS and other combinations such as Wattre ’s Hyperspike “ may be the first step towards a man-portable , tuneable laser weapon that could be used in both non-lethal and lethal modes . ”
Stellar Photonics , which has a $ 2.7 million contract to build PASS for the Defense Department , is pitching a portable laser rifle “ which would be lethal , ” according to Army researchers .
Hambling reports ,
It would weigh about fifteen kilograms , would have a range of more than a mile , and could have numerous advantages over existing rifles–better accuracy and the ability to hit a moving target at the speed of light .
It could also be used in non-lethal mode , “ offering the individual soldier a first response non-lethal alternative , with the capability to go lethal should the situation call for that level of response ” , says Braun .
But extensive testing of its effects on humans would need to be carried out before it could be legitimately used as a non-lethal weapon .
One shudders to think what “ extensive testing of its effects on humans ” would entail and what “ metrics ” would determine its “ effectiveness . ”
Fear not , the Defense Department is busily exploring this for us .
According to its website , Picatinny Arsenal , “ the Home of American Firepower , ” has a brief to “ establish strong partnerships with many agencies … and academia that are exploring advanced technologies . ”
Some of the “ advanced technologies ” under development by Picatinny include :
Advanced Energy Weapons Systems employ advanced technologies that may completely change the way military missions are organized and executed in the future .
These systems include , but are not limited to , charged particle beams , neutral particle beams , antiparticle beams , low and high energy lasers , high - power microwaves ( HPM ) , acoustics , plasma , and substantial potential with nanotechnology .
( “ Products and Services , ” Picatinny Arsenal , no date )
As we have seen in this brief descriptive overview , American militarism is extending the boundaries of “ pacification ” directly into the human body and mind , viewed by military planners and their corporatist paymasters as necessary accoutrements for dominating the “ battlespace . ”
And in this brave new world , science and academia are playing pivotal roles in the development of “ non-lethal ” weapons systems for the American Empire ’s “ up - armored ” war fighters and mercenaries .
According to researcher Nick Turse , since World War II academia has come to rely on Pentagon funding for research and development , a devilish relationship that has “ the money and muscle to alter the landscape of higher education , to manipulate research agendas , to change the course of curricula , and to force schools to play by the rules . ”
As Turse documents in his valuable book , The Complex , one institution , MIT and its spun - off “ not - for - profit ” research powerhouse The MITRE Corporation , brought in a cool $ 883,832,277 in research and development dollars from the Pentagon .
“ Heavy - lifting ” such as this “ would move MIT out of the military - academic ranks and within striking distance of the military - corporate megagiant General Dynamics . ”
Researcher and activist Frank Morales described the sinister convergence of science , corporate power and the military ’s development of “ non-lethal ” weapons technology as one where “ the Pentagon and Justice Department , along with their private and academic appendages are spearheading new ways to control , hurt , torture and kill people , here and abroad . ”
Indeed , Morales writes ,
Within this context , a well - funded sadistic science , searching literally for the “ magic bullet , ” weaponizes anything that can “ disable . ”
This new fascism attacks the body utilizing bio-determinist ideology and advanced technical means , necessarily widening its potential targets with each new technological advance and / or political requirement . …
No longer content to withstand the annoying pressures of democracy , the corporate game plan calls for a more direct action approach , more repression and less concession .
This is the context for so - called non-lethal weapons .
( “ Non -Lethal Warfare , ” in Police State America , edited by Tom Burghardt , Toronto / Montreal : Arm The Spirit / Solidarity , 2002 , p. 120 )
There is nothing “ gee- whiz ” about such appalling technologies .
Serving as instruments for waging the American Empire ’s new class war , the well - paid “ little Eichmanns ” busily designing an uninhabitable world of corporatist nightmare and horror should be denounced–and their “ research ” shut down .

A report on physical perfection and continuous development of cosmetic surgery states that obsession with beauty could lead to serious health issues as well as problems linked with economic well - being .
Girls and women from the United States spend a lot of money on cosmetic surgery so they would look just like the " photoshopped " celebrities from the magazines .
According to the report published by Beauty at any Cost , each year American women spent about $ 7 billion on cosmetics and beauty products ( about $ 100 a month for every woman ) .
If this money was saved and invested for 5 years , it could pay a full year at a public college .
" We believe that the obsession with idealized beauty and body image is a lifelong burden that takes a terrible toll on all young girls and women in this country .
What 's really new here is the sheer extent to which women and girls are now willing to go ... to be ' beautiful , ' according to standards perpetuated by a youth - obsessed media culture with literally thousands of messages , 24 hours a day , " said Lorraine Cole , Young Women 's Christian Association chief executive .
According to the American Society for Aesthetic Surgery , last year about 11.7 million cosmetic procedures were completed in the US , which represents a 446 % increase in ten years .
Most popular cosmetic procedures include botox injections and liposuction .
The report also states that hair sprays and nail polishes , often used in American cosmetics , feature phthalates .
Despite the fact that no governmental reviews has found any phthalate hazardous as used in products manufactured for the general public , a number of studies showed that phthalates caused damage in liver and reproductive system in animals .
The YWCA joint the makers of a new documentary called " America the Beautiful " , in order to warn the 2.5 million women and girls that the association serves in the United States about the problems linked with cosmetic surgery .

At 65 , Paul Phillips was ready to retire .
He 'd raised his four kids , sold his Phoenix produce company , and even bought a 40 - foot RV to drive across the country with his wife LuWanna .
Phillips was working on his golf game , in anticipation of all the free time he'd have .
Even more , he enjoyed playing ping - pong and catch with his grandkids .
But on March 13 , 2001 , Phillips found himself at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , waiting to see an ophthalmologist .
The vision in his left eye had suddenly gone blurry , and he was seeing floating specks of light in the same eye .
Phillips has diabetes ; he 's had it for 18 years .
He and LuWanna knew failing vision could be related , so she insisted he get the best help available .
As LuWanna later recalled , she called the Mayo Clinic and scheduled an appointment with Paul 's ophthalmologist .
Phillips fidgeted anxiously in the waiting room , wringing his hands — still leathery and calloused from 40 years of handling boxes of fruit and vegetables .
Then a nurse called him to examination room number 9 , where she asked him to read an eye chart .
After the nurse left , a man wearing the standard tie and suit coat of a Mayo physician — a trademark in the healthcare company 's facilities — entered the room .
He held an Executive Glaucoma Screening Form and Phillips ' chart in his hand .
He asked a number of questions and then examined both of Phillips ' eyes .
That man , Paul Hughes , diagnosed Phillips on the spot with " K. sicca " or eye inflammation .
He explained that the problem was simply dry eyes and Phillips need not worry about his left eye .
Hughes recommended over - the - counter salve and drops , known as " tears . "
Then he walked Phillips to the billing desk , shook his hand and thanked him for visiting the Mayo Clinic .
On the way home , with LuWanna behind the wheel , Phillips wondered aloud why the doctor had n't dilated his eye .
He concluded the doctor knew more about eyes than he did .
He used the drops , but they did n't alleviate the blurriness or floating flashes of light .
Two weeks later , the Phillips were sitting in a movie at the Deer Valley Harkins Theatre on Bell Road when Paul 's left eye went completely dark — as if somebody had dropped a veil over it .
The retina in his left eye had detached .
The symptoms Paul Phillips reported at Mayo were classic signs of a tearing retina ; according to the Mayo Clinic 's own literature , if caught at that point when he'd visited the clinic , the condition has about an 85 percent chance of successful treatment with retinal reattachment .
Once it had detached , it was much tougher .
And today , after a series of surgeries , Phillips is permanently blind in his left eye .
So why did the Mayo Clinic fail to properly diagnose Phillips ' run -of - the - mill malady ?
Could be because Paul Hughes , the man who treated him — who held his chart and looked in his eye and recommended drops — is n't a doctor at all .
He 's not a physician 's assistant or a nurse , either .
In fact , Hughes has no formal medical training and has never been licensed to provide healthcare or even sell glasses in Arizona .
And yet , for almost 20 years , Paul Hughes " triaged " eye patients in the Mayo Clinic 's ophthalmology department , deciding which doctor , if any , they should see .
Some patients , like Phillips , never did see a doctor — or any other licensed practitioner beyond a nurse .
Phillips says he was n't told this .
He assumed he 'd seen a doctor ; his wife had asked for an appointment with one ; he'd been seen by a nurse , then by a man in a coat who certainly looked like a doctor and never said otherwise .
Even after Phillips ' catastrophe , when the case had gone to court — where a jury would eventually award Phillips $ 3.5 million — Paul Hughes apparently had no contrition .
" I do n't feel like I need to be certified in something I 'm efficient at , " Hughes said to the jury about the treatment he gave Phillips .
When Phillips learned that he was misdiagnosed by a non-doctor , he and his lawyer told the Mayo Clinic they could donate $ 2 million to the blind , or they could brace for a lawsuit .
Mayo chose the lawsuit , and lost .
In July 2006 , a jury found in Phillips ' favor ; the judge lowered the medical malpractice judgment to $ 750,000 , an amount that matches similar cases involving blindness .
Phillips says he has yet to spend a penny of it .
( After the emotional turmoil of the trial , he 's decided to keep the money . )
Instead , he 's spent the last year mourning the recent death of his wife of 50 years , as well as the loss of his depth perception .
Phillips ' story is a case in point that when you visit the doctor , you can't assume you 're seeing a doctor — or even a trained practitioner .
Not at the Mayo Clinic .
Not anywhere .
New Times reported the details of this case mainly from interviews with Phillips , court pleadings , depositions , and transcripts from the trial .
It 's hard to fault Paul Phillips for assuming that a practitioner in a suit and tie , holding his chart at the Mayo Clinic , was qualified to give a diagnosis .
After all , Phillips had gone to the best .
He knew of Mayo 's international reputation for leading the way in cancer research .
And Mayo had just been named the number one choice of hospital by consumers in the Phoenix area for the third year in a row , according to the National Research Corporation .
Beyond that , the Mayo Clinic — founded in Rochester , Minnesota , in 1888 — is an icon , considered the gold standard of medical care .
When the company opened an outpost in northeast Scottsdale almost 100 years later , in 1987 , Mayo drew patients like bees to honey .
But the standards in place at the Mayo Clinic 's ophthalmology department when Paul Hughes was hired — standards clearly not reviewed as the years went on — were hardly golden .
As revealed in court testimony , Paul Hughes was more than just a non-doctor who had his own office located between the spaces of Mayo physicians .
Hughes came to Mayo as a convicted felon ; his offenses included forgery and cocaine possession .
Not that Hughes was qualified to practice medicine in the first place ; he does n't even have a college degree .
If Hughes was n't pretending to be a doctor , he was clearly allowed to see and treat patients in a way other non-doctors were not .
( And in a way not allowed by Arizona law . )
That 's because Hughes was working for a longtime friend , then Mayo 's director of ophthalmology , Dr. John Creasman .
Contacted for this story , Creasman says he trusted Hughes , regardless of his lack of official training .
" All technicians in our department become pretty good diagnosticians .
You could take any one of them , and 95 times out of 100 , they could tell the doctors what the patients had .
They were right most of the time , so that was part of their responsibility , " Creasman says .
Neither Creasman nor Hughes works for the Mayo Clinic now .
Creasman says that Hughes , still a close friend , was devastated by the lawsuit and would not comment for this story .
Other attempts to reach Hughes were not successful .
Mayo employees testified that Creasman 's trust of Hughes resulted in Hughes ' seeing six to 13 ophthalmology patients per day at the Mayo Clinic , usually without any physician supervision .
Hughes worked in that capacity at the Mayo Clinic for 18 years .
No other lawsuits against Creasman or Hughes surfaced in a search of lawsuits at the Maricopa County Superior Court and at Arizona 's U.S. District Court .
Creasman has a spotless record with the Arizona Medical Board , too .
( At least , to the extent that the medical board keeps such records .
For more information about the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners and other state - regulated boards , see the earlier stories in this series , " The Doctor is Out , " March 6 , and " Dr. Loophole , " April 10 ) .
Even if Creasman and Hughes are n't contrite , the Mayo Clinic certainly is .
Speaking publicly about the case , apparently for the first time , the CEO of the Mayo Clinic admits that Phillips ' care was not ideal .
He says it was a fluke that wo n't happen again .
" I 've been in this position six years , and I 've been with Mayo 31 years .
Personally and representing the organization , I feel bad and take responsibility when things go bad .
We see about 100,000 patients per year .
We know this was n't the optimal , " Dr. Victor Trastek says .
" Today we have a lot more policies and procedures in place , " he adds .
" I hope the point comes out that these are different times , and we 're all trying to give the best healthcare to every patient . "
It goes without saying that a non -doctor should n't be seeing patients alone , says Katherine Hatwell , a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association .
Hatwell says she 's heard of optometrists ( who fit patients for glasses ) working as ophthalmologists ( who operate on eyes ) , but she 's never before heard of a non-doctor diagnosing patients in an ophthalmology department .
" We think people should practice to their education and training and not beyond it , " Hatwell says .
" If you do n't have a medical license , you should n't be able to practice medicine . "
Paul Hughes was officially trained to do one thing — fit people for lenses that an eye doctor has prescribed .
That 's equal to the guy at Costco who works the glasses counter filling prescriptions , not writing them .
( In fact , even those salespeople at Costco are licensed by the Arizona State Board of Dispensing Opticians .
Hughes has never been a licensed optician in Arizona , according to Lori Scott , that board 's executive director . )
Even if Hughes were a licensed optician in Arizona , he could n't treat or diagnose patients .
He could only put their glasses together or order their contacts .
So why was Hughes allowed to see Paul Phillips ?
The answer starts about 40 years earlier , when Paul Hughes was convicted of his first crime .
Hughes was born in 1939 in the rural farming town of Friona , Texas — a panhandle community with a population of about 800 , according to A History of Parmer County .
To this day , the average male in Friona does n't achieve more than a high school education .
So Hughes ' journey to the Mayo Clinic , where he had an office and dressed in a suit and tie , was remarkable — in more ways than one .
In his deposition in the Phillips case , Hughes explained he flunked in an attempt to earn a degree at Southwest Junior College in Texas .
He added that his medical training was n't official , per se .
" I guess the rest of the education was n't done in a classroom setting .
I suppose it was mostly on - the - job training , " Hughes said .
What Hughes left out was that his on - the - job - training started as an inmate at a prison in Sugar Land , Texas , as he would later confess to Judge Anna Baca .
Asked under oath whether he'd ever been arrested or served time , Hughes initially forgot to mention his years in prison .
He answered , " Yes , speeding and changing lanes without a proper signal , and just everyday things that . . .
I seemed to be in a hurry everywhere I went , so I accumulated a few traffic tickets . "
Attorney : " Have you ever been to jail or in jail ? "
Hughes : " Yeah .
I went to jail because I did n't pay the fines . "
Attorney : " How may times ? "
Hughes : " One . "
Attorney : " How long did you stay ? "
Hughes : " One day .
Actually , not a full day . "
Attorney : " Anything else ? "
Hughes : " No . "
During the trial , it was revealed that Hughes had n't told the whole truth .
He had actually been to jail multiple times and prison once , and had been convicted of two crimes : forgery and possession of cocaine .
The forgery conviction landed him a six - year prison sentence .
Turns out that 's when Hughes first learned about the human eye .
In the prison infirmary , Hughes met an ophthalmologist .
He says he worked under him as a volunteer inmate for almost two years .
When Hughes walked out of prison , he had one asset he did n't have before — a two - year prison education about the eye .
He applied for a job at Lee Optical in nearby Amarillo .
" That 's where I began my optical profession , in a store with something like five doctors and 60 people , " Hughes said in his first deposition .
Hughes was in charge of making and distributing the glasses that doctors prescribed .
Hughes then learned how to craft prosthetic eyes .
He worked the Texas area as a " traveling eye salesman , " selling ( not installing ) prosthetic eye implants to Vietnam vets who'd lost eyes in combat .
Hughes regularly solicited his prosthetic wares to eye doctors .
During a cold - call sales pitch in Houston , he met an ophthalmologist by the name of Dr. John Creasman .
The two became close friends .
Around 20 years later , the same Dr. Creasman got a call from an old medical school friend .
Did he want to start an ophthalmology clinic in Scottsdale ?
Creasman agreed to assemble a staff at a for - profit business — the Mayo Clinic .
The year was 1987 .
The next year , Creasman hired Hughes to work as a technician at the brand - new Mayo Clinic 's ophthalmology department in Scottsdale .
Hughes apparently did n't even interview for the position .
" He just hired me and put me in charge , " Hughes said in his deposition .
For Hughes , it was a dream job .
The Scottsdale region and the Mayo Clinic both enjoyed a decade of rapid growth .
By 2001 , Hughes was seeing between six and 13 patients per day , without any direct supervision from doctors , according to Mayo receptionist Cheri Chandler 's deposition .
Attorney : " When you schedule [ patients ] with Hughes , are those patients seeing Dr. Creasman after ? "
Chandler : " They are usually just scheduled with Paul . "
That testimony aligned with Hughes ' own words about his role as a near - doctor at Mayo .
" The procedure is that the patient calls into the ophthalmology department , and they 're triaged over the phone , best they can .
And then they 're scheduled with me . . . they 're just scheduled on the schedule for either a doctor or myself . "
Department head Dr. John Creasman also testified that Hughes was the only technician to see patients without a doctor present .
He said none of Mayo's other six technicians saw patients alone , but Hughes did .
According to Creasman , Hughes actually had a patient schedule .
It 's that appointment schedule that Paul Phillips somehow landed on — even though his wife specifically requested an appointment with Dr. Thomas McPhee , an ophthalmologist .
On the night of March 11 , 2001 , Paul and LuWanna Phillips were watching TV .
Phillips had never met Paul Hughes , but the two shared more than a common first name .
They were both born in the late 1930s .
And like Hughes , Phillips also grew up in a farming family .
Phillips spent most of his life picking oranges and building a wholesale produce business .
He eventually sold his Phoenix - based Wholesale Produce and invested the profits into commercial property — mostly west Phoenix storage facilities built in the early ' 80s .
In 1979 , Phillips had a 3,600 - square - foot home built on the border of Glendale and Phoenix .
When the Mayo Clinic opened in 1987 , Phillips was one of their first customers .
He and LuWanna knew the clinic 's prestigious reputation .
So they took their most serious concerns to Mayo — battles with cancer , other maladies , and , eventually , Paul 's eyesight .
Phillips was first treated at Mayo's ophthalmology department in 1999 .
There he met Dr. Thomas McPhee , a reputable ophthalmologist who became his eye doctor .
In 2000 , Dr. McPhee left Mayo to practice on his own .
Phillips says he would have followed McPhee to his private practice but did n't know McPhee had left .
As it turned out , Phillips ' vision problems began a few months after McPhee left Mayo .
Phillips recognized the symptoms as a possible detaching retina , only because his son once suffered the same serious problem .
Phillips also knew his diabetes made him particularly susceptible .
LuWanna called the number for Dr. McPhee 's office at the Mayo Clinic and booked the earliest available appointment , two days later .
As LuWanna and Paul drove the 50 minutes from their home to Mayo , they both thought they'd be seeing Dr. McPhee .
They had been to enough appointments to know the routine at Mayo : fill out paperwork , get escorted by nurse to exam room , wait for doctor in a suit and tie , get diagnosis and / or treatment , and leave .
Phillips was soon called back by a nurse .
The nurse asked Phillips to read the letters on an eye chart .
Phillips could n't read them with his left eye , he says .
He answered some initial questions and then sat with LuWanna , waiting to see the doctor .
The next and last person to enter the exam room was Paul Hughes .
( Mayo 's records confirm that . )
In his deposition , Hughes says he introduced himself simply as " Paul Hughes " and told Phillips that Dr. McPhee was n't available .
According to the depositions of both Hughes and Phillips , here 's what happened next :
Hughes tugged the sliding doctor 's stool over to Phillips , took a seat and rolled within a few inches of Phillips .
Then he examined both eyes .
In addition to Phillips ' medical records , Hughes held a form labeled Executive Glaucoma Screening .
Phillips and his wife assumed Hughes was a doctor because he replaced Dr. McPhee , dressed like McPhee , and performed an examination .
Hughes then wrote a diagnosis of " K. sicca " and treatment of " tears . "
He explained that the problem was simply dry eyes .
Records show no ophthalmologist or eye doctor saw Phillips at Mayo that day .
" Thank you , doctor , " LuWanna Phillips told Hughes on the way out .
Hughes , she testified , did not correct her .
In court , Mayo Clinic attorneys argued that Hughes only " assessed " Phillips .
But medical records show Hughes wrote " K. sicca , " the diagnosis for inflamed eyes , where the form indicates " Present Rx , " the Latin abbreviation for prescription .
With that , Hughes sent Phillips home .
Despite Phillips ' complaints of severe blurriness and flashes of light , Hughes did n't dilate the problematic eye .
Not that he should have known to ; he is n't a doctor .
Hughes said he did n't dilate the eye because he thought Phillips was only in for a standard eye exam .
But given the written diagnosis ( in Hughes ' handwriting ) , the documented complaint of symptoms , and the form that reads " Executive Glaucoma Screening , " the jurors did n't buy Hughes ' story .
Even if Phillips had come for a standard eyeglasses exam , Hughes was n't licensed to give one ( and he documented the exam on a glaucoma screening form ) .
Two weeks after Phillips asked the Mayo Clinic to examine his eye , his retina detached completely .
Doctors hired as expert witnesses for Phillips testified in court that Phillips ' retina could have been fixed had it been diagnosed during his Mayo appointment .
The same doctors said the two weeks of additional scar tissue buildup made repair by surgery nearly impossible .
That 's why Phillips is blind in his left eye today .
Scottsdale attorney Mark Wesbrooks represented Phillips .
He says his client 's case against the Mayo Clinic is one of the most outrageous medical malpractice cases he 's ever seen .
" This guy was a two - time felon .
They actually created a separate schedule for him .
Mayo tried to keep it hush - hush , " Wesbrooks says .
" It was a non -doctor who was allowed to practice medicine .
He testified that he learned all about the eye while in Texas prison . "
These days , it 's common to go to the doctor and not see an actual doctor .
That 's not necessarily a problem .
Many non-doctor practitioners are trained and licensed to diagnose patients .
For example , physician assistants ( P.A.s ) and nurse practitioners ( P.R.N.s ) routinely see and treat patients .
Both P.A.s and P.R.N.s receive years of medical training and residency before diagnosing patients in their area of specialty .
They 're also licensed and disciplined by state boards .
Even without any such training or certification , it 's possible to legally work with patients , under Arizona law .
There 's a state law on the books that allows doctors to name anybody a " medical assistant . "
Medical assistants are n't allowed by law to see patients alone or to diagnose them .
Sometimes , however , they do .
The state trusts physicians to be honest about the duties they give medical assistants , says Roger Downey , spokesman for the Arizona Medical Board .
For this reason , Downey says , medical care in this state is a swim - at - your - own - risk situation .
" Patients may be offered a quicker appointment if they wish to see a physician assistant or a nurse practitioner at the doctor 's office .
Otherwise , patients should not assume the unfamiliar practitioner is a doctor .
They should ask if they do n't know .
That 's part of being an informed patient , " Downey says .
" For elderly patients , most healthcare professionals recommend that an ' advocate ' accompany them when they visit the doctor .
An advocate in this sense is a relative or friend who can ask questions the patient does n't think of asking .
The advocate can also take note of the healthcare provider 's instructions and information that the patient may not remember later . "
That did n't help Paul Phillips .
Medical assistants sometimes go by the name " technician " in ophthalmology departments .
The American Academy of Ophthalmology says technicians and assistants should never diagnose patients .
Spokeswoman Christina Curas says ophthalmic assistants " are not licensed to practice medicine . "
Curas adds that it's a violation of the Academy 's bylaws and ethics to let technicians diagnose patients alone .
Despite those known standards , Creasman assigned Hughes to triage .
Creasman knew Hughes was a convicted felon with no formal medical training when he hired him .
But in an interview for this story , Creasman still says Hughes is qualified to work at the Mayo Clinic .
" Paul was the only one that did triage when [ doctor 's ] appointments were n't available .
He was the only one that had the expertise , " Creasman says .
" It 's absolutely okay for Hughes to be working triage because he has more experience .
In our department we do n't have P.A.s . "
Dr. Creasman also says the Mayo receptionist told Phillips he'd only be seeing a technician .
( Phillips says otherwise , so it's his word against Creasman's .
There 's no recording of the conversation . )
Creasman says Phillips was the negligent one , by assuming a technician was a doctor .
" There 's no way Mr. Phillips could have misunderstood who he was seeing , because the secretaries make that really clear .
Maybe he hoped he could see a physician after triage , " he says .
National advocates say patients should never assume they 're seeing a doctor , and patients should n't be afraid to ask for practitioners ' credentials .
Technicians and medical assistants should n't ever diagnose patients .
" One of the best ways for patients to help ensure that they receive safe and appropriate care is to be informed , ask questions , and make sure that they understand what is going on , " says Diane C. Pinakiewicz , president of the National Patient Safety Foundation .
" Patients and their families need to be viewed by all as part of the healthcare team and , as such , should be encouraged to speak up and actively participate in the care process . "
Exactly two years after Hughes diagnosed Phillips with dry eyes , Phillips filed a lawsuit against the Mayo Clinic .
His March 13 , 2003 complaint alleged that the clinic overlooked his detaching retina and that they did so because Paul Hughes — a non-doctor — diagnosed his problem .
The case dragged on for three years , at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars .
It was shaping up to be a boring malpractice case , packed with medical terminology and detailed time lines , but ultimately , it came down to one man 's word against another's .
Had Paul Phillips actually complained of retinal symptoms ?
Had Paul Hughes really held himself forth as a doctor ?
During the trial , Paul Hughes retired from the Mayo Clinic .
It was June 6 , 2006 — exactly 18 years after he 'd started .
Days later , an anonymous tipster sent a mysterious fax to Phillips ' attorneys .
The fax clearly tipped the scales .
It came from a number inside Mayo and outlined the criminal past Hughes had hidden during his first depositions under oath .
Judge Baca reviewed Hughes ' sworn claims that he'd only been arrested for speeding .
" He clearly testified to the contrary , and it goes to his credibility .
So he can be impeached with those , " Baca ruled .
Baca called Hughes to the court , showed him the fax and told him to come clean .
Hughes then said his first criminal conviction was for forgery .
He explained that his eye education actually started in prison .
Hughes then said his second criminal conviction was " a conviction for possession of cocaine , about 20 years ago . "
Hughes was testifying in July 2006 , making " 20 years ago " about 1986 — roughly when Mayo hired him to work triage and see patients alone as a " technician . "
Hughes then said that , among other things , he learned how to spell the word " ophthalmology " while in prison .
" He gave me a real good training , " Hughes said of the infirmary doctor .
To make matters worse , Hughes was caught in a second inconsistency .
The medical record from Phillips ' appointment was a one - page form .
Hughes testified multiple times that he never modified or added to that record .
Phillips had requested and saved the same document back in 2001 .
When Mayo produced the same record — three years later — it had additional comments about Phillips ' condition .
Those comments were clearly in Hughes ' handwriting and were obviously added some time after Phillips received his copy .
Between the additions to the medical record and the half - truth about his prison time , Hughes ' credibility before the jury was obviously shot .
" It was never about the case beyond that point , " Creasman says .
" It was always about the personality of the individual . "
Creasman thinks Hughes ' criminal past should have been left there .
" I practiced for 40 years .
Never did I work with someone who had his expertise , his savvy , his honesty , his integrity .
I 've never worked with a technician that was as good as he was . "
The jury disagreed .
March 19 is an obscure Catholic holiday , Saint Joseph's Day , honoring Joseph , the husband of Mary and foster father of Jesus .
Paul " Joe " Phillips , his son Joe , and his grandson Joe consider it their own holiday .
They celebrate together every year .
And so on a Wednesday this past March , the three Josephs have gathered at Phillips ' home to celebrate their holiday with cake , food and a family party in the backyard .
Sitting at the kitchen table , Phillips describes the struggles of life with one eye .
Some days he trips on the stairs in his home of 29 years .
When Phillips ' grandson
Joe makes for the backyard , Phillips says he'd like to play catch with him .
He can't .
Now 72 , Phillips is otherwise healthy .
He walks without a cane or other assistance .
His hair is still dark , his skin tanned .
His left eye is cloudy .
Sometimes he wears a patch over it , particularly for reading , but he 's not wearing a patch today .
" It takes me forever to read .
You lose the line , and then you have to start the paragraph over again , " Phillips says .
LuWanna , Phillips ' wife , recently passed away after a long battle with cancer .
Phillips says he regrets spending the last years of LuWanna 's life fighting a court case .
He says there 's no price you can put on an eye .
Outside the house , Phillips ' RV sits unused .
He 's tried to drive it twice .
But after a minor accident each time , he decided it was too dangerous to drive the motor home with his damaged depth perception .
" We thought we were going to see Dr. McPhee .
He 's a good doctor , " Phillips says .
" Now I can't play golf .
Some days I trip over the stairs in my own house .
It 's tough because the eye wants to see , and it takes away from the good eye . "
Third in an ongoing series .

Q : What does it mean to make Rails thread - safe ?
Q : Why is this important ?
Do n't we have true concurrency already with Rails ' shared - nothing architecture and multiple processes ?
Q : So for green - threaded implementations like Ruby , Ruby EE , and Rubinius , native threading offers no benefit ?
Q. Ok , what about native - threaded implementations like JRuby ?
one instance
Q : Is n't that a huge deal ?
There 's been a little bit of buzz about David Heinemeier Hansson 's announcement that Josh Peek has joined Rails core and is about to wrap up his GSoC project making Rails finally be thread - safe .
To be honest , there probably has n't been enough buzz , and there 's been several misunderstandings about what it means for Rails users in general .
So I figured I 'd do a really short Q/ A about what effect Rails thread - safety would have on the Rails world , and especially the JRuby world .
Naturally there 's some of my opinions reflected here , but most of this should be factually correct .
I trust you will offer corrections in the comments .
A : I 'm sure Josh or Michael Koziarski , his GSoC mentor , can explain in more detail what the work involved , but basically it means removing the single coarse - grained lock around every incoming request and replacing it with finer - grained locks around only those resources that need to be shared across threads .
So for example , data structures within the logging subsystem have either been modified so they are not shared across threads , or locked appropriately to make sure two threads do n't interfere with each other or render those data structures invalid or corrupt .
Instead of a single database connection for a given Rails instance , there will be a pool of connections , allowing N database connections to be used by the M requests executing concurrently .
It also means allowing requests to potentially execute without consuming a connection , so the number of live , active connections usually will be lower than the number of requests you can handle concurrently .
A : Yes , processes and shared - nothing do give us full concurrency , at the cost of having multiple processes to manage .
For many applications , this is " good enough " concurrency .
But there 's a down side to requiring as many processes as concurrent requests : inefficient use of shared resources .
In a typical Mongrel setup , handling 10 concurrent requests means you have to have 10 copies of Rails loaded , 10 copies of your application loaded , 10 in - memory data caches , 10 database connections ... everything has to be scaled in lock step for every additional request you want to handle concurrently .
Multiply the N copies of everything times M different applications , and you 're eating many , many times more memory than you should .
Of course there are partial solutions to this that do n't require thread safety .
Since much of the loaded code and some of the data may be the same across all instances , deployment solutions like Passenger from Phusion can use forking and memory - model improvements in Phusion 's Ruby Enterprise Edition to allow all instances to share the portion of memory that 's the same .
So you reduce the memory load by about the amount of code and data in memory that each instance can safely hold in common , which would usually include Rails itself , your static application code , and to some extent the other libraries loaded by Rails and your app .
But you still pay the duplication cost for database connections , application code , and in - memory data that are loaded or created after startup .
And you still have " no better " concurrency than the coarse - grained locking since Ruby Enterprise Edition is is just as green - threaded as normal Ruby .
A : That 's not quite true .
Thread - safe Rails will mean that an individual instance , even with green threads , can handle multiple requests at the same time .
By " at the same time " I do n't mean concurrently ... green threads will never allow two requests to actually run concurrently or to utilize multiple cores .
What I mean is that if a given request ends up blocking on IO , which happens in almost all requests ( due to REST hits , DB hits , filesystem hits and so on ) , Ruby will now have the option of scheduling another request to execute .
Put another way , removing the coarse - grained lock will at least improve concurrency up to the " best " that green - threaded implementations can do , which is n't too bad .
The practical implication of this is that rather than having to run a Rails instance for every process you want to handle at the same time , you will only have to run a certain constant number of instances for each core in your system .
Some people use N + 1 or 2N + 1 as their metric to map from cores ( N ) to the number of instances you would need to effectively utilize those cores .
And this means that you 'd probably never need more than a couple Rails instances on a one - core system .
Of course you 'll need to try it yourself and see what metric works best for your app , but ultimately even on green - threaded implementations you should be able to reduce the number of instances you need .
A. On JRuby , the situation improves much more than on the green - threaded implementations .
Because JRuby implements
Ruby threads as native kernel - level threads , a Rails application would only needto handle all concurrent requests across all cores .
And by one instance , I mean " nearly one instance " since there might be specific cases where a given application bottlenecks on some shared resource , and you might want to have two or three to reduce that bottleneck .
In general , though , I expect those cases will be extremely rare , and most would be JRuby or Rails bugs we should fix .
This means what it sounds like : Rails deployments on JRuby will use 1 / Nth the amount of memory they use now , where N is the number of thread - unsafe Rails instances currently required to handle concurrent requests .
Even compared to green - threaded implementations running thread - safe Rails , it willl likely use 1 / Mth the memory where M is the number of cores , since it can parallelize happily across cores with only " one " instance .
A : Yes , that 's a huge deal .
I know existing JRuby on Rails users are going to be absolutely thrilled about it .
And hopefully more folks will consider using JRuby on Rails in production as a result .
And it does n't end at resource utilization in JRuby 's case .
With a single Rails instance , JRuby will be able to " warm up " much more quickly , since code we compile and optimize at runtime will immediately be applicable to all incoming requests .
The " throttling " we 've had to do for some optimizations ( to reduce overall memory consumption ) may no longer even be needed .
Existing JDBC connection pooling support will be more reliable and more efficient , even allowing connection sharing from application to application as well as across instances .
And it will put Rails on JRuby on par with other frameworks that have always been ( probably ) thread - safe like Merb , Groovy on Grails , and all the Java - based frameworks .
Naturally , I 'm thrilled . :)
An update on the long term plans for Ubuntu release management .
8.04 LTS represented a very significant step forward in our release management thinking .
To the best of my knowledge there has never been an “ enterprise platform ” release delivered exactly on schedule , to the day , in any proprietary or Linux OS .
Not only did it prove that we could execute an LTS release in the standard 6 - month timeframe , but it showed that we could commit to such an LTS the cycle beforehand .
Kudos to the technical decision - makers , the release managers , and the whole community who aligned our efforts with that goal .
As a result , we can commit that the next LTS release of Ubuntu will be 10.04 LTS , in April 2010 .
This represents one of the most extraordinary , and to me somewhat unexpected , benefits of free software to those who deploy it .
Most people would assume that precise release management would depend on having total control of all the moving parts – and hence only be possible in a proprietary setting .
Microsoft writes ( almost ) every line of code in Windows , so you would think they would be able to set , and hit , a precise target date for delivery .
But in fact the reverse is true – free software distributions or OSV ’s can provide much better assurances with regard to delivery dates than proprietary OSV’s , because we can focus on the critical role of component selection , integration , testing , patch management and distribution rather than the pieces which upstream projects are better able to handle – core component feature development .
This is in my mind a very compelling reason for distributions to focus on distribution – that ’s the one thing they do which the upstreams do n’t , so they need to invest heavily in that in order to serve as the most efficient conduit of upstream ’s work .
We also committed , for the first time , to a regular set of point releases for 8.04 LTS .
These will start three months after the LTS , and be repeated every six months until the next LTS is out .
These point releases will include support for new hardware as well as rolling up all the updates published in that series to date .
So a fresh install of a point release will work on newer hardware and will also not require a big download of additional updates .
Gerry Carr at Canonical put together this diagram which describes the release management plan very nicely :
The Ubuntu team does an amazing job of ensuring that one can update from release to release , and from LTS release to LTS release directly , too .
I ’m very proud to be part of this community !
With the addition of some capability to support newer hardware in LTS releases , I think we are doing our part in the free software community – helping to deliver the excellent work of thousands of other teams , from kernel.org to GNOME and KDE , safely to a huge audience .
There ’s one thing that could convince me to change the date of the next Ubuntu LTS : the opportunity to collaborate with the other , large distributions on a coordinated major / minor release cycle .
If two out of three of Red Hat ( RHEL ) , Novell ( SLES ) and Debian are willing to agree in advance on a date to the nearest month , and thereby on a combination of kernel , compiler toolchain , GNOME / KDE , X and OpenOffice versions , and agree to a six - month and 2 - 3 year long term cycle , then I would happily realign Ubuntu ’s short and long - term cycles around that .
I think the benefits of this sort of alignment to users , upstreams and the distributions themselves would be enormous .
I ’ll write more about this idea in due course , for now let ’s just call it my dream of true free software syncronicity .

Long time readers of this blog ( all four of you ) wont find it difficult to remember my usual posts on my birthdays .
Always a time to stop , reflect and setting goals .
Well , another birthday came , I ’m 29 now , and starting a new chapter in my life .
I ’m joining Microsoft and relocating to the North hemisphere .
I ’m sure you have many questions .
I ’m going to put some effort in answering the ones I can anticipate .
Why ?
Many reasons .
First of all , meeting Scott Guthrie and talking to Brad Abrams made me realize those guys are just as fanaticts about technology as I am .
They want to create things that rocks , and so do I .
You probably remember the many times that I ’ve made public my disagreement with MS , the .
Net team , the ASP .
Net team and even the virtualization team .
I ’m still carrying these disagreements , my beliefs have n’t shifted a bit .
The difference is that from now on I will have a chance to make a difference , to tell people what – in my view – is wrong and how it could be fixed , directly .
I ’m joining MS with nothing but respect to those guys — as I love .net and it is my platform of choice , and the same is true to most of you reading this — and have felt the same respect from them .
IMHO respect is the foundation of a good relationship .
Secondly , having a company ( Castle Stronghold ) is great – you can set different directions , invest time , money and whatnot on what you think is best , you can see things florishing ( or not ) .
That being said , I shall add that sometimes it ’s a nightmare .
It ’s definitely not cool when a client tells you they are broken and ca n’t pay you .
And that is just a tiny bit of the stress and aggravation associted with running a business .
It was a great opportunity to realize that I have friends in many countries that came with projects to help us .
Wo n’t _ever_ forget .
The decision was n’t easy .
After getting the formal proposal the ‘ what if ..’s started to pop up .
I had lunches and dinners with friends that have been working for MS .
The goods and bads were discussed to exhaustion .
I decided in favor as it would be an enriching experience .
I ’m also sure it will be a shocking experience , coming from such a small company that I ’ve founded , where things are fast , big decisions are taken within hours ; to the largest software company in the west coast …
Yeah , that scares me .. a lot .
And the decision did n’t come without its price .
I will be very very far away from my extended family , which I visit at least once every week — will now be once in an year , perhaps ?
And far away from my friends ..
Also means the end of a long - lasting relationship which in itself is painfully enough .
On the other side is the start of a whole new experience that I ’m sure is going to change me deeply .
What are you going to do there ?
If you have listened this podcast you know what the community expects from MS .
I like to think I ’m joining to help solve the problems pointed there .
Formally I ’m joining as a Program Manager on the MEF team .
I would love ( and expect ) to participate in several fronts , though , as any member on the DevDiv .
What happens to Castle ?
That was a delicate subject to me , but surprinsingly it was n’t a problem to them .
I got a written permission to keep working on Castle as much as I want .
So nothing changes …
What happens to Donjon ?
The guys at Stronhold will keep improving it and soon release it .
I wont be able to keep working on it .
I ’m sure it will rock !
What happens to Castle Stronghold ?
Albeit I was the frontman at CS , there ’s a handful of talented people there .
For the first time we were lucky hiring a junior developer – I could n’t believe myself – and I ’m positive the company will have a great future .
I ’m going to have a small share of the company , but wont be involved anymore .
Stronghold also just had a share sold to one of our clients , I ’ll release details soon once it gets signed .
That ’s all .
My start date is August 11th , so expect a few more posts on donjon and related stuff here until there .
Wish me luck and see you at alt.

Bernanke , Paulson , FDIC Eye Taxpayer Bailouts , More Power
Even as PDCF use is waning , Bernanke Says Fed May Continue Lending Into Next Year .
" The Federal Reserve is strongly committed " to financial stability and is " considering several options , including extending the duration of our facilities for primary dealers beyond year - end , " Bernanke said in a speech to a conference in Arlington , Virginia .
Bernanke also endorsed proposals to set up a federal liquidation process for a failing investment bank .
The Treasury should " take a leading role in any such process " in consultation with regulators , he said .
Such a resolution mechanism may help reduce concern that investors and dealers begin counting on Fed aid in case their bets go wrong .
Securities firms have cut back on their use of the programs in recent weeks .
The balance of loans outstanding from the PDCF dropped to zero as of July 2 , the first time that 's happened since the program began .
On March 26 , the end of the first full week of operation , the PDCF had a balance of $ 37 billion .
Bids in the TSLF 's weekly auctions , in which dealers swap securities such as mortgage - backed debt for Treasuries from the New York Fed , have declined since the start of the program .
In the July 3 operation , firms submitted bids for $ 26.1 billion out of $ 50 billion of Treasuries offered .
Bernanke 's comments on the resolution authority are in line with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson 's July 2 statement that " any commitment of government support should be an extraordinary event that requires the engagement of the executive branch . "
FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair has also said an agency should be given such liquidation authority for investment banks .
The FDIC has that power over lenders whose deposits it insures .
In the case of commercial banks , the use of taxpayer funds in an emergency requires the approval of two - thirds majorities of the FDIC and Fed boards , and of the Treasury secretary in consultation with the president .
" Despite the complexities of designing a resolution regime for securities firms , I believe it is worth the effort , '' Bernanke said today .
" In particular , by setting a high bar for such actions , the adverse effects on market discipline could be minimized . ''
Bernanke endorsed several ways for the Fed and other U.S. agencies to gain more oversight of investment banks and financial markets .
Congress should legislate " consolidated supervision " of investment banks and other big securities firms , with the unspecified regulator having authority over capital , liquidity holdings and risk management , he said .
The Fed itself should also get " explicit oversight authority " over payment and settlement systems , putting the Fed on par with counterparts from around the world , Bernanke said .
Congress may consider giving the Fed responsibility for " promoting the overall stability of financial markets , " Bernanke said .
Still , " it would be particularly important to make clear that any government intervention to avoid the disorderly liquidation of firms on the verge of bankruptcy should use clearly defined tools and processes , " he said .
Misguided Calls For Activism
These proposed new powers , like the alphabet soup of temporary lending facilities ( TAF , PDCF , TSLF ) all created on the fly , are yet another round of Misguided Calls For Activism .
The Fed with help from Congress and the Bush administration created this mess , and instead of getting rid of the Fed , proposals are flying from every corner for the above parities to give the Fed still more tools in which to wreak havoc .
Now there is an open proposal , " only for emergencies , wink - wink " , to use taxpayer money to bailout banks .
Instead , what needs to happen is for insolvent banks to fail .
We are in this monstrous mess because the Fed , attempting to bail out its banking buddies in the wake of a dot - com crash , decided the way to do it was blow an even bigger bubble to reliquify banks .
That operation " succeeded " by creating the biggest housing bubble the world has ever seen .
However , the patient is now on the death bed .
And just as you do not give heroin to addicts to cure them , you cannot and should not even consider injecting taxpayer money into banks that quite literally deserve to go under .
Sloshing money around does nothing but zombify banks , while further depleting the pool of savings that should go to more productive uses .
Inquiring minds may wish to consider Night of the Living Fed for an analysis of the Fed 's role as pawnbroker , why such misguided policies are bound to fail , and what the real solution to this mess is .
Instead , and in strict accordance with the Fed Uncertainty Principle , the Fed wants sweeping new powers .
Corollary Number Two :
The government / quasi - government body most responsible for creating this mess ( the Fed ) , will attempt a big power grab , purportedly to fix whatever problems it creates .
The bigger the mess it creates , the more power it will attempt to grab .
Over time this leads to dangerously concentrated power into the hands of those who have already proven they do not know what they are doing .

Calling someone a douchebag on the Internet usually does n't result in much in the way of major consequences .
That is unless , of course , you 're in high school and the douchebag in question is a school official .
In the case of Lewis S. Mills High School senior Avery Doninger , the use of the d-word on her blog resulted in her losing her position as class secretary — something that she and her mother believe is unfair and a violation of her First Amendment rights .
Unfortunately for the Doningers , the courts have thus far sided with the school 's decision .
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a lower court decision yesterday , saying that while it was sympathetic to Avery 's plight , the school did not violate her constitutional rights .
It all started with a dispute over a battle of the bands event last year .
The student council , of which Avery was the secretary , had gotten into a disagreement with school officials over an already - twice - rescheduled battle of the bands .
The school wanted to reschedule yet again because a certain teacher could not be present to operate the lighting equipment , and rebuffed the council 's requests to hire a professional or have a parent operate it instead .
Avery and members of the council drafted an e-mail asking others to call or write the district superintendent to support their cause , resulting in numerous phone calls .
This apparently angered school officials , according to court documents , resulting in the possible cancellation of the event altogether .
We say " possible " because the students offer slightly conflicting reports of the events from what school officials told the court ( school officials claim that they merely admonished the students for sending a mass e-mail ) .
Avery then made a post on her personal blog while at home , outside of school hours .
In it , she used somewhat unladylike language to describe school officials , and called on other students to write or call in their complaints .
( As an aside , this request actually seems quite diplomatic for an angry high schooler .
But I digress . )
The blog post contained no threats and was fairly benign outside of her use of the word in question .
Although the blog post is no longer online , it 's excerpted in some of the court filings :
jamfest is cancelled due to douchebags in central office .
here is an email that we sent to a ton of people and asked them to forward to everyone in their address book to help get support for jamfest .
basically , because we sent it out , Paula Schwartz is getting a TON of phone calls and emails and such .
we have so much support and we really appriciate it .
however , she got pissed off and decided to just cancel the whole thing all together . [...]
And here is a letter my mom sent to Paula [ Schwartz ] and cc’d Karissa [ Niehoff ] to get an idea of what to write if you want to write something or call her to piss her off more .
im down .
As it turns out , Jamfest was eventually rescheduled and went down with all but one of the original bands .
It just so happened that Avery and the rest of the council were running for reelection in the spring , however .
Once school officials discovered her blog post by means of a random Internet search , they barred her from being reelected and from being able to speak at graduation .
The reason ?
They had decided that her blog post had created a " foreseeable risk of substantial disruption " at the school , and could n't risk having Avery in a position representing the class .
She and her mother then sued the school district , saying that officials violated Avery 's First Amendment rights under the Constitution , as well as the Connecticut Constitution .
They asked the school to hold new elections and allow Avery to run .
The district court ruled against the Doningers , however , saying that they did not show a sufficient likelihood of success if such an injunction were to be granted .
The Doningers appealed the decision , bringing us to where we are today .
The Court of Appeals noted that adults may have a constitutional right to use vulgar or offensive speech in order to make a point , but that it " may legitimately give rise to disciplinary action by a school " if a school is responsible for " teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior . "
Although Avery made her statements off school grounds and outside of school hours , they were related to school activities and ultimately caused some level of disruption within the school setting .
The court also noted that if Avery had distributed her comments in the form of a flier on school grounds , offensive forms of expression " may be prohibited . "
Avery 's position as secretary was also considered a " privilege " that could be rescinded at any point , the court said , especially since her actions apparently undermined the values of the student government as an extracurricular activity .
Ultimately , the court of appeals decided that Avery 's constitutional rights were not violated by the school .
" We are sympathetic to her disappointment at being disqualified from running for Senior Class Secretary and acknowledge her belief that in this case , ' the punishment did not fit the crime , ' " reads the decision .
" We are not called upon , however , to decide whether the school officials in this case exercised their discretion wisely ... we are not authorized to intervene absent ' violations of specific constitutional guarantees . ' "
The decision concerns free speech advocates because of the cloudy nature of the blog post .
No threats were made and no major student demonstrations occurred — at most , the students were a bit " riled up " ( according to Avery 's testimony ) over having their event possibly cancelled and their student council going to great lengths to turn the decision around .
Most importantly , the decision will likely be used as further precedent in the future for schools ( and possibly colleges and universities ) to take action against students for their postings around the ' Net .

Did you ever notice that families with little money are more tight nit and happier than wealthy families ?
I ’m sure there are other explanations for this reality , but I ’ve stumbled across one epiphany that makes sense to me .
Here ’s how I reached my conclusion .
My boys and I are a very close , happy family , and we recently arrived home from a week - long trip to Disney and Universal .
We had a great time on Space Mountain , Rock ’n Roller Coaster and Disco H2O .
We also loved the shows .
I was even “ THAT GUY ” on the Monster ’s Inc. show – an interactive , animated program that spotlights audience members and makes them characters in the plot .
My boys loved that I somehow got to be the costar of the show for which I was presented with this badge .
All day long , Disney employees , or cast members as they prefer to be called , said “ Hey , you ’re THAT GUY , Congratulations !
Okay , back to our regularly scheduled program already in progress .
As I said , Orlando was awesome , but the trip – the trip was most excellent .
This particular trip reminded me of childhood expeditions , in which memories of the “ journey there ” conjure up more anticipation and excitement than the destination itself .
For me , childhood road trips were a time for laughter , planning , and excitement – almost magical .
My family takes several multi- hour fun trips per year , and it became evident to me this year that while we usually have loads of fun , some magic was missing .
As a college professor in a single parent family , I would not describe my financial status as wealthy , but with budgeting and planning we do fine .
And as I looked at my boys gearing up for our 9 hour trip , I thought : when it comes to childhood possessions , one area that kids today often differ from kids of just a generation ago is in technology .
As we boarded the car for our trip , this is what I observed : two boys with IPods on , cell phones by their sides , one watching a movie on his portable DVD , and the other playing his Nintendo DS .
I had just tuned Sirius radio to hair nation .
For about five minutes I sat frozen with keys in hand – I realized we were being isolated by technology – there was no opportunity to savor the excitement .
I realized that our trip would be like Christmas without the Christmas season – no time for anticipation , so I made the unpopular announcement to put away all the gadgets for the first half of the trip .
The first few moments were n’t particularly productive , but that soon changed .
My boys and I talked about what we wanted to do during our vacation .
We sang songs and played games .
We played the initial game ( ie J.D. Male actor ; hint : plays a pirate ) , the alphabet game ( ie , find words on signs that begin with “ A ” , then “ B : ect ) , the other alphabet game ( I say Apple , one son says Apple , Bear ; the next son says : Apple , Bear , Crow , etc ) , and also 20 questions .
We made up our own games : who could find the most red trucks and who could find the license plates from a specified state .
We told jokes , we told stories , we laughed , and we loved it .
Before the magic of Disney , we shared the magic of the family road trip .
We shared the magic of love and family that no amount of money can buy .
Disney was entertaining :
But the magic did not end there .
As we boarded the car for the trip home , I noticed my boys had their IPods and games by their sides .
I smiled and thought maybe the magic of childhood can’t compete with today ’s technology .
As I started the engine and began to drive , a small but enthusiastic voice from behind me said , “ Can we play 20 questions first ? ”
And so we did . . .
Our vacation is now over ; and as always , while we enjoyed the trip , we are happy to be home .
This trip ; however , we brought a special souvenir home with us , and we agreed to take it out often – something more magical than Disney .
We agreed to limit the electronics and make more time for what really counts – the magic that no money can buy .

Most of the fawning corporate media ( FCM ) coverage of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf 's resignation Monday was even more bereft of context than usual .
It was as if Musharraf looked out the window and said , " It 's a beautiful day .
I think I 'll resign and go fishing . "
Thus , the lead in Tuesday 's editorial in the New York Times , once known as the newspaper of record : " In the end , President Pervez Musharraf went , if not quietly , with remarkably little strife . "
Certain words seem to be automatically deleted from the computers of those writing for the Times .
Atop the forbidden wordlist sits " impeachment . "
And other FCM — the Washington Post , for example — generally follow that lead , still .
Very few newspapers carried the Associated Press item that put the real story up front ; i.e. , that Musharraf resigned " just days ahead of almost certain impeachment . "
In other words , he pulled a Nixon .
How short our memories !
Three articles of impeachment were approved by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27 , 1974 ; Nixon resigned less than two weeks later .
But what were those charges , and how do they relate to George W. Bush today ?
Among the charges were these :
-- Without lawful cause or excuse [ Richard M. Nixon ] " failed to produce papers and things as directed by duly authorized subpoenas by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House … and willfully disobeyed such subpoenas … thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested in the Constitution in the House of Representatives . " --
" Endeavouring to cause prospective defendants … to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony . " --
" Endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency . "
The New John Conyers
Fortunately , John Conyers , who now chairs the House Judiciary Committee , was among those approving those three articles of impeachment .
Unfortunately , he seems to have long - as well as short - term memory loss .
On subpoenas , he has let the Bush administration diddle him and the committee .
What about favored treatment and consideration in return for silence or false testimony ?
What did Conyers do when President George W. Bush commuted Libby 's sentence , in a transparent , but successful , attempt to prevent Libby from squealing on his bosses ?
Conyers moved manfully to do what he always does : he expressed " frustration , " wrote a letter to the president , held a hearing , and then — nothing .
This , despite special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald 's parting admonition , " There is a cloud over the vice president …
And that cloud remains because the defendant [ Libby ] obstructed justice . "
Misuse of the CIA
What about this serious charge ?
Here too Conyers ' behavior has been nothing short of bizarre , even though he has been repeatedly briefed on how the Bush administration played games with intelligence to " justify " an unnecessary war .
If further proof of the misuse of intelligence were needed , Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller provided it in early June , when he released the findings of his committee 's exhaustive investigation of administration misrepresentations of pre-Iraq - war intelligence .
Rockefeller summed it up succinctly :

Forty years ago , author Paul Ehrlich stirred up controversy by predicting that the world 's steady population growth would cause hundreds of millions of people to starve within a decade of publication of " The Population Bomb . "
Though his predictions were wrong , he is often credited with having had a major influence on the environmental movement in the '60s and ' 70s .
During today 's OnPoint , Paul Ehrlich , author of the new book " The Dominant Animal " and Bing professor of population studies and professor of biological sciences at Stanford University , gives his take on today 's top energy and environment issues .
He also responds to critics who have accused him of using scare tactics .
Monica Trauzzi : Welcome to OnPoint .
I 'm Monica Trauzzi .
Joining me today is Paul Ehrlich , author of the new book " The Dominant Animal . "
Paul is a Bing professor of population studies and a professor of biological sciences at Stanford University .
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Paul 's controversial and widely read book , " The Population Bomb . "
Paul , thanks for coming on the show .
Paul Ehrlich : Great to be here .
Monica Trauzzi : Paul , you made a name for yourself in the 60s by publishing " The Population Bomb " and it took a hard look at population growth and the impact that it could have on food supplies , the environment .
With all due respect , there are probably some viewers out there that are thinking " Him again ? "
Paul Ehrlich : Him again , yeah , well , I 'm sorry .
I just have n't died .
Monica Trauzzi :
What 's the new message that you 're putting forth in this new book " The Dominant Animal " that might get some of these skeptics that on your side ?
Paul Ehrlich : Well , it 's an updated message basically .
The things that have changed have almost all changed in a negative direction .
For instance , when " The Population Bomb " was written , we did n't know anything about the destruction of the ozone layer .
We thought that global climate change , climate disruption , was going to be something for the end of this century because we only knew half of the greenhouse forcing .
We knew about carbon dioxide , but we did n't know about the other greenhouse gases .
Norman Myers had n't pointed out that the tropical forests were disappearing and we were losing the working parts of our life - support systems .
We wrote about big epidemics , but AIDS had n't hit yet .
So , basically the things are back where they were then only much , much worse , because , of course , because instead of having 3 1 / 2 billion people today we have almost twice that many .
We 've added more people to the planet since I wrote that book than were alive when I was born in 1932 , which seems like a very short time ago to me .
Monica Trauzzi :
So , you 're saying what , that humans are doing things that are damaging the environment , we 're damaging the world we 're living in and we 're not going to be able to continue living here ?
Paul Ehrlich : " The Dominant Animal , " A , tells you where we came from .
Most people do n't know that .
How did we get to be the dominant animal ?
How did we get the enormous cultural power that 's allowing us to change the entire planet ?
And then second , why are we changing the entire planet stupidly in ways that are going to make it impossible for us to continue civilization ?
And the scientific community is essentially unanimous on this and the big problem today is how in hell do you get people to pay attention and change their behavior ?
I mean we 're having a presidential election in which none of the truly crucial issues are being properly addressed .
Monica Trauzzi :
It 's been widely thought that you paved the way for environmentalism in the 60s .
It 's a different time now though and there are a lot of big names who have come into play , Al Gore , T. Boone Pickens recently .
What makes this book different from all of the other environmental books that are out there ?
Paul Ehrlich :
Well , first of all , it gives the background .
It tells where we came from , how we evolved and how we 're evolving .
The second thing is it's an overview which has been vetted by essentially the key people in the scientific community of where we are , what we 're doing , and what we need to do .
Now , for instance , I 've known
Al for a long time .
We worked together on the nuclear winter issue back in the early 1980s .
What he says is perfectly true , that is we could really shift away from using fossil fuels in about a decade .
The problem is to do that we'd have to have a World War II type mobilization .
It would take the whole society to get together and decide to do it .
In World War II we went from building tens of thousands of cars one year to building tens of thousands of airplanes the next .
And at the end of the war we did the reverse .
We can do it .
The issue is there 's not the slightest sign of it .
We have a government that 's pushing the other way .
Most people , for instance , we 're having a big debate over where to drill for more oil , despite the fact , A , that any place we drill will not change energy prices ; B , gasoline is still much too cheap as any economist can tell you ; and , C , we should not be burning anymore oil that we can ever .
We should not be drilling for oil anywhere because burning oil and coal and natural gas is what 's destroying our environment , our climate .
And we need the climate if we 're going to eat .
Monica Trauzzi :
All right , I want to run through , you just mentioned offshore drilling , that 's a big issue .
I want to run through some of the other major issues that are being discussed on the Hill and get your take on them .
Paul Ehrlich : OK .
Monica Trauzzi : Biofuels and the food to fuel issue ?
Paul Ehrlich : Biofuels is a scam .
Companies went into that without having done any scientific research on what it meant for the atmosphere , for food prices , for the biodiversity that supports agriculture .
We should , with minor exceptions , not be thinking at all about feeding our SUVs instead of feeding people .
Agriculture is our most environmentally damaging activity .
It could be less so , but to use agriculture , to expand agriculture to keep the SUVs running , that 's just plain crazy .
Monica Trauzzi : What about second - generation biofuels ?
Paul Ehrlich : Possibly , but , again , why are n't we working very hard to deploy more various forms of solar power , wind energy , which is a form of solar power , direct solar , starting to build a hydrogen economy and so on ?
In other words , we could do these things , but we 're still looking for more , we 're fighting a huge war to get our hands on a material , oil , and also in Central Asia , in Afghanistan on gas , when those are things we should n't be burning .
We 're not running out of fossil fuels .
We 're running out of environment .
Monica Trauzzi :
But you 're saying do n't use oil , do n't drill for more .
Biofuels is not a good option .
I mean , what ...
Paul Ehrlich : Well , yeah , what we should be ...
Monica Trauzzi :
What are we supposed to be using ?
Paul Ehrlich :
Well , first of all , we should be redesigning , we should have started 20 or 30 years ago redesigning our cities around people , not automobiles .
In Washington there 's a huge plan to add more freeway lanes on the Beltway .
That 's crazy .
We know from history that the more roads you build the more traffic jams you get .
We can't afford to continue on the fossil fuel basis , but of course we have to continue for a while .
The issue is can we do a Gore - like , or other people say 20 - year transition where we get together as a major effort by our society and move to sustainable sources of energy ?
The nice thing about solar or wind is once you put the infrastructure in you do n't have to worry about price shifts .
God gives us the wind whether we want it or not all the time .
So you 're not going to be , for instance , if you have a solar economy in the United States , we wo n't care what the Arabs are charging for their oil because nobody will be buying .
So , we need to make this transition .
And to think that you can just somehow continue , well , if we recycle a little here , if we raise the standards so that you have to have 50 miles to the gallon in the average car , that 's not going to solve it , particularly since our population is still growing .
The United States is already the most overpopulated nation in the world and we 're the only big developed country that 's still growing .
We celebrated getting 300 million people , even though no one has ever come up with an even semi- sane idea for having more than 140 million Americans alive at the same time .
Monica Trauzzi :
What do you think about the idea of relying on technology to get us out of this problem that we 're having with climate change ?
It 's something that President Bush has spoken about , that technology can get us through , can help us get to a point where we 're not emitting as much .
Paul Ehrlich :
Well , technology can certainly help us .
We are no longer in a position to go back to being hunters and gatherers and living off of dead mammoths .
But , Bush talks a good game , he does nothing .
He pushes continually in the other direction and , of course , he 's a wholly owned subsidiary of the oil companies .
What would you expect him to say ?
So , no question we need technology .
What we need is more efficient solar technologies , more efficient wind technologies , much lighter cars and many fewer cars .
We 've got to technologically build transport systems that do n't involve everybody riding around in several tons of metal .
So , yes , we absolutely need technology , but more than that we need to change our general behavior .
Monica Trauzzi : Peak oil ?
True or false ?
Paul Ehrlich : Nobody knows exactly where the peak is , but nobody should care .
We have got to stop burning so much fossil fuel and we 've got to do it fast .
Again , the problem is not that we have too little energy , it 's we have too much of the wrong kind .
And we got to change that or our kids and our grandchildren are really going to suffer .
Because , remember this , we are changing the patterns of the climate for the entire planet , probably for the next thousand years , which means rainfall is going to be in different places .
All of our infrastructure for handling water , our irrigation systems , water for our cities and so on , is going to have to be now continually changed over the next thousand years .
Do you know how expensive that 's going to be and how difficult ?
You know , cities like Lima , Peru , depend on glaciers that are now melting .
California , our biggest agricultural state , has one of the smallest snow packs ever and the snow pack is where the water for agriculture is stored .
And so we 're facing these incredible problems and George Bush is still meandering on about how we will use more technology and get out of it .
He 's got no solid suggestions .
All of his administration is working to get us more oil by killing people .
It 's ridiculous !
Monica Trauzzi :
Well , I do n't know that they would agree with you going that far .
Paul Ehrlich :
Oh , of course , they would n't agree with me , but they 're wrong .
Monica Trauzzi : OK , but listen , how does population play into this ?
Do you think we need fewer people ?
We should stop our current growth rate ?
Paul Ehrlich : Standard calculation is that a sustainable number , with anything like today 's technology , is about 2 billion .
We 're going to go to nine or 10 .
Every person you add puts more pressure on our life - support systems than the last person , because people are smart .
We did n't start farming the marginal soils and then move gradually towards the rich soils of the river bottoms , we 're going the other direction .
So , every person has to be fed from lousier soils , get water from deeper wells , get their energy from more difficult , distant sources , their metals from finer , you know , originally we started with copper that was lying pure on the surface of the earth .
Now , we 're smelting ore sometimes less than 1 percent copper , all that requires huge amounts of energy , huge amounts of environmental destruction .
And you 've always got to remember that our economic system is a wholly owned subsidiary of our ecological system .
If our ecological systems do n't function right , we wo n't eat , we wo n't do anything .
We 'll all be dead very soon .
So , we are wrecking our life - support systems .
Monica Trauzzi :
But also , in Europe , where they 've been seeing a decrease in birth rates , they 're encountering some issues with the economy as well , so it 's a two - sided coin .
Paul Ehrlich :
That 's because their populations are not shrinking fast enough .
You 've got to remember that unless you think that the population can grow forever , in which case you 're hopeless , unless you think that you 're is going to get an older population when you slow population growth .
And that 's wonderful , because old people can work , but the dependent young people can't .
You know , you can get a 50 - year - old working easier than you can get a five year - old working and the 15 - year - olds shrink while the numbers of over 65 increase .
And so you have a dependent group that 's shrinking , the criminal classes shrink , you get more old people .
It 's known that old people can sometimes work until after they 're 70 .
So that 's all of that worry .
The New York Times articles and that , just pure nonsense , pure , pure nonsense .
All you have to do is be able to do arithmetic .
Monica Trauzzi :
What we do about countries like China and India ?
They 're very focused on GDP growth and they do n't want to hear anything else about it , so ...
Paul Ehrlich : Well , no , the Chinese at least have tried to do something about their population situation .
Did you know there 's no drinkable water in China ?
It 's the only place you can go in a poor country and accept a glass of water anywhere , because they boil all their water before they drink it because they have no pure water left .
They 're running out of petroleum .
And , because they 're boiling water , the air over many of their cities , the rain is as acid as vinegar because they 're using coal fires to boil water because there are too many people to have a pure water supply .
China is probably going to split into a relatively rich coastal nation and a dead poor inland nation .
Who knows what 's going to happen to India , but the same thing is going to happen to the United States .
What do people live in Phoenix do when they do n't have any water , when they have to pay $ 15 a gallon for whatever gas they use and so on ?
It 's going to be very interesting .
We are facing a gigantic transition and the present political discussion is nonsensical compared to it .
Monica Trauzzi :
The final question here , you 've been in this game for a long time , what do you think your legacy is ?
What do you want it to be ?
Paul Ehrlich :
What I want it to be is a very healthy world for my grandchildren and great grandchildren and my colleagues and friends ' kids .
I have a lot of people with 5 , 6 , 7 - year - old kids that I like a lot and I do n't want them to be starving in misery or caught up in huge resource wars or sent to places like Iraq to try and get other people 's resources we should n't use anyway .
Monica Trauzzi :
All right , we 'll end it right there on that note .
Thank you for coming on the show .
Paul Ehrlich : My pleasure .
Monica Trauzzi : This is OnPoint .
I'm Monica Trauzzi .
Thanks for watching .

In a storefront on Q Street in Sacramento , Kim Mack told a crowd that spilled out onto the sidewalk how she came to back Barack Obama .
With a son serving in the Iraq war , which she opposed , Mack was looking for a like - minded presidential candidate .
She was impressed by the Illinois senator 's books .
But the clincher came on March 17 , when she met the Democratic contender face to face .
She describes how he lit up the room with his wide smile , shook her hand and thanked her for volunteering .
" He looked at me , and the look in his eyes was worth 1,000 words , " said Mack , now a regional field organizer .
Obama hugged her and whispered something in her ear – she was so thrilled she does n't remember what it was .
Then Mack brought home the point of her story for the crowd of 100 or so eager volunteers , sipping coffee and watching a PowerPoint presentation in the Obama campaign office on a recent Saturday .
" Did that make more impact on you than if I had talked about his health care plan or his stance on the environment ? " she asked .
On the verge of a hectic few weeks leading to Super Tuesday , the crucial Feb.
5 multistate primary including California's , Mack wanted to drill home one of the campaign 's key strategies : telling potential voters personal stories of political conversion .

[ Updated below .
Pandagon readers , take note . ]
[ See also : " Are You Now or Have You Ever Been ... a Racist ? " ] I have several complicated essays in the works concerning the nature of the attraction that Barack Obama holds for many of his supporters .
Once I complete some other articles , I will turn my full attention to them .
I want to mention the following , only because I am still so gobsmacked by it .
A little while ago , in a fleeting moment of distraction , I turned my radio to the Stephanie Miller show .
No more links for her ; I gave her a link some months ago in connection with her grotesquely awful comments about the tasering of Andrew Meyer ( she was Commentary Four ) .
Miller is on vacation this week , so a couple of guest hosts are filling in .
The subject was Obama , and the comments in general were fairly horrifying , but in the way that has been typical for several months now .
" Oh , his message is so wonderful ! "
What 's that message ?
" Hope ! Change ! "
And what 's the nature of that hope and change ?
So much for specifics .
Then another caller came on the line .
She began by announcing that , , in general she does n't believe any of that nonsense about God controlling our national destiny , and shedoes n't believe that God chose that awful George Bush to be our president .
BUT , she burbled on , shebelieves that Barack Obama has beento lead the United States of America .
AND , she further oozed , look at thehe has on people !
This , she portentously announced , IS .
NOT .
A. COINCIDENCE .THIS .
IS .
SIGNIFICANT .Reactions of this kind to Obama are fairly common .
No , they are not this extreme much of the time , but such statements are far from unusual .
And many of Obama 's less obviously deluded supporters fall along the same continuum .
Take a look at the woozily sentimental , intellectually reprehensible remarks collected at the beginning of " Obama 's Whitewash , " the third excerpt here , and the comments here .
Moreover , this kind of reaction -- an emotion - driven response utterly devoid of coherent ideational content , a response that leads far too many people to be enthusiastically willing to believe virtually anything that Obama might proclaim and -- is one that Obama and his campaign explicitly seek to elicit .
People had better wake the hell up , and they had better study some history very damned fast .
I have sometimes remarked , and I repeat the warning here , that the twentieth century was a nonstop train of horrors -- yet in one sense , the most terrible and horrifying aspect of the twentieth century is that Among the horrors of the twentieth century were several notable leaders who initiated events that led to slaughter and destruction on an ungraspably monumental scale .
These charismatic leaders evoked a response from their followers almost identical to that called forth by Obama .
These leaders specialized in " personal stories of political conversion . "
Does n't anyone see the connection ?
Does n't anyone rememberof this ?
Read the Alice Miller excerpts that I offered just the other day .
Try to understand what is going on here .
Try to grasp the immense danger represented by this phenomenon .
If you doubt the nature of my concern on this issue , let me provide what some of you may regard in the nature of a shocker .
I am not quite there yet , but I am seriously considering the following .
Depending on how this campaign develops , and depending on how Obama conducts himself and -- very significantly to me -- how Obama 's most devoted supporters act , I may conclude that , if you vote , you should vote for John McCain .
Unbelievable , I realize , but I may have no choice but to think that the alternative is far too dangerous to countenance .
I wo n't vote for any national office myself for reasons I 've indicated , somewhat fancifully in " The Tale that Might Be Told , " and more substantively in " The Honor of Being Human : Why Do You Support ? " Yes , read your Hannah Arendt , too .
Think about these issues , think about them long and hard , as I will also continue to do .
And please , please tryUPDATE :
My thanks to James Benjamin for replying to one post that reacted with predictable outrage to this entry , thus saving me some work .
I may have some additional thoughts to add on this particular subject myself .
And as indicated above , I am in the process of writing some longer articles about the Obama phenomenon , and about his followers in particular .
I knew this post would rattle some cages ; that was , in fact , part of its purpose ( given that everything I have said here is absolutely true and accurate in my view ) .
But some of the emails I 've received today are ... hmm , interesting , and occasionally instructive with regard to some of the issues in play .
So I may well have some additional shorter posts on this general subject as well , to address certain narrower arguments that have come up .
The visit captured another challenging transition for a woman who has been through many of them .
A month ago , she was a presidential candidate , discussing her plans for ending the war in Iraq and establishing universal health care .
On Wednesday she was promising the apple , strawberry and peach growers that she would fight for federal aid to cover the losses from the damaged crops .
Phil Wagner , a cherry and apple grower  and a Republican  who sent the message to Mrs. Clinton said that the moment was bittersweet .
“ I told her , ‘ I ’m sorry you lost your presidential campaign , but I missed my senator , ’ ” Mr. Wagner said .
“ It ’s saddening , because I was looking forward to our first female president .
Us guys have mucked it up for a pretty long time .
But I ’m glad we have her back . ”
It seemed fitting that Mrs. Clinton ’s first swing through her home state after she ended her campaign on June 7 would be upstate , in a region that unexpectedly connected with her in 1999 when she was a first lady who was considering asking New Yorkers to send her to the Senate .
Her visit stirred much interest throughout the village of Newark , in southern Arcadia , a town 36 miles southeast of Rochester .
Mr. Wagner spent much of the morning shooing away residents from the meeting .
They took us down winding stone stairs and through long corridors , ostensibly to have some make - up dabbed on our noses for the cameras , in fact to meet the interviewer and test his disguise .
We confronted a tall , blond - ish man in his thirties , dressed in leather and studs , his face heavily powdered , his arms and chest shaven .
He spoke in a heavy German accent , his movements and mannerisms ultra-gay .
He tried to write down our names , but they came out dyslexic .
“ This guy is going to interview us ? ”
“ Do n’t worry , he knows what questions to ask you , ” an assistant producer replied .
We did worry .
But we had signed a contract or release form ( we ’re both interviewed so frequently , neither of us bothered to read it carefully ) .
And we , an Israeli and a Palestinian , are gentlemen ; we do what we promise to do .
Besides , we had been suggested to the production company by a respected Middle East expert in Washington whom we both know .
We had bargained for a fee and received it .
Rob , the producer who spoke to us earlier on the phone , had a British accent and seemed serious and professional .
The interview was taking place in an appropriate setting , near the Zion Gate of the Old City of Jerusalem .
Obviously , this production company , with its three cameras and large coterie of assistants , was serious and very professional .
We had been asked to be interviewed for a documentary that would explain the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to the youth of the world .
A worthy cause .
The producers explained that our interviewer , a German rock star , was the perfect person to establish strong communication with our audience .
Perfect , also , because neither of us knows anything about rock stars , German or otherwise .
We were then kept waiting for an hour , a delay for which we were given a variety of production - related excuses .
The interviewer disappeared .
We had other engagements and were beginning to study our watches and complain .
By the time the interview began , we were preoccupied with our scheduling problems .
We were told that , considering the nature of our audience , the questions would focus on the most basic issues .
And they were , indeed , basic , relating to our expectations for the Israeli - Palestinian peace process .
Then one of us mentioned Hamas , and the exchange that ensued went something like this :
“ Vait , vait .
Vat ’s zee connection between a political movement and food .
Vy hummus ? ”
We exchanged astonished glances .
“ Hamas , ” we explained , “ is a Palestinian Islamist political movement .
Hummus is a food . ”
“ Ya , but vy hummus ?
Yesterday I had to throw away my pita bread because it vas dripping hummus .
Unt it ’s too high in carbohydrates . ”
The Hamas - hummus confusion went on for several minutes .
Then , the interviewer declared : “ Your conflict is not so bad .
Jennifer - Angelina is worse . ”
We probed our limited memory of Hollywood scandals :
Was he comparing the Israeli - Palestinian conflict to some sort of tension between Brad Pitt ’s former and current wives ?
What was going on here ?
Should we pull off our microphones , get up and leave ?
We exchanged worried glances .
“ Could we take a break ? ” one of us asked meekly .
The request was ignored .
And so it went .
The cameras kept rolling , the cameramen never cracking a smile .
“ Vy do n’t you Jews and Arabs settle the conflict with a time share on the land ? ” “ Ven vill you Jews return the pyramids ? ” “ Vy ca n’t Jews and Hindus get along ? ”
Jews and Hindus ?
We played it straight and square .
Nay , we simply are straight and square .
We smiled at the idiotic questions and answered them patiently .
We remonstrated that this was no way to help the youth of the world understand the depth and tragedy of our conflict .
When presented with more straightforward questions , we eagerly demonstrated our disagreements on fundamental issues like refugees and who started the conflict .
We knew something ludicrous was happening but could n’t quite figure it out .
Besides , we ourselves were not being ridiculed — only the conflict that occupies and preoccupies us .
And we were pressured for time and just wanted to finish .
Our rock - star host concluded with a mind - boggling song about the epic Middle East conflict between Jews and Hindus .
At the crescendo , he grabbed our hands and joined them with his .
Unlike Mahmoud Abbas and Ehud Olmert ( or President Bush and Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah ) , my Palestinian fellow interviewee and I are not hand - holders , but we suffered through it .
As we started to hurry away , the interviewer followed us , cameras still rolling , peppering us with nonsense questions about being taken hostage and having his throat slit on camera .
Yes , dear reader , Sacha Baron Cohen is loose in the Middle East .
The end product will undoubtedly be hilarious .
We ’ll try to be good sports about it .
But will Sacha Baron Cohen ?
He is exploiting our tragic and painful conflict in the most cynical and deceptive manner .
I doubt he ’ll give us anything in return .
Yossi Alpher is the Israeli co-editor of bitterlemons.org .
When I was in Sweden last weekend , everyone was up in arms about the new Swedish proposal to empower the national spy agency to listen in on all phone calls and network transactions that " cross the border " ( due to the way Swedish telcos manage their tariffs , this would include virtually every mobile phone call , whether or not the speakers were in Sweden at the time ) .
The vote on this takes place tomorrow , and the Swedes are pissed .
From Slashdot :
This Wednesday at 9 am the Swedish Parliament is voting on a new wiretapping law which would enable the civil agency ( FRA – Defense Radio Agency ) to snoop on all traffic crossing the Swedish border .
E-mail , fax , telephone , web , SMS , etc. 24/7 without any requirement to obtain a court order .
Furthermore , by law , the sitting Government will be able to instruct the wiretapping agency on what to look for .
It also nullifies anonymity for press tipsters and whistleblowers .
Many agencies within Sweden have weighed in on this , with very hefty criticism , e.g. SÃ „ PO ( akin to FBI in the US ) , the Justice Department , ex-employees of FRA , and more .
Nonetheless , the ruling party block is supposedly pressuring its members to vote ' yes ' to this new proposed law with threats to unseat any dissidents .
After massive activity on blogs by ordinary citizens , and street protests , the story has finally been picked up by major Swedish news sources .
The result will likely be huge street protests on Wednesday .
People have been completely surprised since this law has not gotten any media uptake unitl very late in the game .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - The United States military announced on Saturday it had charged a civilian contractor in Iraq under U.S. military law for the first time .
Alaa Mohammad
Ali is accused of stabbing another contractor , the military said in a statement .
It did not specify his nationality .
The statement said he was the first contractor charged under an amendment passed by Congress in 2006 , which governs military trials for contractors accompanying U.S. troops .
Ali has been held by U.S. military authorities since February and will face his first pre-trial hearing on April 10 .
He will be given the same rights as a U.S. service member facing military court , the statement said .
The legal status of contractors in Iraq has been the subject of substantial controversy , especially since last September when contractors from the U.S. firm Blackwater were accused of killing 17 people in a shooting incident in Baghdad .
The FBI is investigating whether Blackwater employees broke any laws in that incident , which angered the Iraqi government .
The Blackwater staff were employed by the State Department to guard embassy officials and it is not clear if they could be prosecuted under laws covering contractors accompanying the military , or other U.S. laws .
The State Department announced on Friday it was extending Blackwater ’s contract for another year .

Two - headed baby dies after family take him home because they are too poor to keep him in hospital
A baby with two heads has died because his parents could not afford to pay for his medical care .
The boy , named Kiron , was born on Monday to a 22 - year - old mother in the Bangladesh town of Keshobpur .
When word spread , a huge crowd of at least 150,000 people surrounded the hospital hoping to see him .
Doctors said they could raise the money to take him 100 miles to the capital Dhaka , but warned there would be ongoing medical costs .
Doomed : Two - headed Kiron , born in Bangladesh , in hospital in Jessore as doctors tried to determine his fate
Kiron 's poverty - stricken parents said they could not afford further treatment , and against the advice of doctors took him home to their village near Keshobpur .
There the child , who at first seemed healthy , developed a fever and died .
Privately , doctors said it would have been a miserable life for Kiron had he overcome his initial medical problems .
' Perhaps it was God 's will that he passed away , ' said one .
' We wanted to refer him to a hospital in Dhaka but the family was so poor that they could not afford to take him there , so they took him home where he died , ' paediatrician K S Alam told the AFP news agency .
Officials feared that unless the baby was moved from the clinic in Bangladesh , where he was born , to a more secure hospital , the crowd would force their way in to gaze at the amazing sight .
If that happened , it was feared , mother and baby would be crushed .
Riot police guard the streets of Dhaka , Bangladesh , during a strike in 2001 .
Police were called in to protect the newborn baby
In the past , babies born with physical abnormalities have been viewed in countries such as Bangladesh and India as living gods .
Kiron was born in a caesarean operation on Monday , weighing just over 12lb , in Keshobpur , 100 miles from the capital , Dhaka .
Newspaper Samakal said many well - wishers had left money for the baby 's family .
Companies should promote Hispanics ' economic and social contributions , says Claudia Romo Edelman , marketer and founder of the We Are All Human Foundation .
A loggerhead sea turtle crawls to the sea after being treated for injuries at the Las Vistas beach in the Spanish Canary Island of Tenerife , June 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Santiago Ferrero
ROME ( Reuters ) - About 60 newly hatched sea turtles lost their way during their ritual passage to the sea and marched into an Italian restaurant instead , a conservation worker said on Monday .
The baby turtles -- which ended up under the tables of startled diners at the beachside restaurant -- were probably thrown off track and lured by the eatery ’s bright lights , said Antonio Colucci , who was called to help rescue the group .
“ They saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route , ” said Colucci , who works on a turtle monitoring project for the conservation group WWF ( World Wide Fund for Nature ) .
“ The diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities . ”
The stranded turtles , which had hatched on a beach in the southern Italian region of Calabria , were released into the sea .
Female sea turtles nest on beaches and their offspring instinctively head to the sea after hatching from their eggs .
Researchers are testing a new way to kill cancer cells selectively by attaching cancer - seeking antibodies to tiny carbon tubes that heat up when exposed to near - infrared light .
Biomedical scientists at UT Southwestern Medical Center and nanotechnology experts from UT Dallas describe their experiments in a study available online and in an upcoming print issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Scientists are able to use biological molecules called monoclonal antibodies that bind to cancer cells .
Monoclonal antibodies can work alone or can be attached to powerful anti-cancer drugs , radionuclides or toxins to deliver a deadly payload to cancer cells .
In this study , the researchers used monoclonal antibodies that targeted specific sites on lymphoma cells to coat tiny structures called carbon nanotubes .
Carbon nanotubes are very small cylinders of graphite carbon that heat up when exposed to near - infrared light .
This type of light , invisible to the human eye , is used in TV remote controls to switch channels and is detected by night - vision goggles .
Near - infrared light can penetrate human tissue up to about 1½ inches .
In cultures of cancerous lymphoma cells , the antibody - coated nanotubes attached to the cells ' surfaces .
When the targeted cells were then exposed to near - infrared light , the nanotubes heated up , generating enough heat to essentially " cook " the cells and kill them .
Nanotubes coated with an unrelated antibody neither bound to nor killed the tumor cells .
" Using near - infrared light for the induction of hyperthermia is particularly attractive because living tissues do not strongly absorb radiation in this range , " said Dr. Ellen Vitetta , director of the Cancer Immunobiology Center at UT Southwestern and senior author of the study .
" Once the carbon nanotubes have bound to the tumor cells , an external source of near - infrared light can be used to safely penetrate normal tissues and kill the tumor cells .

" Demonstrating this specific killing was the objective of this study .
We have worked with targeted therapies for many years , and even when this degree of specificity can be demonstrated in a laboratory dish , there are many hurdles to translating these new therapies into clinical studies .
We 're just beginning to test this in mice , and although there is no guarantee it will work , we are optimistic . "
The use of carbon nanotubes to destroy cancer cells with heat is being explored by several research groups , but the new study is the first to show that both the antibody and the carbon nanotubes retained their physical properties and their functional abilities -- binding to and killing only the targeted cells .
This was true even when the antibody - nanotube complex was placed in a setting designed to mimic conditions inside the human body .
Biomedical applications of nanoparticles are increasingly attracting the attention of basic and clinical scientists .
There are , however , challenges to successfully developing nanomedical reagents .
One is the potential that a new nanomaterial may damage healthy cells and organisms .
This requires that the effects of nanomedical reagents on cells and organisms be thoroughly studied to determine whether the reagents are inherently toxic .
" There are rational approaches to detecting and minimizing the potential for nonspecific toxicity of the nanoparticles developed in our studies , " said Dr. Rockford Draper , leader of the team from UT Dallas and a professor of molecular and cell biology .
Other researchers from UT Southwestern involved in the research were lead authors Pavitra Chakravarty , a graduate student in biomedical engineering , and Dr. Radu Marches , assistant professor in the Cancer Immunobiology Center .
Authors from UT Dallas ' Alan G. MacDiarmid NanoTech Institute were Dr. Inga Musselman , Dr. Paul Pantano and graduate student Pooja Bajaj .
Two undergraduate students in UT Southwestern 's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program -- Austin Swafford from UT Dallas and Neil Zimmerman from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- also participated .
The research was supported by the Cancer Immunobiology Center at UT Southwestern , the Robert A. Welch Foundation , the Department of Defense and the Center for Applied Biology at UT Dallas .
Dr. Vitetta is a co-inventor on a patent describing the techniques outlined in the study .

Dial M For Moron
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Americans may face dramatically higher electric bills next year , according to a government report released Tuesday .
The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecast that electricity prices will climb an average of 9.8 % in 2009 .
Only a month ago , the agency was forecasting a 3.6 % increase for next year .
The new forecast projects that electricity prices will climb 5.2 % in 2008 , an increase of nearly 1.5 times the projected 3.7 % increase that was forecast in June .
" Within the past few weeks , a number of utilities have requested permission from state regulators to raise electricity rates in response to rapidly increasing delivered fuel costs for power generation , " EIA wrote .
" It is likely that most other utilities will soon need to pass through these increased costs to retail customers as well . "
The increase in price of natural gas is a main factor in the projected jump in electricity prices , according to Tancred Lidderdale , an EIA economist .
He said natural gas makes up about 20 % of the price of electricity .
The EIA reports that many utilities have requested permission from state regulators to raise electricity rates in response to the increased cost of generating power .
The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit heard oral arguments in an important trademark case last week .
Rescuecom , a computer repair firm , sued Google in 2004 for allowing competitors to purchase advertisements that would appear when a user conducted a search for the keyword " rescuecom . "
A federal judge dismissed the case in 2006 , but Rescuecom appealed .
Trademark law is designed to protect consumers by preventing companies from selling their products under false pretenses .
The core issue of the Rescuecom case is whether choosing a competitor 's trademark as an advertising keyword is likely to confuse consumers .
Rescuecom has argued that Google profits from consumer confusion by obscuring the distinction between organic search results and paid advertising .
Google , in contrast , compares its advertisements to a grocery store that stocks a generic product on a shelf alongside its brand - name competitor — a use that courts have consistently upheld as legal .
Last week , the case was heard by a three - judge panel of the Second Circuit .
Law professor James Grimmelmann was there , and he gives a thorough summary of the exchange .
The argument focused heavily on dueling analogies .
Google 's lawyers invoked the grocery - store - shelf analogy and suggested that the situation was akin to handing out flyers in front of a competing restaurant .
Rescuecom 's lawyer countered that there was no concept of " next to " on the Internet .
He argued that a consumer entering " Rescuecom " into Google 's search box was expecting to be taken to Rescuecom - owned sites , not to those of Rescuecom 's competitors or critics .
He preferred to analogize Google 's actions to a scenario in which a listener calls directory assistance and is read a paid advertisement for a competitor .
A judge also brought up a scenario in which a customer asks a druggist for Advil and is given Aleve instead .
A key precedent is the Second Circuit 's 1-800 Contacts v. WhenU decision , decided in 2005 .
In that case , the Second Circuit rejected the claim that an adware company was guilty of trademark infringement if it produced pop-up ads that were triggered by visits to the 1 - 800 Contacts web site .
Google relied heavily on that ruling in last week 's oral arguments .
The parties disagreed about whether Google labels its ads sufficiently clearly to avoid customer confusion .
Rescuecom alleged that by placing sponsored ads directly above the organic search results and by using the ambiguous phrasing " Sponsored Links " rather than the more direct " Paid Advertising , " Google was stoking customer confusion , which it then profited from when customers mistakenly clicked on ads they thought were organic search results .
Not just a corporate issue
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed a brief in the case , pointing out that the case could have important implications beyond the commercial realm .
The civil liberties organization pointed out that noncommercial organizations often use trademarked terms to comment on or criticize a company 's actions .
Paid advertising is one way such an organization could disseminate its message .
For example , a labor organization might conduct an advertising campaign criticizing a company 's labor practices ; the ability to use the company 's trademark as a keyword for those ads would be essential to the campaign 's success .
Grimmelmann thought that the judges ' questions suggested that their loyalties were divided , with one leaning toward Google , one leaning toward Rescuecom , and the third undecided .
However , because the question before the court was only whether to dismiss the case or let it go to trial , he predicted that all three judges would vote to let the case go forward .
If Google 's lower - court victory is upheld , it could have significant implications for the future of online trademark law .
It would reinforce the WhenU precedent and could prompt other circuits to reconsider their own rulings , which have been more favorable to such trademark claims .
On the other hand , if Google loses , the case would go back to the lower court for a trial and would probably find its way back to the Second Circuit after the trial was completed .
In that case , the controversy could easily drag on for the rest of the decade .
The use of trademarks in search ads has been a frequent source of controversy .
Last year , the Utah legislature passed legislation prohibiting search engines from serving ads linked to trademarked search terms to Utah residents .
The legislation provoked so much controversy that last month the Utah legislature reversed course and repealed the most controversial portions of the law .
Despite popular outcry from the American Jewish community , Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman pressed ahead with his third annual appearance at John Hagee 's summit for Christians United For Israel ( CUFI ) , an evangelical group with powerful fundraising capabilities and long - standing ties to DC insiders including President Bush .
Over 42,000 petitioners called for Lieberman to renounce the controversial televangelist as Senator John McCain did this past May when it was discovered Hagee was selling DVDs which included a speech he made implying that the creation of Israel was the result of God 's plan for Hitler to wipe out six million Jews .
Although it is well - known the membership of CUFI adopts an apocalyptic theology calling for the annihilation of the Jewish race as a key part of the impending rapture , Lieberman 's logic is unclear to many in the Jewish community who sincerely hope God will not exterminate them any time soon .
Lieberman was accompanied Tuesday by Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel of New York who also ignored a public outcry against his attendance at the event , claiming their affiliation with CUFI lay in the shared belief that the U.S. should use it 's military resources against Iran .
Engel even abdicated his own Congressional power as part of a March 2007 war appropriation , granting President Bush authority to strike Iran without Congressional approval .
Engel also also allowed the Congressional committee he chairs to become a forum for radical pro-war Israeli voices , calling for apartheid , not peace .
From Lieberman 's speech Tuesday , " It is no coincidence that the terrorist regime in Tehran that sponsors the rocket attacks that rain out of Gaza on innocent Israelis , also sponsors the terrorist attacks that have murdered hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq .
Both must stop . "
A recent piece in the Tehran Times questioned Washington 's hypocrisy for giving Israel a pass on their acquisition of nuclear weapons despite refusal to sign the International Non-Proliferation Treaty .
The paper claimed that Iran is undergoing close scrutiny by the UN who has been permitted full access including permission to videotape .
It would indeed be unfortunate if this country enters into armed conflict once again on the say - so of an uninformed Congress , in the absence of evidence or any attempt at diplomatic settlement , and with armies of private lobbyists fanning the flames .
Rather then trust those who have already proven themselves unworthy , let Americans instead heed the staunch Conservative war hero , President Dwight Eisenhower who in 1961 warned us to be vigilant against war profiteers who would seek to provoke unending military conflict around the world .
Unmindful , we let them do just that needlessly in Vietnam , until a vocal protest movement gave Congress the political will to investigate a runaway President .
Unmindful again , we let them do it to Iraq , but with the Woodstock generation becoming the common stock generation , America is facing a serious moral crisis , unable to motivate Congress to do it 's Constitutional duty .
Sen .
Lieberman is continuing to assert our beef in the war on terrorism is with Iran , reminiscent of the hard lessons of the past six years where we saw Washington fix the facts around the case for war with Iraq .
Though Americans overwhelmingy believe the war on terror should be directed at the tiny clandestine cells that actually carry out these attacks , Lieberman 's rhetoric shows once again his priorities - defense and energy industry CEOs , and those who feel the U.S. should be Israel 's blindly obedient attack dog .
The case against Iran so far is highly circumspect , but Lieberman does wonders with very little .

Flash Photography Techniques

Flash photography techniques and tips
As photographers we ’re always looking for perfect light .
And yet , the quality of available light is n’t always ideal .
It is rarely perfect .
But I feel that in using flash wisely , I ’m able to enhance or over - ride the available light .
With careful use of flash , I am more in control of light , and hence the way my photos will look – than if I had just accepted the existing ambient light .
Instead of waiting for perfect light , I use what I have …
and add flash to make the best of the situation .
The next series of articles is a primer for anyone who is struggling with flash photography , or worse yet , intimidated by it .
Hopefully , as you go through the articles , things will fall into place .
We ’ll be aiming for those “ aha ! ” moments .
A few things we need to get out of the way first
These pages were originally written to help other photographers who struggle with on - camera flash .
But they were also written as a reaction against the snobbery of the purists who insist on using available light only – even when it looks terrible .
Many of the photos on the next few pages are from weddings .
However , do n’t feel that this only relates to weddings .
The techniques here are applicable to almost any other field of photography .
Since the majority of my work is as a wedding photographer in New Jersey , it was often easier for me to find examples from that .
The techniques here are , for the most part , system non-specific .
I own and use both Nikon and Canon systems .
Over the years I ’ve used a number of Canon and Nikon and Fuji cameras .
These articles are written with the intent that they apply to pretty much any camera and flash system .
The finer specifics can always be found by delving deeper into the manuals – but on a certain level , these techniques apply to every camera and flash .
The photos here were all taken with digital cameras .
They are immensely helpful tools in learning about the craft of photography .
However , the techniques here are valid for film cameras too .
Also , the images here had little Photoshop work done to them .
But I did correct the white balance , and fine - tune exposure and contrast for these photos , as part of my general raw workflow .
I wanted to show what was possible with the camera and flash and lens ; not show off Photoshop skills .
I always use my camera in manual exposure mode for very specific reasons .
With flash however , I alternate between TTL flash ( if either myself or the subject moves around ) , or manual flash , ( if the subject is static in relation to the strobe . )
More about that in the following articles .
And finally , when I talk about ‘ on - camera flash ’ , I am not talking about the pop -up flash , but a proper dedicated hot - shoe mounted speedlight / flashgun .
