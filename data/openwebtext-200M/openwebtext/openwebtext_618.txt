As we 've been writing about the MPAA 's odd lawsuit against RealNetworks for its RealDVD DVD ripping product , we 've pointed out ( multiple times ) how it does n't make much sense .
The problem was that there are tons of much more effective DVD ripping products out there .
Unlike RealDVD , they do n't hobble the ripped copies .
So , shutting down RealDVD does n't do anything to stop piracy -- and if anything only increases it , as those who want to rip DVDs are more likely to just download one of those free products that do n't encumber the resulting rip with more DRM .
Thus , people will still be copying DVDs , and will do so in a way that is a lot more " piratable " than if the MPAA let RealDVD live .
So why is the MPAA doing what it 's doing ?
The EFF has stepped up with theory that makes a lot of sense : this has nothing to do with stopping piracy , and everything to do with controlling how innovation happens in the movie market .
The movie studios that make up the MPAA believe that theythe movie business , and thus any innovation in the industry needs to come through them and get their approval .
What Real is doing with RealDVD is ignoring the MPAA 's " approval " process , and effectively taking the path of innovation out of the studios ' hands .
If this sounds familiar , it 's because this has what 's been going on with almostof the " anti- piracy " battles over the last decade .
Napster was n't so much about stopping piracy ( which of course , did n't work in the slightest ) , but about the RIAA record labels freaking out that someone ( a college kid , no less ) had established a much better and more efficient distribution mechanism without getting their approval and running it through their filter first .
Effectively , the Big Content players believe that they own their industries , and innovation should come from the top down through the paths that they choose .
Thus , these sorts of lawsuits will continue until the management of these firms recognize that innovation is a bottom - up phenomenon .
Or , the big firms go out of business .
Whichever comes first .

We always knew those electromagnetic emanations would amount to no good , and now here they go ruining any shred of privacy we once thought to possess .
Some folks from the Security and Cryptography Lab at Switzerland 's EPFL have managed to eavesdrop on the electromagnetic radiation shot off by shoddy wired keyboards with every keystroke .
They 've found four different ways to listen in , including one previously - published general vulnerability , on eleven keyboard models ranging from 2001 to 2008 , with PS / 2 , USB and laptop keyboards all falling to at least one of the four attacks .
The attack works through walls , as far as 65 feet away , and analyzes a wide swath of electromagnetic spectrum to get its results .
With wireless keyboards already feeling the sting of hackers , it 's probably fair to say that no one is safe , and that cave bunkers far , far away from civilization are pretty much our only hope now .
Videos of the attacks are after the break .

The Supreme Court may rule that pharmaceutical companies cannot be sued for dangerous or even deadly side effects from their drugs if those side effects arise from an FDA - approved use .
Under a legal argument known as " pre-emption , " the FDA 's approval of a drug absolves companies of any responsibility if that drug later turns out to be dangerous , even if information was concealed from the FDA during the approval process .
While courts have rejected this argument for decades , the winds appear to be shifting .
In February , the Supreme Court ruled that makers of medical devices were indeed immune from state lawsuits if their devices had received FDA approval .
But that decision hinged on the specific wording of the law that gives the FDA authority over medical devices , and the laws relating to drug regulation are not worded the same way .
Even so , the Bush administration has been actively urging the courts to apply the same principle to drugs .
The administration argues that only the FDA is equipped to regulate drugs and decide whether a product is safe , and that judges or juries are not able to make informed decisions on those matters .
The FDA has also recently thrown its support behind pre-emption , reversing a longstanding , de - facto policy of viewing lawsuits as an extra layer of oversight to make up for the agency 's time and budget constraints .
Now the agency says that lawsuits over drug side effects could lead to a confusing state - by - state regulatory patchwork that would cause hardship to drug companies and discourage patients from taking certain medications .
Drug companies are using the pre-emption argument as a legal defense in a wide variety of lawsuits , and the Supreme Court is expected to hear such a case , concerning the company Wyeth , in the fall .
Before that , however , a lower federal court is expected to rule on whether pre-emption can be used to dismiss lawsuits by more than 3,000 women who claim that they were injured by using Johnson & Johnson 's OrthoEvra birth control patch according to the instructions on the label .
When Johnson & Johnson announced its plans for a birth control patch in 1996 , one of the main benefits it claimed the product would provide was the ability to prevent pregnancies through lower doses of estrogen than birth control pills .
High doses of estrogen are known to increase women 's risks of blood clots , heart attacks , strokes and death .
But company documents publicized as part of the lawsuits show that in 1999 , the company discovered that the patch actually exposed women to significantly more estrogen than the pill , a total of 30 to 38 micrograms per day .
Because only about half of the estrogen in a birth control pill actually enters the bloodstream , this means that women using the patch were getting as much estrogen each day as if they were taking a 76 microgram birth control pill .
The FDA banned birth control pills containing more than 50 micrograms of estrogen in 1988 .
Rather than reporting this data to the FDA , however , the study 's author instead applied a " correction factor , " reducing the estrogen figures by 40 percent .
Although the author claimed this was meant to adjust for differing rates of estrogen absorption , such a " correction " was a deviation from the study procedure previously submitted to the FDA .
In the final report submitted to the FDA , Johnson & Johnson claimed that OrthoEvra exposed women to only 20 micrograms of estrogen per day .
The " correction factor " was referenced only once in the 435 - page study report , buried in a complex mathematical formula .
According to internal company emails , other clinical trials conducted before approval suggested that women were experiencing side effects such as breast soreness and nausea due to high estrogen doses , but the company did not warn the FDA that the patch might be delivering more estrogen than advertised .
Nor did it tell the agency about other studies , in 1999 and 2003 , showing that the patch exposed women to more estrogen than the pill .
When the FDA approved the product in 2001 , Johnson & Johnson marketed it as releasing less estrogen than the pill , containing 20 micrograms per day .
The label was not revised until a 2005 investigation by the FDA , following reports of deaths resulting from use of the drug .
At that point , the FDA made Johnson & Johnson add a warning that the product " exposes women to higher levels of estrogen than most birth control pills .
" But the company always knew this to be the case , several lawsuits now allege , and is thus responsible for the side effects that resulted : heart attacks , strokes , and even deaths in those who used the patch as directed .
Studies have since confirmed that women on the patch may have twice the blood clot risk of women taking birth control pills , and prescriptions have fallen 80 percent , from a high of 900,000 in March 2004 to only 187,000 in February 2007 .
But Johnson & Johnson claims that because the FDA approved the drug , the company cannot be held responsible for its effects .
Janet Abaray , a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs , disagrees , saying the company took advantage of the agency 's shortcomings .
" Johnson & Johnson knew that FDA .
does not have the funding or the manpower to police drug companies , " Abaray said .
David Vladeck of Georgetown Law School agrees that the FDA has no ability to verify that drug companies are being truthful in their reports .
" These are scientists , not cops , " he said .
Chris Seeger , another plaintiffs ' lawyer , said it would be a mistake to allow pre-emption to let the drug companies off the hook .
" Our lawsuits are the ultimate check against the mistake made by the government , or fraud made by the companies against the government , or just an underfunded bureaucracy stretched thin , " he said .

Consumers who have been holding off on purchasing a PlayStation 3 console while they wait for bundle deals are in for a pleasant surprise next week .
Sony Computer Entertainment Australia today announced that from October 23 onwards all customers who buy a PS3 will receive a copy of Little Big Planet at no cost .
The promotion start date also coincides with the game 's Australian retail release .
The announcement was made today during a Sony media event , and though no firm ending date has been confirmed by the company , it 's expected to last well into the Christmas period .
A Sony spokesperson told GameSpot AU that gamers will receive their copy of LBP in - store at the same time as they receive their console .
The PS3 is n't the only console to receive a Christmas bonus with the upcoming PSP - 3000 handheld coming bundled with a copy of Lego Batman for A$ 339.95 ( $ 325.25 ) .
The PSP - 3000 hardware will also be available on its own for A$ 319.95 ( $ 221.45 ) .
Official console sales figures from data trackers GfK Australia are few and far between , but Sony used today 's event to announce its latest hardware install base figures for the Aussie market .
Sony claims that there are currently 385,000 PlayStation 3 consoles in Australian homes -- 75,000 of which were given away during recent Bravia television promotions and are not included in industry sales figures .
Sony Computer Entertainment Australia managing director Michael Ephraim also predicted that by January 2009 , the PlayStation 3's s total install base would exceed 500,000 units in Australia .

Let me be honest and forthright : I have an agenda — I always do .
You can be certain that I am typing with a purpose in mind .
I am typing in order to satisfy a much sought - after end .
My end — my reason — is the hope that this article will influence a few , turning them toward the path of liberty .
Are you shocked or offended that I have an agenda ?
Is it wrong — no , is it necessarily evil when a man has an agenda ; when a man has a given end for which he will use some means to obtain ?
Certainly not .
We all have agendas that guide our actions .
And we accept the presence of our own personal agendas without question or concern .
When discussing the evils of government - run education , many folks say that I have a personal agenda .
Well , no kidding .
If I wake in the morning , I have an agenda .
The rhetorical use of the word agenda in a pejorative sense implies that others do not have agendas — this being a false assertion .
Those folks have at least one agenda that gets them out of bed in the morning : to continue forcing me to pay for their government school nonsense .
So why it is that many — nay , most Americans — take offense to the idea that public schools have an agenda ?
Why is it that folks who recognize their own agendas cannot recognize that the individuals running the school system have agendas too ?
Why ca n’t these folks accept that those who fought some 150 years ago for the adoption of government - run schools had an evil agenda ?
Or that many today use government schools for vile intentions ?
Why not ?
Yes , why not , indeed ?
The reason is twofold :
The first is that the prime end of government - run education is graduates who support the system .
This is not some hidden agenda — it is right out in the open .
This publicly lauded end is termed citizenship — and a good citizen always supports the so - called public good of government education .
When the schools say that our goal is to educate citizens , you can be certain that they do not mean citizens who question the state or its bureaucracies and unions .
Good citizens believe that teachers and administrators , as government employees , know best .
Even if the material is enough to raise hairs , the good citizen trusts the schools .
And , should a parent begin to question the schools , the group — the collective consisting of neighbors , friends , etc. — applies increasing pressure to bring the recalcitrant back in line — back to being a good citizen .
The second reason is that anyone seeking to manipulate and indoctrinate the youth can find no better means than a system of mandatory education .
This is true whether the purpose is to extend and enhance the coercive power of government or to pollute young minds with perverse nonsense .
It is also true for any other goal , no matter how nefarious or seemingly benign .
The schools are the agent of change .
Therefore , it is no wonder that the majority supports government schools .
Moreover , if your goal is to create citizens who support the collective , and you are not willing to take up arms , you adopt a Gramscian approach and slowly destroy the institutions of free association — of liberty and freedom .
You attack the family , the church , etc. , in a roundabout way .
You employ the strategy of the indirect approach — you indoctrinate the youth .
By doing so , you break the bond of parent and child without resorting to loud confrontations and street fighting .
You simply use the classroom to define the state and its minions as maternal and paternal figures .
Then , you sit back and allow subsequent generations — educated by the state — to chip away at the bedrock institutions over time .
Sure , you have the occasional pitched fight , but these only serve as feints covering your flanking maneuvers .
Your war is not one of attrition ; it is one of subversion and time .
The conservative claims a liberal bias in education ; they claim a liberal agenda .
They are right .
However , the conservatives only propose to force their bias on the liberals .
The conservatives also have an agenda .
Both groups seek to use government , and both are winning and losing at the same time .
The issue is no longer individual versus the collective .
The issue is now who has the power to educate and indoctrinate .
Despite their rhetoric , most conservatives no longer stand for individual rights .
In fact , these conservatives quickly drop the individual and champion the collective every time someone questions their cherished history .
An evening listening to AM talk radio will prove that point : Liberals are teaching our children that Lincoln was n’t an American hero !
That he did n’t stand for liberty !
Those folks are un-American !
The conservative solution is for the government schools to force - feed conservative mythology to every parent ’s child , all in the name of liberty .
Of course , the essence of the current liberal worldview is also the collective — the collective of Prussia and Bismarck , along with that of Marx , etc .
It is a vision that easily melds with the state and its schools .
And it is a vision that is not all that different from the conservatives ’ .
While their respective messages are not the same , both groups subscribe to the state as the means and the collective as the ends .
I asked this question above :
Is it wrong — no , is it necessarily evil when a man has an agenda ; when a man has a given end for which he will use some means to obtain ?
I answered in the negative .
However , I need to return to that response once more .
A man can employ any means that does not violate the property rights of others .
Therefore , he cannot invade your property to state his message .
In addition , he cannot use force to make you pay for his message either .
Other than those two rules , everything else is fair game .
Nevertheless , the so - called public schools violate both of those rules .
Government has first claim to your children — this being true even if you home school — and will invade your property to deliver its message in the form of state - mandated curriculum and exams .
Additionally , government and its schools have first claim to your income — your property .
Their means is one of evil , as it is a means backed by government — the social apparatus of coercion and compulsion ( Mises ) .
Yes , I have an agenda , and so does government , its schools , and associated minions .
Mine — no , ours is an agenda of liberty and peace while theirs is one of violence and control .
Since we do not seek the violence of government to win the day , we have to educate to see our agenda through .
We have much work left , but at the very least , we have the follies of government to use as our fool .
The Best of Jim Fedako

Reason : added some commands ; fixed some mistakes ;
No press conferences , no accountability , no Meet The Press , no medical records , and no college transcripts for the Palin Express .
And now , the press is barred from even talking to her supporters :
Constantly under the watchful eyes of security , the media was n't permitted to wander around inside Coachman Park to talk to Sarah Palin supporters .
When reporters tried to leave the designated press area and head toward the bleachers where the crowd was seated , an escort would dart out of nowhere and confront him or her and say , " Can I help you ? '' and turn the person around .
When one reporter asked an escort , who would not give her name , why the press was n't allowed to mingle , she said that in the past , negative things had been written .
The campaign wanted to avoid that possibility Monday .
This is not America .
And it 's a chilling preview of how Putin - like a Palin - McCain administration would be .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Once upon a time , Las Vegas was synonymous with bargains .
Then cheap buffets , lounge acts and inexpensive hotel rooms gave way to Michelin Guide star - rated restaurants , Cirque du Soleil extravaganzas and luxury suites at the Bellagio .
But all is not lost , even in these tough economic times when gas prices alone may make you reconsider a Vegas trip .
These 21 ideas , each for less than $ 21 , show that Vegas is still the land of the cheap and home of the free , if you know where to look .

The Conservatives called on the RCMP Tuesday night to block reporters from speaking with B.C. candidate Dona Cadman , in a scene reminiscent of the last election when they stashed a local candidate in a restaurant kitchen .
Cadman , a candidate in Surrey - North , has fallen silent since alleging months ago that her dying husband was offered a lucrative life - insurance policy to side with the Tories in a 2005 confidence vote .
A dispute over exactly what kind of deal the Tories tried to strike with the late Chuck Cadman now lies at the heart of a legal battle between Stephen Harper and the Liberal party .
Reporters following the prime minister 's national tour asked to interview Dona Cadman after a campaign rally in Surrey — a request that Harper aides initially laughed off in apparent disbelief that the media would even bother asking .
They later told reporters to go ahead and try speaking with her at the end of the rally , but when the media pack got too close , the prime minister 's staff ordered the RCMP to block journalists from the exit door .
" Keep them out , " one aide shouted at the guards .
Cadman and other local candidates , meanwhile , were whisked out the door .
Harper spokesman Kory Teneycke later said he did n't see the exchange involving the RCMP .
But he insisted there was no need for local candidates to be interviewed .
" Local candidates ' priority is campaigning in their local ridings , and not talking to the national media , " said Teneycke .
He said the Conservatives hold daily news conferences with the party 's most prominent members — and that should be enough .
" We have media availabilities every morning in which journalists can ask questions of the prime minister , " Teneycke said .
" We have events every day in our war room , generally with members of cabinet . "
Local access has been an issue for the party since the 2004 campaign when candidates musing about official bilingualism , abortion and the Charter of Rights helped torpedo the national effort .
Tight message discipline was ramped up in the 2006 election and has remained a party mantra ever since .
In particular , attempts to speak with socially conservative candidates have been aggressively thwarted .
One of those candidates , Harold Albrecht , was whisked away by a Harper aide and hidden in the kitchen when journalists tried approaching him before the 2006 vote .
As for the so - called Cadman affair , an audio tape the Liberals were hoping to use as a weapon against Harper in the current campaign has effectively been silenced by courtroom delays .
Harper recently won an adjournment putting off a hearing that had been scheduled on the affair , and he 's still seeking an injunction to keep the tape out of Liberal hands in the longer term .
Harper also launched a $ 3.5 - million defamation suit last March against the Liberal party , which had used media reports about the tape to accuse the prime minister of " immoral , " " illegal " and " unethical " behaviour .
The prime minister says the 2005 tape , in which he discussed the party 's overtures to Chuck Cadman , was doctored by the journalist who conducted the interview .
SAN FRANCISCO 
Just days after the T - Mobile G1 smartphone went on the market , a group of security researchers have found what they call a serious flaw in the Android software from Google that runs it .
One of the researchers , Charles A. Miller , notified Google of the flaw this week and said he was publicizing it now because he believed that cellphone users were not generally aware that increasingly sophisticated smartphones faced the same threats that plague Internet - connected personal computers .
Mr. Miller , a former National Security Agency computer security specialist , said the flaw could be exploited by an attacker who might trick a G1 user into visiting a booby - trapped Web site .
The G1  the so - called Google phone  went on sale at T - Mobile stores on Wednesday .
Google executives acknowledged the issue but said that the security features of the phone would limit the extent of damage that could be done by an intruder , compared with today ’s PCs and other cellphones .

What 's new ?
As you know , the Republicans bought Sarah Palin $ 150,000 in clothes last month – that ’s more than the average American household spends on clothes in 80 years .
That ’s also a gift .
And it ’s a taxable gift .
It does n’t matter if it ’s for work .
And it does n’t matter if the Republicans now say they ’re going to donate the clothes to charity after it ’s over .
Sarah Palin can’t accept $ 150,000 dollars in goods , use them , then later give them away to charity and not pay taxes on the gift she received .
By the time she gives them away to charity , they ’re used clothes – and worth about 1/3 of their original value .
So , sure , she can take a tax deduction on the $ 50,000 in clothes she ’s giving away ( a savings of perhaps $ 15 k or so ) , but she still has to pay $ 50 k or so in taxes on the $ 150,000 gift she received in the first place .
That means Palin will owe $ 35,000 net in taxes due to her big shopping spree at Neiman Marcus and Saks .
And the Republicans can’t help her pay for it , or she ’ll be paying taxes on their help as well .
Of course , Palin is no stranger to failing to report her taxable income – she did the same thing while serving as governor of Alaska .
Scientists believe 5,300 - year - old mummified 'ice man ' belonged to unknown branch of human family tree
A 5,300 - year - old mummified 'ice man ' unearthed in the Alps belonged to a previously unknown branch of the human family tree , scientists have discovered .
No trace of the lineage appears to remain today , meaning that the 'ice man ' - dubbed ' Oetzi ' - is unlikely to have any descendants .
Oetzi's mummified remains were found in September 1991 in the Eastern Alps near the Austro - Italian border .
The 5,300 - year - old remains of Oetzi the iceman .
Scientists have failed to trace his lineage , fearing his family may have become extinct
He was about 46 years old when he met his violent death .
Examinations revealed that he had been wounded by an arrow and possibly finished off with a mace blow to the face .
Since 1998 he has been on display at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano , Italy .
Scientists have now built up a complete picture of Oetzi 's mitochondrial DNA , which is always passed down to future generations by mothers .
This is DNA in the mitochondria , tiny power plants in cells that generate energy .
The iceman has been on display since 1998 at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Bolzano , Italy , after being discovered in 1991
The team had a surprise when they tried to determine which genetic branch of the human family tree Oetzi belonged to .
Although he fell into a subgroup called K1 , his lineage did not match any of the three known K1 ' clusters ' .
Professor Martin Richards , from the University of Leeds , said :
' Our analysis confirms that Oetzi belonged to a previously unidentified lineage of K1 that has not been seen to date in modern European populations .
' The frequency of genetic lineages tends to change over time , due to random variations in the number of children people have - a process known as " genetic drift " - and as a result , some variants die out .
' Our research suggests that Oetzi 's lineage may indeed have become extinct . '
The findings appear in the journal Current Biology .

Advertisement A passenger plane en route from London to Melbourne has made an emergency landing in the Philippines after a large hole appeared in its fuselage .
Qantas Airways said its Boeing 747-400 , with 346 passengers and 19 crew , diverted to Manila shortly after leaving Hong Kong and landed safely .
Engineers are investigating what caused the hole - about 2.5 m to 3 m in diameter - which led to cabin pressure problems .
An airport official said passengers looked scared and some were sick .
Seeing the hole caused a lot of emotion .
People were physically shaking
Phill Restall , passenger
Eyewitness : Qantas flight drama
What went wrong on the plane ?
In pictures : Plane drama Airport authority spokesman Octavio Lina said part of the flooring near the affected section gave way , exposing some of the cargo below , and part of the ceiling also collapsed .
" Upon disembarkation , there were some passengers who vomited .
You can see in their faces that they were really scared , " he said .
' Gust of wind ' Passengers described hearing a large bang and feeling a rush of wind and debris through the cabin about an hour after Flight QF30 left Hong Kong at 0900 local time ( 0100 GMT ) .
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said the aircraft made an emergency descent from 29,000 ft to 10,000 ft .
It said initial information indicated that a section of the fuselage had separated in the area of the forward cargo compartment .
The damage to the fuselage exposed part of the hold .

Passenger Olivia Lucas told the BBC everyone was " pretty scared for a few moments " .
" Then everyone focused on getting their oxygen masks on , " she said .
" Everyone was calm and quiet and there was notable relief when we landed .
Everyone applauded the pilot . "
" We are very lucky we landed safely and no - one was hurt . "
Phill Restall , from the UK , was woken " with a jolt " by the loud bang before the plane descended rapidly .
" No - one panicked , there was no screaming .
It was n't your typical television movie , " he told the BBC News website .
" Everyone listened to the cabin staff . "
He said other passengers had told him young children in the main cabin were crying .
Delayed shock Mr Restall , who was reassured to see the engines " still spinning " , said they wore the oxygen masks for about 15 minutes , until the plane levelled out .
WHY QF30 DESCENDED 20,000FT
Planes are pressurised as cruising altitudes are freezing and lack sufficient oxygen to breathe
Hole causes decompression , rapidly reducing air pressure and risking exposure Oxygen masks are deployed and pilot makes emergency descent to breathable altitude
The pilot then told passengers they were going to land in Manila to have a look at the damage .
" Everyone was fairly calm , partly because they did n't realise the extent of it , " he said .
" After we disembarked it started to dawn on people that this was a major incident .
There were 350 people up there who were very lucky .
" Seeing the hole caused a lot of emotion .
People were physically shaking .
Many realised how close they were to their own mortality . "
Other passengers reported seeing items flying out of the aircraft .
Dr David Newman , of Flight Medicine Systems , says forcing the plane into a rapid descent after a sudden loss of pressure is a standard emergency procedure .
He says that when cruising , the internal cabin is pressurised to a much lower altitude than outside the aircraft , which is also extremely cold .
" When you 've lost pressure , all that high pressure air in the cabin leaves the airplane and from a medical point of view you 've got the risk of lack of oxygen - which is compensated for by the oxygen masks , " he said .
" The descent is designed to limit how much time you spend up there and of course one of the other issues is that the mass flow of air leaving the airplane - if it's an explosive decompression - will take a lot of loose objects and articles around the cabin and basically try and leave the aircraft via the hole . "
The flight , which had been due to arrive in Melbourne at 1145 GMT , landed in Manila just after 0300 GMT ( 1100 local time ) .
Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon said engineers were investigating what might have caused the hole in the fuselage .
He said Qantas had provided all passengers with accommodation and a replacement aircraft had been arranged .
The airline boasts of never having lost a jet , but has seen some of its aircraft involved in minor accidents in recent years .

Ah , remember the good old days when Americans did n’t have to worry about so many wrong address home invasions by the cops who used to protect them or being tased when you have a broken back , border guards ( Canadian now , US soon ? ) were n’t doing the dirty work of private companies in confiscating MP3 players that might have downloaded music on them , we did n’t send prisoners to other countries to be tortured , the government was n’t eavesdropping on every phone conversation and email sent , we did n’t have Vice Presidents forging documents to help start a war , and so on and so on ?
Good times , good times …
Just think .
There are children being born and growing up who will never know the horror of having to live with all those nasty freedoms we oldsters once had .
They ’ll actually wonder why we considered Soviet life oppressive !
In return , Hungary ’s government , led by Ferenc Gyurcsany , has agreed to significant spending cuts , including wage freezes and the axeing of bonuses for civil servants next year , along with providing upfront capital to the country ’s beleaguered banking sector to ensure it can weather the storm .
BEIJING -- China 's central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than six years in a surprise move that underscored how concern over the strains in the U.S. financial system is reordering economic priorities world - wide .
Worries about the spillover from the U.S. appeared to lead Chinese authorities to shift decisively -- and more quickly than most anticipated -- toward supporting growth , after an inflation scare that has been their top preoccupation for more than a year .
The ...
The causes of the housing implosion are many : lax regulation , financial innovation gone awry , excessive debt , raw greed .
The players are also varied : bankers , borrowers , developers , politicians and bureaucrats .
Mr. Cisneros , 61 , had a foot in a number of those worlds .
Despite his qualms , he encouraged the unprepared to buy homes — part of a broad national trend with dire economic consequences .
He reflects often on his role in the debacle , he says , which has changed homeownership from something that secured a place in the middle class to something that is ejecting people from it .
“ I ’ve been waiting for someone to put all the blame at my doorstep , ” he says lightly , but with a bit of worry , too .
The Paydays During the Boom
After a sex scandal destroyed his promising political career and he left Washington , he eventually reinvented himself as a well - regarded advocate and builder of urban , working - class homes .
He has financed the construction of more than 7,000 houses .
For the three years he was a director at KB Home , Mr. Cisneros received at least $ 70,000 in pay and more than $ 100,000 worth of stock .
He also received $ 1.14 million in directors ’ fees and stock grants during the six years he was a director at Countrywide .
He made more than $ 5 million from Countrywide stock options , money he says he plowed into his company .
He says his development work provides an annual income of “ several hundred thousand ” dollars .
All told , his paydays are modest relative to the windfalls some executives netted in the boom .
Indeed , Mr. Cisneros says his mistake was not the greed that afflicted many of his counterparts in banking and housing ; it was unwavering belief .

It was , he argues , impossible to know in the beginning that the federal push to increase homeownership would end so badly .
Once the housing boom got going , he suggests , laws and regulations barely had a chance .
Suppose you are the publicity officer for a U.S. imperial legion in some God - forsaken hellhole , where your job is to tell the world what the forces have been doing there lately .
What they ’ve actually been doing , of course , is killing people , with little regard for who they are , and destroying a lot of property , with equal disregard for who owns it .
Just “ doing our job , ” as the soldiers say .
As a rule , you describe the persons your forces have slaughtered as “ militants , ” “ terrorists , ” or “ insurgents , ” or you give them some other designation that renders them guilty by definition .
No need to get into boring details , such as a man ’s name , age , occupation , and how many surviving members of his family remain to mourn his death and suffer for want of his support .
A militant is a militant is a militant ; la la la .
If these guys did n’t want to get killed , well , they just should n’t have been born in Afghanistan or Iraq or ( fill in the blank ) .
The trouble with the standard reporting procedure is that very often your forces ’ attacks leave behind the all - too - undeniable bodies and body parts of women , children , and old people .
Of course , you can call them bad names , too : women are sometimes terrorists , kids can carry bombs , blah , blah , blah .
But it ’s a tough tale to sell .
The sight of dead children , in particular , has a way of raising uncomfortable questions about what the hell you are doing in that God - forsaken hellhole and how you are going about doing it .
Recently , in one of the countless instances in which such questions had arisen , the U.S. military spokesman came up with a truly priceless turn of phrase .
The military had already followed the usual procedure — first deny everything , then admit something might have happened and promise to conduct an investigation , then report the findings of your phony - baloney investigation , which almost invariably exculpates all your troops , then , when faced with incontrovertible evidence of your crimes , minimize their extent and spin the whole story so that you continue to evade responsibility for the innocent persons you ’ve just slaughtered .
At this late stage in the sequence , the media flack , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman , explained that previous denials and minimizations were not actually wrong ; rather , as the U.S. forces were compelled to face the facts more fully , their story had to change , too .
As he put it , “ sometimes the truth can change . ”
Welcome to 1984 , Mr. Whitman .
You ’re going to be very happy there .
It has often been opined that “ military intelligence , ” “ military justice , ” and “ military music ” are oxymorons .
It is high time that we added to this list “ military truth . ”
UPDATE : Move along , nothing to see here .
Jay Leno , the host of “ The Tonight Show , ” recently installed a prototype wind turbine ( as well as solar panels ) atop a garage in Burbank , Calif. , where he works on his car collection .
He senses public interest in small - scale wind power that does not have much to do with dollars - and - cents analysis .
“ People seem fascinated by the turbines , ” Mr. Leno said .
“ You go , ‘ Look !
It ’s spinning ! ’ ”
Perched high above a building , wind turbines serve as a far more visible clean - energy credential than solar panels , which are often hard to see .
At least a dozen small manufacturers have sprouted up to supply the market , though rooftop turbines still account for only 1 percent or so of the 10,000 small wind turbines that are sold each year in the country , according to Ron Stimmel , an advocate of small wind systems at the American Wind Energy Association .

That number seems poised to grow , given the recent interest .
“ We ’re prebleeding - edge early , ” said Todd Pelman , founder of Blue Green Pacific , the maker of Mr. Beaudoin ’s turbine .
The technology , he conceded , is not yet “ something that would be bought at Home Depot . ”
Mr. Pelman has sunk $ 200,000 of his own money into the start - up , which has just three turbines in operation — Mr. Beaudoin ’s pair , and one above Mr. Pelman ’s own bedroom in a Victorian house in San Francisco .
In accordance with urban sensibilities , many of the new designs are stylish .
The six turbines peeping over the edge of a building in the Brooklyn Navy Yard , installed this summer , look as if they are covered with dainty white parasols , a design touch that doubles as a bird shield .
The French designer Philippe Starck has plans to introduce an elegant plastic turbine in Europe this fall .
Mr. Bloomberg ’s proposal calls for wind turbines on the city ’s skyscrapers and bridges , though it is unclear how big they will be and just where they will go .

Big Changes
It ’s been just over four years since our first post here on $ 30 / Week .
Over that time , this project has turned from a short - term experiment into a lasting part of our lives .
Though we ’ve had some ebbs and flows in our blogging consistency , and we ’ve been more careful about keeping to our budget in some weeks than in others , this site has definitely led us to some long - lasting and pretty fundamental changes in the way we shop , cook , and eat .
As a result , the experiment that we were chronicling on this blog has sort of just become a part of how we live our lives , which has made it a bit more laborious to keep writing about .
Here and there we ’ve been thinking about how we could start a new experiment and get ourselves more enthusiastic about the site … and $ 15 / week did n’t seem like the right direction to go .
As it happens , the $ 30 / Week household is going through some big changes right now .
After living in a series of New York City apartments for over 10 years ( and in Brooklyn for most of that ) , we just bought a house in Poughkeepsie , NY , where we ’ll be moving at the end of November .
Our new home is a 1910 stone house which is going to require a fair amount lot of renovation – mostly aesthetic but also some mechanical – and since we are both first - time homeowners with almost no direct experience in home repair beyond installing dimmer switches , this seemed like a thing that we ’d be really excited to write about .
And so we ’ve started a new site , Minnisingh , where we are going to write about the process of fixing this place up and making it our home , as well as our experience living somewhere other than New York City for the first time in over a decade .
Plus we ’ll probably end up writing about some other things like books and movies that always seemed out of scope for this blog .
For those who are really just interested in recipes and cooking , not to worry – we ’re definitely not going to stop writing about food !
One of the things we ’re most looking forward to as new homeowners is having a bit of land that we can devote to some more substantial gardening projects , plus a basement that we can use for a root cellar , and other semi-urban ( do n’t make me say “ suburban … not yet ) homesteading projects .
And of course , with the new financial responsibilities of home - ownership , frugality and a DIY ethic in food ( and everything else ) will remain one of our key priorities .
We ’ve been pretty amazed and really grateful at how many people have kept with us over the years – locally , across the country , and overseas .
We really hope that you ’ll follow along as we move on to this new phase .

We prepped quite a bit for Hurricane Sandy and probably spent $ 30 bucks just getting some stuff as we just do n’t know how long this storm will last and when our local supermarket will be open again .
So…a bunch of things were made .
It ’s also Phil ’s birthday today , so a great birthday dinner was in order .
If we could n’t go out , we would dine in !
Phil ’s birthday menu included : homemade bread , mock chicken liver pâté and deviled eggs for starters ; roasted carrot and avocado salad ( modified ) as the first course ; a vegetable tagine with couscous as the second course and a cherry cobbler for dessert ( thanks Mike for making this earlier ! ) .
Pictures to come !
Other things we made that we thought would keep in case the power went out included : black bean veggie burgers ( the rest of the black beans are cooked and hanging out in broth for a number of other uses ) , whole wheat pasta , tomato sauce , a number of hardboiled eggs , a frittata , chocolate chip cookies and the aforementioned birthday dinner stuff ( we still have leftovers ) .
It probably sounds crazy , but everything was actually easy to put together and just used up a lot of dried good we already had .
No Time Bread I know we ’ve referenced this recipe before , but I wanted to bring it up again because it is a great example of how you can make something that is better than store - bought ( sliced white bread , I am looking at you ) .
If you ’re scared of baking or put off by the amount of time it can take , try this one out .
It can be on the table in a little over an hour and it ’s easy , cheap and makes your house smell amazing because you will be making FRESH BREAD !
If you have bread flour , great !
If not , do n’t sweat it , this recipe works fine with all - purpose , although you may need a bit more of it .
Just follow the directions and you ’ll have warm bread to smother with butter or cheese or whatever else you like .
No - Time Bread from Apartment Therapy
Limelight $ 30 Bucks a Week was a feature on NY12 ’s Brooklyn cable news yesterday !
We were interviewed by the extremely nice Kena Vernon at our local supermarket and then took her back to our apartment to make some lentil and sweet potato soup .
The segment is brief , but we were excited that our message of shopping for fresh food and staying away from prepackaged stuff came through .
For the soup , we sauteed chopped onions and sweet potatoes in olive oil and added 1 cup of homemade broth concentrate , 2 cups of water , a cup of lentils and salt , pepper and fresh thyme .
We let the whole thing simmer until the lentils were cooked through and it was the perfect lunch to accompany today ’s rainy day .
Baked Donuts
Fall means baking !
I love summer ( salads , garden veggies , tomatoes , sunshine ) , but fall is my favorite season because I get to start baking again .
Turning on the stove in the summer is something I am loathe to do , so come fall , it is baking time !
Using my trusty donut pan , I used this very easy recipe — with modifications ( used olive oil and regular dairy ) .
You can really dress these up with just about anything .
Get creative !
Our toppings included : melted chocolate mixed with a bit of bourbon and topped with chopped dried figs
apple butter with homemade granola sprinkled on top
cinnamon & sugar
Easy Yogurt Cake
We had some yogurt that was nearing its expiration date in the fridge and I remembered the amazing Gâteau au yaourt from Chocolate & Zucchini .
An oldie , but a goodie , this cake is easy , delicious and extremely adaptable .
I used nonfat plain yogurt , used bourbon instead of rum and glazed the top with some apple cider and sprinkled toasted coconut flakes on the top of it for the last 10 minutes of baking .
You could throw some jam in between the layers , top with whipped cream , glaze with chocolate and sprinkle with hazelnuts …. the possibilities are endless for this moist and tangy base .
You could also eat it plain , with a cup of coffee , for breakfast .
Cake for breakfast may help dieters .
Seriously !
Baigan Bharta Lasagna
So , we decided to experiment a little with dinner tonight .
We had some lasagna noodles that we wanted to use , and were thinking we could figure out some sort of undiscovered lasagna dish that would revolutionize tiered pasta .
This did not happen .
We decided to go for a baigan bharta lasagna , cooking the eggplant first in veggie broth , some tomato paste , garlic , ginger , coriander , and cumin .
Once it was soft , we layered it with the pasta and shredded cheese we got at the produce market ( labeled simply “ Trinidad Cheese ” ) and baked it covered for 20 minutes and then uncovered for about 40 .
It came out looking pretty good .
Unfortunately , the eggplant released a lot of water , so beneath the crusty top it lacked the structural integrity you want in a lasagna .
Also , the Indian spices were n’t really bold enough to overcome the pasta , tomato , and cheese combination .
In the end it was tasty , but if you did n’t know what was in it , you would have just thought it was slightly - different , slightly - wet lasagna .
I still think the Indian lasagna idea has legs though – maybe with aloo matar gobi instead .
Apple Onion & Butternut Squash Tart
And now we are at the last of our apples .
Thanks apples , you had a good run .
We made Very Lazy Fall Apple Butter , an apple crumble , Butternut Squash & Apple Soup , Apple Onion Spicy Chutney and for the finale , this Apple Onion & Butternut Squash Tart .
Serve for breakfast , lunch or dinner or cut into thin slices for a great appetizer – I bet it would go fabulously with a dry prosecco .
This is a super versatile and delicious tart .
The onions , apple and squash cook down to form a great caramelized base that contrasts nicely with the buttery / herbed crust and the salty cheese .
Inspired by this Martha Stewart recipe , I decided to bust out our Rosemary Tart Dough used in the Tomato Tart recipe ( scroll down for the tart dough part ) .
Apple Onion & Butternut Squash Tart Ingredients : 5 onions , peeled and thinly sliced
4 apples , peeled and chopped
1/2 butternut squash , cut into 1/2 ″ cubes and roasted ( we had this leftover from the soup , you can add the cubes in when you add the apples to save you a step , I ’m sure it will be fine )
salt
olive oil
apple cider ( vegetable broth or water would do in a pinch )
1 Rosemary Tart Dough
1/4-1/2 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese To Do : Make your Rosemary
Tart dough and be sure to refrigerate it overnight or for at least a couple of hours .
Heat up the olive oil in a large pot and add the onions .
Cook until softened , about 10 - 15 minutes .
Add the apples ( and butternut squash if it ’s not roasted ) and 1/4 cup apple cider or water .
Let everything simmer with a lid on the pot until caramelized , about 30 minutes .
Give it a stir every now and then and add more cider or water so nothing gets burned .
Give it a taste .
Taste good ?
Great ?
Need more salt and / or pepper , season away !
Heat oven to 375 F .
Roll out your tart dough and press into a tart pan ( f you have leftover dough roll them into twists , sprinkle with parm and bake them – extra treat ! ) .
Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork a few times .
If you have some spicy chutney , spread it along the bottom and bake for about 10 minutes .
If you do n’t , sprinkle the bottom with a bit of grated Parmesan cheese or pecorino and bake for about 10 minutes .
Remove the tart dough from oven and pile on the onion / apple / squash mixture .
Spread evenly throughout the pan and top with some more cheese .
Your call on how much cheese – remember these are salty cheeses .
Bake for about 30 - 45 minutes or until the tart dough and cheese are a beautiful golden brown .
Apple Onion Spicy Chutney
I just googled “ what is the difference between a jam and a chutney ” because I was n’t sure whether to call this recipe a chutney or a jam .
Turns out , a chutney incorporates sweet , spicy and sour elements and is n’t as smooth as a jam .
So , this IS a recipe for chutney !
Another recipe created out of necessity to get rid of all of the apples from apple picking .
This might be the new hit after Tomato Jam .
It ’s spicy , sour and a bit sweet from the apples and caramelized onions .
Perfect with grilled cheese sandwiches , in a tart , slathered on eggs , brushed on tofu , plopped into soup …. you get the idea .
After taking a sauce class with Peter Berley , I ’ve really been into grinding my spices right before using them in a recipe .
I used our trusty mortar and pestle , but am a big fan of using an out - of - commissioned coffee grinder for large quantities .
Apple Onion Spicy Chutney
Adapted from this recipe .
Ingredients : 8 onions , chopped finely
4 - 5 apples , peeled and diced
4 cloves garlic , peeled and minced
2 cups white vinegar
1/2 cup cider vinegar ( you could probably use all cider , I just did n’t have enough )
2 cups sugar
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 bay leaves
2 teaspoons crushed peppercorns
1 teaspoon crushed cloves
1 teaspoon crushed allspice
1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper
1/2 tablespoon salt To Do : Heat up a bit of olive oil in a large pot and add the onions .
Let them cook until softened , about 10 - 15 minutes .
Add the rest of the ingredients , stir and bring to a boil .
Stir for about 5 minutes and then reduce heat to a simmer .
Cover pot and walk away .
Come back and give it a stir every 15 minutes or so .
You want everything to become a lovely brown color and cook down – it can take a while .
Taste it .
Do you like it ?
Add more spices if you want .
Once you can run a spoon through the mixture and a path forms without liquid filling it up , you ’ve got the right consistency .
Pour into jars and can – process in a hot water bath for 15 minutes .
You could also pour into jars and put them in the fridge .
They should last for a while because of all of the sugar and acid .

2/18/2017 Trumps Most Chilling Economic Lie ( Stiglitz )
The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization including a trade war .
History can not be put into reverse .
Technology has proceeded in a certain way based on the premise of global supply chains .
Disrupting the global supply chains would be costly and would increase the prices of goods that Americans buyespecially the mass - marketed goods that have kept prices so low for the goods purchased by ordinary Americans .
9/6/2015
The dry bulk shipping market will remain in recession due to contracting demand for iron ore and coal , and any recovery is not expected until 2017 , according to the Dry Bulk Forecaster report published by global shipping consultancy Drewry .
Falling demand and oversupply has severely impacted commodity values , with iron ore and coal prices in virtual free fall .
Less than 60 bulkers were contracted in the first seven months of 2015 , a drop of 91 % YoY , and down from more than 1,200 in full year 2013 .
Combined with the firm pace of deliveries , this has led to a 20 % decline in the bulkcarrier orderbook since the start of 2015 ..

3/16/12 BIMCO forecasts 20 million DWT of dry bulk to be recycled during 2012 2/12/2012 Barrons : Baltic Dry : Not Washed Up --
News that the Baltic Dry Index is sunk as an economic indicator is much exaggerated .
The index which measures the cost to haul dry freight over the world 's oceans has merely run aground after getting hit with a shipping - market tsunami .
Do n't worry .
It will right itself soon enough and should once again become a useful forecasting tool , as early as the end of the year .

12/9/2011 Capesize rates rose to 21 - month highs on Chinese iron ore demand that is estimated to grow 20 % by 2015 11/6/2011 Will They Never Learn ?
True , the container lines are taking delivery of big new ships and ordering even more of them , but they have to because of the ever - rising cost of bunker fuel .
The technology of the engines on new ships is changing so quickly that carriers are forced to buy new ships in order to have any hopes of operating profitably at any point on the future .
If they dont order new ships and hang on to their older ships , which burn fuel at a much higher rate , they wont be able to compete with carriers that deploy the newer , more efficient ships that are coming to market in the next few years .

Asian coal import demand is expected to be improved with the Asian winter season being a cold one .
Adding to this positive expectation some port congestion may be experienced in Australian and Indonesian ports as many forward fixtures for thermal coal have been recorded during the past weeks , and all these fixtures cant be accommodated without delays .
This congestion might well be the extra boost we all want and hope for the dry cargo market says Cotzias .

New building cancellations to top 40 % of current dry bulk orderbook says National Bank of Greece But , new building cancellations will reach about 40 % of the total orderbook sayd NBG , which means that 100 million dwt will never reach the water .
This , coupled with an estimated 70 million dwt of scrapping of older tonnage , could allow for a gradual recovery of dry bulk usage , close to the ten year average of 87 % of available hiring days .
Should this scenario materialize , dry bulk rates will drop below 2,000 points during 2010 and recover higher than 3,000 points during 2011 , which could be deemed as very satisfactory , should one consider the current imbalance in the market .

Election monitors call for extension of VA voting hours Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday November 4 , 2008
Print This Email This
An election monitoring group is asking officials in Virginia to address reports of massive voting machine failures and voters being turned away from polls , and it may go to court if no action is taken .
Election Protection , a nonprofit group aimed at cataloging and correcting problems at the polls , says it has received more than 27,000 calls from voters since 5 a.m. Tuesday .
Most problems have been reported in Pennsylvania , Virginia , New Jersey and Florida , representatives of the group said .
Voters experiencing problems can report them by dialing 866 - OUR - VOTE or 866 - MY - VOTE1 .
" We dont want to be chicken little here ,  said Jonah Goldman , who directs the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Campaign for Fair Elections .
" What were trying to do is report what were seeing out in the field .
Unfortunately this is what we expected .
During a press conference Tuesday morning , group representatives said they were asking election officials in Virginia to extend voting by two hours .
The group also wants election to ensure that paper ballots are available in precincts where electronic voting machines break down .
If elections officials fail to act , the group could file a lawsuit in federal court , but it hopes to avoid that option .
" We understand that litigation is a last and imperfect option , " Goldberg said .
" Our first priority is to try to solve these problems collectively . 
The NAACP sued unsuccessfully on Monday in an attempt to extend voting hours , and John McCain 's presidential campaign filed a lawsuit seeking an extension for military members to return their ballots .
Election Protection hopes voters are not discouraged by long lines or other problems throughout the day Tuesday .
Federal law allows voters who are in line at precincts before polls close to cast regular ballots .
If courts decide to extend voting hours , people who arrive at polling places after the polls would have closed have to cast provisional ballots .
Observers worry that voters in some areas are being given provisional ballots , instead of regular paper ballots .
This creates the potential for disenfranchisement and complicates the process because provisional ballots are not counted along with the rest of the election results .
Another group , Info Voter Technologies , also is fielding reports of problems at polls .
Its hotline has received more than 1,000 calls from Virginia since polls opened Tuesday .
Voters reported mechanical problems , long lines and some late - opening poll locations .
One report to the group said 400 people were reported standing in line in Petersburg , VA .
Virginia 's presidential elections have not been closely contested for a generation , and officials there seem unprepared to handle the massive influx of new voters .
Elections officials need the resources they need to properly prepare ahead of time for large elections .
" The infrastructure of our elections is nt really equipped to handle this kind of turnout ,  Goldman said .
" And that s unfortunately the story youll hear from us in 2010 and 2012 if we dont get serious about elections . 
DEVELOPING ...
It appears we were a little hasty in celebrating the demise of the Dutch blasphemy laws .
Danish journalist Flemming Rose has contacted MWW , relating the concerns of a Dutch colleague about this supposed repeal .
All is not as it seems .
The intention is to introduce the concept of “ indirect insult ” and expand an existing law which protects people on the basis of race , age , disability , and sexual orientation to include protection on the basis of religion or “ conviction ” .
This means that remarks directed at Islam , Christianity , Buddism or – depending on your interpretation of “ conviction ” – even homeopathy and astrology , could be interpreted as indirect insults to people , and prosecuted as such .
According to a commenter on the original story , this law carries a maximum sentence of 12 months , whereas the original defunct blasphemy law carried a maximum 3 month sentence .
Writes Rose :
This spring the Dutch minister of justice Hirsch Ballin wrote a note to parliament asking them to consider stiffening blasphemy laws .
In the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the arrest of Gregorius Nekschot parliament refused to go along , and this proposal is the compromise that the government came up with .
This whole scenario looks very similar to what we went through here in the UK with the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill – when we came very close to getting a universal blasphemy law imposed on us .
We won that battle by a narrow margin , thanks to an alliance of convenience between artists , secularists and Christians .
Will the Dutch see the danger and mobilise in time to prevent a free speech disaster ?

Now that John McCain has finally decided to show up for the debate in Oxford , Mississippi tonight , here are five things that you should keep your eye on while enjoying the debate .
Look out for the economy , the sound bite , and temperament among other things .
1 ) . The Economy – It is pretty simple .
McCain ’s strength is foreign policy and military affairs .
His huge weakness is on the economy .
McCain won his party ’s nomination because of the war in Iraq , but his recent slide in the polls is all about the economy .
For McCain to have a strong debate tonight , the emphasis must stay on foreign policy .
The more time spent on the economy , the worse McCain looks .
The bar is set low for Obama tonight .
He only needs to hold his own against McCain against foreign policy .
This will be Obama ’s best chance , so far , in the fall campaign to answer voters ’ concerns about his experience .
For Obama , the key is n’t his positions , but convincing people that he is up to the job .
If the line of the debate ends up being about the economy , then Obama is in great shape , but if the Democrat makes the big mistake the door will be open for McCain .

2 ) . Lincoln - Douglas
This Is n’t – Neither of these candidates are great debaters .
John McCain ’s troubles in front of a camera are well documented .
He makes George W. Bush look like Ronald Reagan .
In the 20 + debates against Hillary Clinton , Obama was mediocre at best .
He sometimes struggles to give short clear answers .
This debate will not be pretty or be remembered as a stylistic work of art .
It has the potential to be a bit personal and ugly .
If Obama matches McCain ’s expected aggressiveness , this thing will deteriorate quickly .
3 ) . Warm vs. Cool – McCain thrives on conflict , and can get angry fast .
Obama was given to flashes of anger during the primary debates , but no outbursts .
In 2000 , George W. Bush was able to use McCain ’s temper against him to his advantage .
If Obama gets under McCain ’s very thin skin , then the Republican could play into the notion that he is the angry old man .
McCain ’s temper is ugly , and needs to be kept in control .
In contrast , Obama has shown ability to remain on even keel during the debates .
Obama was able to handle whatever Hillary Clinton threw at him , and she is a thousand times more the debater than John McCain could ever hope to be .
Obama has been tested in a way that McCain has n’t .
If McCain blows up , and Obama looks presidential , McCain will have a big problem .
On the flip side if McCain looks the aggressor , and Obama seems too cool and passive , this will help the Republican .
4 ) . Looking Presidential –
This may seem superficial , but many voters make up their minds based not on what the candidates say , but who looks more presidential .
The perception battle could be the most important unspoken element of this debate .
Obama has seen his margin expand in the polls , because he has looked more presidential than McCain in handling the economic crisis .
Tonight is McCain ’s chance to get some of that momentum back .
If McCain looks like he is floundering in any way during tonight ’s debate , Obama could find himself in a position to run away with this race .
McCain could dominate the foreign policy debate , and still hurt himself if he drops the ball on the economic questions .
McCain has been unable to look presidential on both foreign and domestic policy during this campaign .
If Obama needs to reassure people that he can handle the foreign policy part of the job , McCain needs to do the same on the domestic front .
5 ) . The Sound Bite –
The debates are won and lost on sound bites .
Who can forget Al Gore ’s sighs in 2000 , and the way that they played into the Bush campaign ’s portrayal of Gore as a know it all ?
A sound bite from a debate can crystallize an opponent ’s campaign theme , and make the difference in a close presidential election .
Presidential debates have devolved from gatherings that look to inform voters into zinger fests where each campaign tries to land the sound bite that sticks , and dominates the media coverage for the 24 hours after the debate .
Obama and McCain have already waged a deeply personal and heated campaign against each other .
If this debate becomes about personal zingers , then McCain and his non-issues oriented campaign has the advantage , but if McCain is forced to talk about the issues , Obama has an advantage .
I am looking for Obama to try to frame McCain ’s worldview as outdated and wrong .
This is a subtle way for Obama to make the old age does not equal change argument .
Obama will try to make McCain defend his support of Bush .
If the Democrat is successful , he could put McCain on the defensive and have himself a very good night , but barring a major gaffe , I doubt that this debate will settle anything .
As the smoke cleared after Monday ’s stunning House of Representatives vote against a $ 700 billion financial bailout for Wall Street , the politicians immediately got down to the business of blaming each other — and scheming about the next attempt to push through this rescue of the super - rich .
But for working people trying to figure out what the hell has happened to the U.S. financial system — and why the leaders of the U.S. government , apparently regardless of political party , are prepared to spend more than $ 2,000 for every man , woman and child in this country to save Wall Street — the reaction was different .
For one thing , there was sweet satisfaction to be taken in the fact that the bankers and stockbrokers did n’t get their way for once , especially since they ’re out to steal $ 700 billion in taxpayers ’ money to cover their bad investments , under a program devised by former Wall Street CEO and now Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson .
With the business world ratcheting up political pressure and Paulson predicting certain doom if no action was taken , the Bush administration and the leadership of both parties in both the House and Senate were all sure that the bailout bill would go through .
Yet the legislation was derailed because members of Congress are feeling the heat from a growing popular outrage over the staggering scale of a giveaway to the very same people who led the economy to the edge of the abyss .
It was an all - too - rare turn of events for the U.S. political system , the opinions of ordinary Americans actually mattered in what happened .
At the same time , though , there ’s a sense of foreboding .
If the government ca n’t agree on a bailout , will Wall Street really crash and burn and cause an economic catastrophe on Main Street , too ?
After all , that ’s the claim of “ King Henry ” Paulson and his nominal boss , George W. Bush .
They ’re basically extortionists , insisting that if Congress does n’t agree to a king ’s ransom for the banks , the economy gets it – - in the form of a worldwide financial meltdown that would wipe out workers ’ savings and eliminate millions of jobs overnight .
The stock market plunge that followed the House vote Monday will have reinforced such fears .
Few workers have the resources to play the stock market , of course , but their lives are affected by its ups and downs , especially the downs : for example , the loss of retirement savings in 401 ( k ) accounts that many workers rely on , now that defined benefit pension plans are going the way of the dinosaur .
So is it true ?
Are we all , the multi-millionaire bankers on Wall Street and the tens of millions of workers on every other street , in the same boat after all ?
Do we really need the Paulson bailout to avert a second Great Depression ?
The answer is no .
The argument that a bailout of the banks is good of all us is an ideological smokescreen , to cover the specifics of the Paulson proposal , as sanctioned by the Democrats — which benefits the rich and powerful , at the expense of the rest of us .
There are plenty of ways that government intervention could alleviate the financial crisis and provide urgently needed relief to working people .
But that would involve programs , policies and priorities that the bankers despise and that political leaders in Washington want nothing to do with .
Paulson is right to say that Wall Street is facing its most severe crisis since the Great Depression — a catastrophe entirely of its own making — and that the U.S. government has to respond .
But the form that response takes — a huge handout for the super - rich or a progressive plan to rein in the banks and help ordinary people — depends on whether workers organize to make their voices heard and felt in Washington .
Democrats like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Barney Frank say they drove a hard bargain and forced concessions from the Bush administration on the Wall Street rescue .
But the provisions they point to , a toothless section that urges banks , “ where appropriate , ” to negotiate with homeowners faced with foreclosure , as well as easily avoided restrictions on executive pay at rescued companies , are window - dressing at best .
The heart of the plan proposed by Paulson remains in place — a naked power grab of the bankers , by the bankers and for the bankers .
This is the scheme that allows Paulson and future treasury secretaries to buy the worthless securities and “ troubled assets ” of banks and other financial institutions , and not at their current value , if they ’re worth anything at all , but at or near the original inflated price the banks paid for them .
In other words , Paulson wants unrestricted power to cover the losses of the world ’s most reckless gamblers .
All the scare tactics in the world ca n’t disguise that .
Normally , under the U.S. political system , lawmakers are insulated from any accountability to the people who vote for them .
That enables them to pursue an agenda against the interests of the majority .
But they do have to face voters from time to time and , unfortunately for the 435 members of the House , the bailout package came up for a vote just five weeks before Election Day .
As a result , no one in Congress wants to be too closely associated with Paulson ’s plan , no matter how badly their patrons on Wall Street want it .
Thus , leading Democrats , while going along with Paulson , claimed they did so to “ save ” the economy , while blaming Bush and the Republicans for creating this catastrophe .
As for the House Republicans , whose defection led to the legislation ’s defeat on Monday , there ’s plenty of hot air about standing up for the interests of ordinary people .
Yet the telling fact was that among those facing a close reelection battle in November , virtually all voted against the bailout .
The Paulson plan will be back before both houses of Congress before the week is out , perhaps with some token changes to pick up a few more votes .
But the essence will be unchanged :
It is a proposal for the greatest transfer of wealth from workers to the rich in U.S. history .
What ’s really required is an entirely different kind of government intervention in the economy .
For starters , the banking system should be nationalized .
This could provide immediate relief for the international credit squeeze , in which banks are choking off economic growth by refusing to lend to one another .
The next order of business : ban the Wall Street casino for high - stakes gambling on incomprehensible investments like “ collateralized debt obligations ” and “ credit default swaps . ”
The banks ’ ability to damage our livelihoods with their speculation should be ended immediately .
Nationalized banks are nothing new .
For much of the second half of the 20th century , they were the norm in Western Europe , and they remained capitalist institutions to boot .
But a nationalized banking system would at least provide more public accountability over the operations of these institutions and subject them to greater political pressure .
What ’s more , it ’s hard to describe the federal government ’s recent adventures in the banking industry as something other than nationalization .
In the past week , the FDIC seized control of Washington Mutual ( the largest savings and loan in the country ) and sold it to Bank of America at a bargain - basement price , and then put Wachovia ( the fourth - largest bank ) out of its misery with a forced sale to Citigroup .
But to sweeten the latter deal , the FDIC had to agree to cover any losses in excess of $ 42 billion out of the $ 312 billion of bad debt on Wachovia ’s books .
Yet Citigroup gets to keep the profits from having a bigger share of the market .
Why should n’t taxpayers get the gains from this merger , instead of just the losses ?
After three decades of free - market dogma pushed by both Republicans and Democrats , nationalization of the banks might seem unthinkably radical for the U.S.
But it was the Wall Street conservative Republican Paulson who presided over the nationalization of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac , and the insurance giant AIG .
Paulson ’s $ 700 billion bailout plan is also a form of nationalization , but one that socializes the banks ’ losses at taxpayers ’ expense , while leaving the profits in private hands .
Why not take control of the banks outright , and send their corrupt and incompetent executives packing ?
An economic bailout on pro-worker terms would include much more than nationalizing the banks .
There would be a moratorium on home foreclosures , mandatory renegotiations of adjustable - rate mortgages , and incentives to convert empty , newly constructed condominiums into affordable rental housing .
Also badly needed is a plan to create jobs , starting with a public works infrastructure program that could rebuild schools and housing in run -down inner cities .
The expansion of public transportation and government investment in alternative energy would also be priorities .
Such a program is a long way from what ’s being discussed in Washington .
For their part , Democrats from Barack Obama on down are content to attack the Republicans as the source of the economic catastrophe .
That may be enough to get them elected , but the policies they promote do n’t even begin to address the scale of the problem .
This economic crisis is still in its early stages , but it ’s already clear that the old ideology of the free market is out .
However , nothing has appeared to replace it , and so the mainstream political and economic discussions are a muddle of old ideas and half - baked schemes .
We need to start the debate on the real alternatives now — to raise the ideas , the strategies and the organization that working people need to resist the attempt to make them pay for the crisis .
With the entry to sub-orbital flight , and even orbital flight , becoming ever so slightly easier , the obvious thought of space porn kicks in .
Who would n't want to see two or more people going at it like rabbits in a weightless environment ( or at least trying to go at it like rabbits in a weightless environment ) ?
Sadly , Virgin Galactic has turned down a $ 1 million offer to do just that .
The offer was made by an unidentified party who was willing to put the money up front to do a space porn movie .
Considering that a flight aboard VG costs $ 200,000 for a two - hour flight , $ 1 million does n't seem too bad .
Though how much you could actually do and perform in two hours is debatable .
And what if one or more of the actors gets sick ?
Caravan park owner who built up £ 1.2 m fortune could be left with nothing after bank collapse
A couple who ran a caravan park may have lost their £ 1.2 million life savings after they sold the business and deposited the profits in a failed Icelandic bank .
Darren and Ruth Johnston cashed in the 17 - acre site , a family business for three generations , after a drop in takings last winter made them fear a recession .
They hoped to ride out the storm with their money in a high - interest account and buy a smaller caravan business during brighter economic times .
But just six months after selling Winkups Caravan Park in Abergele , North Wales – and celebrating by buying his wife a Porsche Boxster – Mr Johnston was yesterday formally told he can no longer access his savings .
Boom to bust : Darren Johnson and his wife Ruth Johnson have lost their caravan park empire
He and Mrs Johnston , a former hairdresser , also face a £ 120,000 capital gains tax bill on their vanished profits .
It will be a familiar story to thousands who have lost savings deposited in Icelandic banks through offshore subsidiaries .
The Johnstons chose an offshore bond offered by Royal Skandia after a financial adviser recommended the six per cent interest rate .
But the bond was deposited with an Isle of Man subsidiary of Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer and Friedlander ( KSF ) , which went bust this month .
While UK depositors have had their money guaranteed by the Government , offshore KSF accounts are not covered .
Nor is the money protected by an Isle of Man guarantee for personal depositors , as the Royal Skandia bond is regarded as a corporate one .
In letters sent to the couple and hundreds of other savers yesterday , Royal Skandia said : ‘ At this time you are not able to switch money from these deposits to other assets .
We recognise that these developments will cause you considerable distress . ’
The couple now face losing their four - bedroom £ 500,000 home in Denbigh , North Wales .
They fear they will have to pull sons Harry , 13 , and George , ten , out of private schools .
So far the couple , who have been married for 15 years , have hidden the full scale of the ‘ nightmare ’ from the boys .
Mrs Johnston , 47 , said : ‘ I just want to protect them as long as I can .
But I do n’t think we will be able to hang on to my car for much longer .
‘ Every morning I wake up feeling sick , just gut - wrenching .
Neither of us can sleep , it is just too horrendous to contemplate .
We are going to have to start all over again despite everything we have worked for . ’
Mr Johnston , 44 , said : ‘ I have never had any savings in my life , just a Nationwide account which I opened a week into my first job at the age of 22 .
‘ This was the first time I had money to save and I trusted what I was told .
‘ I feel like a fool now but that does not mean that those like me deserve this .
I am being treated like a fat cat who can afford to lose a million here and there .
‘ Gordon Brown seems to not care about us , to have just decided that the Isle of Man is a leper and that it should go down along with all who have put money there .
‘ Our family ’s caravan park was good and simple , bingo and beer .
Good people went there , not wealthy people , but it was an honest business in which we worked hard .
‘ Gordon Brown is doing nothing .
There are hundreds if not thousands like us who put savings away .
We were n’t even playing the stock markets . ’
Royal Skandia said it was in talks with the local authorities and the British Government about compensation schemes .
A spokesman said : ‘ We are doing everything we can for our clients .
We do not provide financial advice , merely offer products .
Mr and Mrs Johnston will have received advice from an independent financial adviser . ’
" Sometimes the leak is so bad that even a plumber can't fix it . "
This was the concise summation of a cable political strategist the other day , after the third and final presidential debate .
That sounds about right , and yet the race in its final days retains a feeling of dynamism .
I think it is going to burst open or tighten , not just mosey along .
I can well imagine hearing , the day after Election Day , a lot of " You wo n't believe it but I was literally in line at the polling station when I decided . "
John McCain won the debate , and he did it by making the case more effectively than he has in the past that Barack Obama will raise taxes , when " now , of all times in America , we need to cut people 's taxes . "
He also scored Mr. Obama on his eloquence , using it against him more effectively than Hillary Clinton ever did .
When she said he was " just words , " it sounded like a bitter complaint .
Mr. McCain made it a charge : Young man , you attempt to obscure truth with the mellifluous power of your words .
From Mrs. Clinton it sounded jealous , but when Mr. McCain said it , you looked at Mr. Obama and wondered if you 'd just heard something that was true .
For the first time , Mr. Obama 's unruffled demeanor did n't really work for him .
His cool made him seem hidden .
There is now something infantilizing about this election .
Mr. Obama continued to claim he will remove wasteful spending by sitting down with the federal budget and going through it " line by line . "
This is absurd , and he must know it .
Mr. McCain continued to vow he will " balance the budget " in the next four years .
Who believes that ?
Does even he ?
More than ever on the campaign trail , the candidates are dropping their G's.
Hardworkin ' families are strainin ' and tryin 'a get ahead .
It 's not only Sarah Palin but Mr. McCain , too , occasionally Mr. Obama , and , of course , George W. Bush when he darts out like the bird in a cuckoo clock to tell us we are in crisis .
All of the candidates say " mom and dad " : " our moms and dads who are struggling . "
This is Mr. Bush 's former communications adviser Karen Hughes 's contribution to our democratic life , that you cannot speak like an adult in politics now , that 's too austere and detached , snobby .
No one can say mothers and fathers , it 's all now the faux down - home , patronizing — and infantilizing — moms and dads .
Do politicians ever remember that in a nation obsessed with politics , our children — sorry , our kids — look to political figures for a model as to how adults sound ?
There has never been a second 's debate among liberals , to use an old - fashioned word that may yet return to vogue , over Mrs. Palin :
She was a dope and unqualified from the start .
Conservatives and Republicans , on the other hand , continue to battle it out :
Was her choice a success or a disaster ?
And if one holds negative views , should one say so ?
For conservatives in general , but certainly for writers , the answer is a variation on Edmund Burke :
You owe your readers not your industry only but your judgment , and you betray instead of serve them if you sacrifice it to what may or may not be their opinion .
I ’m a big fan of Wordle .
Everybody likes pretty tag clouds , but until recently , I ’ve had no practical use for the tool .
What with the forthcoming election and all , and being in marketing , I thought it might be interesting to use Wordle to distill each of the four national parties ’ websites into a tag cloud .
The cloud would reflect the terms that the party uses most frequently on their English - language websites .
With an assist from Ask Metafilter , I got them done .
I ’ll explain a little more about how after the clouds .
As usual , click for larger versions :
What Conclusions Can We Draw ?
That ’s more a question for you than me , as I have n’t spent much time trying to grok what these clouds tell us ( yes , I used ‘ grok ’ ) .
What jumps out at you ?
How Did We Make
Them ?
First , I grabbed a complete copy of each party ’s website .
I just stuck with HTML files , so if a party hosts a lot of PDFs with unique content , then that ’s not reflected .
The sites , of course , ended up being different sizes , and I ’m relying on my site - copying software , so I ca n’t be certain I got all the pages .
Then we concatenated each set of HTML files into one gigantic file .
Using some scripty - magic , we generated the top 100 or 250 words , each appearing as many times as they appear in the original site .
I went through each of these to clean out most or all of the leftover HTML code , navigational terms like ’ email ’ or ‘ newsletter ’ and French words .
The French is why we used 250 words in some cases .
For some sites , I downloaded both the French and English version of the site , so I needed to remove the French .
By working with a 250 word file , I was able to clean out the French and still have a sizable database of words .
In short , it ’s somewhat unscientific , but I ’m optimistic that the clouds represent a reasonably fair reflection of each site ’s top content .
If anyone wants to work with the content I copied , I ’m happy to share it .
I ’m not going to publish the complete sites here , though , as I expect that would constitute a copyright violation .
Who Done What ?
a.k.a.
User Stamping
Something I do in every app I create is add creator_id and updater_id to nearly every model .
As created_at and updated_at are known as timestamping , I refer to my creator and updater attributes as “ user stamping . ”
The annoying part is in every controller I had to assign those attributes to the currently logged in user .
This is n’t a big deal but I ’m lazy so I started to look for solutions .
Thread.current
The first thing that popped into my head was Thread.current .
Thread .current is basically a hash that allows you to assign thread - safe key value pairs for the current thread .
My thought , based on some research , was to wrap Thread.current [ : myapp_user_id ] with User.current so I could just use User.current in any active record model .
Only problem is that smelled a little bit and I figured would be frowned upon by the community as you really should n’t access request stuff in your models like that .
You can read more about threads and Thread. current if you want .
Solution : Sweeper
I brainstormed a bit with Brandon Keepers and he suggested a few things .
Eventually , we decided on a sweeper as they have access to controllers which would have access to the current user .
Tada !
User Stamp , the plugin , was born .
I whipped it together last night (< 50 LOC ) , added a few specs , and put it up on github this morning .
Installation
Installation is uber predictable .
script / plugin install git://github.com/jnunemaker/user_stamp.git
Once plugin is installed and user_stamp call with list of models to track in application.rb .
class ApplicationController < ActionController :: Base user_stamp Post , Asset , Job end
If you actually want to access this stuff through associations and show it in your app you could do something like this :
class Post < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to : creator , : class_name => ' User ' belongs_to :updater , :class_name => ' User ' end
Then , say in a view , you could do the following :
< h1 >< %=h @post.name %></h1 > < div ><%= @post.content %></div> < p >Posted by < %=h @post.creator.name %></p>
Let me know what you think in the comments .

The 17 have been in Guantanamo Bay for nearly seven years The White House has reacted angrily after a judge ordered that 17 Chinese Muslims held at Guantanamo Bay should be released into the United States .
District Judge Ricardo Urbina said the US could not hold the 17 as they were no longer considered enemy combatants .
The Uighurs were cleared for release in 2004 but the US says they may face persecution if returned to China .
The White House said the ruling could set a precedent that would allow " sworn enemies " to seek US entry .
The government says the 17 also pose a security risk if released into the US .
Lawyers for the Bush administration have argued that federal judges do not have authority to order the release into the US of Guantanamo detainees .
Analysts say the ruling is a rebuke for the US government and could set the stage for the release of dozens more detained at the military jail in Cuba .
' No risk ' Lawyers for the prisoners said it was the first time a federal court had ordered the release into the US of any Guantanamo prisoners .
Judge Urbina had presided over a hearing to consider appeals by the 17 who were seeking to be freed and allowed into the US .
They have been held at Guantanamo for nearly seven years .
The judge said there was no evidence that they were " enemy combatants " or a security risk .
CHINA'S UIGHURS Ethnically Turkic Muslims , mainly in Xinjiang Made bid for independent state in 1940s Sporadic violence in Xinjiang since 1991 Uighurs worried about Chinese immigration and erosion of traditional culture " Because the constitution prohibits indefinite detentions without cause , the continued detention is unlawful , " he said .
He ordered that they be brought to his courtroom for a hearing on Friday and he scheduled another hearing for the following week to decide where the Uighurs should be permanently settled .
Members of the Uighur community in the Washington DC area have offered to take them in .
The Washington DC courtroom was packed with dozens of Uighurs and human rights activists who cheered and applauded at the decision .
Justice department attorney John C O'Quinn 's request to delay the detainees ' release pending a possible appeal was denied by the judge .
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said the ruling " could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay , including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 , who may also seek release into our country " .
Beijing demand
Some detainees at the military prison fear torture or persecution if they return to their home countries , according to the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights .
The Bush administration has maintained that if they cannot be returned home and no other country will take them , they should stay at Guantanamo .
The 17 Uighurs had been living in a camp in Afghanistan during the US - led military campaign that began in October 2001 .
They fled into the mountains and were held by Pakistani authorities who handed them over to the US .
Beijing has demanded that all Uighurs held at Guantanamo be repatriated to China .
Many Muslim Uighurs from Xinjiang in western China want greater autonomy for the region and some want independence .
Beijing has waged a campaign against what it calls their violent separatist activities .

What are these ?
Sports is something that folks of all ages can partake in .
There are the youth leagues .
There are adult recreation leagues .
These types of recreation leagues have been around for many of years .
It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be able to make these types of recreational outlets to be able to function .
Whether you ’re looking for an Austin moving company to haul the equipment around or just a place to store it , there are plenty of options .
There are volunteers , the coaches , the umpires , and all of the equipment that is needed .
Anyone and everybody can tell you that has been associated with these ventures that it takes a host of people to make them function .
When it comes to planning and utilizing the smooth running of these sort of leagues , the storing of the equipment in the off season is something that can not be taken lightly .
Some people and leagues are fortunate to have storage spaces already at their playing fields and facilities .
Still , there are times where there can be an overflow of equipment or a league simply does not have the avenue or resources to store their equipment in the offseason .
In Austin though there is a solution and option .
Austin storage units are everywhere throughout the city .
This means that they will be able to cater to any person or any league in the area who is looking to store their sports equipment in the offseason .
You simply cannot ask for anything better than that .
For instance , take a football recreational league .
These leagues issue their own pads and helmets .
They also have items such as field markers and pilons .
If a league is very large and has a lot of participants , they easily can come into a situation where they simply do not have enough room to store their equipment in the offseason .
Knowing that there is a resource or option to store equipment is by far a very good thing .
Again , there are people , associations , and leagues out there that are fortunate enough to have enough space to be able to store their equipment in the offseason .
There are those times though where there is an overabundance of equipment and extra space is needed for storage .
This is the time in Austin to consult with other Austin storage units .
They will be able to afford the needed space and will only make the offseason for the particular league to be able to run that much smoother .
Recreational sports leagues are very underrated .
The thing is that these leagues , especially youth leagues , are the feeder programs for athletes who are looking to strive for bigger and better things .
When the offseason comes , the equipment that is used in the league needs to be placed in storage to where it can be kept safe and sound for the following campaign .
Making sure to have ample and secure storage is essential .
This is part of the reason that a new season is able to take off and excel like it does .
Rev Peter Mullen is chaplain to the London Stock Exchange ( I do n't know why a stock exchange needs a chaplain but I imagine there 's lots of praying going on there right about now ) .
He also has a blog ( Google cache here ) , where he posts solutions to " problems " that would make the one - eye veil Saudi cleric proud :
It is time that religious believers began to recommend specific utilitarian discouragements of homosexual practices after the style of warnings on cigarette packets :
Let us make it obligatory for homosexuals to have their backsides tattooed with the slogan SODOMY CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH and their chins with FELLATIO KILLS .
Rev Mullen now says the post is a " light - hearted joke . "
Gay men should be forced to have ' health warning ' tattoos , says Stock Exchange chaplain
Jelly Bean , a mother cat at the Humane Society of Harrisburg Area , may think her third " kitten " looks and smells a little strange , but she is letting him nurse and cuddle just the same .
Baby Bear , a chocolate Labrador retriever , came to the Humane Society as a 3 - day - old puppy abandoned by his mother .
Shelter workers fed him from a bottle and used a heating pad to keep him warm .
Then Jelly Bean stepped in and allowed Baby Bear to nurse with her two kittens , Jelly Roll and Jelly Belly .
Nearly the same size as Baby Bear , the two kittens treat him as their brother , Humane Society spokeswoman Kelly Hitz said in a written release .
Baby Bear will be eligible for adoption when he is about 8 weeks old .

First edition , first and only printing .
15 x 12 x 1 1/4 inches. 18 original black and white gelatin silver prints printed by John Gossage , mounted on 14 x 11 inch archival board ( 18 total boards ) , with hand - written curses in pencil by the artist , and presented in a custom - made box of natural wood and Plexiglas ( with a back - panel that slides open ) .
Essay by Gus Blaisdell in a separate 12 - page booklet insert ( 10 1/2 x 7 inches ) .
Also includes a 1 - page interview with John Gossage by Peter Lloyd from 1991 , in an separate envelope .
This first edition was limited to 100 copies hand - numbered and signed by Gossage .
Out of print .
Scarce .
From the interview with the artist by Peter Lloyd : " It was n't until 1999 when Mr. Gossage had lost interest in following up on the work seen here that I finally got him to tell me about ' all this shit . '
After the usual arguments about whether I would ' really be interested ' and the complaints that it should ' all be obvious , ' he started to talk about the making of the project he had entitled ' The Plains of Hell . '
The Plains of Hell is apparently a Cajun fiddle tune that Gossage has never heard but had always liked the title of .
The pictures were made in New York State : Staten Island and the area around Syracuse .
The exact places for the images were chosen by consulting the 103c list of hazardous waste sites that the EPA issued .
That list details specific locations of massive pollution that have not yet made it to the more public Superfund list .
Gossage said that at first he would use a map and drive to the precise locations detailed on the list , but as he did more shooting , he found he could tell when a site was coming up by what you might call ' visual smell . ' "
The amount of risk you take is one of the few aspects of investing that you can control .
Risk does n’t have to control you ; the goal is to control risk .
When approaching an investment decision , be realistic about what the market can give you in exchange for the risk you take .
When you are educated on how to build your financial health and security , the fear of uncertainty will not govern you , and the turbulent economy will not fluster you .
This puppy may be able to take on this kitty now , but in two years , this cat will dominate !
Wow .
Tim and I are quite the fans of video game cakes .
Really , any video game character showing themselves in the form of food appeals to us .
And this absolutely breathtaking Mario Kart themed cake , is truly a sight to behold .
I ’d marry the hell out of anyone who promised this to me .
The attention to the tiniest detail is really unparalleled .
We ’ve got a bunch more photos after the jump .

Urge Congress to Vote Contempt for Karl Rove : Live Blog
by Don Siegelman
It ’s great to be here blogging with you on DailyKos !
I thoroughly enjoyed the discussion I had at FireDogLake a few weeks back , and I ’m really looking forward to our dialogue today .
I ’m writing today to urgently enlist your help in my effort to hold Karl Rove accountable for politicizing the Department of Justice — including the malicious , politically - motivated prosecution that targeted me and sent me to prison — because our time may well be running out .
If Congress adjourns at the end of September without holding Karl Rove in contempt , our chances at restoring democracy may very well be kaput .
We must pull out all the stops and turn up the heat .
More on the flip .
Don Siegelman ’s diary :: ::
Now that a U.S. District Judge has ruled that White House aides like Rove can’t claim immunity in order to refuse testifying before Congress , there ’s no room for Karl Rove to hide any longer .
It is time for Rove to come clean and tell the truth about what he has done , before the House Judiciary Committee , for all America to see .
That ’s why I ’m asking you to email your Member of Congress , right now , and urge the full House to vote to hold Karl Rove in contempt !
If you speak out , and Congress votes contempt for Rove , he ’ll have to speak out too — and for the first time , under oath !
There is sworn testimony by a Republican lawyer that Karl Rove targeted me when I was Governor of Alabama through a malicious , unfounded , politically - motivated prosecution by the wife of Rove ’s best friend in Alabama .
I was shackled , handcuffed , taken to a maximum security prison , and put into solitary confinement .
I served 9 months in federal prison before the appeals court released me .
We cannot let Karl Rove refuse to testify before Congress about his role in this nefarious scheme !
Karl Rove has thumbed his nose in the face of Congress , refusing to answer questions about his abuse of power in launching politically motivated prosecutions and politicizing the Department of Justice .
Now a federal judge has stripped Rove of his immunity claim .
We do n’t have any time to lose .
With only two more weeks left before Congress adjourns for the year , we need the House to act — and act swiftly — to force Karl Rove to show up and testify .
If Rove really has nothing to hide , then he should prove it to Congress and the country .
He should n’t be ducking the Congressional subpoena .
So please join me in speaking out : Forward an email to your Member of Congress right now , before the House adjourns at the end of September — and demand that they vote to hold Karl Rove in contempt !
Thank you so much for your help .
I look forward to responding to some of your questions and comments in the thread below .
— Don Siegelman
Governor of Alabama
1999 -2003

UPDATE ( 2:50 pm ET ) :
Thanks so much for blogging with me today !
I ’ve got to run off to some more meetings on Capitol Hill today , where I ’m sitting down with Members of Congress to express our concern and commitment to urge the full House to hold Karl Rove in contempt and force him to show up and testify .
In the next day or two , I ’ll be releasing the names and phone numbers of some specific Members of Congress whose votes will be critical if we are to succeed in holding Karl Rove in contempt .
These are good men and women who need to hear from their constituents on this important issue .
Thanks so much for all that you ’re doing .
We do n’t have any time to lose — so if you have n’t already , please go to http://www.ContemptForRove.com and email your Member of Congress now !

Improvements in ethanol
America ’s Ethanol Producers Cut Energy Consumption
Efficiency Gains Add to Ethanol ’s Green Footprint
To : Reporters and editors
Date : September 30 , 2008
More efficiently using our natural resources is at the core of this nation ’s efforts to secure a more sustainable energy future .
America ’s ethanol producers are at the forefront of that effort , developing the technologies and processes that are constantly improving the already green footprint of this domestic renewable energy industry .
A recent report by John Christianson , CPA of the independent accounting firm Christianson & Associates , PLLP , catalogues the energy improvements being made at ethanol biorefineries across country .
According to the report , the average amount of energy as measured by British Thermal Units ( BTUs ) required to produce ethanol and a livestock feed co-product across all ethanol production technologies was reduced by 13.5 percent between 2004 and 2007 .
View Christianson ’s report
BTUs requirements per gallon of ethanol production :
2004 2007 31,588 BTUs per gallon 27,298 BTUs per gallon ( Note : A gallon of ethanol contains approximately 77,000 BTUs )
The most efficient biorefineries demonstrated an even more dramatic reduction 19 percent reduction in BTU energy requirements , today using fewer than 21,000 BTUs per gallon of ethanol produced .
Likewise , electricity usage at ethanol biorefineries was also cut .
The Christianson report shows a 13 % reduction in electricity consumption at the average ethanol facility .
The electricity requirements of ethanol facilities per gallon of ethanol produced :
2004 2007 .781 Kwh per gallon .680 Kwh per gallon
The results of the Christianson report are consistent with the results of the Department of Energy ’s recent Argonne National Laboratory analysis of the improving efficiency of the American ethanol industry between 2001 and 2006 .
According to Argonne :
Water consumption — down 26.6 %
Grid electricity use — down 15.7 %
Total energy use — down 21.8 %

Arctic sea ice extent during the 2008 melt season dropped to the second - lowest level since satellite measurements began in 1979 , reaching the lowest point in its annual cycle of melt and growth on Sept. 14 , according to researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder 's National Snow and Ice Data Center .
Preliminary data also indicate 2008 may represent the lowest volume of Arctic sea ice on record , according to the researchers .
The declining Arctic sea ice is due to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases that have elevated temperatures across the Arctic and strong natural variability in Arctic sea ice , according to scientists .
Average sea ice extent during September , a benchmark measurement in the scientific study of Arctic sea ice , was 1.8 million square miles .
The record monthly low , set in 2007 , was 1.65 million square miles .
The third lowest monthly low was 2.15 square miles in 2005 , according researchers at the center .
The 2008 low strongly reinforces the 30 - year downward trend in Arctic sea ice extent , said CU - Boulder Research Professor Mark Serreze , an NSIDC senior scientist .
The 2008 September low was 34 percent below the long - term average from 1979 to 2000 and only 9 percent greater than the 2007 record .
Because the 2008 low was so far below the September average , the negative trend in the September extent has been pulled downward , from a minus 10.7 percent per decade to a minus 11.7 percent per decade , he said .
" When you look at the sharp decline we have seen over the past 30 years , a recovery from lowest to second lowest is no recovery at all , " Serreze said .
" Both within and beyond the Arctic , the implications of the decline are enormous . "
Conditions in the spring , at the end of the growth season , played an important role in the outcome of this year 's melt , the researchers said .
In March 2008 , thin first - year ice covered a record high 73 percent of the Arctic basin .
While it may appear to be a recovery of the sea ice , the large extent masked an important aspect of sea ice health since thin ice is more prone to melting during the summer .
The widespread thin ice in spring 2008 set the stage for extensive ice loss during the melt season , according to the NSIDC researchers .
Through the 2008 melt season , a race developed between the melting of thin ice and gradually waning sunlight , said CU - Boulder Research Associate Walt Meier , a research scientist at NSIDC .
Summer ice losses allowed significant solar energy to enter the ocean and heat up the water , melting even more ice from the bottom and sides .
Warm oceans store heat longer than the atmosphere does , contributing to melt long after the sunlight has begun to wane , Meier said .
In August 2008 , the Arctic Ocean lost more ice than any previous August on record .
" Warm ocean waters helped contribute to ice losses this year , pushing the already thin ice pack over the edge , " said Meier .
" In fact , preliminary data indicate that 2008 probably represents the lowest volume of Arctic sea ice on record , partly because less multiyear ice is surviving now and the remaining ice is so thin . "
In 2008 , summer conditions worked together to save some first - year ice from melting and to " cushion " the thin ice pack from the effects of sunlight and warm ocean waters , preventing the " perfect storm " for ice loss seen in 2007 , according to the researchers .
Temperatures in 2008 were cooler than in 2007 , although still warmer than average .
Cloudier skies also protected the ice from some melt , and wind patterns spread the ice pack out , leading to higher extent numbers , according to CU - Boulder Research Associate Julienne Stroeve , an NSIDC research scientist .
The end result was the natural variability of short - term weather patterns provided enough of a " brake " to prevent a new record - low ice extent from occurring , she said .
" I find it incredible that we came so close to beating the 2007 record , without the especially warm and clear conditions we saw last summer , " said Stroeve .
" I hate to think what 2008 might have looked like if the weather patterns had set up in a more extreme way . "
The melt season of 2008 reinforces the decline of Arctic sea ice documented over the past 30 years , said CU - Boulder Senior Research Associate Ted Scambos , NSIDC lead scientist .
" The trend of decline in the Arctic continues , despite this year 's slightly greater extent of sea ice , " said Scambos .
" The Arctic is more vulnerable than ever . "
The tiny village of Ilakaka , Madagascar had barely 40 residents before 1998 .
Then , a large deposit of sapphires was discovered along a nearby riverbed , and caught the eye of some Thai businessmen in the gem trade .
Word got out , and Ilakaka swelled to tens of thousands of residents - the center of a sapphire boom , today the source of nearly 50 % of all the sapphires in the world .
Illegal miners mixed with large - scale operations , all operating under little or no regulation , in a wild - west atmosphere of potential fortunes , lawlesness , violence and hardship .
In the years since , the easily - mined sapphire fields have been picked clean , and the remaining miners often work in deep holes , climbing far underground .
Mining is also a family effort - according to an official study , of the 21,000 children living in the region , 19,000 belong to working families .

Documents expose Prince William RAF training row : report Agence France - Presse
Published : Sunday November 9 , 2008
Print This Email This LONDON ( AFP )  Prince William 's bosses in Britain 's Royal Air Force ( RAF ) were unaware of full details of training flights which took him to a stag party and a wedding , the Sunday Telegraph reported .
Documents released to the newspaper under Britain 's freedom of information laws state that officers would have cancelled the flights if they knew the prince was using them to get to private functions , it said .
The paper also reported that the five training flights on an RAF Chinook helicopter including the controversial sorties , originally exposed by a tabloid , cost the taxpayer 86,434 pounds ( 106,000 euros , 135,000 dollars ) .
The flights , which the paper said the prince himself planned , took place in April this year when he was on a four - month attachment with the RAF .
The attachment was designed to prepare for the day when William -- son of heir to the throne Prince Charles and the late princess Diana -- will be head of the armed forces as king .
The flights included a trip over his father 's country house Highgrove in southwest England ; practice landings in a field next to girlfriend Kate Middleton 's family home ; a trip to a wedding in northeast England ; picking up his brother Prince Harry from London to take him to a stag do and " buzzing " the royal residence at Sandringham , eastern England , the paper said .
A royal spokesman told the Sunday Telegraph : " Prince William accepts that the sorties were naive and accepts his share of the responsibility for what happened . "
A Ministry of Defence spokesman added : " All flights undertaken with Flying Officer Wales were legitimate training sorties .
" In retrospect , there was a degree of naivety involved in the planning of these sorties but there is no question anyone misled anyone . "
The 26 - year - old announced in September that he will now train as a search and rescue pilot , saying : " The time I spent with the RAF earlier this year made me realise how much I love flying . "
It is sad to see people who have grown up here and gone through the public school system ( although that is much to say at times ) are still be capable of such statements like which truly shows their ignorance and blatant racist ways .
A lot of people I went to high school with know the person a whole lot better than me but just from that statement there , I think I know plenty to decide for myself .
A couple of my better friends are probably the staunchest conservatives I know but you know what , I can respect them because we differ solely on issues that matter and do n’t discredit a candidate simply because of his or her name .
I have told some of my closest friends that although there is a very high probability that Barack Obama is going to be elected President , the likelihood of him bringing the country together really lies in the hands of those who refuse to see beyond a skin color , beyond a guy with a funny name and refusing to accept that he may be just as much of an American as you are is what is holding this country back .
Let ’s not be naive and think just because an African American can reach the highest position in our country that all of a sudden and overnight , racism will disappear .
As the economic conditions of our country continue to deteriorate as they most likely will , regardless of who is President , expect to see race rise once again and those looking to prey on the weak blame this solely on a “ black ” man being not qualified to run a country .
There is probably a chance that this will flame the fire even more in those minds of the hateful but this is where an opportunity arises .
This country has a far too dark of a history to continue to ignore this issue and deem it to insensitive to brought into the spotlight .
Maybe I was too naive to think this would occur in a community where I went to school but maybe that was asking too much ?
Maybe this will be an educational experience that those with a different name than your Joe Smith are just as human as you , can realize this “ American Dream ” that everyone speaks about .
To some however , this so called American Dream * comes with a fine print :
* Some restrictions apply .
Not available in all states and certainly not to all races especially those with a dangerous sounding name that will threaten the freedom of America .
Oct. 3 , 2008  --
Sea ice at the top of the planet has apparently reached the lowest volume ever recorded , say scientists , with conditions declining toward a point where the Arctic Ocean may soon be completely ice - free in summertime .
While final numbers are still coming in , experts at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colo. , believe the overall volume of Arctic sea ice -- determined by measuring the area covered and the thickness of ice -- has reached the lowest level since satellite measurements began in 1979 .
" We 're pretty confident this is a record low , " said Walt Meier , a research scientist at the center .
Meier and his colleagues monitor the health of Arctic sea ice by looking at many factors , including the extent of sea ice -- how much can be seen from space -- and the thickness of ice hidden underwater , to calculate the overall volume .
" It 's like a building and a Hollywood set of a building , " Meier said .
" You take a picture of both of those , and they look exactly the same .
But if you go and peer around the corner , one is thick , and one is n't .
And so , what we 're seeing now is that ice , that used to be like a building , is kind of becoming more like a Hollywood movie set . "
Experts say that much of the thicker Arctic sea ice -- which takes years to develop but is more robust -- has been replaced by younger , " first year " ice that is thinner and more prone to melting .
In March 2008 , data showed that a record 73 percent of the sea ice in the Arctic was made up of the thinner ice .
" The arctic is fundamentally changing in character , and we 're going to continue this downward trend and eventually reach the point when we have entire sea-ice melts during the summertime , " Meier said .
Experts warn that , without Arctic sea ice , there will be major , if unknown , consequences far beyond the top of the planet .
The region acts as a giant air conditioner for the planet , helping stabilize global temperature and weather patterns in lower latitudes , like the jet stream .
" You 're changing the equation , " Meier said .
" And that 's going to potentially change traditional wind patterns , ocean currents , and storm tracks .
And which way the wind blows has tremendous impact in certain areas , particularly on where it rains and when it rains . "
Less sea ice also exposes darker water , which absorbs more energy from the sun .
That , in turn , melts even more ice .
2007 broke the record for the lowest extent of sea ice , and 2008 came in second .
The third - lowest year on record is 2005 , part of a dramatic downward trend that has lasted three decades and does n't appear to be slowing .
Going forward , experts say , there may be some cooler years when the sea ice may not melt as much .
But the long - term trend toward warmer temperatures makes a recovery unlikely .
" We do n't see it turning around , " Meier said .
He believes that the Arctic could be ice - free in summertime by around 2030 or 2040 , but he says more pessimistic estimates predict that could happen as soon as 2013 .
" Five years ago , if you 'd gone to a conference of scientists and said , 'by 2013 the Arctic sea ice in summertime is going to be gone , ' you might have been laughed out of the room , " he said .
" No one is laughing now . "
Economy Bad Even for Bush Administration Officials
Created : November 03 , 2008 15:20 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
With fewer than three months to go in George W. Bush ’s presidency , it ’s time for top administration officials to line up high - powered jobs at Fortune 500 companies or Washington think tanks .
But as the Wall Street Journal reported this weekend , that ’s not happening .
Partly due to the bad economy and partly due to the president ’s historic unpopularity ( 24 percent is his latest approval rating ) , more than 3,000 political appointees do n’t have a job lined up after Jan. 20 .
Fairly high - profile officials like Education Secretary Margaret Spellings have been turned down for jobs .
This is strange .
Clinton administration officials , for example , are leaders of prominent think tanks ( John Podesta at Center for American Progress , Strobe Talbott at the Brookings Institutions ) , big banks ( Jacob Lew at Citigroup ) and major universities ( Donna Shalala at the University of Miami ) .
But the transition has , relatively speaking , been a struggle for officials either disgraced during the administration , like Alberto Gonzales , or just hurt by their association with it , like Spellings .
Perhaps top
Bush officials will eventually get the plum private - sector work that appointees of previous presidential administration ’s enjoy .
But for now , these officials are too radioactive to participate in the public - private revolving door in Washington .

Scientists developed the world 's fastest computer that is able to perform 1,000 trillion operations per second .
The computer , called RoadRunner , is twice as fast the previous fastest computer IBM's Blue Gene system , which was considered to be the fastest supercomputer , being three times faster than other supercomputers in the world .
The RoadRunner was developed by the engineers from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , US , and IBM Corp. from 13,000 of computer chips .
RoadRunner is the world 's first petaflop computer , meaning that it can perform 1,000 trillion operations per second .
The daily performance of the computer can be compared to the calculations made by 6 billion people using a hand - held computer 24 hours a day for 46 years .
It took more than six years to develop a computer technology like this .
Built from computer chips used in popular video game PlayStation 3 and 12,960 cell engines , it can boast 80 terabytes of memory .
The interconnecting system takes 6,000 square feet , having 57 miles of fiber optics and weighs 500,000 pounds .
The supercomputer will be used for nuclear weapons research , but will have a numerous applications in medicine and science , engineering and other fields .
It has a great potential to help in developing biofuels , new drug therapies and even vaccine for the HIV virus , solving global energy tasks and find a clue to the origins of the universe .
The RoadRunner is now placed at the IBM research laboratory in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , but will be moved to the Los Alamos National Laboratory , where it will be initially tested for unclassified work and later used for nuclear weapons work and other government activities .

Even as the government moves to plug holes in the nation ’s banks , new gaps keep appearing .
As two financial giants , Citigroup and Merrill Lynch , reported fresh multibillion - dollar losses on Thursday , the industry passed a grim milestone :
All of the combined profits that major banks earned in recent years have vanished .
Since mid-2007 , when the credit crisis erupted , the country ’s nine largest banks have written down the value of their troubled assets by a combined $ 323 billion .
With a recession looming , the pain is unlikely to end there .
The problems that began with home mortgages , analysts say , are migrating to auto , credit card and commercial real estate loans .
The deepening red ink underscores a crucial question about the government ’s plan :
Will lenders deploy their new - found capital quickly , as the Treasury hopes , and unlock the flow of credit through the economy ?
Or will they hoard the money to protect themselves ?
John A . Thain , the chief executive of Merrill Lynch , said on Thursday that banks were unlikely to act swiftly .
Executives at other banks privately expressed a similar view .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
One - third of the world ’s ocean fish catch is ground up for animal feed , a potential problem for marine ecosystems and a waste of a resource that could directly nourish humans , scientists said on Wednesday .

The fish being used to feed pigs , chickens and farm - raised fish are often thought of as bait , including anchovies , sardines , menhaden and other small - to medium - sized species , researchers wrote in a study to be published in November in the Annual Review of Environment and Resources .
These so - called forage fish account for 37 percent , or 31.5 million tons , of all fish taken from the world ’s oceans each year , the study said .
Ninety percent of that catch is turned into fish meal or fish oil , most of which is used as agricultural and aquacultural feed .
Ellen Pikitch , executive director of the Institute for Ocean Conservation Science and a professor at Stony Brook University in New York , called these numbers “ staggering . ”
“ The reason I find that so alarming is that it ’s an enormous percentage of the world fish catch , ” Pikitch said by telephone .
“ And fish are fundamentally important to the health of the ocean overall . ”
Forage fish are near the base of the marine food web , nourishing larger fish , ocean - dwelling marine mammals and sea birds , especially puffins and gulls , the study said .
ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES
Unlike such dinner - plate fish as tuna , swordfish and cod , the extraction of forage fish is largely unregulated , Pikitch said .
Excessive removal of these small fish from the ocean environment could hurt the species that feed on them .
Aside from the potential ecological consequences , the taking of these large numbers of forage fish interferes with food security for humans , she said .
On average , it takes three to five pounds ( 1.36 to 2.27 kg ) of fishmeal to produce one pound ( 0.45 kg ) of farm - raised fish , Pikitch said .
“ If you ’re creating protein for humans to consume , does it make sense to take three to five pounds of perfectly good food and convert it into only one pound of food ? ” she said .
Most forage fish are high in omega 3 fatty acids associated with heart health , she said , adding that it makes sense for humans to consume these fish directly rather than to feed them to livestock and farmed fish .
But human consumption of these fish needs to be monitored , said Joshua Reichert of the Pew Environment Group .
“ Whatever people take out of the sea needs to be carefully calibrated to ensure that sufficient fish are left to sustain populations of other fish , seabirds and marine mammals , which all play a major role in the healthy functioning of the world ’s oceans , ” Reichert said in a statement .
The study is the product of a nine - year partnership between the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the Pew Charitable Trusts , funded by the Pew Institute for Ocean Science , which is transitioning to become the Institute for Ocean Conservation Science at Stony Brook .
As concerns about the effects of global warming continue to mount , a new study published in the December issue of Physiological and Biochemical Zoology finds that an increase in average temperature of only two degrees Celsius could have a devastating effect on populations of Australia 's iconic kangaroos .
" Our study provides evidence that climate change has the capacity to cause large - scale range contractions , and the possible extinction of one macropodid ( kangaroo ) species in northern Australia , " write study authors Euan G. Ritchie and Elizabeth E. Bolitho of James Cook University in Australia .
Ritchie and Bolitho used computer modeling and three years of field observations to predict how temperature changes that are considered to be likely over the next half - century might affect four species of kangaroos .
They found that a temperature increase as small as a half - degree Celsius may shrink kangaroos ' geographic ranges .
An increase of two degrees may shrink kangaroos ' ranges by 48 percent .
A six - degree increase might shrink ranges by 96 percent .
Ritchie says that generally accepted climate models predict temperatures in northern Australia to be between 0.4 and two degrees warmer by 2030 , and between two and six degrees warmer by 2070 .
The most significant effects of climate change are not necessarily on the animals themselves , but on their habitats — specifically , in amounts of available water .
This is particularly true in Northern Australia , says Ritchie .
" If dry seasons are to become hotter and rainfall events more unpredictable , habitats may become depleted of available pasture for grazing and waterholes may dry up , " the authors write .
" This may result in starvation and failed reproduction … or possible death due to dehydration for those species that are less mobile . "
And although kangaroo species may be mobile enough to relocate as the climate changes , the vegetation and topography for which they are adapted are unlikely to shift at the same pace .
The antilopine wallaroo , a kangaroo species adapted for a wet , tropical climate , faces the greatest potential risk .
Ritchie and Bolitho found that a two - degree temperature increase may shrink its range by 89 percent .
A six - degree increase may lead to the extinction of antilopine wallaroos if they are unable to adapt to the arid grassland that such a temperature change is likely to produce .
" Large macropodids are highly valuable economically , through both ecotourism and a commercial meat trade , and many species are an important food source for indigenous people , " they write .
" Therefore , it is critically important that we understand the ecology of Australia 's native herbivores to ensure any further economic development will occur in an environmentally sustainable way . "
The paper appears in an issue of Physiological and Biochemical Zoology on the focused topic " Predicting Extinction : Investigating the Interface of Physiology , Ecology , and Climate Change . "
On this date , October 3 , 2008 , the American people were betrayed by those whom they had elected to represent them .
The members of Congress who voted for the Wall Street “ bailout ” violated their oath of office to “ support and defend the Constitution ” … “ that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ” … “ and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter : … ”
Without holding any meaningful hearings or public discussions and listening only to those most responsible for the economic disaster , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Congress abdicated its responsibility to the American people .
Locking out most members from all discussions , the congressional “ leadership ” emerged from their backrooms with legislation that grants Secretary Paulson the ability to spend at least $ 700 billion to “ take such actions as [ he ] deems necessary ” … ” to promote financial market stability . ”
Entrusting tremendous political and financial power ( and a ton of borrowed money that taxpayers will have to repay with interest ) into Paulson ’s sole discretion , members of Congress must have been aware that , prior to his cabinet appointment in 2006 , Paulson worked for 32 years at Goldman Sachs , one of the Wall Street firms that stands to benefit greatly from his “ actions . ”
Paulson , who cashed out his Goldman stock valued at $ 575 million to become the Secretary of Treasury ( without having to pay any taxes on the sale ) , earned more than $ 53 million in pocket change during just his last two years at Goldman Sachs for innovations such as a new line of “ Mortgage Backed Securities . ”
Gambling more than a trillion dollars on risky subprime second mortgages , Paulson cleverly converted them into AAA - rated “ secure ” investments by purchasing guarantees from the American International Group .
AIG , coincidentally , was just “ bailed out ” two weeks ago by Secretary Paulson for $ 85 billion ( of borrowed money that taxpayers will have to repay with interest ) , averting a devastating loss by Goldman Sachs , who was holding more than $ 20 billion in otherwise worthless second mortgages .
Is it surprising that Lloyd Blankfein , Goldman ’s current CEO , was present with Paulson when the decision was made to bailout AIG ?
The bailout ’s $ 700 billion price tag is only an arbitrary guess by Paulson and is most likely just the first installment of many more to come .
Other economists , with more successful track records , believe the total will be much greater , perhaps $ 5 trillion , as concealed losses are uncovered and foreign companies dump their toxic investment waste into their American offices .
In passing the “ Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 , ” Congress ignored the “ great concern ” expressed by almost two hundred of the nation ’s leading economists who pleaded with Congress “ not to rush , to hold appropriate hearings , and to carefully consider the right course of action , … ” In addition to its ambiguity and long - term effects , the economists believed the bailout plan to be “ a subsidy to investors at taxpayers ’ expense ” and to be “ desperately short - sighted . ”
Ultimately , more than 400 top economists , including two Nobel Prize winners , voiced opposition to the bailout .
The economists were not alone in being ignored by the politicians .
It is widely reported that calls and emails to Congress from constituents were running as high as 300 to one against the bailout .
Mike
Whitney reports one analyst saying that “ the calls to Congress are 50 percent ‘ No ’ and 50 percent ‘ Hell , No ’ . ”
The percentages adjusted as the stock market tumbled , but public opposition to the bailout remains strong .
An AP poll only identified 30 percent of the public in favor of the bailout , and a CNN Money opinion poll found 77 percent of the people believing the bailout would benefit those most responsible for the economic downturn .
Who Benefits ?
The Latin adage , Cui bono , asks “ to whose death are you going ? ”
Law enforcement investigators quickly learn that the guilty party can usually be found among those who stand to gain from a murder or other crime .
There is no doubt the bailout will most benefit some of the richest and highest paid individuals in the American economy .
But , why did the politicians betray the wishes of those who elected them in favor of the criminals who committed the fraud ?
Perhaps the answer can be found in another Latin phrase , quid pro quo , meaning “ what for what ; something for something . ”
Individuals working for Wall Street finance , insurance and real estate companies and the companies ’ political action committees have contributed more than $ 47 million to the campaigns of Senator Obama ( three of top five sources ) and Senator McCain ( top five sources ) , both of whom voted for the bailout .
More to the point , Wall Street has contributed more than $ 1.1 billion dollars to congressional candidates since 2002 .
Nine of the top ten House recipients of Wall Street largesse , who each received an average of $ 1.5 million , are on the financial oversight and taxation committees .
Even more telling , the bipartisan Congressional “ leaders ” most responsible for pushing the bailout through Congress , Senators Dodd and Gregg and Representatives Frank and Blunt have taken almost $ 20 million from Wall Street sources during the last 20 years .
Dodd recently received $ 6 million in contributions during his presidential primary campaign , and Frank has collected $ 720,000 this year .
Other key players also have been well compensated this year : Congressman Kanjorski received $ 755,000 and Congressman Bachus banked $ 704,000 .
Who Loses ?
The ordinary , hard - working voters , who were opposed to the bailout , and their children and grandchildren , will be the ones who will ultimately have to repay , with compound interest , the money that will have to be borrowed to give away to Wall Street bankers .
The bailout was “ sweetened ” in the Senate by another $ 110 billion in tax relief and renewable energy incentives to get enough House votes for passage ; however , only the temporary one - year slowdown of the Alternative Minimum Tax offered any succor to the middle - class workers affected by it .
The bailout raises the debt ceiling to $ 11.3 trillion , or about $ 37,524 for each man , woman and child in the United States .
How is this burden ever going to be repaid ?
Workers already know their wages are falling , their jobs are at risk , their health care , food and fuel costs are skyrocketing , and they are being kicked out of their apartments and homes because they can’t pay the rents and mortgages .
Did n’t each member of Congress have a sworn duty to rescue the millions of Americans suffering from the reckless gambling of Wall Street moguls , rather than to reward an obscene excess of greed ?
Foreclosure Rescue
At least six million homeowners will probably default on their mortgages this year and next , and millions more will have their equity wiped out by declining property values .
More than 770,000 homes have been seized by lenders since 2007 , and 91,000 families were just kicked out of their homes in August .
These American homeowners were betrayed by their elected representatives !
The only provision in the bailout legislation to remotely “ benefit ” homeowners whose homes are being foreclosed upon only “ encourages ” mortgage service companies to modify mortgages .
Paulson is required to “ maximize assistance for homeowners … and minimize foreclosures ” ; however , he also has to ensure that the government does n’t incur any additional costs .
Thus , there ’s little or no hope of any meaningful benefit to distressed homeowners resulting from the bailout .
The legislation could have required the government to directly purchase the defaulting mortgages and to adjust them to the reduced value of the property , as was done in the Great Depression .
Instead , Paulson is authorized to purchase the complex derivatives ( Wall Street ’s gambling debts ) piled on top of the original mortgages .
The difference is whether homeowners or Wall Street receives the benefit of the bailout .
Bankruptcy Rescue
More than 4,476 Americans filed for bankruptcy every day during August , the highest number since changes in the law in 2005 made it much more difficult , and even impossible in many cases , to obtain debt relief .
More than a million , increasingly elderly , people will petition for bankruptcy this year .
These destitute Americans were betrayed by their elected representatives !
Under the current law , bankruptcy judges do not have the power to modify mortgages of a petitioner ’s primary residence , irrespective of how the mortgages have been sliced , diced and repackaged .
The bailout could have provided judges with the authority , in appropriate cases , to adjust the amount secured by the mortgage to the value of the property and to adjust the interest rate to a reasonable percentage .
Unemployment Rescue
New claims for unemployment benefits rose to 493,000 last week , the highest level in seven years .
The economy has already lost 605,000 jobs thus far this year , and it dumped 159,000 payroll jobs just during September , the greatest drop in five years .
These unemployed Americans were betrayed by their elected representatives !
Although the House of Representatives passed an economic stimulus bill that would fund job creation and extent jobless benefits for long - term unemployed workers on September 26th , the Senate failed to pass its own stimulus bill on the same day .
President Bush has promised to veto the legislation if passed .
The bailout legislation could have provided for an extension of jobless benefits , but it did n’t .
Homeless Rescue
More than 750,000 and as many as a million Americans are homeless today , and the numbers are increasing dramatically .
The National Coalition for the Homeless reports that homelessness is growing because of foreclosures , loss of jobs , and the rising price of fuel and food .
These homeless Americans were betrayed by their elected representatives !
Homeless sites are appearing all across the country as people with no place to stay are pitching tents and huddling together for support and protection .
Their plight did not receive any consideration by the Congressional leadership that rammed the bailout through Congress .
Hunger Rescue
The most recent report by the Department of Agriculture found that in 2006 , 35.5 million Americans lived in households with insecure food supplies and the numbers were increasing .
At risk children numbered more than 12.6 million , and African Americans and Hispanic Americans suffered at higher rates than the national average .
In 2006 , 9.6 million Americans had to frequently skip meals or eat too little , and often had to go without food for a whole day .
Today , as members of Congress voted to reward the richest and most greedy members of our society , they ignored those without the most basic necessity for survival .
This morning , they rewarded the most powerful and best - fed members of our society , and gave no thought to the helpless children who will go to bed hungry tonight .
Food banks who serve as the last resort for the hungry are running out of food .
They are having to reduce rations and to dip into emergency supplies of staple items .
There are reports of a 40 percent increase in requests for food assistance and a 30 percent drop in supplies .
These hungry Americans were betrayed by their elected representatives !
The bailout could have increased the amount of federal assistance for food banks in the Emergency Food Assistance Program , but it did n’t .
The Consequences
The real estate bubble that has been driving the United States economy has now popped , and there is no replacement engine to transport America ’s consumer society down the highway to happiness .
Americans are facing the mother of all depressions ; it will be hard and it will last a long time .
What are all of these homeless , hopeless , and hungry people going to do ?
Many have already exercised their First Amendment right to petition their government for the redress of grievances .
A majority of the members of Congress , the two presidential candidates , and the President paid no attention to the economic experts and the thousands and thousands of voters who protested the bailout and who begged them to rescue the people rather than the rich and powerful .
The people can always take to the streets in protest , and they probably will do so in growing numbers as the economic circumstances become more harsh .
The U.S. government is already planning for the eventuality – not with the helping hand of supplemental legislation to help with mortgages , jobs , shelter or food , but with the mailed fist of military suppression .
The Army Times reports the current deployment within the United States “ homeland ” of an “ on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies or disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
The Army acknowledges that the Northern Command may call upon the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team to help with “ civil unrest and crowd control . ”
With almost a trillion dollars picked from their pockets to reimburse reckless Wall Street gamblers , many Americans righteously feel betrayed tonight .
A majority will elect a new president one month from tomorrow , and most will wait to see who it will be , and what if anything he can or will do to alleviate their suffering .
There are others , undoubtedly , who agree with the Supreme Court ’s recent decision that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is individually held , and who believe that the use of their personal weapons is justified to overthrow a government that betrays them and which destroys their very means of existence .
The right of legitimate self defense is recognized by every criminal law in America .
Perhaps democracy in the United States is not dead ; if not , it ’s on its deathbed .
Resuscitation in the form of responsible representation is possible , but time is growing short .

Atticus Capital has lost more than $ 5 billion this year due to the demolition of 25 % - 32 % of the capital in its two main hedge funds .
It 's no wonder why rumors of Atticus liquidating its positions and closing up shop are being taken seriously .
But , they 're not true , says the founder ( WSJ ) :
" We 've heard these rumors as well and they 're not true , " says Tim Barakett , founder of Atticus , which has [ had ? ] about $ 14 billion under management .
" We 're certainly not liquidating .
In fact we have a large net cash position and are looking for opportunities to invest capital . "
Back in 2006 , Barakett earned $ 675 million .
Now , investors are shorting stocks that funds like Atticus own , anticipating capital redemptions by the funds ' LPs and therefore mass liquidations of these securites .
Here are two reasons , though , why Atticus may actually survive :
there is no trigger allowing investors to pull their money out if heavy losses are incurred ( unlike , say , Ospraie )
the firm does not employ much leverage

London 's Westminster Council says a work by underground artist Banksy is graffiti and will be painted over .
The seven - metre tall work , painted in giant white letters on a concrete wall in April , was intended as a criticism of Britain 's Big Brother culture and specifically the prevalence of CCTV cameras .
" One Nation Under CCTV " , it screams , from a wall on which a CCTV camera is also mounted .
A child figure perched in a letter appears to be painting the message on the wall , which overlooks a post office yard in Oxford Circus .
The work , Banksy 's biggest in London , was painted under the cover of darkness after the artist managed to erect three storeys of scaffolding behind a security fence , despite being watched by the CCTV camera .
But Westminster Council says the work will be painted over , The Times newspaper reported today .
The council says it will remove any graffiti , regardless of the reputation of its creator .
Banksy has no more right to paint graffiti than a child , the council said .
" If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art , " Robert Davis , the chairman of Westminster 's planning committee , told The Times .
" To go and deface other peoples property is graffiti .
Just because he 's famous does n't give him that right . "
Banksy started out as a street artist , but his work is now coveted by celebrities and has earned him a lot of money .
In February , his Andy Warhol - inspired screen print of supermodel Kate Moss sold for $ 210,550 at a street art auction in London .
And a wall he had painted sold for $ 453,700 .
Banksy 's work has been bought by actress Angelina Jolie and singer Christina Aguilera .

The video is part of a growing media library highlighting Mr. Putin ’s masculinity that includes episodes of Mr. Putin , a former K.G.B. agent , bare - chested on a fishing expedition and in flight in a fighter jet .
No cameras were rolling when Mr. Putin was said to have tranquilized the tiger as it stalked the journalists who had accompanied the prime minister and some scientists on a scientific expedition to Russia ’s Far East in late August .
The judo video includes instructional tips from Mr. Putin , a black belt , and from Yasuhiro Yamashita , a former world champion , among others , according to press reports .
It will first be sold in martial arts schools throughout the country , and only later at some unspecified date will it be available to the public , First Channel , a state broadcaster , reported .
In one video fragment shown on Russian television , an Asian - style flute whistles in the background , as a black - clad Mr. Putin describes the principles of judo .
“ The name itself carries the foundational philosophy : to receive the greatest result with little , but effective , effort , ” he says .
“ In a bout , compromises and concessions are allowed , but only in one case : if it is for victory . ”
When Arkansas enacted Act 1220 in 2003 , it was done with great fanfare and national attention .
So began the largest and most comprehensive statewide school - based childhood obesity initiative ever enacted in the country .
Act 1220 was to provide the proof needed that the war on childhood obesity could be won .
The fourth annual report evaluating the effectiveness of the Arkansas Act 1220 was quietly released recently .
Quietly , perhaps , because the news was n’t encouraging ...
Never in the history of our country have there been such vast amounts of public health and education funds and resources — and more policies addressing every facet of communities , homes and school environments — devoted towards addressing childhood obesity .
The Arkansas
Act is held up as the model for childhood obesity programs affecting every child in the country .
So , the report evaluating its effectiveness , and potential detrimental effects on families or young people , should have been front page news and reached every parent and taxpayer in the country .
But if you heard nothing about it , you were n’t alone .
A scattering of local news stories reported that the law was a “ Big Success ” in creating healthier school environments , noting that junk foods and sodas were being prohibited in growing numbers of schools , and more parents and kids understood BMI and the health risks of obesity and were making changes to eat healthier and exercise more .
A lead author of the evaluation report , Jim Raczynski , Ph.D. , dean at the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health , told media that the changes that have taken place in Arkansas schools are probably more extensive than anywhere else in the country and that Arkansas is leading the national trend , with the entire country looking to Arkansas as a model for their own public policies .
Reading closely , of course , those claims of success are based on processes , not actual clinical outcomes improving children ’s health or even addressing the Act ’s key goal : reducing rates of childhood obesity .
Background
Act 1220 was signed into Arkansas law by former Governor Mike Huckabee in April 2003 , which launched this far - reaching program to combat childhood obesity .
Its main provisions included annual BMI screenings of all public school students with reports sent to their parents ; the implementation of policies restricting access to vending machine junk food and sugary drinks in public schools ; the creation of community partnerships and a Child Health Advisory Committee to develop nutrition and physical activity standards and wellness programs in schools and communities ; and intensive curriculums on the health risks of obesity and to promote weight control and healthy lifestyle behaviors in youth and their families .
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supports the collection of BMI and evaluation data and its reporting .
The third annual evaluation report on Act 1220 revealed that , despite including everything popularly believed necessary to eradicate childhood obesity , the program had had no effect in reducing rates of overweight among young people .
Nor was it able to demonstrate any positive effects on children ’s health or health behaviors .
It did , however , uncover evidence suggesting that the Act was having harmful effects on Arkansas ’ young people .
A major CDC review of school - based BMI screening programs found similar failures and causes of concern .
[ See reviews here and here . ]
The latest evaluation of Act 1220 actually comes in the form of two reports .
One is the technical report on the BMI assessments and on the program ’s success in achieving its main goal : reducing rates of obesity among young people in Arkansas .
The other , is the complete , four - year evaluation of Act 1220 , specifically examining how the program has affected the health and welfare of children .
Here ’s a look at both .
Assessment of Childhood and Adolescent obesity in Arkansas Year Four ( Fall 2006 – Spring 2007 )
This publication reported the detailed BMI assessment data and weight classifications among students from each of the counties and school districts for the 2006 – 2007 school year .
It was authored by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement ( ACHI ) , a policy center supported by the Arkansas Department of Health and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
ACHI ’s function has been to help implement Act 1220 and evaluate its effectiveness .
According to this report , 99.1 % of Arkansas public schools had participated in the statewide BMI Assessment program .
The report from this last school year was based on data from 77.6 % of the students ( down from 85.5 % the prior year ) .
[ The authors refuted concerns that this was fading support for the program , but said that the 2007 legislative session debate on whether to discontinue the program may have resulted in all but the most ardent districts delaying BMI assessments until the controversy was resolved .
But this would also be more apt to favorably affect the findings . ]
The primary finding of this Assessment report was that since 2003 , the Arkansas Act 1220 has had no effect on children and adolescent weight classifications .
There has been no reduction in ‘ childhood obesity ’ .
More specifically , there ’s been no change in the rates of young people whose BMIs fall in the ‘ overweight ’ ( ≥95th percentile ) or ‘ at - risk - for - overweight ’ ( ≥85th percentile ) categories on BMI growth curves .
Just as in 2003 when this sizeable program began , about 20 % of Arkansas young people were classified as ‘ overweight ’ , 17 % as ‘ at risk ’ , 60 % as ‘ healthy weight ’ , and 1.8 % as ‘ underweight ’ ( ≤5th percentile on growth curves ) .
The report ’s conclusions state that the findings “ show that together we have continued to halt the progression of childhood obesity statewide . ”
Digging deeper , however , reveals that the same indications of possible harm and disparities suggested in the third evaluation , were even more prominent in this report .
Yet , unlike the third report , this report ’s text did n’t mention them at all — they ’re buried in the data tables at the back .
It appears that the Arkansas program may have most “ failed ” children at both ends of the socio- economic spectrum , but in different ways .
The counties and school districts with the lowest reported rates of students classified as ‘ overweight ’ and ‘ at - risk - of - overweight ’ , had the highest rates of ‘ underweight ’ students .
This correlation is a worrisome indication that the intense focus on weight and healthy lifestyles could be leading some young people to adopt unhealthy efforts to control their weight to the extreme .
Rates of underweight young people in Perry country , for example , were 3.14 % , with a total of 33.87 % of young people with BMIs at or above the 85th percentile .
Rates of underweight in Conway county were 2.76 % , and in Madison country 2.52 % .
These counties are also those with primary white populations : 95.62 % , 83 % and 95.94 % , respectively .
In Arkansas , race / ethnicity is roughly a measure of socioeconomic status , with StateHealthFacts reporting that minority children in Arkansas live with 2 ½ times the poverty of white children .
Similarly , the program has had no effect in reducing higher rates of ‘ overweight ’ in areas of social - economic disadvantage , despite the healthful behaviors of the heavier children .
Sevier county , for example , had rates of underweight of only 0.97 % , but the highest rates of children with BMIs at or above the 85th percentile ( 45.13 % ) .
Whites make up only 79.61 % of the county ’s population , while 11.84 % are of Pacific Island descent .
Only 1.8 % of young people in Lee county ( with 57.24 % black population ) are underweight , while 47.95 % of the children were reported as falling in the higher BMI categories .
Year Four Evaluation : Arkansas Act 1220 of 2003 to Combat Childhood Obesity
This publication summarized the most recent findings of researchers at the Fay W. Boozman College of Public Health at the Arkansas for Medical Sciences who ’ve been conducting evaluations since the Act was implemented .
This work was also funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
The report ’s synopsis said that “ while this evaluation does not assess the impact of individual components of the Act , there has been no evidence of an increase in negative consequences of any Act 1220 mandates over the past four years . ”
The broad - scale changes impacting students “ support a healthier school environment . ”
A critical look at the report , however , paints a less rosy evaluation .
Parental reviews .
Interviews of a randomly selected , representative sample of parents have been conducted since the program began .
The report said that the percentage of parents stating they were comfortable with getting a BMI report from their child ’s school has been dropping and is now down to about half of parents .
More than half ( 54 % ) of parents also said they did n’t find the BMI reports even “ somewhat helpful . ”
Parents of larger children were even less enamored by receiving a BMI report on their child as compared to parents of smaller size children , with nearly 50 % more of them saying that they were concerned about the confidentiality of the reports .
Parents of larger children , though , were no less “ aware of the health problems faced by overweight children ” than other parents , nor did they differ in viewing the BMI reports as unhelpful .
The unrelenting information about the health dangers of childhood obesity , however , had left them nearly three - fold as fearful for their own children .
Increased weight concerns among the children .
Nearly 20 % of parents interviewed said that their child had expressed concerns about his / her weight that year .
Among those parents , 62 % said that their “ child ’s concerns had not been expressed before BMI assessments began at school . ”
Not only were students more likely to have expressed concerns about their weight after the BMI assessments began , but the younger pupils had been the most adversely affected by the program and become worried about their weight .
For example , 31 % of children under age 10 reported being concerned about their before the BMI assessments began , compared to 69 % four years into the program .
There is no evidence that this is healthful or beneficial for youngsters .
Parental concerns .
More than one - third of parents ( 38 % ) said that they worried their child was more concerned about his / her weight than their child should be , and 20 % of parents were very worried about their child ’s level of weight concern .
Healthcare professionals , however , may also find other reasons for disquiet in the parental misunderstandings exhibited by these next findings .
While it ’s a concern when a child of any size expresses fears about their bodies , especially fears of “ feeling too fat , ” parents of students in the ‘ underweight ’ category were typically less worried about their child ’s concerns about their weight [ not defined ] than were parents of ‘ overweight ’ and ‘ at - risk ’ students .
More than half ( 51 % ) of parents with ‘ underweight ’ children said they were not at all concerned about their children expressing weight concerns .
And 39 % of the parents of ‘ overweight ’ children were n’t concerned because they believed their child “ needs to lose weight . ”
Raising questions about the quality of the information parents are hearing about BMIs and health problems surrounding children ’s weights , the evaluation report found that the percentage of parents saying they believed that childhood diabetes is a health problem for overweight children had increased to 81 % , up from 66 % in 2004 .
The authors viewed favorably the fact that nearly two - thirds of parents reported that they were trying to make their family ’s diets healthier , with the greatest reasons parents gave for “ changing the family to a healthier diet ” were to manage weight and become healthier ( 29 % ) .
However , even these changes sought by the program were already waning , down by one - quarter just from 2006 .
Students ’ perceptions .
The percentage of students “ not at all comfortable ” with getting BMI reports had increased to 25 % .
But , just as polling results give only part of the story , this report one did n’t reveal the range of young people ’s feedback .
How many admitted they were somewhat uncomfortable ?
The percentage of children reporting being teased had increased , with 12 % teased because of their weight ( up from 6 % in 2006 ) and 25 % of children teased for other reasons ( up from 19 % in 2006 ) .
Are these indications that this program could be heightening body and health concerns among already body - conscious young people and increasing bullying and stigma of fat , less athletic or disabled children ?
Another of the key concerns of childhood obesity programs is that they can increase dangerous weight control behaviors and eating disorders .
“ As part of the evaluation of the impact of Act 1220 , findings from the biennial Youth Risk Behavior Survey ( YRBS ) also are monitored , ” this report explains .
The YRBS is a biannual survey administered by the CDC and state and local agencies of a representative sample of U.S. high school students in each state , to evaluate six categories of health risk behaviors .
It includes specific questions about weight control behaviors .
The year 4 evaluation report states that , according to the YRBS data it presented , “ weight control behaviors among Arkansas youth have been essentially consistent since 2001 and are not significantly different from behaviors observed in the nation as a whole . ”
But this statement should be viewed with reservation , as it gives an incomplete picture .
‘ First do no harm ’
Nationwide , the percentage of teens engaging in risky weight control behaviors , according to YRBS data , had mostly dropped nationwide .
But not in Arkansas .
The Act 1220 evaluation report said that in 2005 , 12 % of Arkansas teens admitted to having taken diet pills — this is twice that of their peers nationwide .
Nine percent of Arkansas adolescents were reported as having vomited or taken laxatives ( up from 5 % in 2001 ) , compared to 5 % nationwide ; and 16 % of Arkansas teens reported having fasted in 2005 , compared to 12 % nationwide .
In other words , higher percentages of Arkansas youth were engaging in risky behaviors to control their weight .
But even this snapshot is incomplete , as it only reports the YRBS data to 2005 .
The 2007 YRBS data , released in the CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on June 6 , was not included .
The latest 2007 YRBS report said that “ the prevalence of most risk behaviors does not vary substantially among cities and states . ”
Arkansas was comparable to the rest of the country in most all of the surveyed behaviors , except for distinct differences in weight control behaviors .
Rather than these Act 1220 interventions to encourage healthful eating and physical activity showing favorable effects on the young people of Arkansas , the most recent 2007 YRBS data provides the most troubling indications to date of the adverse effects these programs are having .
Arkansas teen girls , for example , were about 20 % more likely to engage in unhealthful and risky behaviors trying to lose weight as compared to their peers nationwide — even though they were not fatter .
[ In fact , according to the 2007 YRBS data , slightly fewer of them fell in the ‘ overweight ’ category compared to teen girls nationally ( 9.1 % versus 9.5 % ) . ]
For example :
● 16.9 % of Arkansas teen girls admitted to going without eating for 24 or more hours to control their weight ( compared to 15.8 % national average ) .
● 9.2 % of Arkansas teen girls admitted to taking diet pills and liquids ( compared to 7.5 % national average )
● 8.1 % of Arkansas teen girls admitted to vomiting or taking laxatives to manage their weight ( compared to 6.9 % nationwide )
In addition to the evidence suggesting that teen girls are being most harmed by the Arkansas program , so too have the teens who are heavier than their peers .
These young people were nearly four times more likely to be embarrassed by the BMI measurements , 2 ½ times more likely to be dieting and 33 % more likely to report feeling concerned about their weight .
Yet , their health behaviors were generally “ better ” than their thinner peers .
For example , 89 % of the larger teens ( ≥85th percentile ) had n’t purchased any snacks from vending machine in the past month , compared to 42 % of their peers ; and 46 % had n’t purchased a beverage , compared to 26 % of their peers .
The percentage of heavier children who ’d consumed soda in the past 24 hours dropped between 2004 - 2007 , but had increased 27 % among their thinner peers .
This report supports concerns raised for years by childhood development and eating disorder experts that young people are not ready to grasp or appropriately act on even positive nutritional messages .
It also sadly bears out the admonitions of the Childhood Obesity Working Group of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force to professionals and government health officials forging ahead with BMI screening and childhood obesity interventions before they have evidence of being beneficial , that they may put young people at risk of harm .
For those who believe that these programs to teach healthy eating and physical activity are urgently necessary , proven to be beneficial and harmless , they are not .
Despite their good intentions , this report provides no indication that after four years , the extensive statewide Act 1220 measures have resulted in “ healthful ” behavioral changes , either .
In fact , Arkansas adolescents reportedly eat fewer fruits and vegetables , drinking less milk and more soda than teens across the country .
Yet , this report neglected to include any of this information — it ’s found in YRBS data .
Certainly , if the program had resulted in young people eating “ healthier , ” it would have been trumpeted far and wide .
Instead , according to the 2007 YRBS data :
● 13.3 % of Arkansas high school students ate 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day , compared to the average of 17.9 % among teens nationwide
● 10.5 % of Arkansas high schoolers drank 3 or more servings of milk a day , compared to 14.5 % national average .
● 39.4 % reporting drinking a soda at least once a day , compared to 29.5 % national average .
The Act 1220 4 - year evaluation said that the percentage of Arkansas children reporting that vending machines were available at school dropped by nearly half , with correspondingly fewer purchases .
But what kids eat during the school day is not equivalent to their overall diets .
Success in reaching policy goals is not support of the soundness of those goals .
The Act 1220 evaluation report also revealed a substantial increase in the percentage of Arkansas teens who report they do n’t participate in physical education classes in school ( from 3 % in 2003 to 46 % in 2007 ) , a reduction in PE participation ( from 71 % to 41 % ) , and no change in leisure - time activity during the 4 - year evaluation period .
Bottom line
Since
Act 1220 was enacted in 2003 , it has failed to have any measurable effect on children ’s weight status ; it has failed to demonstrate meaningful improvement in their overall diets or physical activity levels ; it has failed to demonstrate improved health outcomes ; and there are growing indications that it ’s having unintended consequences .
Parents , healthcare and educational professionals , as well as taxpayers , might rightfully question if the costs for these school - based initiatives might be better utilized in efforts to help improve the future of Arkansas ’ children .
Might school days better benefit young people , focused on education , rather than diets and exercise ?
Math scores among Arkansas 8th grade students , for instance , are below national averages and have n’t demonstrated the increases seen elsewhere in the country .
According to the latest 2007 National Center for Education Statistics ( NCEP ) report , average NCEP math scores for Arkansas 8th grade students showed that only 4 % had achieved advanced scores and less than a quarter ( 21 % ) even scored proficient – these compare to national rates of 7 % and 24 % , respectively .
Even more concerning , more than one - third ( 35 % ) of Arkansas ’ 8th graders scored below basic proficiencies .
The year four evaluation report concluded by saying that the findings of the continued efforts under this Act and related initiatives to address childhood obesity will help inform decision makers . *
Without complete information reaching policy makers on the effects of this Act , however , how likely will they be to make evidence - based policy decisions ?
And how likely will the vast network of stakeholders be to ?
The work of the BMI assessments and evaluation reports have been funded for an additional five years by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation .
RWJF President and CEO Risa Lavizzo - Mourey , M.D. , said in an earlier press release : “ There are ‘ natural experiments ’ taking place ... but we ca n’t afford to surrender an entire generation of kids to the obesity epidemic while we wait for perfect answers . ”
Parents might not agree that they want their children to be test subjects , but how many even know they are ?

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama leads John McCain in five of eight crucial battleground states one week before the presidential election , with McCain ahead in two states and Florida dead even , according to a series of Reuters / Zogby polls released on Monday .
Obama held steady with a 5 - point lead over McCain among likely U.S. voters in a separate Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby national tracking poll , the same advantage he held on Sunday .
The national telephone poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points .
Republican McCain is struggling to defend about a dozen states won by President George W. Bush in 2004 , including all eight of the states surveyed over the last three days .
Breakthroughs by Obama in any of those states could move him close to or above the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the White House on November 4 .
Obama , a Democratic senator from Illinois , held narrow leads over McCain in Virginia , North Carolina , Missouri , Ohio and Nevada , most within the margin of error of 4.1 percentage points .
McCain had a solid 10 - point lead in West Virginia and a 6 - point edge in Indiana .
The two candidates were tied at 47 percent in Florida , the largest of the battlegrounds with 27 electoral votes and the state that decided the disputed 2000 election .
Most polls show Obama comfortably ahead in all of the states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004 , but the Reuters / Zogby polls show McCain in serious danger in several states won by Bush .
“ If Obama holds the Kerry states , he is in line now to get enough electoral votes to win the White House , ” Zogby said , noting McCain faces a difficult fight in a handful of states where Republicans have a long history of success .
‘ UPHILL BATTLE ’
“ These polls are a measure of what an uphill battle McCain faces to win , ” Zogby said .
“ These are all Republican states and McCain has a very tough challenge , but they are all close . ”
The state polls showed Obama leads in Virginia by 7 points , 52 percent to 45 percent , and in neighboring North Carolina by 4 points , 50 percent to 46 percent .
In Missouri , Obama leads by a narrow 48 percent to 46 percent .
In fast - growing Nevada , an influx of new residents , growth in the Hispanic population and economic troubles have given Obama momentum and a 4 - point lead , 48 percent to 44 percent .
Obama leads by 5 points , 50 percent to 45 percent , in Ohio , the state where Bush ’s narrow victory over Kerry clinched his re-election in 2004 .

But Obama ’s hopes of putting heavily Republican Indiana into the Democratic column are threatened as he trails 50 to 44 percent .
McCain has a comfortable 50 percent to 40 percent lead in West Virginia , a state some polls had shown was becoming competitive .
With the race in Florida tight , both candidates plan to spend several campaign days there down the stretch .
Obama will hold a late - night rally in Orlando on Wednesday with former President Bill Clinton .
Obama has built his edge in the battleground states much as he has in national polls .
In the latest national tracking poll , he leads McCain by 13 points among independents and by 12 points among women .
Slideshow ( 13 images )
McCain leads handily in the national poll among whites by 54 percent to 41 percent , but Obama has done a better job of reaching across the partisan divide -- he attracts 19 percent of conservatives while McCain wins just 5 percent of liberals .
Independent Ralph Nader and Libertarian Bob Barr both received support from 1 percent of those polled nationally .
Two percent said they remain undecided in the race .
The rolling tracking poll , taken Friday through Sunday , surveyed 1,203 likely voters in the presidential election .
In a tracking poll , the most recent day ’s results are added , while the oldest day ’s results are dropped to monitor changing momentum .
The U.S. president is determined by who wins the Electoral College , which has 538 members apportioned by population in each state and the District of Columbia .
Electoral votes are allotted on a winner - take - all basis in all but two states , which divide them by congressional district .
The state polls were taken Thursday through Sunday and surveyed 600 to 603 likely voters in each state , with a margin of error of 4.1 percent .

Thugs with Badges : Crackdown in Minneapolis
FLOOD THE MAYORS ' OFFICES ASAP
St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman - 651-266-8510 651-266-8510
by Mark Crispin Miller and Rady Ananda
This may be the first video release on the Twin Cities raids - against legitimate protest at the Republican National Convention .
Twin Cities author Jeremy Hubbell provides background info on this decade - long practice .
Included is a call to action , with an online petition , mayors ' phone numbers , links and info on upcoming national actions .
OpEdNews has been covering the ongoing raids as reported by The Uptake , The Minnesota Independent , and others .
Our own Kathlyn Stone has been posting at the Twin Cities Daily Planet .
Video release by the National Lawyers Guild .
Late Tuesday night , at 2:00 a.m. on August 27th , Minneapolis police arrested members of the Glassbead Collective , and searched their rooms , as a pre-emptive measure against protest at the Republican National Convention .
Glassbead is a New York City group that documents police misconduct and First Amendment activity around the United States .
Vlad Teichberg , a journalist from Glassbead , reports being detained at 2 am in Minneapolis on August 27th .
Notes , computers , cameras , cell phones , clothing , and money were confiscated by police .
NLG attorney Bruce Nestor reports the media group was originally told they were being investigated for recent car burglaries in the neighborhood .
They were then questioned about their travel plans .
All of the detainees declined consent to a search of their property , but the cops searched those belongings anyway .
Later , Nestor was told that he and others were detained for trespassing on railroad property .
Some of the material illegally seized by Minneapolis police last week in " an intelligence operation " contained information regarding other protest groups , including organizers ' names and phone numbers , as well as their schedules and meeting and protest locations .
Nestor correctly predicted that the police would use such information to conduct future raids , and further prevent Constitutionally protected protest over the next week .
This August 27th video may be the first video release on the Twin Cities use of Gestapo tactics to subvert First Amendment protest at the RNC .
Teichberg condemns police thuggery , noting there is : " a systematic system where police are manufacturing accusations .
This particular problem can undermine the very essence of our democracy .
It is fundamentally un-American and threatens the very fabric of our existence , because if the people who are told to enforce the laws are free to violate those laws , there can be no rule of law .
And what do we have ?
We have a society run by a bunch of thugs with badges . "
Author Jeremy Hubbell on the Minneapolis police
Jeremy Hubbell , who is working on a book about the Twin Cities , advises that the Minneapolis police have been mobilized for just such actions since the late 90's :
" The behavior of the Minneapolis police was predictable .
Since the EarthFirst ! , AIM , Medota Dakota , and neighborhood groups used aggressive nonviolence ( treesits and lockdowns in buildings scheduled for demolition ) to block construction of Hwy 55 through south Minneapolis ( mid-1990s to climactic event in Dec 99 , Operation Coldsnap ) , the city rapidly caught up with other metro police forces and their ' counter - terrorism ' type policing .
They got a little too zealous from that point on .
In the summer of 2000 , e.g. , the U of MN hosted the International Society of Animal Genetics conference -- and police pre-emptively raided homes of known anti-gmo activists .
Incidents have occurred since of this nature .
Pre-emptive raids are old hat .
Just fyi that this is not ' new ' in our ' has n't been a free society for a long time nation . '
Not even new in " Nice " Minnesota .
" I should also note : the St. Paul site for the RNC is perfect for controlling protest .
If you have n't seen it or can't quite appreciate the maps of the site .
The Xcel center ( the power distributor of the Twin Cities , formerly NSP - Northern States Power ) has a moat on three sides due to freeway construction .
To get there , you either exit the freeway , or walk downhill from the Cathedral or state capitol .
On the east is downtown St. Paul and the Mississippi .
Directly east , in fact , is the center of upper class St. Paul - the St. Paul Hotel , Rice Park , and The St. Paul Chamber Orchestra - the most secure section of the city .
On the one hand , the geography should allow for an orderly separation of - protesters - from their object without arrest ( just have them walk circles on the capitol mall .
On the other hand , due to the control , it will be quite easy to make arrests - even easier than it was in NY . "
Online Petition to Halt Police Violence
Via Fernwoods , an on - line petition to protest and halt the violence by police ( with frequent updates on the site as well ) :
Police are suppressing the coverage of events by seizing people 's video cameras .
People 's cameras were smashed to the ground and broken .
These are not isolated incidents , they represent a pattern of targeting people .
We need everyone to video - the activities of the police Department .
When we no longer have the freedom of the press , we no longer live in a democracy .
Urgent !

StopWarOnIran.org - Sept 27 Actions in 100 Cities
Dear Friends ,
As we write , thousands of activists are gathering in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis - St. Paul in preparation for a week of protest during the Republican National Convention .
Over the past three days , these activists have been targets of police raids , brutality , and media distortion .
Salon reports :
" Protesters here in Minneapolis have been targeted by a series of highly intimidating , sweeping police raids across the city , involving teams of 25 - 30 officers in riot gear , with semi-automatic weapons drawn , entering homes of those suspected of planning protests , handcuffing and forcing them to lay on the floor , while law enforcement officers searched the homes , seizing computers , journals , and political pamphlets . "
These arrests , days before the beginning of the Republican National Convention , are an attempt to undercut turn - out at the legally permitted anti-war rally planned for Monday , Sept. 1 , organized by March on RNC Coalition .
The event , which is expected to be massive , will gather at the State Capitol and march to the RNC Convention site .
The police , acting on orders from the RNC , clearly intend to use tactics of fear and intimidation to impact the days of protest that have been planned by hundreds of justice and anti-war organizations for more than a year .
It is more important than ever , in the face of the outrageous harassment and illegal arrests , to support ALL the protesters in St Paul this week .
Take a minute and send a message in support - go to http://www.troopsoutnow.org/ rnc08protestrights.shtml
Police have claimed that protesters intend to engage in acts of violence , but the only criminal and violent acts taking place in the Twin Cities are those being committed by the Ramsey County sheriff 's office and the Minneapolis and St. Paul police departments .
The illegal and excessive raids , conducted by SWAT teams armed with automatic weapons ; the mass preemptive roundups of dissenters ; and the attempt to label all protesters as criminals are tactics clearly intended to silence protest .
We will not be deterred or intimidated by these tactics .
Please join us in standing up to Bush - McCain - RNC police state tactics .
A delegation of Troops Out Now Coalition activists is in Minneapolis - St. Paul and will be participating in the many protests during the week of Sept. 1 - 4 .
If you are in the area , please join us -- look for Troops Out Now Coalition banners and placards .
Whether you are able to join us in the streets or not , you can still stand with us against police repression .
Please sign the petition at http://www.troopsoutnow.org/ rnc08protestrights.shtml .
Demand : Stop Illegal Raids and Arrests !
Protest is not a crime !
Starhawk asks us to call the Mayors of St. Paul and Minneapolis .
Tell them you are outraged by these attacks on dissent .
Urge them to let Poor People encamp and to let dissent be heard .
FLOOD THE MAYORS ' OFFICES ASAP

Navel - gazing commentators in American journalism schools love to lament the dumbing - down of US political culture , but recently they 've had no cause for complaint : the focus of debate has been the very nature of reality itself .
At a campaign stop last week , Sarah Palin congratulated her audience for living in " the real America " , and spoke of her love for " the pro-American areas " of America , a truly mindbending concept that may cause injury if you reflect on it for too long .
Meanwhile , as John McCain watches the once solidly Republican state of Virginia slip out of his grasp , the latest campaign talking - point is that northern Virginia - the Washington suburbs where the Democratic vote is strongest - is n't " real Virginia " at all .
Naturally , such distinctions enrage liberals , who resent the idea that not voting Republican equals a lack of patriotism .
But the McCain / Palin definition of " reality " caught up with a prominent Republican too this week when Nancy Pfotenhauer , a senior McCain adviser , told a TV interviewer that she herself , Pfotenhauer , lived in a part of Virginia that she did n't consider to be real , whereupon she immediately vanished in a puff of smoke , leaving only an empty studio chair and the faint aroma of absurdity .
Perhaps she 's gone to " the celebrity land " , another mystical world invoked by Palin this week .
" We were on the bus today , we were making a list of who are some celebrity singers who could come out and help us , and gosh , for the life of us , the pickins were slim there ! " the Alaska governor told a crowd .
" Who 's quasi - conservative out there in the celebrity land ? "
The correct answer to this question is " the actor Robert Duvall and that guy from Metallica " .
But that 's hardly the point : Palin 's apparent ability to perceive all these multiple dimensions raises the serious possibility that she is operating from a plane of intelligence so elevated , so completely inaccessible to all but a few of the world 's leading superstring theorists , that it wrongly appears to the rest of us very much like immense stupidity .
Contrast Palin 's fondness for " the real America " with the disdain for reality demonstrated by the anonymous George Bush aide who famously described the president 's critics as belonging to " the reality - based community " .
( " We 're an empire now , and when we act , we create our own reality , " the source told the journalist Ron Suskind in a now legendary 2004 New York Times article . )
Which is more worrying : that the Bush White House believed reality could be ignored , or that Palin thinks her opponents are n't real ?
Actually , do n't answer that .
Making sure people show up at the polls on election day is crucially important work , of course , and one hesitates to mock any well - meaning effort to get out the vote .
But can we make an exception for Ben & Jerry 's , the ice - cream company whose ostentatious stance of corporate community - mindedness as a marketing tool is almost as annoying as the cutesy names of their flavours ?
Fresh from getting free publicity from Cherries for Change , their pro-Obama repackaging of Cherry Garcia , the firm has launched a voter - reward campaign offering a free scoop of ice - cream for anyone who can prove they voted on November 4 .
" Show us your ' I Voted ' sticker , a photo of you in front of your polling station , do the I Voted Dance , or just tell us you voted ! " the company 's website proclaims excitedly .
Which would be a marvellous democracy - enhancing wheeze were it not for the fact that offering any kind of recompense for a vote where federal candidates are on the ballot is an offence under US law .
" If I were Ben & Jerry 's lawyer , I 'd tell them to shut this down , " writes Rick Hasen , an expert on voting legislation at Loyola law school in Los Angeles , and also , it would appear , a crotchety spoilsport who probably just needs a few more scoops of New York Super Fudge Chunk and a big hug .
Another voter - reward scheme that may be in breach of the law : John McCain 's daughter , Meghan , has told New Hampshire voters that if her father wins there she 'll have the state motto , Live Free or Die , tattooed on to her body .
Not many things are to John McCain 's credit at the moment , but one of them is the fact that he 's letting his daughter join him on the campaign trail without dictating what she says to the press - a far cry from Chelsea Clinton 's message - repeating appearances , let alone Mitt Romney 's five sons , who during the primaries ran a strictly on - message and vaguely terrifying weblog , the Five Brothers Blog , in support of their disconcerting father .
Meghan McCain , who runs an entirely amiable website at McCainBlogette.com , has called Barack Obama " cute " , reported drunken evenings in karaoke bars on the trail , offered candid thoughts on her father 's campaign strategies ( Mike Huckabee as vice - president , she noted months ago , was " not gonna happen " ) , and spoken of the perils of dating a supporter of eccentric libertarian superhero Ron Paul : " He collected Barbie dolls .
I called my girlfriends after and was like , ' That 's weird , right ? ' "
Turns out that there is a straight - talkin ' , likable maverick named McCain after all .
What a pity they nominated that short - tempered , impetuous , negative - campaigning demagogue instead !
This week Oliver watched Sarah Palin 's appearance on Saturday Night Live : " She said almost nothing , so it was a triumph . "
He also spent far too long reading rightwing American blogs : " You would n't believe the things I 've heard about Michelle Obama .
Which is just as well , because most of them are completely made up . "
Josef Fritzl , the Austrian man who kept his daughter locked in a cellar for more than two decades has told a psychiatrist he was " born to rape " , blaming his tyrannical mother for his behaviour .
A report by a forensic psychiatrist which has been leaked to the Austrian press said that Fritzl , 73 , believed his behaviour had been tame .
" I was born to rape , " he has said .
" Bearing that in mind I controlled myself for quite a long time . "
He added : " I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter . "
The 130 - page report based on six lengthy interviews between psychiatrist Heidi Kastner and Fritzl , details his destructive relationship with his mother .
Describing himself as an " alibi child " , Fritzl said his mother only had him to prove to her partner that she was not sterile .
He described a childhood in which he was repeatedly neglected .
During second world war bombing raids , his mother would retreat to an air - raid shelter for safety , leaving Fritzl alone in the family home , he said .
From birth he said he had a problem with his urinary tract which made it extremely painful for him to urinate , a common complaint which could easily have been rectified .
But his mother waited for years before taking him to a doctor , only doing so after the intervention of a neighbour .
Fritzl , who locked up his daughter Elisabeth , 42 , for 24 years in a purpose - built cellar and fathered seven children by her , one of whom died shortly after childbirth , and three of whom lived with him and his wife in his house upstairs , said he had deliberately never looked his daughter in the face while he was raping her .
Kastner said it had been his way of distancing himself from the situation .
He said he stopped having sex with his wife Rosemarie the same day he allegedly sedated his daughter and took her into the cellar .
" Finally I had someone who was just for me , " he said .
He said he believed that she would always remain with him .
" I only had so many children with her so that she would always stay with me , because as a mother of six she would no longer hold any attraction for other men . "
Fritzl admitted that he often punished his " dungeon family " for rebellious behaviour by turning off the light or letting them go hungry for several days .
He also taunted the incarcerated children with photographs of other children playing outside in the sun , to " show them there was another world " .
Kastner , said his sexual behaviour and his need to dominate women was his way of " compensating for the defencelessness and humiliation he felt as a child " .
Fritzl said that he had tried to escape from the horror of his childhood by burying himself in books , reading everything he could find which allowed him to suppress everything he could not cope with .
He said his recognition that he was of above average intelligence was what finally gave him the courage to disobey his mother .
As an adult he said he had thrown himself into his work as a way of suppressing his sexual desires .
He described himself as a " volcano " who felt " torn " and had come to the conclusion that he possessed an " mean streak " , and a " flood of destructive lava that was barely controllable " .
It was shortly after puberty Fritzl began sexual attacking girls .
He went on to break into the flat of a nurse and rape her at knifepoint at the age of 32 .
In her report , Kastner said that although Fritzl had deep psychological issues , a severe combined personality disorder and a serious sexual disorder , he was sane enough to stand trial .
But she recommended that he should spend the rest of his days in a secure psychiatric unit and should never be set free , arguing he would always be a danger to society .
He was said to have had a thin grasp of the gravity of his crime however after expressing a belief that he would spend his final days with his wife Rosemarie , and pleading for a short prison sentence so that he could continue running his property business which would enable him to provide for his family .
Elisabeth , her six children fathered by Fritzl , and her mother Rosemarie continue to receive psychiatric care , but are believed to have been moved from a clinic to a secret location where they are trying to learn to lead a normal life .
Fritzl is expected to go on trial in the next few months .
" Adopt Us ! " Edition
UPDATE :
Hi there !
We were born under a bush next to Elaine 's front door .
My mom is scared of humans , so she picked out a really nice bush for us to hide under .
When the humans in the house found us , they got very nervous and were afraid we might be eaten by a nasty opossum .
So they saved us and put us in a warm bed on the porch .
Now the humans feed us from a bottle three times a day to give my mom a break .
And she does the rest .
My mom is starting to trust the humans more , because she realizes they are here to help us grow strong and healthy .
She sits close to the humans now , and watches over us as they try to feed all 5 of us with just two bottles .
It can get a little messy sometimes .
Like all kids , though , kittens grow up fast and our mom can't take care of us forever .
We need to find humans who love fluffy , adorable kittens and will raise them as their own .
We promise to use the litter box , leave your Christmas ornaments on the tree , and purr in your ear every night .
Will you help us ?
Unlike our mom , we are not afraid of humans .
We love to cuddle .
We will love you .
If you can take one of us home , email Liss .
Shaker Darla 's friend Elaine rescued a mother and her kittens recently and is committed to finding all five kittens good homes .
She 's already paid for the first round of shots , and is desperate to find adoptive parents for these little dolls , so if you 're interested , and are near ( or can get to ) the Madison , NC area , email me and I 'll put you in contact with Elaine .
( Elaine also adds she'd be willing to drive 3 hours one way to meet someone with a kitten . )
Image : after STICKGOLD et al. , Science LEARNING CURVE .
Experts , novices and amnesiacs playing Tetris show different patterns of improvement over seven sessions -- patterns that are in part reflected in their dreams .
A diversion ?
Yes .
Addictive ?
Maybe .
But a research tool for delving into the purpose of dreaming ?
In fact , the game Tetris has proved to be just that .
Robert Stickgold and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School recently conducted a clever set of experiments in which they used the game to guide the content of people¿s dreams : among 17 subjects they trained to play Tetris , more than 60 percent reported dreaming of images associated with the game .
And the researchers found that when and how the study¿s sleeping participants saw these images helps confirm the idea that the brain uses dreaming to reinforce learning .
They reported their findings in the October 13 issue of The idea that sleep , and in particular dreaming , serves to cement new information and skills in the brain first gained a lot of attention when Stickgold and his colleagues described another set of findings in the March 1999 issue of the .
In this set of experiments , they showed that subjects who had slept for six hours or more after learning a new task -- in this case , spotting a visual target on a screen as quickly as possible - - improved , whereas those who didn¿t sleep on it didn¿t .
Moreover , they found that those who improved the most slept for eight hours , with ample time for both slow - wave and rapid eye movement ( REM ) periods of sleep .
Stickgold hypothesized why these sequential phases of sleep were so crucial , describing a two - step process by which memories important to learning were consolidated and integrated in the brain .
During slow - wave sleep , the hippocampus - - a region of the brain that stores recent , episodic memories about discrete events -- replays its files for the neocortex , home to more permanent memories .
The communication between the two brain areas at this time is one way , from the hippocampus to the neocortex .
During the REM dreaming that follows , though , the flow of information flips , from the neocortex back to the hippocampus .
Stickgold suggested that once the neocortex connects the new memories to others in storage , it sends a message back to the hippocampus to erase them .
In this latest round of experimentation , Stickgold and his team probed yet a third phase of dreaming -- the hypnagogic period that occurs within the first hour of sleep .
They studied three different sets of subjects who all played Tetris over the course of three days -- playing for two hours in the morning and in the evening on the first day , and for an hour each morning and evening on the following days of the study .
Twelve of their subjects had never before played the game .
Another 10 were experts who had logged between 50 and 500 hours of Tetris prior to the experiment .
And the remaining five were amnesiacs , having no short - term memory due to lesions in the hippocampus .
Science Image : after STICKGOLD et al. , THOUGHTS AND IMAGES .
Reports about Tetris differed depending on when they occurred .
Thoughts alone were more common among subjects before sleep , and images were more prevalent after sleep .
In all , though , the reports were astonishingly similar .
Seventeen of these 27 subjects reported seeing the same images during hypnagogic sleep -- namely falling geometric pieces that , if placed properly , rack up points in Tetris .
And , interestingly , most of these reports occurred after the second night of the study .
This delay suggests to the researchers that the need to learn may in part prod the brain into dreaming .
¿ It ¿s as if the brain needs more time or more play before it decides , ¿ Okay , this is something that I really need to deal with at sleep onset , ¿ Stickgold says .
In fact , the learning curve for the game -- measured by total points earned - - was quite different for the three groups .
Whereas both the experts and the novices showed considerable improvement , the amnesiacs did not .
And this progress was somewhat reflected in the dream reports .
The nine novices who were initially worst at the game were the very same who reported seeing falling pieces during sleep onset -- suggesting again that the more a subject needed to learn , the more his or her brain reviewed the material .
Only five experts saw the imagery .
Two of them , however , described Tetris images associated not with the version they played in the lab but with the version they had played on Nintendo machines -- a twist that Stickgold attributes to the integrative process .
Perhaps most surprising , three of the five amnesiacs described having the same kinds of hypnagogic dreams as the normal subjects .
The researchers had assumed that the amnesiacs¿ dreams -- especially those during the hypnagogic phase -- would have nothing to do with recent events , if they occurred at all , due to the damage to their short - term memory centers .
¿ We thought that if there¿s one part of sleep that depends on episodic memories , which amnesiacs lack , it 's sleep onset , ¿ Stickgold says .
But even for these individuals , most of whom did not remember the game from one day to the next and had to be taught all over again , the Tetris dreams seemed to affect their waking behavior .
Co-author David Roddenberry , an undergraduate at Harvard , noticed that one of the amnesiacs who didn¿t remember the game nevertheless placed her fingers on the computer keys used in playing at the start of a session .
¿ She did not quite know what she was doing and yet she did know what she was doing , ¿ Stickgold comments .
¿ In a way , this is Freud¿s unconscious -- things activated in our brain that are in fact memories that guide our behavior but are not conscious . ¿
To try to understand this barrier between waking and sleep , the researchers also compared the differences in reports of images or thoughts of Tetris both before sleep onset and right after .
Curiously , thoughts about Tetris not associated with seeing falling pieces were more prevalent before sleep , whereas reports of images were more common during sleep .
¿ What was most striking about the data , ¿ the researchers write in the Science paper , ¿was the strong similarity in reports from different individuals . ¿
All the subjects dreamed of pieces falling and sometimes rotating or fitting into empty spaces -- and none reported seeing the picture surrounding the pieces , the scoreboard or the keyboard .
" What we¿re really looking at here is the age - old mind - body problem : the mind - brain connection , ¿ Stickgold notes .
¿ We think of our mind as being ours .
But there are real ways in which the brain has a set of rules of its own .
We ¿re getting an idea of what the brain uses as its rules for picking out cortical memory traces to reactivate and bring into our conscious mind , and we¿re trying to see across wake - sleep cycles how that process happens . ¿
That game is far from over .
Here we are , the day before the big 2008 Paris Motor Show ( well , the night for some of us ) and the Lamborghini Estoque Concept can't seem to keep itself covered up .
First we got leaked images a bit earlier today , and now , full high - resolution shots straight from Lamborghini , along with a full press release .
In more than one place the presser makes it clear this is only a concept while simultaneously hinting at a future for the car .
Though we expected details on the powerplant of the Estoque , it seems the fellows from Santa Agata are happy enough with giving us everything and nothing , saying it could take the Gallardo LP 560 - 4 V10 , a turbocharged V8 based on the V10 , a V8 with a hybrid module or an extremely high - performance TDI .
Thanks , Lamborghini , that helps us none .
Enjoy the pictures and the press release below .
Lamborghini Estoque Concept
It is a Lamborghini like no other before it : a four - door sports car that sticks resolutely to its creed .
The Lamborghini Estoque concept has everything that defines a Lamborghini : extreme , uncompromising and unmistakably Italian , it brings a whole new versatility to the brand 's DNA - with its four seats and ample luggage space , this " everyday sports car " is a perfect fit for an equally versatile lifestyle .
Lamborghini Estoque is a study , a concept created specifically for the 2008 Salon d'Automobiles in Paris .
From the very first glance there can be no doubt that this is a Lamborghini - a car with compelling presence , both unique and unmistakable .
The long wheelbase , the low profile , the broad track , the mighty , accentuated wheels , the clean surfaces and razor - sharp definition - every single line breathes the spirit of the Lamborghini brand .
A new and unique elegance The Lamborghini Estoque is an entirely new interpretation of the Sant ' Agata design ethic : it is a concept that provides a clear indication of the future .
This applies to the new , elegant self - confidence of the lines themselves , but even more to the concept of the vehicle .
The Lamborghini Estoque is the first sedan in the history of Automobili Lamborghini , although " sedan " is more a reference to the number of doors than any other characteristics .
Even sports sedan is an inadequate classification : the Lamborghini Estoque establishes a new category of super sports sedans .
With a powerful front mid-engine , permanent all - wheel drive and a sophisticated , precision - tuned chassis , the Lamborghini Estoque boasts a unique technology package .
A sign of success
In Paris , the Lamborghini Estoque demonstrates the innovation , the creativity and the design flair of the Lamborghini brand , currently represented by the enormous success enjoyed by Lamborghini Gallardo and Murciélago super sports cars .
As a concept , the Lamborghini Estoque represents one of several possibilities for a third model series within the Lamborghini product line - up .
At this point in time , no decisions have been taken in respect of either a third model series of any kind or of the Lamborghini Estoque concept in particular .
Of course , as a true Lamborghini , it goes without saying that the Lamborghini Estoque also bears a suitably powerful name with a rich heritage from the Spanish Corrida - bull fighting .
The Lamborghini Estoque is a rapier ( sword ) , approximately 90 centimetres ( 35.43 inches ) long , used in a bull fight by the Matador .
The Concept Lamborghini Estoque embodies the concept of a Lamborghini that is both a dedicated sports car and a relaxed Gran Turismo .
As a sedan with four doors and four individual sports seats , it is a multi- faceted vehicle for multi-faceted lifestyles .
Relaxed Gran Turismo
The Lamborghini Estoque is the perfect travelling companion , be it en route to business meetings , the theatre , the golf course or even a weekend away with the kids .
At the end of the day , it is the only car that allows you to share the singular driving pleasure of a Lamborghini with more than one person - possibly even with the whole family .
And there is still enough room left over for weekend luggage or several golf bags .
Despite its extremely low profile - at a mere 1.35 meters ( 4.43 feet ) high - the Lamborghini Estoque is surprisingly spacious .
The secret lies in its very long wheelbase which , in spite of the rearwards positioning of the front mid-engine , enables a relaxed , sporty seating position .
Entering and exiting is also pleasingly straightforward through the large , wide - opening doors .
Challenging : a thoroughbred sports car
At the same , the Lamborghini Estoque is a thoroughbred sports car with exceptionally refined power delivery , razor - sharp precision handling and a meaty engine tone .
Challenging driving pleasure on a winding mountain road , followed by a relaxed , enjoyable journey along miles and miles of motorway - the Lamborghini Estoque is commanding across the entire driving spectrum , at the highest level .
The Lamborghini Estoque 's versatility makes it the perfect addition to the range of Lamborghini super sports cars .
Design Such a Lamborghini must be immediately recognizable in its design as a unique and unmistakable work of art .
For the Lamborghini Estoque , this is clearly a case of " mission accomplished . "
The proportions of the Lamborghini Estoque are simply fascinating : no other automobile combines so convincingly the elegance of length with the sporting attributes of a low profile and impressive breadth .
Or to put it into figures - the concept painted in an all - new color , is 5.15 meters ( 16.89 feet ) long and 1.99 meters ( 6.53 feet ) wide , with a height of only 1.35 metres ( 4.43 feet ) .
The wheelbase is a stately 3.01 meters ( 9.88 feet ) - an equally important element of elegant vehicle architecture .
And it is unequivocally Italian - the flat bonnet , the long wheelbase , the narrow window openings , the flat rear that ends decisively with a negative return - it is all pure " Italianità " on wheels ; everything bears the design language of the large classic Italian four - door cars , albeit with a unique , modern interpretation .
Pure Lamborghini .
Clearly a sports car
The front end of the Lamborghini Estoque is a clear and unambiguous statement of its sports car credentials .
Its place amongst the family of Lamborghini super sports cars is also distinct and unmistakable - with its swooping V - shape , its two large air intakes pulled forward and the small front spoiler in between .
This front end design gives the Lamborghini Estoque a firm , low stance , while providing excellent aerodynamic efficiency .
The large air intakes facilitate the cooling air that is important for such a high - performance vehicle and the spoiler was specifically designed to improve aerodynamic balance at high speeds .
Such distinctive sports car architecture is only possible by positioning the front mid-engine well towards the rear .
Despite the very low bonnet , it goes without saying that the Lamborghini Estoque fulfils all safety regulations and pedestrian protection standards .
Taut muscles
The bonnet of the Lamborghini Estoque makes the origins of the sheer power of this vehicle immediately apparent .
The location of the engine is clearly evident through the distinct division created by two large air outlets and the additional emphasis of a central power area .
Further air outlets are positioned both left and right in the wings , behind each of the front wheel arches .
Together , with the division of the bonnet , these elements add emphasis to the area above the wheels , framing the front end of the Lamborghini Estoque like a taut muscle .
The permanent all - wheel drive that is typical for all Lamborghinis means that the 22 inch wheels , with their new five double - spoke design , also do their part in delivering power to the road .
Here too , the Centro Stile has stuck firmly to the Lamborghini principle that form always follows function ; after all , the ample cooling air flowing into the high - performance driveline also has to move quickly out of the vehicle .
Tremendous tension along the flanks Its proportions guarantee the Lamborghini Estoque an impressive appearance .
The skilled sectioning along the flanks of the vehicle gives the body shell an incredibly muscular form .
Beneath the flat surfaces of the bonnet , the incredibly powerful shoulder line , a further side line rising slightly towards the rear and , finally , the equally distinct sill line all add emphasis to the flow of power from the engine to the magnificent 23 inch rear wheels .
The masculine profile is completed by the negative return of the rear end .
This adds further tension to the form of the Lamborghini Estoque - the whole car looks coiled and ready to pounce at the drop of a hat .
These sharp lines frame a fascinating interplay of surfaces across convex and concave curvatures .
The Lamborghini Estoque clearly displays the design language of the Centro Stile Lamborghini with a distinctive elegance .
Powerful elegance at the rear
The flow of form is brought to its conclusion by the broad , even expanse of the rear end .
The horizontal split created by the flat LED light clusters and the large , mesh - covered lower air outlets bring additional emphasis to this breadth .
A narrow , slightly slanted " frame " panel surrounds the whole rear aspect and further highlights its powerful elegance .
Precise details , such as the hexagonal fuel caps on both sides of the vehicle , characterize the depth of the design language .
The front headlamps , featuring bi-Xenon and LED technology , carry forward a theme evident in both the Lamborghini Reventón and the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560 - 4 - the Y - shape of the daytime running lights .
The tiny green / white / red flag adorning the front wings discreetly highlights that an automotive statement as uncompromising as this one can come from only one country on Earth - from Italy .
The interior Despite its extremely low profile , the Lamborghini Estoque offers a surprisingly generous feeling of spaciousness .
The length of the interior facilitates a relaxed seating position for all four individual seats and plays a significant role in the supreme comfort of this super sports sedan over long distances .
The interior reflects elements of the exterior design language , also evident in the cabin of the Lamborghini Estoque - in the distinctive lines of the door panels or in the swooping V - shape applied to the cockpit , reflecting the form used on the front end and on the bonnet .
Luxurious interior
The dominant material of the interior is highest - quality Nappa leather .
The four individual seats boast sporting contours , supreme long - distance comfort and extensive electrical positioning options .
Cockpit with large - screen display
The cockpit presents the driver with a large - area LCD screen displaying vehicle and route information .
A range of presentation formats are available for selection depending on personal preference - a distinctive classical layout with circular instrument dials , or an innovative digital display .
A top-class audio installation and a sophisticated rear seat entertainment system round off the equipment .
Like the interior , the luggage compartment of the Lamborghini Estoque is also surprisingly spacious .
Despite the low - profile rear end , it has plenty room for several golf bags or pieces of luggage .
Production feasibility
As a pure concept car , the Lamborghini Estoque is a design exercise and a further indication of the innovative power of the Lamborghini brand .
Yet , it is based on a feasible technical concept that offers a whole range of fascinating alternatives for the body shell and driveline .
Just like the brand 's super sports cars , the Lamborghini Estoque uses a mid-engine layout .
However , the high - performance driveline used here is not located in front of the rear axle , as in the Gallardo and Murciélago or in the Reventón , but behind the front axle .
This front mid-engine concept , with the driveline set way back , facilitates balanced weight distribution and a centre of gravity close to the vehicle 's vertical axis .
Both ensure the unparalleled agility and handling precision of a mid-engine vehicle .
Reserves in every situation Like all contemporary Lamborghini models , the Lamborghini Estoque is also equipped with permanent all - wheel drive .
It distributes the engine power to all four wheels , thus making for superior traction in all driving situations , as well as providing extra reserves for extremely sporty driving and for challenging weather conditions .
A range of drivelines is conceivable for the Lamborghini Estoque .
This is headed up by the highly - acclaimed Lamborghini ten-cylinder from the Gallardo LP 560 - 4 - with more torque and higher revving than virtually any other engine .
A complementary alternative could be a turbocharged eight - cylinder derived from this V10 .
A particularly economical , but nevertheless dynamic , variation would be a V8 with a hybrid module or an extremely high - performance TDI .
The Centro Stile Lamborghini
With the Estoque , the Centro Stile Lamborghini has created further proof of its creativity and attention to detail .
The design centre that opened in 2004 is a studio of creatives , designers and model makers that combines the culture and the spirit of the brand with the power of innovation and of creating a new aesthetic .
The Centro Stile Lamborghini is part of the best tradition of Italian vehicle design , and is leading the way forward with the latest in working techniques .
The Centro Stile is located in a 2,900 sq. meter ( 31,215 sq. feet ) facility , where it occupies two interconnected floors .
The generously proportioned design studio is equipped with two full - size surface tables and their associated tooling and measuring equipment , while further areas house the latest in computer workstations for the creative experts and a workshop for the model makers .
The Centro Stile is also connected directly to the neighbouring Ufficio Tecnico - the direct link to Lamborghini 's development department ensures the rapid realization of ideas .
Speed is a key aspect for Lamborghini , for both its cars and its working processes ; the Reventón was created in the record time of less than one year .
In - house creativity and implementation From the first sketches made either on paper or using the three - dimensional computer program , through 1:10 or 1:4 scale models to full - size models , the complete design process is organized within small , fast - moving teams .
Since it was founded , the Lamborghini brand has been bringing innovative design trends to the rarefied atmosphere of the world 's most desirable automobiles , and producing vehicles with absolutely unmistakable character .
Models such as the Miura and the Countach were way ahead of their time , but quickly attained the status of timeless classics .
From their first appearance , every new Lamborghini is destined to become a legend and sought - after collectors ' item .
With the current Murciélago and Gallardo , Lamborghini has once again perfected an innovative design language .
The exterior proportions provide an indication of the power and dynamic character of the driveline .
Crisply - defined edges , precision lines and clean surfaces result in a design that is reduced to its very essence .
Every element is designed precisely in accordance with its function .
Examples of this on the Lamborghini Murciélago LP640 include the movable cooling air intakes and the asymmetric sills ; on the left side of the vehicle , the air intake is significantly larger to accommodate the flow of fresh air to the oil cooler .
Clear lines , perfect details
The unmistakable form of a Lamborghini is something that always speaks for itself : ornamentation or decoration of any kind has absolutely no place here .
This firmly places the current models that bear the sign of the bull within the best traditions of their brand and of 60s and 70s Italian vehicle design .
The sports cars of that time were acclaimed for their perfect proportions and for their objective , functional elegance that required no embellishment of any kind .
The purist execution of the lines is complemented perfectly by the passion for detail possessed by the designers in Sant ' Agata Bolognese .
The rear view of the Murciélago LP 640 is distinctive not only for its impressive power , but also for the fine interplay of the elements in the sophisticated rear light cluster .
The sensuality of precision and performance A Lamborghini is a high performance athlete .
Its high degree of sensuality is based on precision , performance and spontaneous action .
This type of elegance is the elegance of pure , unadulterated power .
This Lamborghini DNA is carried forward into future products at the Centro Stile , which is destined to continue to set clear design trends - the Lamborghini Estoque is the perfect example .
The design centre on the site of the historical birthplace of all Lamborghinis guarantees the super sports cars with the bull brand will remain exclusive , sensual and challenging - and always unmistakably Italian .

Dear Reddit :
Much as I tried and failed to love my first girlfriend , I have tried to love you .
I took you at your word , and trusted you to be a news aggregator .
Maybe you really were an aggregator at some point , and maybe you will be again , but I ’m not sure I ’m willing to take that risk .
It could be that you have become “ FOX News for the Left ” on accident , but I do n’t think this is the case .
I realized today that underneath your simple exterior and closed - minded politics , you are nothing more than a private club .
I can tolerate an open social network that happens to be like - minded , but a hive mind is too much for me to bear .
If you do n’t agree with this characterization , I ask you to look at what happens to stories from the other end of the political spectrum .
Normally , I would just stop coming by , but I think it is important the club realize what they are doing , and I would guess I am not alone in my concerns .
Far left news stories are posted all day long , and pushed to the front page .
The message is clear , Republicans are evil , George Bush is a dictator , Dick Cheney is the antichrist , and the United States is doomed if it does not elect Barack Obama .
The problem is , instead of aggregating news , you have started filtering the news , and what is left behind paints a bleak picture of stolen elections , voter fraud , martial law , and unending financial crisis .
You are breeding fear by not allowing participation from those with differing opinions that could moderate the debate .
You know as well as I do that fear is the enemy of reason .
The biological systems that are enhanced by fear have little or nothing to do with one ’s ability to think , though they often assist us in making the correct decision during times when our choice is binary .
The problem is , fear often takes situations where the decision is not yes or no , or fight or flight and eliminates all our options until the problem seems binary .
A recent example is the rabble that grew from stories of imminent martial law .
Those stories of course changed to martial law being used in November to steal the election , then morphed again into martial law being used by President Bush to hold authority after Barack Obama wins .
In a matter of days you ran the full spectrum of fear – it ’s happening now , it ’s happening soon , it ’s going to happen eventually .
My concern is you stripped away the context .
It is October in a presidential election year , and news stories of this kind are not a new invention .
Worse , just like FOX news you make no apologies for your fear mongering .
There is no accountability .
By the time a story is fully debunked , you have moved on to a new way that Republicans are going to destroy the United States .
What happened to the horrible calamity on October 7th ?
What happened to the imminent bombing of Iran ?
What happened to the New Great Depression ?
You can say they will happen eventually , but that is true of most things if the timeline is long enough .
Where are the news stories that could mediate such fears by putting them in context ?
I thought the more liberal individuals in America were supposed to be the more intelligent and reasonable individuals .
I thought liberals were open minded and believed in nuance .
When you do attempt to offer context , it is only context to further my fear .
And when there is a day that does n’t lend itself to trashing everyone who ever cast a ballot in a Republican Primary , you dig up stories about election fraud in Ohio four years ago .
I know the report just came out , but if you were so worried about it , you could have read a book on the subject , instead of waiting until it aided your goal of agitating and unnerving liberals .
Additionally , when you post a story that is nothing more than an interview sharing one person ’s opinion , it is n’t actually news .
I understand that the other guys have been in charge for eight years , and that a lot of things have happened which give you cause to feel concern ; however , if you look back to 2000 , there was widespread panic among Republicans that President Clinton would not leave office .
FOX
News unearthed a scenario where he could keep his office in the case of a contested election , and pushed the idea that he most certainly would do so because Al Gore was his vice president .
You see , the bigger problem is filtering your media this way only hurts the participants .
The reason Republicans have been acting so unhinged over the last two weeks is no different .
They are afraid of what will happen in an Obama presidency , and they only get their news from special sources that filter out any conflicting opinions .
In some cases , you do us a great disservice by not taking the next step and posting competing ideas .
There are concepts of value in other ’s opinions even when one does not agree .
The men who wrote the United States ’ Constitution did not agree on most anything while they worked on that document .
They had heated debates , and felt disgusted with one another ’s views , but they listened to each other , and the final result was stronger because of it .
Instead of agitating people about martial law , post stories that explain how martial law is a low percentage possibility , and explain what can be done .
There are options besides fighting or fleeing in the event of President Bush completing his coup d’état .
The easiest thing we can do is ensure we have enough food to last for a few months ( provided we ration it ) , and some bottled water in case of service disruption .
Should Martial
Law be implemented , the most effective means to ending the action is a work stoppage .
It will take a lot less than three months for corporate America to pressure the government into restoring some semblance of freedom , and that small amount of freedom allows us to organize and implement new plans to peacefully take back our country .
This is practical information that may actually be helpful in the event of disaster and that is why it would never end up on your front page .
Someone posted a story that was n’t pro-Obama , and the response was nearly immediate that it be pushed down into no man ’s land where even the worst of your junkies could not find it – because your search feature sucks .
( Yes , I know that google will allow me to do a site search , and I do so occasionally , but it seems odd that a solution to this problem be so unattainable ) .
Worse than the negative voting system you use to keep people with differing opinions from joining the discussion , is the way you treat moderates who visit .
One of the comments to a recent non -left story basically said “ take it to free republic , we ’re not stupid here . ”
When you react in this way , you lower the discourse to a significant degree , and do all of us a disservice .
Mostly , I just wanted you to know , that I have tried to love you , but it is n’t working out .
No matter how much you try to cater to my viewpoints , I need third party information and opinion if I am to be an informed citizen .
Maybe in the future , after the election is over and Bush is dethroned , we can hang out again , and see how it goes , but . . .
I guess that what I am saying is we can still be friends , Reddit , but I want to see other aggregators .
Sincerely ,
D.pH
P.S. Would you please quit acting like Ron Paul is the last honest politician and sole protector of the Constitution ?
It is annoying , and makes you look uninformed .
For a year , we 've listened to analysts passionately explain how online ad spending will power through any broader economic and advertising weakness .
Eyeballs are moving online , this story went ( goes ) , ad dollars will follow .
Online advertising is accountable .
Online advertising is the future .
Blah , blah , blah .
It 's time we woke up and faced reality .
Online display - ad spending will fall in 2009 , probably sharply .
It will probably fall again in 2010 .
Hundreds of startups counting on advertising as a business model will be flattened .
Yahoo , CNET , AOL , and other big display - ad properties will get hammered .
Legions of me - too video sites will croak .
Ad networks , the " hey , let 's just start an Internet company ! " flavor of this second dotcom boom , will get decimated .
This is why Nick Denton , the CEO of the highly profitable Gawker Media , just blew out so much of his staff .
Nick 's no fool , and his only concern at this point is that he did n't go far enough .
This is why Yahoo will almost certainly fire too few employees when it announces its mass layoffs this week .
This is why the value of AOL , MSN , and other second - tier properties will continue to atrophy .
How do we know online display ad spending will fall ?
Because by Q2 of this year it had already slowed sharply -- to mid-single digit growth -- and that was before things even began to get bad .
According to IAB , the growth of non-search online ad spending ( display , classifieds , lead - gen ) was 14 % in Q1 and 5 % in Q2 .
5 % ! That 's before the horrific fall - off in consumer spending in September .
We 'll be lucky if non-search spending is up year - over - year in Q3 .
By Q4 , it will almost certainly be negative .
How much has online display ad growth already deteriorated ?
Take a look at this chart from PriceWaterhouse .
For the last three years , Q1 spending has been higher than Q4 of the prior year and Q2 was higher than Q1 .
This year , both numbers are down ( see the two righthand columns ) .
Again -- that 's before things really got bad .
( And this is total spending , which includes the still - growing search ) .
Now , look at how Q2 revenue has behaved over the years .
See that 25 % dip from 2000 - 2002 ?
The coming drop probably wo n't be that bad , but it will be bad .
And it will last at least two years .
( These numbers , by the way , are all online advertising , not just display . )
How bad will the online display ad market fare over the next couple of years ?
At this point , we would estimate at least a 10 % drop next year and probably more .
( 20 % is not inconceivable ) .
Again , the overall market fell 25 % from 2000 - 2002 .
There are many reasons why this falloff should not be be so extreme - - namely , that half of online ad customers wo n't go bankrupt this time .
On the other hand , there are many reasons why this falloff could be worse :
The general economy is going to get clobbered in this recession -- something that did n't happen last time .
So , what 's the smart amount of spending decline to plan for ?
We think about 10 % next year and slightly more in 2010 , with the possibility that things could get a lot worse .
We would also plan on the decline lasting at least two years .
The country is n't going to dig itself out of this economic hole quickly .

GOP SEES CHANCE OF STEALING ELECTION SLIPPING AWAY
" We are running out of smear ideas and ideas for voter suppression , " said Karl Rove .
" What we are the most afraid of , is that the next president of the United States will actually be a man who , I shudder to think of this , a man who actually won the election . "
Satire by R J Shulman
WASHINGTON  ( PTSD News ) 
As polls indicate that Senator Barack Obama is slowly pulling away from rival John McCain , Republican leaders are concerned they will not be able to steal the election .
" We project that we can overcome up to seven points of an actual Obama lead with the strategy we have in place , " said Winthrop Downing of the Republican National Committee .
Downing told the Post Times Sun Dispatch that this strategy , named Operation American Freedom , which was used successfully in 2000 in Florida and in 2004 in Ohio , uses shock and awe to disorient the opponent .
" While black box tampering , challenging student , black and recently foreclosed voters , generic voter intimidation and voter roll purges have proven successful in the past , " Downing said , " we may not be able to prevail if Obama gets more than 54 percent of the vote . "
" We were hoping the relentless personal attacks on Obama , you know , that he is an angry black Muslin intent on teaching sex to your kindergartner , would soften up his numbers enough for us to be in reach of pulling the victory from him , but he as been bobbing and weaving like Muhammad Ali on steroids , " said Barbara White , a GOP strategist .
" We did make some progress when we tricked the media into covering the ACORN story thinking it was about real voter fraud , " White said .
" Of course , no one with those wild names will show up to actually vote , but media focus on ACORN allows us to challenge more legitimate voters .
More importantly , while the media is swarming all over the little acorn , the mighty tree of GOP vote stealing will go unnoticed , even though it will cost more than 3 million Democrat votes . "
Polls in several key swing states are now showing an increased lead for Obama .
" We just needed that old fool McCain to keep it close enough , " said a GOP staffer who wished to remain anonymous , " but he seems to be losing it .
Just yesterday he got so mixed up at a rally he told a crowd in western Pennsylvania that he agreed with Obama that they were a bunch of angry rednecks .
And Palin ?
A moose would be more qualified to be veep . "
" We are running out of smear ideas and ideas for voter suppression , " said Karl Rove .
" What we are the most afraid of , is that the next president of the United States will actually be a man who , I shudder to think of this , a man who actually won the election . "

CLG Index
Client applications based on Cappuccino communicate with servers ( remote services ) through basic HTTP requests , whose message content ( body ) can be in various formats , either XML ( the schema as to be defined , there is n’t any rule there – this is called XML - RPC ) or the standardized and easy to read JSON format ( is n’t XML ) .
The message could also be wrapped in a SOAP enveloppe , but it is less frequent ( because more complex to deal with ) when calling webservices from a rich client ( especially if the caller is n’t a Java program – wich is the case with Cappuccino , pure javascript – because we cannot then use generated Axis proxies ) .
Then we will consider here that HTTP requests are originated from javascript client code ( that is AJAX – the use of XMLHttpRequest javascript class ) , the only way to provide a partial refresh in the client - side page .
The problem that arises is that , for security concerns , Ajax ( XMLHttpRequest class ) is n’t allowed to make cross - domain calls , that is the domain of the requested url must be the same as the one from the current page ( this is the case at Cjed Audio Home site : news uncollapsing / collapsing is done sending an Ajax request to a php script in the same domain ) .
In order to circumvent this limitation , a trick has been used , that is known as JSONP ( JSON with padding ) .
The point is to dynamically add in the page ( through DOM ) a script element of javascript type , whose source is pointing to the service url in the other domain .
In this situation the cross - domain call is allowed .
As we are in an AJAX call context , the end of processing on the server side ( extracting news content , doing a search , etc. ) must trigger a callback function on the client - side in order for the refresh to happen ( use of the result ) .
The second trick is to not simply return the result – in JSON or other format - , as it would n’t produce any result on the client side ( the call originates from a script include ) , but to return a javascript method call instruction – in javascript – ( the famous callback function ) , with passing the result string computed on the server side as a parameter to that callback function call ( this parameter can be in JSON or XML format ) .
For example the result string will be myCallBackFunction ( { “ x ” : 10 , “ y ” : 15} ) if the process returns two integer values in JSON format .
Then the interpreted result will trigger the callback javascript function on the client - side ( possible from the script area ) , with the return result passed as a parameter to it .
As for the server to know what callback function name to prepend at the start of the result string ( myCallBackFunction area ) , we have to pass that information by adding an aditionnal request parameter to the service url .
Examples :
http://search.yahooapis.com/ImageSearchService/V1/imageSearch?appid=YahooDemo
&output=json&callback=callBackResult&query=searchValue
http://www.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photos.search&tags=searchTag&media=photos&machine_tag_mode=any
&format=json&api_key=ca4dd89d3dfaeaf075144c3fdec76756
&jsoncallback=CPJSONPConnectionCallbacks.callbackXX .
The name of the parameter that stores the callback function name varies depending on the JSONP service called ( here callback for Yahoo and jsoncallbacl for Flickr ) , the same for another parameter that provides the result format ( json ) .
We simply simulate here how the XMLHttpRequest API operates , without relying on in ( because it cannot be used for security concerns ) … but there is to know if it is a secure way …
Through the source code of Flickr Photo Demo Cappuccino application , we discover the CPJSONPConnection class .
It is instanciated ( in the AppController class in that example ) through the following Objective - J ( javascript ) instructions :
var request = [ CPURLRequest requestWithURL :" JSONP service url " ] ;
( this url contains a parameter that specifies the result format in the returned string , json here )
var connection = [ CPJSONPConnection sendRequest : request callback : " jsoncallback " delegate : self ] ;
( for that service , Flickr JSONP , the parameter that stores the callback method ’s name is called jsoncallback )
In the CPJSONPConnection source code we discover that the CPJSONPConnectionCallbacks.callbackXX value is used as for the callback name ( that is the value passed to the jsoncallback request parameter – that parameter name is an instance variable of the CPJSONPConnection class ) .
This value is defined as a javascript function ( stored in a javascript callback functions array ) that contains the following Objective - J ( javascript ) code :
[ _delegate connection:self didReceiveData: data ] ;
[ self removeScriptTag ] ;
The connection : didReceiveData method is then called ( when the returned javascript is interpreted from the script area ) on the AppController class ( defined as the delegate when using CPJSONPConnection sendRequest : callback : delegate : – we passed self ) .
This delegate method signature is as follows :
( void ) connection : ( CPJSONPConnection ) aConnection didReceiveData :( CPString ) data
Inside that method we can directly extract informations from the returned string – data parameter – ( JSON format here , that is the expected result – ie without the prepended callback method name ) .
If the called service url is hosted in the same domain as the current page , the previous JSONP mechanism is n’t required , and we can simply use the XMLHttpRequest class , wrapped ( hidden ) by the CPURLConnection class ( the call is then pure classical Ajax ) .
We specify the delegate object during the CPURLConnection instance creation , using the following method :
connectionWithRequest :( CPURLRequest )
aRequest delegate :( id ) aDelegate
( the passed url parameter is built the same way as previsously , creating a CPURLRequest object )
However , as here the call will finally be triggered by XMLHttpRequest ( will provide the callback method name – always the same ) there is no need anymore to pass the callback method name to the service through the url ( that information is passed to the XMLHttpRequest class , that manages the callback triggering ) .
So the service only returns the JSON message in the resulting string ( no need to prepend the javascript callback method name , we are in a classical Ajax call context ) .
We only have to implement , in the delegate object ( typically AppController ) , the following method ( this name is hard - coded as the XMLHttpRequest callback name in CPURLConnection class implementation , when the later start method is called ) :
-( void ) connection :( CPURLConnection ) aConnection didReceiveData:( CPString ) data
If the returned data string is in JSON format ( and we use either a CPJSONPConnection or a classical Ajax call through CPURLConnection ) we can easily deserialize that string into a structured javascript object , thanks to the CPJSObjectCreateWithJSON method :
Example :
-( void ) connection :( CPURLConnection ) aConnection didReceiveData:( CPString ) data
{
var myJSObject = CPJSObjectCreateWithJSON ( data ) ;
...
}
For rich client applications , the requested business services are more likely to be hosted on other severs ( and so other domains ) that the client interface page , then the JSONP solution will be required .
If the server service is implemented in php , its returning string will look like this ( considering the result part is in JSON format ) :
<?=$_GET['jsoncallback ' ] ? >( { " greeting " : " Hello from request . " } )
Update : see also the CP2JavaWS Cappuccino client to Java remote services bridge , that allows easy call of remote business services , using provided proxy ( client - side ) and JSON servlet ( server - side ) .
It completely hides the CPJSONPConnection and CPURLConnection classes , manages encoding / decoding and namespace of services methods ’s parameters and return ( full objects graphs including nested heterogeneous collection elements ) , call of a delegate handlers for success response and fail ( passing the decoded return graph ) , in the same way ( use syntax ) as GWT does ( but without any generation step ) .
Objects attributes serialization is automatic but can be redefined by implementing the CPCoding protocol in custom objects .
Percolation : Slipping through the Cracks Posted August 2008 .
The existence of a critical probability makes percolation a mathematically interesting and rich subject .

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction
My backyard has an area where the soil is mainly clay and another where it 's mainly sand .
The day after a hard rain , the sandy region is usually dry while the clay region is still damp .
The process by which water moves through a medium , like sand or clay , is called percolation and is currently the focus of significant mathematical activity , some of which we 'll describe in this article .
Geoffrey Grimmett begins his book Percolation with the question : " Suppose we immerse a large porous stone in a bucket of water .
What is the probability that the centre of the stone is wetted ? "
To begin creating a mathematical model , we will imagine a two - dimensional lattice of channels running through the rock ( a more realistic three - dimensional model can wait ) .
This is known as the square lattice , and we will denote it by Z2 .
We choose a parameter p between 0 and 1 and declare that each edge is open with probability p.
Think of an open edge as a channel that is large enough to conduct water through it .
Here are examples for two different values of p. p = 0.3 p = 0.6
If we imagine that the size of the channels is much smaller than the size of the rock , it is reasonable to assume that the lattice is infinite in extent .
To rephrase Grimmett 's question , we may ask , " What is the probability that there is a path of open edges from the origin that travels infinitely far ?
We can easily make two statements .
When p = 0 , every edge is closed so there will be no infinite open path containing the origin .
However , when p = 1 , every edge will be open so there must be an infinite open path .
What happens for intermediate values of p ?
For small p , there will be few open channels so any open paths will most likely be short .
However , as p increases , there are more open channels , and eventually it is likely that there is an infinite open path starting at the origin .
If there is a positive probability of having such an infinite path , we say that percolation occurs .
We will see that there is a critical probability , that we denote p c , representing a threshold ; percolation occurs above p c but not below .
A result due to Harris and Kesten , which we 'll outline later , states that the critical probability for the square lattice is p c = 1 / 2 .
The existence of a critical probability makes percolation a mathematically interesting and rich subject .
On either side of the critical probability , the system behaves in fundamentally different ways ( as water drains easily through sandy soil but not through clay ) .
As such , it serves as a model for more complex systems that experience a phase transition when some parameter , such as temperature , passes through a critical value .
Percolation provides a model that is simple enough to be mathematically accessible while still displaying many of the features of more complex systems .
A simple example Let 's begin with a simple example that illustrates some general principles .
We will study percolation on the infinite binary tree , a portion of which is shown below .
If p is the probability that each edge is open , we want to find θ ( p ) , the probability that there is an infinite open path containing the root of the tree v 0 .
We begin by letting P n be the probability that there is an open path from v 0 to a vertex n levels below .
Notice that we have P 0 = 1 .
Shown in red below is a path from v 0 to a vertex three levels below .
This path moves through another vertex v 1 .
The probability that an open path from v 0 to a vertex n levels below passes through v 1 is pP n - 1 , the probability p that the edge from v 0 to v 1 is open times the probability P n - 1 that a path from v 1 to a vertex n - 1 levels below it is open .
Therefore , the probability that there is no open path from v 0 to a vertex n levels below passing through v 1 is 1 - pP n - 1 .
Since any path from v 0 to a vertex n levels below must pass through one of the children of v 0 , we find that the probability that there is not an open path from v 0 to a vertex n levels below is and therefore
If we define the function f p ( x ) = 1 - ( 1 - px ) 2 , we have P n = f p ( P n - 1 ) .
The graph of f p is shown below in two different cases , depending on the derivative f p ' ( 0 ) = 2 p . f p ' ( 0 ) = 2 p > 1 f p ' ( 0 ) = 2 p < 1
In the first case , 2 p > 1 , we see that there is a fixed point and if 2 p < 1 , the only fixed point is x 0 = 0 .
From the graph , we see that if 2 p > 1 and x > x 0 , then x 0 < f p ( x ) < x .
Since P 0 = 1 , we have and and so on .
It then follows that if p > 1/ 2 .
The graph of θ ( p ) is therefore shown below :
Here we see that the critical probability , p c = 1/2 ; above p c , θ ( p ) > 0 and we have percolation .
Below the critical probability , θ ( p ) = 0 and there is no percolation .
This example is unusual in that it is difficult to compute the critical probability and θ ( p ) exactly for most combinatorial graphs .
As we 'll see toward the end of this article , however , it is thought that the specific form that θ ( p ) takes here shares features with that from other graphs .
Percolation on the square lattice Percolation theory was introduced to mathematicians by Broadbent and Hammersley in 1957 .
For two decades , work in this new field concentrated mainly on finding critical probabilities .
For instance , Broadbent and Hammersley showed that the critical probability for the square lattice Z2 , shown below , is between 1/3 and 2/3 .
On the basis of Monte Carlo simulations , Hammersley later suggested that this probability should be 1/ 2 .
Indeed , through work of Harris and later Kesten , it was eventually proven that p c = 1/ 2 .
We will outline the proof of this theorem later .
For now , let 's develop a feel for how configurations behave for various values of p .
Here is one configuration of open edges that results when p = 0.4 .
Given a configuration of open edges and a vertex v in the lattice , the cluster C v will denote the collection of vertices connected to v by open edges .
Below we show a configuration when p = 0.3 and C 0 , the cluster containing the origin , in blue .
Remember that θ ( p ) is the probability that there is an infinite path containing the origin , which is the same event as the cluster C 0 being infinite .
Here 's what happens as we increase p. p = 0.2 p = 0.3 p = 0.4 p = 0.45 p = 0.5 p = 0.55 p = 0.6 p = 0.8
Based on these examples , two things can be observed .
First , if we look at a fixed value of p , we see that the size of the clusters is relatively small for small values of p.
A theorem of Menshikov allows us to state this quantitatively .
If E is some event , we will use P p ( E ) to denote the probability that E holds when the edges are open with probability p.
By S x,n , we will denote the event that there is an open path from a vertex x to another vertex whose distance from x , measured in the lattice , is n .
( We measure distances in the lattice as the number of edges in the shortest possible path between the two vertices . )
Though proven in considerably more generality , Menshikov 's theorem roughly says that For a given p < p c , there is a constant a such that P ( S x , n ) ≤ e-an .
This means that the probability of having an open path decreases exponentially as the distance traveled by the path increases .
The Harris - Kesten Theorem
For our second observation , imagine increasing p as we consider the size of the cluster C 0 .
It is relatively small for small values of p , but around p = 0.45 , its size begins to grow significantly .
This leads us to suspect that the critical probability p c , the probability that marks the transition from θ ( p ) = 0 to θ ( p ) > 0 occurs around 1 /2 .
In fact , one of the first significant results in percolation theory is the Harris - Kesten Theorem
For the square lattice , p c = 1/ 2 .
In what follows , we will outline a proof of this theorem , which divides naturally into two parts .
The first half , originally proven by Harris in 1960 , states that θ ( 1/2 ) = 0 .
In particular , this implies that p c ≥ 1/ 2 .
The second half , proven later by Kesten in 1982 , says that p c ≤ 1/ 2 .
The result that p c = 1/2 naturally follows .
We 'll begin outlining an argument for Harris ' theorem by considering the dual of the square lattice .
This graph is formed from the square lattice by placing one vertex in the center of each square and joining vertices with an edge when their corresponding squares in the square lattice share an edge .
Notice that if we are given an edge in the lattice , there is exactly one edge crossing it in the dual .
Also , the dual lattice is a copy of the square lattice translated so that the vertices are in the centers of the squares .
For this reason , we say the square lattice is self - dual .
Suppose we are given a configuration of open edges in the square lattice .
We will consider an edge in the dual lattice to be open exactly when the edge it crosses in the square lattice is closed .
Shown below in red is a configuration for the square lattice and , in blue , the corresponding configuration in the dual lattice .
In this way , requiring that the edges in the square lattice are open with probability p is the same as requiring that edges in the dual lattice are open with probability 1 - p .
Now consider C 0 , the cluster in the square lattice containing the origin .
If p < p c , then this cluster is almost surely finite .
As the figure below shows , this means that there is almost surely an open cycle in the dual lattice containing the origin in its interior ( shown in green ) .
To summarize , we see that θ ( p ) = 0 for those values of p for which there is almost surely an open cycle in the dual lattice containing the origin in its interior .
We will therefore assume that p = 1/ 2 and show that there is almost surely an open cycle in the dual lattice containing the origin in its interior .
From this it follows that θ ( 1/2 ) = 0 and hence p c ≥ 1/2 .
To do this , we will find the probability that there is an open cycle in the dual lattice contained in an annulus and composed of four separate open paths as shown below .
Breaking the problem down even further , we will look at one of the four sides of this rectangular annulus , a rectangle whose dimensions are 3n by n , and find the probability that there is an open path running horizontally across this rectangle .
We begin , however , by studying a square .
Here is a fundamental observation : Suppose we consider R , a rectangular portion of the square lattice with k by l vertices .
We may also consider R ' , a k - 1 by l + 1 rectangular portion of the dual lattice :
We will show that there is either an open path moving horizontally across R or there is an open vertical path in R ' .
To see this , imagine constructing the figure on the right : there is a hexagon on each vertex in R and R '.
Hexagons corresponding to vertices in R are shaded .
The squares between hexagons correspond to edges , and these are shaded if the corresponding edge is open in R ( and hence closed in R ' ) .
White squares therefore correspond to open edges in R ' .
Since we are interested in horizontal open paths in R , we consider all the edges on the left and right sides to be open .
Similarly , we consider all edges at the top and bottom to be open in R ' .
Imagine that we start at the corner A and walk on the border between the white and gray regions .
This path may only end at B or C since the gray region is always on our right .
If we end at B , we have a horizontal open path across R , and if we end at C , we have a vertical open path across R '. Recall that P p ( H ( R ) ) denotes the probability that there is a horizontal open path across R when edges are open with probability p.
In the same way , P 1 - p ( V ( R ' ) ) is the probability that there is an open vertical path across R '.
Since there is either a horizontal open path across R or an open vertical path across R ' , we must have and so If we consider the case that R is an n + 1 by n rectangle , then R ' is an n by n + 1 rectangle .
We then have P 1/2 ( H( R ) ) = P 1/2 ( V( R ' ) ) = 1/2 .
If instead we take R to be an n by n square S , a horizontal path has a shorter distance to travel so we have Notice that this is independent of n , the size of the square .
Now that we understand the probability of having an open path across a square , we would like to use this understanding to study more general rectangles .
Remember that we would eventually like to understand rectangles of dimension 3n by n .
The following technique is due to Russo , Seymour and Welsh .
Consider the figure to the left , in which we have two squares of sides n and 2n .
Consider the event F 1 described by a configuration of open paths , like the blue and red ones shown below .
We know that the probability of an open vertical path in the smaller square is greater than 1/2 .
In the same way , the probability of having a horizontal path , like the red one , open is greater than 1/2 as well .
The fact that we want the red path to enter the smaller square introduces another factor of 1/2 : Now let F 2 be the event that there is an open path across a 3n by 2n rectangle .
We break this into smaller pieces by considering the rectangle to consist of two squares of dimension 2n by 2n overlapping in an n by 2n rectangle .
Applying our previous result , we have Continuing in this way , we may continue to understand wider rectangles by breaking them into smaller rectangles that overlap in a square .
For instance , the figure to the right illustrates an argument showing that the probability there is an open path across a 2n by n rectangle is greater than 2 - 15 .
With some additional work , we see that the probability that there is an open horizontal path across a 3n by n rectangle is greater than 2 - 25 .
Remember that we are interested in finding an open cycle around the annulus shown below .
Decomposing the annulus into four rectangles whose dimensions are 3n by n , we see that the probability of having an open cycle in the annulus is greater than ( 2 - 25 ) 4 = 2-100 .
That 's a pretty small number , but it 's enough to do the trick .
Again , the important point is that this number does not depend on the size of the annulus .
We now imagine ringing the origin with a set of concentric annuli as shown .
We now know that the probability there is no open cycle in an annulus is smaller than 1 - 2-100 .
Therefore , if we look at k concentric annuli , the probability that there is an open cycle encircling the origin is smaller than ( 1 - 2-100 ) k .
Since 1 - 2-100 < 1 , we see , by allowing k to become arbitrarily large , that the probability that there is no open cycle encircling the origin is smaller than any positive number and hence zero .
Therefore , there is almost surely an open cycle encircling the origin , which means that C 0 is almost surely finite and hence θ ( 1/2 ) = 0 and p c ≥ 1/2 .
This completes the proof of Harris ' Theorem .
To complete the proof of the Harris - Kesten theorem , we also need to prove Kesten 's theorem , which says that p c ≤ 1/ 2 .
We will do this by assuming that p c > 1/2 and arriving at a contradiction .
The argument sketched here is not Kesten 's original proof .
If we assume that p c > 1/2 , then p = 1/2 is below the critical probability .
Recalling Menshikov 's theorem , which we stated earlier , we then have P 1/2 ( S x , n ) ≤ e-an , for some constant a , where S x , n is the event that an open path runs from x to a vertex whose distance from x is n.
Consider an n by n square S. Since there are n vertices on the left side of the square and any horizontal path has length at least n - 1 , we have By choosing n to be very large , we can make the term n e-an as small as we like .
For instance , we may choose n to be so large that n e-an < 1/4 .
The inequality above then says that P 1/2 ( H( S ) ) < 1/4 .
However , this contradicts the fact that P 1/2 ( H( S ) ) ≥ 1/2 .
Therefore , our assumption that 1/2 < p c must be incorrect , which completes the proof of Kesten 's theorem .
Some other results
The early days of mathematical work in percolation focused on finding critical probabilities for various combinatorial graphs .
After a considerable amount of effort , relatively little is known .
Here is a summary .
The scenario we have presented , where edges are declared to be open or closed , is usually known as bond percolation .
Alternatively , we may also consider site percolation , in which the vertices of the graph are declared to be open with probability p.
We then study paths in which every vertex visited is open .
Shown below , for instance , are the vertices in the triangular lattice T and a configuration of open vertices with p = 0.3 .
We may consider replacing the vertices by hexagonal tiles , coloring the open ones , and asking if there is an infinite connected set of colored tiles .
In 1982 , Kesten proved that p c = 1 / 2 for site percolation on the triangular lattice .
For bond percolation on the triangular lattice , Wierman showed in 1981 that p c = 2 sin( π / 18 ) ≈ 0.347 .
It should not be surprising that this critical probability for bond percolation is lower than that for the square lattice since each vertex in the triangular lattice has six edges compared to four in the square lattice .
Since the triangular lattice T is dual to the hexagonal lattice H , it is not surprising that the critical probability for bond percolation on H is p c = 1 - 2 sin( π / 18 ) .
Aside from these results and those for regular graphs , which are similar to the binary tree we looked at earlier , very little is known about the exact values of critical probabilities for other graphs .
Conformal Invariance
As mentioned before , early work in percolation theory concentrated on finding critical probabilities .
Recently , however , theoretical physics has raised interesting questions in some different directions .
It should be clear that the critical probability depends on geometric properties of the graph .
However , there is evidence that certain percolation probabilities remain unchanged under " conformal maps . "
A conformal map of the plane is a function from one region in the plane to another that may distort distances but must preserve angles .
Examples are provided by complex analytic functions such as f( z ) = ez .
Motivated by theoretical physics and numerical experiments , Aizenman and Langlands , Pouliot and Saint - Aubin conjectured that certain " crossing probabilities " were unchanged after the application of a conformal map , as we 'll now explain .
To begin , we will consider a region D in the plane with four marked points P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , and P 4 .
These points divide the boundary of D into four arcs A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , and A 4 .
We will call this data a 4 - marked region and denote it by D 4 .
If L is some lattice in the plane , we may consider the portion inside D and a configuration in which either sites or bonds are open with probability p. By P( D 4 , L , p ) , we mean the probability that there is an open crossing from arc A 1 to A 3 contained inside D . The example P ( H ( R ) ) that we considered earlier is a special case of this construction .
Finally , imagine that the lattice L is scaled by a parameter δ to obtain δ L .
Here are some examples : δ = 0.5 δ = 0.25 Consider what happens as δ → 0 .
Since the distance between the two arcs in δ L grows arbitarily large and , if p < p c , Menshikov 's theorem says that the size of the clusters decays exponentially , we must have P ( D 4 , δ L , p ) → 0 if p < p c .
Conversely , if p > p c , we are guaranteed to have an infinite cluster , and it follows that P ( D 4 , δ L , p ) → 1 .
The interesting question is what happens if p = p c .
Conjecture ( Aizenman and Langland , Pouliot , Saint - Aubin ) : For any " reasonable " lattice L , the limiting probability exists , lies in the open interval ( 0 , 1 ) and is independent of the lattice L. Moreover , if D 4 ' is the result of applying a conformal map to D 4 , then P( D 4 ) = P( D 4 ' ) .
This is a remarkable conjecture for it says that the limiting probability does not depend on the lattice and is unchanged when the region is changed by a conformal map .
In fact , Cardy , motivated by ideas from conformal field theory , proposed an exact formula for the limiting probability .
To understand Cardy 's formula , we note that conformal maps provides a great deal of versatility .
For instance , any two regions D 3 with three marked points are related to one another by a conformal map , a fact that follows from the Riemann mapping theorem .
If we consider a 4 - marked region D 4 and momentarily forget about the fourth point P 4 , there is then a conformal map carrying the region D and the three marked points P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 into the equilateral triangle D ' with vertices P' 1 = ( 1 , 0 ) , P ' 2 = ( 1/2 , /2 ) , and P ' 3 = ( 0 , 0 ) .
Now the fourth point P 4 corresponds to a point P' 4 = ( x , 0 ) as shown below .
Assuming that conformal invariance holds , Cardy 's remarkable formula , interpreted in this way , says that P ( D 4 ) = x .
As yet , conformal invariance and Cardy 's formula have only been rigorously proven for the case of site percolation on the triangular lattice T , a result due to Smirnov in 2001 .
However , there is considerable evidence to suggest that they hold in wide generality .
Power laws and universality Theoretical physics also predicts that a number of properties depend , not on the geometric properties of the graph , but only on its dimension .
For instance , we know that the critical probability for site percolation on the triangular lattice is 1 / 2 .
This says that θ ( p ) = 0 for p < 1/2 . If , however , we ask how θ ( p ) behaves for values of p above 1/2 , physics indicates that the following should hold : θ ( p ) ≈ ( p - 1/2)5/36 for values of p just above 1 / 2 .
We call such an expression a power law .
Besides demonstrating the relatively simple behavior of θ ( p ) in the case of site percolation on the triangular lattice , the conjecture further says that the exponent 5/36 should describe θ ( p ) for percolation on any planar lattice near its critical probability p c .
That is , θ ( p ) ≈ ( p - p c ) 5/36 for any planar lattice .
This is an indication of universality , the hypothesis , based on physical reasoning , that there are critical exponents , such as 5/36 , that depend only on the dimension and not on the details of the particular lattice .
In fact , it has been mathematically verified , by Lawler , Schramm , and Werner , that , for site percolation on the triangular lattice , θ ( p ) has this form .
At present , however , we are not able to say that this result holds more generally .
Other , similar results hold as well .
If we consider χ( p ) , the average number of vertices in C 0 when p < p c , physics tells us that it should be true that χ ( p ) ≈ ( p c - p)-43/18 .
Also , suppose that p = p c and consider P( n ≤ |C 0 | < ∞ ) , the probability that the cluster containing the origin contains a finite number of vertices greater than or equal to n .
Physics again predicts that P( n ≤ |C 0 | < ∞ ) ≈ n-5/91 .
Both of these power laws have been proven for site percolation on the triangular lattice by the work of Kesten , Lawler , Schramm , Smirnov , and Werner .
At this time , it appears that theoretical physics , more specifically , conformal field theory and quantum gravity , have a great deal to say about percolation .
One of the challenges before mathematicians is to create a mathematically rigorous theory to support these physical insights by , in particular , verifying conformal invariance for percolation on two - dimensional lattices and the universality of power laws .
Mathematics has traditionally been tightly connected to physics .
It is interesting to see that the link between these two disciplines is still so vital .
The mathematical importance of this field is demonstrated by the fact that Wendelin Werner was awarded mathematics ' highest honor , the Fields Prize , in part for his work in percolation .

May 1 , 2008 A 28 kilometer - long bridge is being planned to link the Middle East and Africa .
The US $ 20 billion bridge will become the longest suspension bridge in the world and tower some 400 meters above the water , with at least three spans of around 2700 m each .
Undoubtedly set to become one of the wonders of the modern world , the project includes plans to build entire cities at each end , linked by a six - lane motorway and a four - track railway .
Adding complexity to the enormous task , the bridge it is to be built in an area of intense seismic activity .
It is anticipated that the Yemen - Djibouti Fixed Link will take some 12 years to complete .
Yemen and Djibouti are divided by the Red Sea 's Bab El - Mandeb Strait , which itself is divided by Perim Island .
The strait east of Perim is only 3.5 km wide and approximately 20 m deep but the western strait is more than 20 km wide and 300 m deep .
International engineering , environmental science and economic consulting group COWI will develop the design and overall requirements for the link for Dubai - based developer Middle East Development LLC , taking into account factors such as its location and the challenges of building in deep water heavily trafficked by shipping to and from the Suez Canal .
COWI 's Head of Major Bridges Henrik Andersen says , " The length and navigational clearance required west of Perim will likely mean at least 10 km of multi-span suspension bridge , with the remainder being approach bridges .
The concrete pylons will have to be supported up to depths of 300 m and at the same time tower 400 m over the water 's surface to support the ultra - long span suspension bridge .
Each pylon will be 700 m .
It will be enormous . "
Andersen told Gizmag , " COWI is carrying out the intial studies of the Yemen - Djibouti project and a bridge of this unprecendented magnitude will require many studies over the next years , including such things as ship collision , seismic aspects and aerodynamics .
COWI has previously conducted similar studies and design for other major suspension bridges in areas of high seismicity including the Messina bridge in Italy . "
Project manager Lars Jensen has wide experience in suspension bridge design and also with the design of concrete offshore oil platforms .
" Oil rigs often stand in deep water .
The difference here is the weight above the water the pylons will have to bear .
A rig is light compared to a suspension bridge .
The pylons will have to be exceptionally strong . "
AFP ’s story on the proposed bridge has more details .

WASHINGTON , Oct. 8 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve said it extended American International Group 's line of credit by another $ 37 billion Wednesday .
The Wall Street Journal reported AIG has already drawn down $ 61 billion of the $ 85 billion line of credit the Fed extended to the company on Sept. 17 .

The new program brings the AIG bailout total to $ 122.8 billion .
The Fed statement said the extended credit " will allow AIG to replenish liquidity used in settling those transactions , while providing enhanced credit protection to the New York Fed and U.S. taxpayers in the form of a security interest in these securities . "
The oldest human to have his complete mitonchondrial ( mtDNA ) genome sequenced , a 5,000 - year - old " Iceman " mummy known as Ö tzi , does not appear to have any living relatives in Europe .
The new genetic analysis reveals that Ö tzi belonged to a previously unknown branch of human evolution .
Said study coauthor Franco Rollo :
" Apparently , this genetic group is no longer present ....
We do n't know whether it is extinct or it has become extremely rare " [ HealthDay News ] .
The researchers extracted DNA from Iceman 's rectum .
They analyzed the genome of the cells ' energy - making structures , called mitochondria .
" You only get mitochondrial DNA from your mother , and she gets it from her mother and so on , so it forms an unbroken link all the way back to the common maternal ancestor of all of us , " said researcher Martin Richards [ LiveScience ] .
Earlier studies of fragments of
Ö tzi's mtDNA had indicated that he was of the K1 lineage , which is further divided into three branches .
But after comparing his complete mtDNA genome with that of 115 modern Europeans of K1 lineage , the researchers found three mutations that place Ö tzi in a fourth , previously unknown , branch of K1 .
It 's unclear what happened to this fourth branch of the K1 lineage between Ö tzi's time and ours .
Ötzi ’s ancient genetic comrades may have gotten swamped by other mitochondrial DNA lines as people congregated in increasingly larger settlements , the scientists suggest .
Random changes in the mitochondrial DNA of Ötzi ’s peers may have contributed to the absence of a match as well [ Science News ] .
said evolutionary biologist Eske Willerslev .
Nevertheless , the new genetic study contributes to our already extensive knowledge of Ö tzi's life and death .
Scientists believe he lived 5,350 to 5,150 years ago as a hunter - gather and died
And some scientists are skeptical of the new findings , reported in Current Biology [ subscription required ] .
“ Because the Rollo team used intestinal material from the mummy , it is difficult to exclude the possibility that their unique mitochondrial DNA lineage is a result of contaminant DNA mixing in with Ötzi ’s own genetic sequences , ” [ Science News ]

In 2003 , researchers reported that the mummy also appeared to have suffered from heart disease , arthritis , degenerative disc disease and a bit of frostbite [ HealthDay News ] .

Israeli media said that three people were also hurt in the clashes on Saturday night , despite reinforced police guard that barricaded a section of the city after nightfall to contain stone - throwing clashes protests , closing it to traffic .
Trouble started in Acre after dark on Wednesday at the start of the Yom Kippur , the holiest day for Jews , when youths attacked an Arab man who drove into a mostly Jewish district to a relative ’s home , disturbing the start of 24 hours during which many Jews fast and abstain from driving .
As word spread from mosque loudspeakers of Jewish youths stoning the car , Arab crowds responded angrily , causing widespread damage to cars and shops in a main city street .
There have been no serious injuries in the violence , but at least 11 Arab homes have been torched since the riots began , officials said .
Many shops and restaurants in the old town , a popular tourist destination , were either closed or bereft of any business on Saturday .
Hebrew - language flyers were circulated calling for a boycott of Arab businesses .
Abbas Zakour , an Israeli Arab lawmaker from Acre , said he was trying to mediate a truce under which representatives of Arab residents would condemn the driver involved in the Yom Kippur incident .
“ Despite our differences we thought we could never reach such circumstances in Acre , ” Zakour told Israel Radio of the town , where 46,000 Arabs and Jews live side - by - side and violence has been rare .
“ These have been a few difficult days for Jews and Arabs , ” Zakour said .
“ We should sit down together .
I hope we succeed . ”
Sami Hawary , an Arab resident who heads a group that promotes cooperation between Arabs and Jews , told Reuters : “ The tension is very high here , things are on a knife - edge . ”
Relations between Israel ’s Jewish and Arab citizens have been sometimes tense , due in part to Israel ’s conflict with Palestinians , 60 years after the Jewish state ’s establishment in what was then Palestine .
Israeli and Palestinian leaders have agreed in principle on a two - state solution in which the 4 million Arabs of the West Bank and Gaza , many descended from those displaced in the 1948 war , would eventually have a state .
Arabs comprise about a fifth of Israel ’s population .
Israeli prime minister - designate Tzipi Livni visited Acre on Friday and urged a return to calm .
An escalation of the violence could hamper Livni ’s already tough job to form a new coalition government after the resignation of premier Ehud Olmert .

New - home sales in the west and south defied a predicted overall - sales drop
New homes in the US changed hands at their lowest price in four years during September , official figures showed .
The median price of a new single - family home was $ 218,400 ( £ 141,870 ) according to the US Commerce department .
Sales were up 2.7 % on the previous month , beating economists ' predictions , although total sales for the month were 33 % below last year 's figures .
The boost follows news of the biggest monthly gain in five years for existing US homes sales in September .
Foreclosures
The median price of a new home in September was 9 % less than it would have cost last year - and at its lowest level since September 2004 - when house prices were rising rapidly during a five - year housing boom .
The unexpected rise in new home sales followed a 12.6 % drop in month - on - month sales in August , after a 3.6 % rise in July .
September 's sales were actually down 21.4 % in the north - east of the US , and 5.8 % in the Midwest .
But the overall rise was fuelled by a 22.7 % rise in sales in the west and a 0.7 % rise in the south .
Meanwhile , the number of unsold new homes , which stood at 394,000 at the end of September , remains near historic highs , bolstered by a large number of US home foreclosures adding more properties to the market .
Not wanting to soil my own clothes , I will start this scheme at a thrift store .
I ’ll put on a white collared shirt , tie , jacket and walk out .
A man in a suit never draws suspicion , even when he ’s stealing the suit .
Then I visit the local grocery store or Super Wal - Mart with a small pocket - knife .
I grab a handheld basket upon entering and fill it up with enough stuff that I could n’t fit a bottle of bleach in it .
Next stop , the bleach aisle , where I ’ll make a small horizontal cut along the bottle 1 - 2 inches below the cap .
The incision looks like a sloppy clerk used a box cutter to open the case the bleach came in .
Note to grocery store employees : never use a box cutter when dealing with bleach !
Since my basket is full , I have to hold the bottle against my body with my free arm .
I make sure the cut is facing inward and apply enough pressure to make sure the bottle leaks all over my coat .
When I go to the check out I do n’t need to say anything when I get to the register .
The cashier will go into hysterics and say something to the effect of , “ oh my god , look at your suit ! ” I can also leave it to her to determine that my leaking bleach bottle is the culprit .
I just look shocked and confused as I try to wipe it off .
Now I can try to stiff arm the manager out of giving me cash on the scene , but I ’ll be lucky to get more than a few hundred dollars .
Rather than yell and scream , I just tell the store manager I have an interview in an hour and have to get home to change ASAP .
The manager will fill out an incident report and tell me who to follow up with .
A few weeks later , I ’ll collect $ 5,000 for a suit I bought and returned the following day after copying the receipt .
If you know of any easier ways to fund a trip to Europe , I ’m all ears .
Sitting idle , the Taser Shockwave looks like a waist - high rack of square green teeth .
But press a button , and those teeth - - six electrified cartridges tethered by 25 - foot wires -- shoot out in a 20 - degree arc .
Inch - long probes emitting 50,000 volts of electricity pierce through clothing and skin .
If a human being is in their path , his or her muscles immediately flex and lock involuntarily .
Use Shockwave defensively to create a perimeter around rioters , as police demonstrated in a training exercise on California 's Treasure Island earlier this month , and a mob of unruly individuals can be corralled into a corner .
Or fire the device into a crowd , and several targets go down in a temporarily paralyzed heap .
Shockwave , set to be deployed sometime in 2009 , is one of several powerful new " less- lethal " devices coming closer to being used in the real world , as opposed to just test situations .
And it's not the only experimental toy soon to be sold by Phoenix - based Taser International .
Other products being tested by the company include a taser shell that can be fired from any shotgun and a taser laminate film that can electrify the surface of a traditional riot shield .
From Taser 's perspective , these science - fiction - like weapons are new and more effective ways to control dangerous situations without using deadly force .
But in the eyes of the company 's critics , Taser is expanding the scope of a controversial technology that has yet to be proven safe .
Taser 's Extended - Range Electronic Projectile ( XREP ) , for instance , is the first electrically incapacitating weapon that can be fired from a gun .
Unlike Taser 's older products , which shoot an electrically charged cartridge tethered by a 25 - foot wire , the XREP is designed to be loaded into a normal firearm .
After it 's fired from the gun 's barrel , small fins extend that cause the cartridge to spin like a rifle round and fly accurately up to 100 feet .
When the XREP shell hits someone , short probes pierce his or her skin or clothing .
A metal barb attached by a wire falls out from the back of the capsule to create another point of contact on the target 's body , unleashing an electrical current through the body 's muscles and causing them to spasm .
If the target grabs at the XREP round and touches the wire , it routes another jolt of current through the clutching hand .
Violent as the new devices may sound , Taser argues that the XREP and Shockwave both hold the promise of defusing a wider range of dangerous situations than ever before without resorting to lethal force or putting police in dangerous situations .
" Police officers are paid to enforce the law , not to get hurt , " says Taser spokesman Steve Tuttle .
" Police need this .
That 's why we 've survived the controversy around our products . "
But Dalia Hashad , director of human rights for Amnesty International in the U.S. , calls the weapons " something out of a bad video game . "
She argues that the Shockwave and XREP are unproven technologies that could be used indiscriminately .
Since U.S. police first began using tasers in 2000 , 350 people have died in police custody after being stunned by the devices , according to Amnesty International 's count .
In 40 of those cases , tasers were listed by the coroner as a possible cause of death , Hashad says , and in many cases , the victim was elderly , under the influence of drugs or mentally ill .

Those kinds of victims are the most likely to suffer injuries from being stunned , she adds .
And trying to discern when a taser should be used appropriately becomes complicated when a taser 's range is extended or the Shockwave is fired at multiple targets .
" There 's no individual assessment , " Hashad says .
" We 're asking police to consider whether someone they 're about to ' tase ' is an appropriate candidate given all the risks .
How can they do that for six people at once ? "
She adds that the XREP 's default setting delivers a 20 - second shock , compared with the five - second shock of a traditional taser .
That kind of prolonged incapacitation , she argues , is typically the most likely to lead to injuries or deaths .
" It raises very significant questions about how the length of the shock time affects the human body , " she says .
Taser recently suffered a public - relations blow when a jury found the company partially liable for the death of 40 - year - old Robert Heston , a Salinas , Calif. , resident who suffered a heart attack and died after being tased three times .
The company was ordered to pay $ 6.2 million to Heston 's family .
That case was the only lawsuit that Taser has lost of the 75 suits brought against the company , though others have been settled out of court .
Taser spokesman
Tuttle flatly denies that anyone has ever died from being tased .
Heston , he points out , was under the influence of methamphetamines , and the jury determined that Taser was only partially responsible for his death .
Tuttle also argues that the coroner reports Amnesty International refers to only imply that a taser " was n't ruled out " as a cause of death .
In fact , Tuttle says that the taser 's electrical current is as painful as static shock from a door knob .
" It does n't hurt , " says Tuttle , who 's been tased himself several times .
" Do n't get me wrong , it 's uncomfortable .
It kind of feels like hitting your funny bone 18 times per second throughout your whole body . "
And the question of whether devices like XREP and Shockwave will mean tasers are used less discriminately ?
" No one conducts a field interview before applying a taser , " Tuttle says .
" The situation must meet police - department requirements and use - of - force guidelines , or it's a civil rights violation .
That 's how it 's always been deployed against suspects in dangerous situations . "
Taser International , of course , is n't the only one developing new , controversial less - lethal weapons .
The military 's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program ( JNLWP ) is testing a variety of new ways to stun and incapacitate enemy combatants including " flash - bang " grenades that create noise and light to disorient targets , as well as a two - foot diameter laser that can temporarily blind a vehicle 's driver at around 600 feet .
The so - called Active Denial System , a heat ray that can make targets feel as if their skin is catching fire without actually inflicting damage , is also under development .
But even the military , which has used traditional tasers in the field since 2004 , has doubts about Taser International 's new toys .
" We 're doing a lot of testing to make sure they do n't kill people , " says John Keenan , the JNLWP 's director of science and technology .
" We have to understand the health effects associated with them .
If we 're calling something a non-lethal weapon , we have to make sure it 's not lethal . "

Palin's ' Trooper - gate ' Cover - up Ripping a page from George W. Bush ’s playbook on obstructing investigations , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and her senior aides are maneuvering to thwart an abuse - of - power investigation that Palin initially vowed to assist .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly Now , rather than cooperate with an independent counsel assigned to examine whether Palin fired the state ’s public safety commission because he refused to fire her ex-brother - in - law from the state troopers , Palin , her husband and seven witnesses close to Palin are resisting giving testimony .
Moreover , on Tuesday , just one day before giving her widely acclaimed speech to the Republican National Convention , Palin took the unusual step of filing an ethics complaint against herself – to move the investigation to the state personnel board whose three members are appointed by the governor .
Palin ’s decision to , in effect , turn herself in so she could get a hearing before more sympathetic investigators was known by the U.S. news media before Palin ’s speech , but was rarely , if ever , mentioned by TV pundits filling hours of air time with chatter about her charisma , her moose hunting and her 17 - year - old daughter ’s pregnancy .
Back in Alaska , state Republicans also took on the role played by congressional Republicans in Washington , attacking the fairness of any investigation that might put a GOP leader in a negative light .
John Coghill , a Republican state legislator from North Pole , Alaska , demanded that Democratic Sen. Hollis French , who has been overseeing the probe , resign because French suggested that Palin ’s alleged abuse of power could lead to her impeachment .
“ These statements cause me to think that the report is already written even though the investigation is only just begun and the most important witnesses have not even been interviewed , ” Coghill said in a letter .
[ NYT , Sept. 6 , 2008 ]
However , Palin and her administration appear determined to make sure that those witnesses do n’t get interviewed , at least not in a way that might cause political embarrassment before the November elections .
State legislators have set a goal of issuing a report by Oct. 10 on Palin ’s firing of state public safety commissioner Walt Monegan , but it now appears that the legislature will have to issue subpoenas to compel the testimony of the seven witnesses , including Palin ’s top aide , her personnel director and the commissioner for administration .
A subpoena battle could eat up time both in getting approval from Republican legislators and in overcoming objections from lawyers for the witnesses .
Balking at Depositions Palin and her husband , Todd , also are balking at giving depositions to independent counsel Steve Branchflower , who was picked by the legislature to investigate whether Monegan ’s firing was retaliation for his refusal to fire trooper Mike Wooten , who has been embroiled in a bitter divorce / custody battle with Palin ’s sister for several years .
Palin ’s lawyer , Thomas Van Flein , indicated that Sarah and Todd Palin would likely rebuff any request by Branchflower for a deposition and insist that the investigation only be handled by the state personnel board .
Palin ’s legal team also appeared to be following another favorite tactic of the Bush administration – putting the investigator on the defensive by lodging complaints against him for supposed wrongdoing .
Attorney Van Flein complained that independent counsel Branchflower had sought to reach Todd Palin directly “ on a secure and confidential line , ” which Van Flein called “ a serious security breach that we may be obligated to report to the Secret Service . ”
[ Anchorage Daily News , Sept. 3 , 2008 ]
Palin ’s recent attempts to frustrate the legislative investigation reverse her assurances in late July that she was “ happy to comply , to cooperate . ”
After her surprise selection as John McCain ’s running mate , she began traveling with the national Republican crowd , which has many years of experience in fending off legislative oversight of controversial actions by the Bush administration .
For instance , Bush has made broad executive privilege claims to block testimony from his subordinates about a White House drive to politicize the Justice Department , including the firing of nine federal prosecutors who were not considered “ loyal Bushies . ”
The case of Palin ’s firing of public safety commissioner Monegan is somewhat different because the allegations are that the governor was abusing her power to carry out a personal -- rather than a political -- vendetta , but many of the tactics for thwarting an investigation would be similar .
Family Vendetta
When Palin was sworn in as Alaska ’s governor in December 2006 , she was enmeshed in a messy family feud with her sister ’s ex-husband , trooper Wooten .
Through complaints to his superiors , Palin already had helped engineer Wooten ’s five - day suspension from the state police earlier in 2006 for various examples of personal misconduct .
In January 2007 , a month into Palin ’s term , her husband , Todd , invited Palin ’s new public safety commissioner Monegan to the governor ’s office , where Todd Palin urged Monegan to reopen the Wooten case .
After checking on it , Monegan informed Todd Palin that he could n’t do anything because the case was closed .
In an interview with the Washington Post , Monegan said that a few days later , the governor also called him about the Wooten matter and he gave her the same answer .
Monegan said Gov. Palin brought the issue up again in a February 2007 meeting at the state capitol , prompting a warning that she should back off .
However , Monegan said Gov. Palin kept bringing the issue up indirectly through e-mails , such as comparing another bad trooper to “ my former brother - in - law , or that trooper I used to be related to .
” Monegan said he also began getting telephone calls from Palin ’s aides about trooper Wooten , including from then - chief of staff Mike Tibbles ; Commissioner Annette Kreitzer of the Department of Administration ; and Attorney General Talis Colberg .
Colberg acknowledged making the call , after an inquiry from Todd Palin about “ the process ” for handling a threatening trooper , and then relaying back the response from Monegan that the issue had been handled and nothing more could be done .
Monegan also told the Post that he warned each caller about the risk of exposing the state to legal liability if Wooten filed a lawsuit .
However , Todd Palin continued collecting evidence against Wooten and lobbying for his dismissal .
The governor ’s husband acknowledged giving Wooten ’s boss , Col. Audie Holloway , photos of Wooten driving a snowmobile while he was out of work on a worker ’s compensation claim .
Alaska ’s Deputy Attorney General Michael Barnhill told the Post that a member of the governor ’s staff , personnel director Diane Kiesel , also made at least one call to Col .
Holloway about the snowmobile incident .
[ Washington Post , Aug. 31 , 2008 ]
On July 11 , 2008 , Palin abruptly fired Monegan , saying only that she wanted to take the public safety department in a different direction .
Monegan then went public with his account of the mounting campaign against Wooten from the governor ’s family and staff .
Monegan told the Anchorage Daily News that Todd Palin showed him the work of a private investigator , who had been hired by the family to dig into Wooten ’s life and who was accusing the trooper of various misdeeds , such as drunk driving and child abuse .
Though Palin insisted she was n’t involved in the pressure campaign , a review by the Attorney General ’s office found that half a dozen state officials had made about two dozen phone calls regarding Wooten .
A tape recording of one conversation – between Palin ’s chief of boards and commissions Frank Bailey and police Lt. Rodney Dial in February 2008 – revealed Bailey saying , “ Todd and Sarah are scratching their heads , ‘ Why on earth … is this guy still representing the department ? ’ ”
Facing mounting evidence of improprieties , Palin now appears determined to sidetrack the investigation , much as President Bush has delayed and obstructed probes into his alleged wrongdoing for seven years .
Gov. Palin has a well - worn GOP playbook to draw from .

" Everybody in the PR business wants to get out of San Francisco , " she told me .
" None of these Web 2.0 companies are actually making money .
This bubble 's about to burst . "
That bit of cocktail chatter is from a few weeks ago , at one of the trillion - and - one tech mixers that happen in San Francisco during the conference season ( which , as near as I can tell , is year - round ) .
She was a PR person for a major software company , and in the course of our conversation she volunteered , entirely without my prompting , that the mood in the Valley was incredibly grim .
Now , I have no idea what PR people know about anything apart from PR , but my immediate temptation was to imagine that this whispered flight of the PR flacks could be some kind of secret Valley omen , sort of like the way that wild animals can magically sense an oncoming tsunami , so they rush to high ground while the humans stand around wondering why the animals are acting funny .
I 'm apocalyptic that way , and I tend to think we 're all up a creek and the Asian banks are holding the paddle .
But I 've learned in my short time here that I 'm relatively alone in my gloomy disposition , and that people in the Valley are indefatigably sunny , especially when it comes to asset valuations .
So when things further deteriorated late last month , and various Valley luminaries began flogging the " we 're going to be ok ... we live in a bubble over here on the West coast " line to news outlets and bloggers , I was inclined to believe that they believed it .
And what do I know — I just moved here .
Maybe this place really is a bubble in the " boy in the bubble " sense , and not in the " dot - com bubble " sense .
But I doubt it , and the darker part of me ( the part that still lives in Boston ) suspected that maybe they doubted it too .
Could it be that these guys have their assistants out stockpiling arugula and shotguns , while they lie through their smiling teeth to worried reporters like Om Malik ?
It was in this conflicted frame of mind that I viewed the the leaked slides and notes from the now - infamous " RIP : Good Times " presentation that VC stalwart Sequoia Capital , which they gave to their portfolio CEOs this past Wednesday .
In spite of the fact that the presentation contains a pretty hefty dose of pessimism , there 's a part of me that still just does n't believe that it 's possible for the Valley 's VCs to be this sincerely dour .
Are they serious ?
The presentation starts out solidly enough , and it contains a great recap of how we got into this present mess .
But the last part is just completely over - the - top in a " scared straight " sense , like when that cop came to my junior high gym class and told us about how cocaine use can rot out the cartilage in your nose to the point where you can pass a rag from one nostril to the other .
( Cops really knew how to scare kids then , because even the juvie - bound among us thought that this rag - through - the - nose story was the Grossest Thing Ever .
But I digress . )
So how bad is it , according to Sequoia 's slide show ?
Well , if the latter half of the presentation is any indication — especially the slide of the Time Magazine cover featuring a Depression - era soup line — they 'd like their CEOs to think that Wall St. has just released Depression 2.0b12 , and that the gold master could drop any week now .
The slide after the soup kitchen one shows the dreaded , Japan - in - the - 90s - style " L " - shaped curve .
The " L " curve is the one where stock prices drop precipitously and then stay low for a long period of time , as opposed to the hope - for " U " - shaped curve , which has prices dipping and then recovering almost as quickly .
So the " L " curve is scary for people with money to spend , but even worse is one of the later slides , the " Death Spiral , " which features a skull in the center of a vortex .
Foul and formless Azathoth , in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity .
I imagine that the Death Spiral slide is the moment where the assembled audience is supposed to truly grok the gravity of the present situation , and to understand that they really must do that thing which they most dread : become profitable ( or else ) .
I 've no doubt that the assembled crowed responded to the threat of mandatory profitability the way that my adolescent classmates responded to the cop 's rag - through - the - nose story — i.e. , by looking at Sequoia 's Doug Leone and thinking to themselves with horror , " I wonder if he 's actually seen people do that ... that profitability thing . "
A recipe for non-disaster
As a route to profitability , Sequoia urges its CEOs to aggressively pursue a range of novel and exotic measures , like , y'know , not wasting money on things that do n't work , and actually having a real revenue stream that involves selling a " must - have product " to customers who have the " ability to pay . "
Seriously .
You could entitle the presentation , " How to do business in a world where rich backers are not just shoveling money at you , " because that 's essentially what it is .
Reading through the presentation , I feel like some prudish southerner who showed up at the hippie nudist beach unawares , and then got a sudden , hairy eyeful when the tide went out and left everyone standing there naked .
And now they 're all looking at me like , " you 're not from here , are you ? "
( Metaphor stolen shamelessly from Warren Buffet [ PDF ] . )
So yes , it is true , apparently people here were really not doing most of this stuff .
And yes , it 's also true that they 're really going to have to start .
I 've heard from more than once person who 's trying to raise VC in the present environment that the spigot is indeed shut off , and many VC firms ' partners ( i.e. , the rich guys with cash to give out ) have let it be known that anyone who wants fresh money to blow should look elsewhere for the next few months .
Those with money are keeping it on the sidelines while they wait to see if the rest of the mad , prophetic rantings [ PDF ] of Nouriel Roubini actually come to pass .
As for the PR woman that I quoted at the outset of this article , yeah , maybe her friends are smart to start looking for someplace cheaper to live , given the Sequoia slides that advocate cutting way back on any sales and marketing efforts that can't measurably deliver .
Or maybe all of those folks should just wait another week or two for San Francisco real estate to go into free fall , and then they 'll be able to afford this place again on their freshly cut base salaries .
Oh , I know that such a thing can't possibly happen here — since moving to the region I 've heard the bit about Bay Area house prices never - ever - ever going down almost as many times as I 've heard the Mark Twain quote about summer in San Francisco .
In fact , I 'm sure there was a whole team at Lehman whose job it was to keep a master list of Asset Prices that Can't Possibly Fall , and " real estate , San Francisco " was probably right after " real estate , Manhattan . "
At the end of the day , I still do n't know if the Sequoia VCs believe all of their " this is not your father 's market crash ; it 's your grandfather 's " straight talk , but then again , I 'm not sure it really matters what they believe .
What matters is that the dominoes are still falling , and nobody really knows what kind of world we 'll be living in when they 've settled .
But on the off chance that the Sequoia folks are ( accidentally ) right , I 've got a few boxes of MREs and a giant plasma screen TV , so as long as the Internet still works and the Playstation Store stays online , I 'll be ready for anything .

Intel 's IDF is currently underway , and of course is bringing hints and reports of a lot of new hardware and technology on the way from the silicon giant .
Some particularly interesting news to enthusiasts and overclockers has come from the Core i7 processors , which have a variety of features that seem specific to people intent on tweaking their systems .
To start off with , the CPU wo n't be hindered by a forced voltage limitation , on top of no longer having CPU voltage directly linked to memory voltage .
This means that future Intel boards wo n't be limited in what memory they can use solely based on system voltage .
The good news has n't stopped there – the Core i7 is potentially going to have an unlocked memory multiplier , letting you change memory frequency on the fly , something any decent enthusiast board must have .
Other good news includes a reconfigurable Turbo Boost , at least on certain models .
When I first started coding in Python , I did n't know what I was doing .
So I structured my Python programs the way I would write Bourne shell scripts or Perl programs , writing functions as necessary and useful but otherwise putting all of the logic and code in the program 's file outside of functions ( in what I now call ' module scope ' ) .
This is a perfectly rational structure for Python programs , and even works ; my programs ran fine and were perfectly functional .
But it was also a bad mistake , as I slowly discovered later ; what you really want to do is put all of your code in functions ( and then start one with magic ) .
The problem that makes it a mistake is that a program written this way cannot be import ed as if it was just another Python module ; if you try , the program 's code immediately starts running and explosive things start happening .
There are at least two reasons why this is unfortunate :
various useful tools like pychecker rely on import ing your code in order to pick through it .
This is arguably a mistake on pychecker 's part and they should be using a more robust mechanism , but it 's how they work right now , so if you want to use them ( and pychecker is usually quite useful ) you have to live with it .
( Discovering pychecker and trying to use it on my programs was how I began to realize the mistake I 'd made . )
ing your code in order to pick through it .
This is arguably a mistake on pychecker 's part and they should be using a more robust mechanism , but it 's how they work right now , so if you want to use them ( and pychecker is usually quite useful ) you have to live with it .
being able to import your main program gives you a handy method of testing bits of it from an interactive interpreter .
To make this really work you need to code your program so that it calls sys.exit ( ) as little as possible .
If a function runs into a fatal error it should not do the usual ' call die ( ) with an error message ' thing ; instead , it should raise an exception .
Only the very top of the program should catch those exceptions and wind up calling sys.exit ( ) .
( And if you do n't like phase tracking , catching and wrapping exceptions can give you a nice method to add context to the error message that you 'll wind up reporting . )
I 'm sure that this is strongly suggested somewhere in the Python documentation and the smart people were aware of it from the start , but I missed it ( to my regret with those early programs ) .
Oh yes , the magic you need to make your top level function start running when your program is actually run ( instead of being import ed ) is :
if __name__ == " __main__ " : ... run code here ...
At the module scope , __name__ is normally the name of your module ( well , the name it is being imported by ) .
When Python is running your code because it has been directly handed to the interpreter , Python sets the name to " __main__ " instead .
Sidebar : my current program structure
The program structure that I have wound up adopting for my own programs looks something like this :
import sys def process ( ... ) : ..... def main ( args ) : ..... try : process (...) except EnvironmentError , e : die ( " OS problem : " + str(e ) ) except MyError , e : die ( str( e ) ) .... if __name__ == " __main__ " : main ( sys.argv [ 1 : ] )
Welcome to the British Lawnmower Museum
Enter the fascinating world of this internationally famous Museum and have a unique experience , it marks the culmination of a dream by Ex-Racing champion Brian Radam .
His interest in this type of equipment stems from early involvement in the family business started in 1945 which has developed into Lawnmowerworld , catering for all aspects of sales , spares and service .
The Museum retains a character not often seen in these modern times .
The Museum has now become one of the Worlds leading authorities on vintage lawnmowers and are now specialists in antique garden machinery , supplying parts , archive conservation of manuscript materials and valuing machines from all over the world .
See ' Lawnmowers of the Rich and Famous ' including Prince Charles and Princess Diana , Brian May , Nicholas Parsons , Eric Morcambe , Hilda Ogden , Alan Titchmarsh and many more .
The lawnmower was patented by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830 .
He was working in a textile mill in Stroud , Gloucester , where he designed a machine originally to trim the knap off the cloth , destined for Guardsmen 's uniforms .
His revolutionary idea was to use it to cut grass !!.
At the time people thought he was a lunatic and a madman to invent such a contraption , so he had to test the machine at night so no one could see him .
Why not book a guided tour and learn more of the extraordinary history of the garden machine industry .
Included in this Unique National collection are manufacturers not normally associated with the garden industry , names such as Rolls Royce , Royal Enfield , Vincent , Dennis , Hawker Sidley , Perkins Diesel , British Leyland , Fraser Nash and many more .
Most of the exhibit 's technical and industrial artefacts are from the Victorian and Edwardian era .
The restored exhibits are devoted to keeping a small part of British engineering Heritage alive .
BRITISH AT ITS BEST over the last 200 years .
The international space station is about to get all the comforts of a modern , high - end , " green " home : a fancy recycling water filter , a new fridge , extra bedrooms , workout equipment and the essential half - bath .
Later this week , space shuttle Endeavour 's seven astronauts will carry up all the frills for more luxurious space station living - and a larger household .
Liftoff is set for Friday night , US time .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It will be a home makeover in the extreme .
The space station will go from a three - bedroom , one - bath house with kitchenette to a five - bedroom , two - bath house with two kitchenettes and the latest gizmos Nasa has to offer .
To be more precise , astronauts will be installing an extra toilet , more sleeping compartments with individual thermostats and laptop hookups , and an exercise machine capable of some 30 routines .
They also will be delivering the essentials of Nasa 's first attempt at a closed - loop environmental system in orbit , where almost everything gets recycled .
Already , the power on the space station is generated from solar panels .
Most significant is the water recovery system - it will turn urine and condensation into fresh drinking water .
The system is essential if Nasa is to increase the size of the space station crew from three to six .
That switch is supposed to occur by the middle of next year .
Endeavour 's commander , Christopher Ferguson , considers the water system the single most important piece of equipment that he 's delivering .
He said the benefits go way beyond the space station - think of all the deep - space exploration made possible once crews are freed of lugging water .
" This is really it , and it has no parallel .
I would challenge you to find any other system on the Earth that recycles urine into drinkable water .
It 's such a repulsive concept that nobody would even broach it . "
" But that day will come on this planet , too , where we 're going to need to have these technologies in place , and this is just a great way to get started . "
Would he drink the stuff ?
" Are you crazy ?
I would never try that , " Ferguson joked .
" No , actually , you know what ?
If they offered me a sample , I would do it . "
Astronaut Donald Pettit , a former space station resident who will help hook up the system , looks at it as one big coffee machine .
" It 's going to take yesterday 's coffee and make it into today 's coffee , " Pettit said .
Hot coffee is no problem in orbit , it 's the cold drinks that are scarce .
The existing space station galley provides hot or warm water - but not cold .
The same with food - hot or warm , but nothing cold .
Fresh food like apples or onions that go up on Russian supply ships or Nasa 's shuttles has to be gobbled up quickly .
The lone refrigerator is restricted to science experiments .
So the astronauts are quite excited about getting a second refrigerator with the new kitchenette .
It will keep drinks cold and food fresh .
" It seems kind of trivial , but six months of lukewarm orange juice can kind of bum you out , " said astronaut Sandra Magnus , who will fly up on Endeavour and move in for 3 months .
Nasa does not expect to get the water generation system up and running before spring .
That 's how long it will take to check everything and make sure the recycled water is safe to drink .
Until then , the space station crew will continue to use water delivered by the shuttle and unmanned Russian supply ships .
Before Endeavour leaves , urine already collected by space station residents will be flushed through the system and undergo distillation , so recycled water samples can be returned to Earth for analysis .
Additional samples will be brought back by another shuttle in February to make absolutely certain the system is working properly .
If everything goes well , the space station will open its doors to six full - time residents next May or June .
The jump in crew size is especially important for the Canadian , European and Japanese astronauts who have been waiting years to live aboard the space station .
" Imagine for a moment that we have an international space station in orbit that we 've invested in and we do n't have any US crews on board .
That 's what the partners live with today , " said Mike Suffredini , Nasa 's space station program manager .
Besides providing patriotic public relations , the larger , more diverse crew will boost the amount time spent on scientific research from 10 hours a week - the average now - to 35 hours a week , Suffredini said .
Most of the crew 's time is now devoted to upkeep , and the maintenance chores will grow as the 10 - year - old space station ages , he noted .
While fixing up the inside of the space station , Endeavour 's astronauts will tackle a greasy , grimy job on the outside .
Three of the crew will take turns cleaning and lubricating a jammed solar - wing rotating joint ; it 's clogged with metal shavings from grinding parts and has n't worked right for more than a year .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The U.S. economy is facing several grim quarters and is unlikely to rebound before 2010 , according to an interview with a senior U.S. Treasury official carried in a weekend Chinese newspaper .
Under Secretary David McCormick , who is due to visit Shanghai this week , told China ’s 21st Century Business Herald that credit conditions had weakened dramatically , dimming growth prospects .
“ At present it is hard to predict how negative the impact will be , but in the next few quarters , the situation will be quite grim , ” McCormick was quoted as saying .
The newspaper translated his remarks into Chinese .
“ We hope that we can finally stabilize the economy in 2009 , and return to a growth trajectory in 2010 , ” he added .
“ But no matter what , doubtless now is a difficult period . ”
A UK Professor Hopes His Genetically Modified Worker Bees Can Help Stop The Colony Collapse Disorder That Is Grossly Effecting the UK Economy
Last week 140,000 protesters from the British Beekeepers Association ( BBKA ) marched on Whitehall demanding $ 8 - million in emergency funding from the Department for Environment to tackle alarming rates of bee decline .
The decline has cost the UK economy about $ 54 - million in the past year alone .
[ social_buttons ]
But British scientist Francis Ratnieks — and the UK ’s only professor of apiculture — is pioneering research that he hopes will assuage the hardship beekeepers have been experiencing with colony collapse disorder .
He hopes to reverse the decline of the honeybee by breeding cleaner bees to protect hives from harmful diseases .
The cleaner bee is a breed of worker bee that will be genetically programmed to keep hives clean .
They will be responsible for removing pupae and larvae from the hives if they are dead or dying .
Currently these cleaner bees only exist in very small numbers .
The hygienic bee was first observed in the 1930s , but at most only 10 - percent of a hive has bees with this gene .
Basically , if more of these bees can be “ created ” then they can protect hives from parasites like the varroa mite : last year the mite killed more than 2 - billion honeybees and wiped out one in three colonies .
This three project is being privately funded by the leading UK honey brand Rowse Honey .
The company has warned Britain that the country could run out of home - produced honey by Christmas .
Aside from just honey , bees pollinate some $ 165 - million worth of crops in the UK annually , as well as flowers and wild plants .
The Bee Farmers ’ Association is supporting the project by helping to test colonies with hygienic queens in 100 hives across Britain , to see if they are also good at making honey .

How to Improve Your Self - Control
• Next article in this series : Self - Control Instantly Replenished by Self - Affirmation • Previous article :
New research suggests self - control can be improved using abstract reasoning .
“ It ’s all right letting yourself go , as long as you can get yourself back . ”
~ Mick Jagger
Temptation comes in many forms , often so potent , so animal , that it seems impossible to resist .
Eating too much , drinking too much , spending too much or letting the heart rule the head .
We get instant messages from deep in the gut that resonate through the mind , trying to dictate our behaviour .
One of humanity ’s most useful skills , without which advanced civilisations would not exist , is being able to engage our higher cognitive functions , our self - control , to resist these temptations .
Psychologists have found that self - control is strongly associated with what we label success : higher self - esteem , better interpersonal skills , better emotional responses and , perhaps surprisingly , few drawbacks at even very high levels of self - control ( Tangney et al. , 2004 ) .
People , being only human , find the constant battle with basic urges is frequently too great and their self - control buckles .
However , recent experimental research by Dr Kentaro Fujita at Ohio State University and colleagues has explored ways of improving self - control , where it comes from and why it sometimes deserts us .
Based on new research , along with studies conducted over the past few decades , Dr Fujita and colleagues have proposed that abstract thinking and psychological distance are particularly important in self - control .
1. Evidence that abstract thinking improves self - control
It never ceases to amaze just how different two people ’s views of exactly the same event can be : one person ’s freedom fighter is another ’s terrorist .
But the way in which we view people or events is n’t just constrained by unchangeable patterns of thought that are set in stone .
Dr Fujita and colleagues explored the idea that simple manipulations of how we construe the world can have a direct effect on self - control .
Their hunch was that thinking from a more abstract , high - level perspective increases self - control .
In their research , published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , Fujita et al. ( 2006 ) used a number of experiments to test the idea that self - control is affected by how we construe or interpret events .
The problem for the researchers was manipulating aspects of people ’s construal without them realising : this required some deception .
In one of Fujita et al. ’s ( 2006 ) studies participants were told they were going to take part in two separate experiments – one on personality and another billed as a student survey .
In fact this was just a cover story as the two pieces of research were designed to work together .
Experimenters used the ‘ student survey ’ as a cover to manipulate levels of construal .
They needed participants to be thinking in either a high - level way ( abstract – seeing the whole forest ) or a low - level way ( concrete – seeing individual trees ) .
They did this by getting participants to think about their level of physical health , but in two different ways :
High - level construal condition : participants were asked to fill in a diagram which encouraged them to think about why they maintain good physical health .
Participants tended to put answer such as : “ To do well in school . ”
This got them thinking about ends rather than means – the ultimate purpose of physical health .
participants were asked to fill in a diagram which encouraged them to think about they maintain good physical health .
Participants tended to put answer such as : “ To do well in school . ”
This got them thinking about ends rather than means – the ultimate purpose of physical health .
Low - level construal condition : in contrast participants in this condition were asked to think about how they maintained their physical health .
Naturally they responded with things like : “ Go exercise ” .
In other words they focused on means rather than ends , the actual process .
Just before this manipulation of construal level , in a study they were misinformed was separate , participants were told their personality was being tested physiologically through holding a handgrip .
This handgrip was designed to be difficult to squeeze together but participants were told to hold on as long as possible .
This provided a baseline measurement of their grip strength .
Just after the manipulation of construal level participants had dummy electrodes attached to their arm and were told that their personality could be measured while they squeezed the stiff handgrip again .
This time , though , they were told that the longer they could squeeze the handgrip the more accurate the information would be .
The question was : how well could participants forget the temporary discomfort of holding the handgrip once they had been told about the desired goal of getting information about their own personalities ?
The results confirmed Fujita et al. ’s ( 2006 ) suspicions .
They showed that participants in the low - construal thinking condition ( thinking about means rather than ends ) held on to the handgrip for , on average , 4.9 seconds less than they had during the baseline measurement .
In contrast those in the high - construal condition held on for 11.1 seconds longer than their baseline measurement .
Whether participants were thinking about means or ends had a really significant effect on how long they squeezed the handgrip .
Those participants who had been encouraged to think in high - level , abstract terms demonstrated greater self - control in enduring the discomfort of the handgrip in order to receive more accurate personality profiles .
Along with this design Fujita et al. ( 2006 ) also carried out other studies using different measures of self - control and different ways of inducing either high - level or low - level construal .
These produced similar findings .
People in the high - level construal condition were consistently :
More likely to avoid the temptation of instant gratification .
Prepared to make a greater investment to learn more about their health status .
Less likely to evaluate temptations like beer and television positively .
2 . How personality and the situation affect self - control
Self - control is not just affected by how we are thinking at a specific moment , that would be too easy .
We have each developed different amounts of self - control .
Some people seem to find it easy to resist temptation while others can be relied on to always yield to self - gratification .
To a certain extent we have to accept our starting point on the self - control sliding scale and do the best we can with it .
Although a few people have very high ( or very low ) levels of self - control , two - thirds of us lie somewhere near the middle : sometimes finding it easy to resist temptation , other times not .
Naturally the exact situation has a huge effect on how much self - control we can exert .
One property of different situations central to self - control that psychologists have examined is ‘ psychological distance ’ .
Research reveals that people find it much easier to make decisions that demonstrate self - control when they are thinking about events that are distant in time , for example how much exercise they will do next week or what they will eat tomorrow ( Fujita , 2008 ) .
Similarly they make much more disciplined decisions on behalf of other people than they do for themselves .
People implicitly follow the maxim : do what I say , not what I do .
It ’s not hard to see the convergence between the idea of ‘ psychological distance ’ and high - level construal .
Both emphasise the idea that the more psychological or conceptual distance we can put between ourselves and the particular decision or event , the more we are able to think about it in an abstract way , and therefore the more self - control we can exert .
It ’s all about developing a special type of objectivity .
3 . How to improve your self - control
Fujita et al. ’s ( 2006 ) studies , along with other similar findings reported by Fujita ( 2008 ) , suggest that self - control can be increased by these related ways of thinking :
Global processing .
This means trying to focus on the wood rather than the trees : seeing the big picture and our specific actions as just one part of a major plan or purpose .
For example , someone trying to eat healthily should focus on the ultimate goal and how each individual decision about what to eat contributes ( or detracts ) from that goal .

For example , someone trying to eat healthily should focus on the ultimate goal and how each individual decision about what to eat contributes ( or detracts ) from that goal .
Abstract reasoning .
This means trying to avoid considering the specific details of the situation at hand in favour of thinking about how actions fit into an overall framework – being philosophical .
Someone trying to add more self - control to their exercise regime might try to think less about the details of the exercise , and instead focus on an abstract vision of the ideal physical self , or how exercise provides a time to re-connect mind and body .

High - level categorisation .
This means thinking about high - level concepts rather than specific instances .
Any long - term project , whether in business , academia or elsewhere can easily get bogged down by focusing too much on the minutiae of everyday processes and forgetting the ultimate goal .
Categorising tasks or project stages conceptually may help an individual or group maintain their focus and achieve greater self - discipline .
These are just some examples of specific instances , but with a little creativity the same principles can be applied to many situations in which self - control is required .
Ultimately these three ways of thinking are different ways of saying much the same thing : avoid thinking locally and specifically and practice thinking globally , objectively and abstractly , and increased self - control should follow .

Enlarge By Khalil Senosi , AP Richard Leakey speaks in Nairobi , Kenya in 2007 .
Leakey warned that the worldwide credit crisis will be " just devastating " to scientific research in coming years , as endowment interest income drops and companies cut donations .
LITTLE ROCK , Arkansas  Famed scientist Richard Leakey warned that the worldwide credit crisis will be " just devastating " to scientific research in coming years , as endowment interest income drops and companies cut donations .
Leakey , who once served on a government economic team in his native Kenya , said much of the support for science comes from wealthy philanthropists , foundations and companies .
All those groups likely will be affected by lowered interest rates and the squeeze of credit not being available to fund their operations , he said .
" With the investment portfolios being hit as hard as they 've been hit in the last few weeks , particularly the last few days , I would have thought there would be a very dramatic reduction in available funds for research in all sorts of countries , " Leakey told reporters Wednesday .
" Unless they bring it under control , I think it 's going to spread .
I think it 's extremely worrying for science . "
Leakey became famous after making a number of fossil discoveries in East Africa .
His team unearthed the bones of the most complete skeleton of a prehistoric human ever found in the desolate , far northern reaches of Kenya in 1984 .
The effect of the credit crisis on science likely will begin to be felt as organizations begin planning their budgets for 2009 , Leakey said .
The paleontologist said donations will be " hugely hit , " affecting what research and exploration can be done next year and into the future .
" This has spread right across the world and there 's quite a lot of science to be supported , " Leakey said .
" I think it is just devastating .
" It 's more worryful for people who are losing their homes , it 's more worryful for people who are losing investments for their children 's futures , but we 're also very worried as scientists , " he said .
Leakey was in Little Rock to speak at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock .
In a new book , Leakey offers a stark warning for the planet , saying global warming could wipe out endangered species living in national parks and refuges throughout the world .
He said the extinction of a few species could destroy food chains supporting many other animals — including humans .
" I think the end of the Ice Age was a quite a massive change and I think this will be ... almost as big of a change in the way we live , " Leakey said .

Google was accused of censoring 2 % of search results in China Microsoft , Google and Yahoo have signed a global code of conduct promising to offer better protection for online free speech and against official intrusion .
The Global Network Initiative follows criticism that companies were assisting governments in countries like China to censor the Internet .
The guidelines seek to limit what data should be shared with authorities , in cases where free speech is an issue .
" This is an important first step , " said Mike Posner of Human Rights First .
He told the BBC " What this is is a recognition by all these tech companies , the human rights groups and social investors that there has to be a collective response to this growing problem .
" Companies need to step up to the plate and be more aggressive in challenging unwarranted government interference , " he said .
The initiative states that privacy is " a human right and guarantor of human dignity , " and the agreement commits the companies to try to resist overly broad demands for restrictions on freedom of speech and the privacy of users .
They will also assess the human rights climate in a country before concluding business deals and make sure their employees and partners follow suit .
" These principles are not going to be a silver bullet , but the most important point for me is to provide transparency , " said Danny O'Brien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" We have joined this initiative because we know that a wide range of groups working together can achieve much more than the company acting alone , " said Andrew McLaughlin , Google 's director of global public policy .
' Valuable roadmap '
The impetus for such an agreement follows years of criticism that a number of businesses , including Google , Yahoo and Microsoft have complicity built what has been dubbed the " Great Firewall of China " .
Skype say they are abiding by Chinese laws over internet use Google has been accused of complying with Chinese government demands to filter internet searches to eliminate query results regarding topics such as democracy or Tiananmen Square .
Microsoft has come under attack for blocking the blog of a prominent Chinese Media researcher who posted articles critical of a management purge at the Beijing News Daily .
Canadian researchers uncovered that a Skype joint venture in China monitored users ' communications .
And a Chinese reporter Shi Tao was jailed for 10 years after Yahoo China provided his personal information to the Chinese government .
Today Yahoo co-founder and CEO Jerry Yang welcomed the new code of conduct .
" These principles provide a valuable roadmap for companies like Yahoo operating in markets where freedom of expression and privacy are unfairly restricted .
Shi Tao 's jailing sparked a controversy of Yahoo business practices in China " Yahoo was founded on the belief that promoting access to information can enrich people 's lives and the principles we unveiled today reflect our determination that our actions match our values around the world , " said Mr Yang .
While China has been painted as the worst abuser , Colin Maclay of the Berkman Centre for Internet and Society at Harvard University said there are other countries and governments all over the world at fault .
" The number of states actively seeking to censor online content and access personal information is growing .
" And the means employed - technical , social , legal , political - are increasingly sophisticated , often placing internet and telecommunications companies in difficult positions . "
' Business case '
The Global Network Initiative was drawn up by the internet companies along with human rights groups , academics and investors .
Adam Kanzer who is the managing director and general counsel at Domini Social Investments said as well as being the right thing to do , it also makes good business sense .
He told BBC News " When you see the industry being caught up in the tactics of various regimes around the world , the business case is very clear .
Freedom of expression and privacy is core to their business .
" They depend on a wide open , freely accessible and secure internet .
That 's what they are about .
If people do n't trust the internet and believe they are secure , then that is counterproductive to their business . "
The plan has yet to receive the support of internet companies in China
The effort is already being seen by some as not going far enough .
" After two years of effort , they have ended up with so little , " said Morton Sklar executive director for the World Organisation for Human Rights USA .
" It is very little more than a broad statement of support for a general principle without any concrete backup mechanism to ensure that the guidelines will be followed . "
Mr Posner of Human Rights
First disputes that and said this agreement has not been set up as a " gotcha system " but as a way " to work with companies to get them to improve what they are doing , credit them when they do it and call them out if they fail . "
While it is hoped many more companies will sign up , two European telecommunications firms , France Telecom and Vodafone , are already said to be considering adding their names .

Interview with Noam Chomsky ' The United States Has Essentially a One - Party System '
The linguist and public intellectual Noam Chomsky has long been a critic of American consumerism and imperialism .
SPIEGEL spoke to him about the current crisis of capitalism , Barack Obama 's rhetoric and the compliance of the intellectual class .
Sam Stein
Huffington Post
September 14 , 2008
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan offered a woeful outlook of America ’s economic situation on Sunday , saying the crisis with the country ’s financial institutions was as dire as he had ever seen in his long career , and predicting that one or more of those institutions would likely collapse in the near future .
" Oh , by far , " Greenspan said , when asked if the situation was the worst he had seen in his career .
" There ’s no question that this is in the process of outstripping anything I ’ve seen and it still is not resolved and still has a way to go and , indeed , it will continue to be a corrosive force until the price of homes in the United States stabilizes .
That will induce a series of events around the globe which will stabilize the system . "
Appearing on ABC’s This Week , Greenspan would not definitively say whether the government should come to the rescue of Lehman Brothers , which has been forced to consider a possible sale after its stock shares plunged drastically this past week .
Instead he called the situation surrounding the investment bank — and the bailout that occurred this past spring of Bear Stearns — as a " once in a half century , probably once in a century type of event . "
The circumstances for Lehman may , as Greenspan noted , be different .
Bloomberg News reported on Friday : " Rising speculation that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. may fail is generating less concern among investors than when Bear Stearns Cos. imploded in March . "
Much of the issue , Greenspan added , was the trouble in the housing market , which he predicted would become stabilized by next year .
Pressed by host George Stephanopoulos as to whether another major financial institution — such as the struggling Washington Mutual , American International Group , or Merrill Lynch — would fail in the interim , the former Fed chair responded in the affirmative .
" I suspect we will [ see one fail ] , " he said , " but in and of itself that does not need to be a problem .
It depends on how it ’s handled and how the liquidations take place .
And , indeed , we should n’t try to protect every single institution .
the ordinary cost of financial change has winners and losers . "
In light of these dynamics , Greenspan noted that the government was left with tough decisions : which institutions are " so fundamental to the functioning " of society that they demanded a federal safety net ?
Earlier in the week , the former fed chairman noted that such choses extended to tax policy as well .
In an interview with Bloomberg Television , Greenspan argued that the country could n’t afford the tax cuts being proposed by John McCain without an equally massive reduction in spending .
" I ’m not in favor of financing tax cuts with borrowed money , " he said .
" I always have tied tax cuts to spending . "

Heading east on a windy Interstate 70 , we 've entered the Great Plains of Kansas , leaving the behind the Rocky mountains , where our visit to Colorado Springs gave us the opportunity to attend one of the now - famous Sarah Palin rallies .
Colorado Springs is definitely what Palin would describe as one of the " pro-America areas of the nation , " home to some of its most powerful conservative evangelical institutions .
When we arrived at the city 's minor league baseball stadium on Monday at 6 am for an 8 am rally , there were already plenty of Palin 's supporters lined up in the pre-dawn darkness , many of them dressed in red to demonstrate fealty to their candidate .
Two hours later , they had filled the centre of the 8,500 - seat stadium ( though there were still empty seats in the stands ) and were kept stamping their feet in the damp cold - first to a Christian rock group and then to Hank Williams , Jr , who sang one populist tune after another , some of them tailored to the current election .
In the original version of his song , Family Tradition , Williams defended his hereditary penchant for drinking Jim Beam and smoking dope .
But rewritten as " McCain - Palin Tradition , " the song encourages voters to ignore the " leftwing liberal media " and support the Republican ticket " cuz they 're just like you and ol ' Hank " .
He goes on to explain the causes of the financial crisis : " The bankers did n't want to make all those bad loans / But Bill Clinton said ' you got to !' /
Now they want to bail out , what I 'm talking about / Is a Democrat liberal hoodoo ! "
Williams 's tribute in song to Sarah Palin compared her to a mama bear " who could be counted upon to " protect your family 's condition " because " If you mess with her cubs , shes gonna take off the gloves , / Thats an American female tradition " .
It ended with a musical question to the vice - presidential candidate : " How can you be so smart and be such a good lookin ' dish ? "
After Williams exited to the sound of Johnny Cash 's Walk the Line , the mama bear herself appeared sporting a red leather jacket , producing a roar from her followers .
Palin has pulled back from her riff about Barack Obama not being " a man who sees America like you and I see America , " after accusations of coded racism from the media , and shouted death threats againt Obama from her crowds .
Now she is instead offering up another American bogeyman : The Red Menace .
Obama 's tax plan , Palin warned her audience , would drive the country into the socialist camp : " Obama calls it spreading the wealth , " she said .
" Now is not the time to experiment with socialism .
Distributing the wealth will stifle entrepreneurial spirit . "
In fact , the only person who is promoting any kind of socialism these days is n't Obama but George Bush , who has basically nationalised the banking system - ensuring , at the same time , that his brand of corporate socialism will benefit the rich , while leaving the proletariat to twist in the wind .
Nevertheless , Palin's use of the s-word drew a raucous response from the crowd .
While the crowd at the rally was totally behind their lady in red , there was nonetheless a sense of something being not quite right among Palin 's fans .
Beneath the cheers and applause , there was a lingering mood of defeat - a sense that it was all over , and that as much as anything , this was a goodbye rally for the woman who just months ago had so energised social conservatives .
Pressing a blue " Country First " placard into my hands , a middle - aged woman with intense sparkling eyes told me that she thought there still was a chance - that the polling figures were showing a slight up - tick for McCain .
She did n't seem all that convinced herself , but she pointed a finger towards heaven and smiled resolutely .
The decision , she said , was in the hands of God .
" But , what if you lose ? ''
I asked .
" We will just have to wait until he decides , " she said , again nodding towards heaven .
" That might be a pretty long wait , " I said .
She laughed and agreed .

If you 're looking ahead to the next presidential election , you can order a Palin 2012 yard sign , and the vendor may be doing brisk business in the next couple of weeks .
If John McCain loses Tuesday -- and maybe even if he wins -- some conservatives see her as a future president .
But I would n't bet on it .
Palin obviously has a star quality that most politicians do n't .
Also working in her favor is that if Obama wins , she presents such a sharp contrast to him -- down - home instead of Ivy League , feisty instead of cool , Alaska instead of Hawaii .
If things go badly under a President Obama , voters will tend to look for someone very different -- like when they chose the sunny , militantly anti-communist Ronald Reagan over the moralistic Jimmy Carter , who seemed weak in the face of the Soviet aggression .
But there are even more factors that will act to pull her down .
One is history .
If she wins and John McCain serves two terms , she 'll face the difficult challenge of succeeding him -- something only one incumbent vice president has done since 1836 ( George Bush in 1988 ) .
And if he loses ?
I can't remember the last time a losing vice presidential candidate went on to secure the presidential nomination four years later .
Everyone thought Ed Muskie would do it in 1972 , but he flopped .
Some people thought Joe Lieberman set himself up nicely for 2004 as Al Gore 's 2000 running mate .
Things did n't work out that way .
Then there is the matter of Palin herself .
Unlike some veep candidates who start out relatively unknown and gain ground with voters , she got the benefit of the doubt upfront and then squandered it .
Right after she was chosen , 51 percent of voters had a favorable view of her .
Today , 59 percent have a negative opinion .
Palin has become a deeply polarizing figure -- and , more than any vice presidential candidate in memory , an object of ridicule .
If McCain loses , some Republicans will put much of the blame on her and carry a grudge for years to come .
And then there is that Troopergate investigation , which could still embarrass her .
All this may not hurt her with red-meat conservatives who are smitten with the former beauty queen , but they do n't dominate the Republican Party .
If they did , McCain would n't be the nominee this year .
Assuming Obama wins this year , she would also probably face some serious conservative competition in 2012 -- starting with Mike Huckabee , who showed that an evangelical conservative could be funny , charming and unthreatening , and Mitt Romney , who has lots of fans among economic conservatives .
And there 's one more thing , which could help Palin or hurt her :
In four years , a lot of things can change .
When he was just the topic du jour because of his question to Barack Obama back in the neighborhood in Ohio , that was one thing .
But “ Joe the Plumber ” is now actively campaigning with and for John McCain , appearing on stage with him at multiple events , etc .
He has become a part of McCain ’s campaign , like any other surrogate .
So here “ Joe ” is on TV just about an hour ago saying that people should n’t vote for Obama because he doubts Obama ’s “ loyalty to America ” .
I guess saying Obama reminded him of Sammy Davis , Jr. was n’t bad enough .
But is n’t it time someone ask McCain whether he ’s really willing to associate with this extremist ?
New Evidence : Low Level Mercury in Fish a Health Hazard
" The problem is that we are not given enough information about just how much mercury is in the fish that is widely available in stores and restaurants .
Most American consumers are simply unaware that the fish they eat could be making them sick , " she said .
The San Francisco doctor was the first to recognize low - level mercury poisoning in patients who regularly consume certain types of fish when she saw the symptoms some of her own patients had in common .
Dr. Hightower 's research now extends from the individual patients in her practice to widespread mercury poisonings in Japan , Canada , and Iraq .
She says the FDA guidelines for mercury " are rooted in a study of the victims of a mass methylmercury poisoning in Saddam Hussein 's Iraq . "
But the poisoned food in that study was not fish - it was wheat .
" An associate in Iraq 's health ministry who oversaw the study of Iraqi victims of mercury toxicity has recently revealed that he withheld information from researchers - information that might have shown severe effects at much lower levels of exposure , " she warns .
An article on the Corrosion Doctors website gives some idea of the numbers of people affected by that methylmercury poisoning in food .
" In the early 1970 's a major methyl mercury poisoning catastrophe occurred in which an estimated 10,000 people died and 100,000 were severely and permanently brain damaged .
Saddam Hussein 's regime was largely successful in suppressing information about the event , " the site states .
In the late 1960's and early 1970's , Iraqi harvests failed to produce enought to feed the people .
Officials decided to import a newly branded " wonder wheat " from Mexico , but they worried that the seed might grow moldy during the long , humid ocean journey to Iraq if it was not dressed with some fungicide .
" Methyl mercury became the most cost - effective fungicide , because it had recently been banned in Scandinavia and several American states due to environmental and toxicological risks , " Corrision Doctors explains .
" So the world market was flooded and prices dropped . "
Dr. Hightower says that when the FDA and the swordfishing giant Anderson Seafood Inc. went to court in the mid-1970s over the FDA 's consumption guidelines , Anderson used the Iraqi study as proof that high levels of mercury exposure are safe for the general public .
Older , larger fish will be the ones with the highest concentration of mercury .

But Dr. Hightower says she learned that one of the lead investigators of the Iraqi poisoning disputed the fishing industry 's claim of how much mercury is safe to eat .
Government agencies around the world , including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , have moved away from the idea that there are " safe " levels of mercury blood levels based on the Iraq studies .
But still Hightower says the FDA has failed to adequately warn the public that mercury - laden seafood is a major threat to their health .
The concern reaches far beyond women of childbearing age and children , she said Wednesday as her book , " Diagnosis : Mercury : Money , Politics , and Poison , " was released .
" Common sense says that if you are not feeling well , and are eating poison , then stop eating it and see if you feel better , " said Dr. Hightower .
" ' Diagnosis : Mercury ' brings together the strongest evidence to date that the FDA 's guidelines for fish consumption are insufficient , " said Chuck Savitt , president of Island Press , which published the book .
" We simply do n't know how widespread low - level mercury toxicity is in the United States , and this book tells us that regular consumers of certain types of fish are in danger , " Savitt said .
" Diagnosis : Mercury " makes a case for increased study and stronger FDA regulation of this poison in food supplies .
The current California Department of Health fact sheet on mercury in fish warns local fishermen , " Fish from some areas of California have mercury or other chemicals in them . "
" Most fish that you buy in stores or restaurants are safe .
But even these fish may contain mercury , " warns the state agency , naming the dangerous fish as " shark , swordfish , tilefish or king mackerel . "
The state advises that fish with little or no mercury are store - bought farmed catfish , tilapia , wild salmon , pollock , shrimp , and scallops .
Health officials generally recognize that older , larger fish , higher on the predatory food chain will be the ones with the highest concentration of mercury in their meat .
The Hawaii State Health Department advises that fish small enough to fit in a pan are the ones that will have the least mercury .

By V. Lance Tarrance , Jr. - October 13 , 2008
Now that polls indicate Senator Barack Obama is the favorite to win , some analysts predict a racially biased " Bradley Effect " could prevent Obama from winning a majority on November 4th .
That is a pernicious canard and is unworthy of 21st century political narratives .
I should know .
I was there in 1982 at " ground zero " in California when I served George Deukmejian as his general election pollster and as a member of his strategy team when he defeated African - American Democratic California gubernatorial candidate Tom Bradley , not once but twice , in 1982 and again in 1986 .
Bradley Effect believers assume that there is an undetectable tendency in the behavior of some white voters who tell pollsters that they are " undecided " when in fact their true preference is to vote against the black candidate .
This so - called effect suggests the power or advantage to alter an outcome - a pretty serious charge .
This would render poll projections inaccurate ( overstating both the number of undecided voters and the African - American candidate 's margin over a white opponent ) and create an unaccounted for different outcome .
However , it is indeed a " theory in search of data . "
The hype surrounding the Bradley Effect has evolved to where some political pundits believe in 2008 that Obama must win in the national pre-election polls by 6 - 9 points before he can be assured a victory .
That 's absurd .
There wo n't be a 6 - 9 point Bradley Effect -- there can't be , since few national polls show a large enough amount of undecided voters and it's in the undecided column where racism supposedly hides .
The other reason I reject the Bradley Effect in 2008 is because there was not a Bradley Effect in the 1982 California Governor 's race , either .
Even though Tom Bradley had been slightly ahead in the polls in 1982 , due to sampling error , it was statistically too close to call .
For example , the daily Tarrance and Associates tracking polls for the Deukmejian campaign showed the following weekly summations ( N=1000 each ) during the month of October :
Week of :
Oct.7th Oct. 14th Oct. 21st Oct. 28 Nov. 1
Bradley 49 45 46 45 45
Deukmejian 37 41 41 42 44
It is obvious that this election was closing fast .
Yet , Bradley 's win was projected by the most prominent public pollster in the state , Mervin Field , who boasted on Election Day that Tom Bradley would defeat George Deukmejian , " making the Los Angeles mayor the first elected black governor in American history " ( UPI 11 - 3 - 82 ) .
The reason for Field 's enthusiasm was that his last weekend polling showed a 7 - point margin for Bradley , but this was totally at variance from the Tarrance and Associates internal tracking results .
Field 's own exit polls , on Election Day itself , where voters were questioned after they left the polling places , also predicted a Bradley win .
This caused the San Fransisco Chronicle , ignoring the closeness of the election and mixed polling results , to print 170,000 copies of its early morning Wednesday edition under the headline " Bradley Win Projected . "
Also at variance with the Mervin Field exit polls were the NBC and the CBS networks , using both exit polls and actual returns from key precincts , when they declared George Deukmejian the winner and not Tom Bradley the winner .
In an AP report , a KNBC newscaster told viewers on Election Night " ... half of the polls are wrong and I do n't know who 's right . "
The only thing we know for sure is the election was too close to call , and some of the Election Day projections were right and others ( notably Mervin Fields ' projections ) were wrong and , unfortunately , most of this explanation because of selective memory has not been carried forward to this day .
The Field Poll inaugurated the speculation that led to the baseless Bradley Effect theory when , after the 1982 election , Field said " race was a factor in the Bradley loss " ( AP 11 -4 - 82 ) .
Mervin Field cited no data , but only speculated that white conservative voters of both parties were more undecided and that he may have over - represented minority voters in his polling .
Thus , the Bradley Effect was born amidst some major polling errors and a confusing array of mixed predictions , hardly a firm foundation to construct a theory .
Even later analysis of the 1982 election revealed the weakness in the Bradley Effect theory as Bradley actually won on election day turnout , but lost the absentee vote so badly that Deukmejian pulled ahead to win .
That Bradley won the vote on Election Day would hardly seem to suggest a hidden or last minute anti-black backlash -- on the contrary , it suggests how easy it would have been for weekend polls and Election Day exit polls to get it wrong , since the decisive group of voters had largely already voted before the final weekend and never showed up at the polls to answer the questions of exit pollsters .
When Barack Obama lost the 2008 New Hampshire primary after all seven pre-election polls had Obama projected as the winner , the Bradley Effect got a second wind , blown along by a lot of misinformed press speculation asserting that our nation was still suffering from latent racism .
A few weeks later , after much analysis of election demographics , and with a more thoughtful examination , it is clear that race was not the determinant that gave Hillary Clinton a surprising victory .
In fact , it was a combination of an older brand of feminism , the open party system that encouraged independents to vote in the primary and some Obama campaign hubris that caused the result .
The New Hampshire polling debacle was also eerily familiar to those of us who witnessed first - hand the 1982 California election day errors .
A lesson learned from 1982 campaign , but not remembered in 2008 , was what a San Francisco Chronicle editor said the day after the 1982 election , " It seemed logical ... to project a continued gain for Bradley . "
There was never a consensus of data to support this logic .
The 2008 New Hampshire update on the so - called Bradley Effect also falls short of proving this false theory of latent racism .
Instead , the New Hampshire debacle should be labeled for what it is , the worst polling disaster since " Dewey Beats Truman . "
The Deukmejian campaign tracking polls did not confirm any Bradley Effect and to interject this type of speculation into the 2008 presidential election is not only folly , but insulting to the political maturity of our nation 's voters .
To allow this theory to continue to persist anymore than 25 years is to damage our democracy , no matter who wins .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Treasury Department is " actively " looking at buying equity stakes in some of the nation 's banks , according to White House officials .
At a briefing Thursday morning , White House spokesman Dana Perino confirmed reports that the United States could soon join the United Kingdom , Iceland and Italy in announcing a plan to inject capital directly into their troubled banking systems .
Then later , after a punishing day for stocks , President Bush 's chief economic adviser , Edward Lazear , told CNN that capital injections are being considered as an option .
Lazear said officials were still working out how that option and other tools available to the Treasury under the recently passed $ 700 billion financial rescue plan could best be used .
" We have to make sure that we get it right , " Lazear said .
He also noted that while it may take days or weeks to get the full plan up and running , " the markets will be reassured in very short order . "
Capital - a measure of a bank 's strength - is what makes lending possible .
For the past month , as major financial institutions have failed , banks have been hoarding their cash to make sure they do n't get caught in a capital squeeze .
That in turn has caused a cutoff in credit needed by businesses and consumers .
It 's not clear what form the government intervention would take , but Treasury is likely to end up with ownership interests in the banks that receive the capital .
" These capital injections are something that Secretary Paulson is actively considering , " said Perino .
She said she could n't comment on the timing or extent of such investments .
The move would be made under the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout law enacted on Friday .
The focus of the bailout was a plan to have Treasury buying damaged mortgage - backed securities from banks and financial firms .
The aim is to help firms improve their balance sheets and profit prospects and attract capital from the private sector .
But the administration is now arguing that direct investment is part of the powers under the act .
The Treasury 's latest move comes as banks around the world struggle to deal with the global financial crisis .
Other governments have already stepped in to nationalize banks .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Wednesday morning that the British government would make available £ 50 billion , or $ 87 billion , to the nation 's eight largest banks in an effort to shore - up their capital positions .
In return for the infusion of capital the British government will receive preferred shares of those banks .
Iceland seized control of its three largest banks .
Officials with the Italian government have said they are looking at their own bank rescue plan similar to the British efforts .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson first hinted of the U.S. effort to directly shore up banks on Wednesday in a speech about the bailout .
He said increasing capital investment in the nation 's banking system is one of Treasury 's goals , and he seemed to suggest that such capital could come directly from taxpayers .
The new law gives " broad flexible authorities for Treasury to buy or insure troubled assets , provide guarantees , and inject capital , " Paulson said .
Paulson vowed to " use all of the tools we 've been given ... including strengthening the capitalization of financial institutions of every size . "
The reports cheered some experts who had argued that such direct investment was the best way to help financial companies .
" The proper way to resolve a banking crisis is not to buy toxic assets but rather to recapitalize banks directly via injections of public capital ( in the form of preferred shares ) into distressed but solvent financial institutions , " wrote Nouriel Roubini , professor of economics at New York University 's Stern School of Business , on his blog Thursday .
Treasury had been reluctant to move in that direction during debate over the bailout bill and it is significant that officials are now talking about the possibility of such direct investment , Roubini wrote .
" The 180 - degree turn in the Treasury position is driven by the disastrous market reaction to the passage of this legislation and to the realization that U.S. banks are in such a deep trouble that , absent a direct partial public takeover of the banks , this severe financial crisis will get much worse , " wrote Roubini .
Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst at the Stanford Group , said in a note that he believes buying shares would be a good move for banks and their shareholders .
He said even if government stock purchases dilute the value of shares held by investors , they are unlikely to wipe out current holdings .
The firebomb attack this weekend on the publishing house Gibson Square in London was an assault on one of the bravest publishers in the business .
Three men were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 on Saturday morning , suspected of attempting to set fire to the premises .
Martin Rynja , who runs Gibson Square , is due to publish Sherry Jones 's novel about Mohammed 's wife Aisha , The Jewel of Medina , next month .
Random
House had pulled out of publishing the novel in August , stating that it had been advised that " the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the Muslim community " and that " it could incite acts of violence by a small , radical segment " .
This is not the first time that Rynja , owner of a small , independent publishing house , has shown himself to have more gumption and appetite for controversy than the big boys .
Four years ago , he published Craig Unger 's House of Bush , House of Saud after Random House , once again , pulled out - this time for fear of libel action .
He is also the publisher of OJ Simpson 's If I Did It and Alexander Litvinenko's Blowing Up Russia .
Rynja 's support for free speech is proving to be exceptional , as is his courage in standing up to bullies , at a time when other publishers will surrender at any intimation of legal action - particularly from litigious Saudis .
Rynja , who trained as a lawyer , has shown that capitulation need not be inevitable .
I can only hope that the shocking attack on his office will not dim his determination - but he will need support .
Random House dropped
The Jewel of Medina in anticipation that offence might be caused in an extraordinary instance of pre-emptive censorship .
Let 's remember the similarly dire predictions that were made when Geert Wilders released his provocative film Fitna , which links Islam to terrorism - it was in fact a non-event .
Yet , in this instance , the row that ensued once the story broke about Sherry Jones 's novel has , like a self - fulfilling prophecy , served to escalate the very scenario that Random House was apparently seeking to avert .
It is most telling that they sent a work of fiction out to academics for approval in the first place - since when was a historian , however smart and literate , a suitable judge of whether a novel should or should not be published ?
Surely the only grounds for publishing a novel are whether it is of literary merit ?
One of the academics they consulted , Denise Spellberg , was reported as saying : " You can't play with a sacred history and turn it into soft - core pornography . "
Why not ?
This is one person 's subjective view of a novel - it should not be grounds for censorship .
Random
House 's actions show just how far we have lost our way in this debate over free expression and Islam : the level of intimidation , fear and self - censorship is such that one of the biggest publishers in the world no longer felt able to publish a work of creative imagination without some kind of dispensation .
Jones 's book does not claim to be a piece of history - it 's a work of invention .
It was also disingenuous of Random House to suggest that the novel might incite violence .
Certain members of the population might choose to commit an act of violence , but that is not the same as the book itself inciting violence .
To pass the responsibility in this way to the novel was a betrayal of the author and of free speech .
So it was left to a small publisher , with none of the resources a major publishing house can enjoy in such a time of crisis , to stand up for principles .
Now that Rynja has come under attack , it is more necessary than ever to counter any justification of censorship on the grounds of offence ( that may or may not be caused ) and to condemn any intimidation tactics .
This whole affair - from Random House 's decision to drop the book , to the attack this weekend - is evidence of a worrying trend .
Twenty years since The Satanic Verses was published , in the 60th - anniversary year of the UN Declaration of Human Rights , we are facing a crisis for free expression .
Yet the threat comes not only from those who commit acts of violence , but from those who ostensibly support human rights .
Respect for religion has now become acceptable grounds for censorship ; even the UN secretary - general , Ban Ki-moon , has declared that free speech should respect religious sensibilities , while the UN human rights council passed a resolution earlier this year condemning defamation of religion and calling for governments to prohibit it .
As the writer Kenan Malik has so astutely pointed out , " In the post - Rushdie world , speech has come to be seen not intrinsically as a good but inherently as a problem because it can offend as well as harm ... "
Censorship , and self - censorship , Malik observes , have become the norm .
What we have seen , over the past two decades , is an insidious new argument for curbing free speech become increasingly acceptable .
Martin Rynja has consistently set an example to us all in not being cowed by outrage , convention and legal action .
It 's an independent spirit that we urgently need to cherish , support and emulate - and it's not only free speech groups like Index on Censorship that should be standing up for him .

Mr Obama has a narrow lead in Ohio boosted by new voters
The US Supreme Court has blocked attempts by the Republican Party to challenge the right of 200,000 new voters to cast their ballots in Ohio .
An appeal court had previously backed a complaint brought by the party , which argued that the voters ' details did not match federal records .
Their concern was over registered voters backing Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama for president .
A Democratic official said Republicans were trying to disenfranchise voters .
Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , a Democrat , said that although there were 200,000 cases where voter registration did not match social security or motor vehicle registration records , the majority of the cases were mis-spellings or inaccuracies in data bases .
" Federal government red tape , mis-stated technical information or glitches in databases should not be the basis for voters having to cast provisional ballots , " she said .
Delays The Federal Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , in Cincinnati , had ordered Ms Brunner to supply county election boards in Ohio with lists of the disputed electors , which could have led to these voters being issued with provisional ballots , open to challenge .
Officials said the measure would have caused considerable delays on election day .
The US Supreme Court ruling means that Ms Brunner will no longer have to supply the lists .
The court said its ruling was not a comment on whether Ohio was complying with a provision of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 that lays out requirements for verifying voter eligibility .
Instead , the ruling was based on a judgment that the law does not allow private entities - like the Ohio Republican Party - to bring the case to court .
John McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis stressed that the court ruling was not a judgement on the validity of the Republican Party 's case .
" If you look at what the ruling said , it said that the Republican Party did n't have standing in order to bring the suit , " he told reporters on a campaign conference call .
" It did n't make a decision on the merits of the case . "
" I think that the secretary of state ought to do her job , " he added .
Registration drive
The winner of the 2008 election is likely to be the candidate who is most successful at getting their voters to the polls .
The Obama campaign , in particular , has invested heavily in a voter registration drive to sign up new voters drawn from the ranks of its supporters , such as young people .
And they appear to have managed to increase the number of newly registered Democrats significantly in a number of key swing states in addition to Ohio , such as Colorado , Virginia and North Carolina .
So any further legal challenges to their right to vote could have a big effect on the election outcome if the contest is close .
In the 2000 US election , disputed ballots in Florida led to an election deadlock that was only resolved by the Supreme Court .

What are these ?
Take the case of the Bridge to Nowhere , which supposedly gives Ms. Palin credentials as a reformer .
Well , when campaigning for governor , Ms. Palin did n’t say “ no thanks ”  she was all for the bridge , even though it had already become a national scandal , insisting that she would “ not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that ’s so negative . ”
Oh , and when she finally did decide to cancel the project , she did n’t righteously reject a handout from Washington : she accepted the handout , but spent it on something else .
You see , long before she decided to cancel the bridge , Congress had told Alaska that it could keep the federal money originally earmarked for that project and use it elsewhere .
So the whole story of Ms. Palin ’s alleged heroic stand against wasteful spending is fiction .
Or take the story of Mr. Obama ’s alleged advocacy of kindergarten sex-ed .
In reality , he supported legislation calling for “ age and developmentally appropriate education ” ; in the case of young children , that would have meant guidance to help them avoid sexual predators .
And then there ’s the claim that Mr. Obama ’s use of the ordinary metaphor “ putting lipstick on a pig ” was a sexist smear , and on and on .

Why do the McCain people think they can get away with this stuff ?
Well , they ’re probably counting on the common practice in the news media of being “ balanced ” at all costs .
You know how it goes :
If a politician says that black is white , the news report does n’t say that he ’s wrong , it reports that “ some Democrats say ” that he ’s wrong .
Or a grotesque lie from one side is paired with a trivial misstatement from the other , conveying the impression that both sides are equally dirty .
AMP6 T - Amp DIY Class - T Amplifier Kit
Introduction - AMP6 T - Amp DIY Class - T Amplifier Kit from 41hz.com
In late 2004 and early 2005 , raving reviews about the $ 30 Sonic Impact T - Amp started to surface .
Some called it a " Giant Killer " , some did not like it , but most agreed it was an inexpensive amplifier that sounds pretty darn good .
The favorable reviews had me wondering about Class - T amplifiers so I decided to try one on for size .
Taking the DIY route , I opted for a $ 39 AMP6 kit from 41hz.com .
The AMP6 is a small amplifier that uses the Tripath TA2020 chip and includes an on - board regulated power supply .
The manufacturer , Tripath Technology , Inc. describes Class - T amplifiers as offering both the audio fidelity of Class - AB and the power efficiency of Class - D amplifiers .
Figure 1 : Tripath TA2020 Distortion vs Power Output
DIY Class - T Amplifier Kit
The kit components came neatly packaged in small Ziploc bags which identified the contents .
The PCB is double weight , double sided copper and very compact .
Photograph 1 : Contents of the AMP6 Kit
As you can see from the contents , the toroids need to be hand wound .
I somehow managed to break a wire while I was winding one and it was promptly replaced by 41hz.com .
The instructions are decent , but expect you to have a basic understanding of electronics and some soldering skills .
However , there is an error on the PCB to be aware of .
The polarity of the large bulk capacitor C99 is reversed on the PCB .
The rectangular pad on the PCB should be positive , the round pad negative .
Be careful with this one as wrong polarity of electrolytic capacitors can cause them to explode !
This error is identified in the documentation , so be sure to read though the manual before you break out the soldering iron .
Construction - AMP6 T - Amp Kit
Assembly of the board is fairly straight forward .
I always start with the smallest components and work upwards in size .
The polarity markings on the diodes can be hard to see , so if you are uncertain , use a multimeter to determine their polarity .
Also , do n't forget to isolate the regulator from the heatsink .
The amplifier chip does not need to be isolated .
Photograph 2 : Assembled AMP6 PCBs
The transformer was salvaged from a dead computer UPS .
I do n't know the power rating , but it is a sizable chunk of iron and much larger than required .
The documentation recommends a transformer rated at 80 VA for 4 ohm loads and 40 VA for 8 ohm loads .
The heatsink was salvaged from a dead computer power supply which also provided the IEC socket , power switch and fuse holder .
As it turns out , it is the voltage regulator that sizes the heatsink required as the amplifier chip does not produce much heat .
The small aluminum chassis was purchased from a surplus store and was unmarked , but appears to be a Bud Chassis .
Note that I had to move the tank capacitor to the underside of the PCB in order to have room to fasten the regulator to the chassis .
Photograph 3 : Underside View of Finished AMP6 Kit
The kit comes with 3.3 uF electrolytic capacitors for input ( DC blocking ) , but I opted to use 3 uF film capacitors instead .
The volume control ( not supplied with the kit ) is a 100k Alps Blue Velvet .
Input is through inexpensive gold plated RCA jacks with inexpensive gold plated binding posts used for the output .
A small toggle switch on the front allows you to switch between on and sleep ( standby ) mode .
Photograph 4 : Finished AMP6 - Front View
Measurements and Listening Impressions
I checked the frequency response into a 4.5 ohm resistive load and it was flat from 10 Hz to about 6 kHz , up 0.2 dB at 10 kHz and up 1 dB at 20 kHz .
The measurements are similar with those by Michael Mardis .
See Michael 's site for measurements of SNR , distortion and crosstalk .
I tried the AMP6 with my BD - Pipes and while I was impressed with the detailed midrange and top end , I found the bass a little dry and lacking .
I experimented by adding an additional 4900 uF to C1819 with the result of seemingly less bass .
I came to the conclusion that the stiff ( low Xmax ) 40 - 1197 drivers in the BD - Pipes prefer amplifiers with a low damping factor which allows them resonate more and help fill in the bass .
Photograph 5 : Finished AMP6 - Rear View
The AMP6 was a very nice match With a pair Paradigm Mini Monitors ( 2 - way bookshelf ) .
The bass was very tight and accurate .
The AMP6 had nice crisp and detailed highs .
Overall a very nice amplifier for the low cost .
Another positive is the low power consumption of the AMP6 kit which will work well with battery power supplies .
Now for the big question - How does the AMP6 kit sound relative to other low cost IC based amplifier kit ?
I still find that my favorite IC based amps are the LM3886 IC chip amplifier ( gainclone ) kits .
There is something about the LM3886 chip amps kits that make the music more involving over the AMP6 .
This is not to say I think the AMP6 is bad , in fact , I think it is a fantastic value and sets the bar high for a low cost off the shelf kit .
Higher resolution photographs of the AMP6 kit are available in the Photo Gallery : AMP6 DIY Class T Amplifier Kit .

Alfred E. Neuman 's goofy , grinning visage has been synonymous with satire since the founding of * Mad * magazine in 1952 .
Now some original artwork featuring that jug - eared face is hitting the auction block in November .
" We wanted to hold onto them for as long as possible , " current editor John Ficarra told the Associated Press about the decision to sell the artwork featured on timeless Mad covers .
" Not as much as a tribute to the early history of Mad ... but because these paintings were covering up quite a few holes in the walls .
This auction leaves us no choice .
Now we have to patch and paint . "
The art in question covers much historical ground , from George Washington to Richard Nixon and the Vietnam War .
The work of late Mad illustrator Norman Mingo is generously represented , including his revered Neuman caricature for issue No. 30 , at right .
Mingo was the only World War I vet to serve the magazine , as well as the illustrator who was commissioned to create Neuman as the 20th century 's unforgettable gap - toothed dope .
A preview of the 36 Mad classics in question kicks off Oct. 29 at New York 's Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art .
It is followed Nov. 14 by the sale , which will be held online and at Dallas ' Heritage Auction Galleries .

FIFTY YEARS after his death , the figure of Pope Pius XII continues to strain relations between Catholics and Jews .
On Saturday Fr Peter Gumpel , postulator for the cause of sainthood of Pius , called on the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Israel to remove a caption attached to a photo of Pope Pius in the museum .
Housed in a section that recalls those who did not raise their voices in protest against the deportation of Jews , the caption below the photograph claims that " the Vatican did not react with either verbal or written protests " , adding that when more than 1,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz from Rome in October 1943 , the Holy See did not intervene .
Fr Gumpel claims this is a false interpretation of history and says , as has often been suggested by Vatican historians , that Pius did a great deal behind the scenes to save the lives of thousands of Jews .
Vatican scholars have argued that Pius chose not to speak out more directly against Hitler for fear of retaliation against the Jewish people .
Additional controversial light , however , has been shed on Pope Pius by diplomatic documents unearthed by archivist Mario Cereghino .
He discovered a dispatch sent to the foreign office in London by the British special envoy to the Holy See , Sir d'Arcy Osborne .
Rome daily La Repubblica yesterday carried an extract from this diplomatic " post " in which Sir d'Arcy reports on a meeting he had with Pope Pius in the Vatican on October 18th , 1943 , just two days after the Jews had been rounded up in Rome and deported to Auschwitz .
Expressing dismay that Rome was at the mercy of the Nazis , the envoy asked Pope Pius to do everything possible to save the Vatican and its neutrality status : " He [ Pius ] replied that , as far as that was concerned and up to that moment , the Germans had behaved correctly . "
Repubblica also reports the discovery of another " diplomatic " letter , this one from Hitler 's ambassador to the Vatican , Ernst von Wieszacker , on December 13th , 1943 , in which the envoy reports to the Nazi hierarchy that Pius " hopes that the Nazis hold their military positions on the Russian front " by way of a bulwark against the spread of communism .
Just two weeks ago the Rabbi of Haifa , Shear - Yusev Cohen , in an obvious reference to Pope Pius , told the Synod of Bishops in Rome that Jews cannot " forgive or forget " the silence of " many leaders , including religious ones " , in the face of the Holocaust .
Speaking to reporters later , the Rabbi said that he felt it would be inappropriate if Pope Benedict XVI were to beatify Pius .
Fr Gumpel suggested that Pope Benedict would not make a visit to Israel until such time as the Yad Vashem photo was removed .
However , senior Vatican spokesman Fr Federico Lombardi issued a note saying the photo would not be a " decisive " issue in regard to a papal trip to Israel .
Fr Gumpel also suggested that Pope Benedict had , thus far , stayed the beatification cause of Pius so as not to further strain Jewish - Catholic relations .
Amos Luzzatto , a senior figure in Italy 's Jewish community , yesterday underlined the concerns of the Jewish community worldwide about the possible beatification and canonisation of Pius , saying : " No one denies that thousands of Jews were saved in convents .
But the silence about the mass deportations was another thing .
If they want to beatify Pius before clearing up all the doubts on those silences , so be it .
But the Vatican should know that for Jews , this would open up a wound that would be hard to heal . "

Snakes reveal deadly fang secret
New research could settle a long - standing controversy over the evolution of deadly snake fangs .
In today 's issue of the journal Nature an international team of scientists argue that different types of fangs , thought by some to have evolved independently , actually have a common evolutionary pathway .
Syringe - like teeth connected to venom glands are used by many snakes to inject venom into their prey .
But such fangs can be in the front of the jaw - as in cobras and vipers - or in the back and for years scientists have argued over the origin of such different fangs .
Dr Bryan Fry , of the University of Melbourne 's Bio21 Institute , who contributed to the new research , says advanced snakes share a common ancestor that had venom glands before fangs developed .
" Logically venom preceded fangs as there cannot be a selection pressure for the evolution of intricate delivery systems [ for venom ] in the absence of something worth delivering , " he says .
Fry says early in the evolutionary pathway , snakes used regular teeth to chew the venom in with some lineages later developing enlarged rear teeth .
" The true innovation in venom delivery came with the development of hollow - syringe fangs to deliver the venom in a high - pressure manner , " he says .
This allowed snakes to envenomate new prey because they could " efficiently get past the thick fur of mammals or puncture the hard scales of other snakes " .
Fry says the new research has now found that this major development in snake evolution , involving the back teeth and venom gland , ocurred independently from the rest of the teeth .
Snake embryo study
Fry and colleagues studied fang development in 96 snake embryos covering eight species , including those with rear fangs and those with front fangs .
They tracked the movement of tooth - forming cells in the upper jaw of snake embryos , by monitoring the expression of the sonic hedgehog gene ( shh ) .
Different levels of the gene 's expression cause different types of cells to be formed in the developing embryo .
They found all fangs originated at the back of the upper jaw and the front fangs migrated forwards as the snake embryo developed .
' Uncoupling '
The researchers say the findings show an apparent " uncoupling " of the back region of the tooth - forming layer from the rest of the teeth during evolution .
They say this evolutionary event could have contributed to the massive increase in snake diversity and numbers in the Cenozoic era , which started about 65 million years ago .
Reptile expert , Professor Rick Shine at the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Sydney agrees .
" Snakes are a relatively young group , " says Shine .
" But they are one of the great success stories in recent times in an evolutionary sense . "
Shine says the " elegant " paper is " a huge leap forward in understanding how modern snakes have perfected the killing system that they have " .
And he says the team has shown that snakes are " much more similar than we would have thought " .
" Scientists have been puzzling over the evolutionary relationships between snake lineages for a long time , " says Shine .
" What we are seeing [ in this paper ] are variations on a theme " with a bit of genetic modification along the way .

CREPE PAN : Worth it ?
Or not ?.
» Discuss Article
Value is a relative concept .
Just ask the folks at Lehman Brothers .
But when it comes to ingredients and kitchen tools that beckon to the enthusiastic home cook , it ’s important to the bottom line -- in this case , a great meal -- to take a look at what ’s really worth your hard - earned cash -- and what is n’t .
We scrutinized our kitchens and the merchandise .
Our thumbs - up , thumbs - down verdicts on a couple of dozen popular or hyped cooking items follow .
No apologies -- we ’re opinionated .
Some gadgets and goodies are grossly overvalued , others just do n’t get their due .
We considered cost , efficacy and practicality -- as well as the happiness factor .
Because for a true chocoholic , a 3.5 - ounce bar of Michel Cluizel Noir de Cacao 72 % cacao really is worth $ 6 .
Obviously , a lot of this is open for discussion , even heated debate .
Is a 1 - ounce tin of Spanish saffron really worth $ 199 ?
How about a $ 60 Rachael Ray fondue pot ?

Mortar and pestle
When it comes to kitchen tools , I ’m a big fan of the simpler the better .
And you ca n’t get much simpler than a mortar and pestle .
Basically nothing more than two rocks that you use to grind food , it has n’t really been improved since the Stone Age .
But when something is perfect , why mess with it ?
You can spend $ 100 on a French marble one from an antique store , or you can pick up one made of granite at a Thai grocery store for less than $ 25 .
While you ’re shopping , pick up a wooden pestle as well -- those granite ones get really heavy when you ’re stirring in oil a drop at a time for aioli .-- R.P .

Good corkscrew

I ca n’t tell you how frustrating it is to take a good bottle of wine to someone ’s house and find that the only corkscrew they ’ve got is one of those $ 1.99 drugstore ones with solid screws that are good only for splitting corks .
Come on , spend an extra couple of bucks and get one with a hollow auger ( it will look like a corkscrew rather than a sheet metal screw ) .
You can find them for around $ 10 and you wo n’t believe the difference .

Instant - read thermometer
I have worked with chefs who have been cooking so long that they can tell within 5 degrees the temperature of a roast just by giving it a good squeeze .

Good dried pasta
Cheaping out on spaghetti , rigatoni and penne is false economy when you can find terrific brands such as Latini , Rustichella d’Abruzzo and Maestri selling for only a couple of bucks a box more than the industrial stuff .

Small kitchen scale
In a perfect world , we would measure all of our ingredients by weight .
That ’s obvious for baking , where the way you scoop flour into a measuring cup can make as much as a 20 % difference in quantity .
But it ’s also true for other kinds of cooking .
Measuring by weight opens up the hidden ratios of cooking in a way that volume measuring can’t ( in fact , my friend Michael Ruhlman is writing a book on that subject ) .
For example , a classic mirepoix has equal weights of chopped carrots and celery and twice as much onion .
That ratio does n’t show up in cup measurements .
You can find a really good digital electronic kitchen scale for less than $ 30 .
The two things to look for are a capacity of at least 10 pounds and a “ tare ” feature that helps those of us who are not mathematically inclined to allow for the weight of bowls , etc. -- R.P.

Heavy - duty roasting pan
Especially with the holidays staring us in the face , this is one of the best investments you can make .
And it is a bit of an investment -- a good roaster will probably cost in the neighborhood of $ 150 .
But if you ’re going to splurge on a good pan , this is one of the places to do it .
Look for pans with low sides that allow air circulation .
Avoid lighter pans , which may be cheaper , but wo n’t brown the meat well , and nonstick pans , which may seem convenient , but do n’t caramelize the pan juices .

Expensive red wine vinegar
One of the great puzzles in food marketing is why no company has stepped up to make a great - tasting red wine vinegar .
It ’s not like it ’s cloning wild mushrooms or something .
In fact , just about any idiot can make it at home quite easily .
I ’m a prime example .
I have kept a big jug going on my counter for more than 15 years .
A couple of occasional bottles of sturdy $ 5.99 red wine and dregs from dinner parties are all that is required to keep me in clean , fruity , complex vinegar whenever I want it .-- R.P.

Mini food processor
What ’s the point ?
Anything small enough to fit in the feed bowl of one of these can be just as easily and quickly chopped by hand .
Find it in the cupboard , put it together , find a plug , pulse twice , take it apart , clean it up , put it away .
Give me a chef ’s knife and a cutting board any day .
-- R.P.
Expensive nonstick skillet
If you ’re spending more than $ 30 on a nonstick skillet , you ’re crazy .
I know , because I have done it repeatedly .
And two months later they ’ve got the same set of nicks and dings as the cheapo pan I bought at the restaurant supply store .
Of course , it goes without saying that nonstick anything else -- saucepans , roasting pans , etc. -- is a complete waste of money , unless you truly are a serial scorcher .-- R.P.

Expensive knives
My wife is going to howl with laughter when she reads this because I ’ve got two knife blocks jammed full , and more in a drawer .
But 98 % of all the cutting I do is with a chef ’s knife or a paring knife .
The rest of it , I confess , is nothing more than a cutting - edge indulgence .
So let ’s agree never again to mention that 12 - inch antique French carbon steel ham slicer , OK ?-- R.P .
Big red wines
How many grilled black - pepper - coated steaks are you going to eat in a year ?
That ’s about the only possible dish these high - alcohol , high - extract wines can pair with .
I ’m looking at you , Paso Robles Zin !
Who are you kidding with 15.5 % alcohol ?
And these days there are even some Pinots that get that high .
If I want Port , I ’ll buy Port . -- R.P .

White truffles
There is no one who loves white truffles more than I do .
But I can count on one hand the number of times I ’ve had white truffles in this country that approach the quality of the ones you get in Italy .
There , you can smell the truffles being sliced from across the room .
Here , most of the time you practically have to bury your nose in a dish before you get any of their perfume .
Luxury ingredients are wonderful when there is a payoff ; otherwise they ’re the culinary equivalent of gold - plating bathroom fixtures .

High - quality coffee
Skimping on coffee is one of those things -- like buying cheap shoes -- that never ends up working out .
Sure , a pound of fair trade , organic , artisan - roasted Ethiopian Yrgacheffe is going to set you back more than a can of Folgers ( about three times as much ) , but you ’ll get a far better cup of joe , therefore increasing the caffeine happiness factor and probably decreasing the amount of coffee you ’ll need to drink in the first place .
Quality over quantity , anyone ?-- A.S.

Dutch oven
A few years ago I bought a 4 - quart Staub enameled cast iron Dutch oven on sale at a cooking store , and I think I ’ve used it more than all the rest of the pots and pans in my kitchen -- combined -- since then .
I do n’t even put it away ; it lives on my stove .
These lidded pots usually cost $ 100 to $ 200 ( the price varies a lot , depending on the size and manufacturer ) , but you can use them on the stove top and in the oven , for soups , braises , casseroles , boiling pasta and making sauces .
I even use mine to make cobblers .
They conduct heat amazingly well , are pretty enough to serve in , and they ’re so durable that they ’ll survive us all .
Bargain cast - iron
Dutch ovens from the hardware store may not be as pretty , but at a fraction of the price , they ’ll work almost as well .
-- A.S .
Whole vanilla beans
Imitation vanilla extract should come with a government warning label :
You have no idea what you ’re missing .
Even extract made from real vanilla has nothing on the beans themselves .
Scrape the seeds into sauces and doughs , steep the husks in vats of crème anglaise for ice cream .
You can reuse the beans too .
After they ’re dried , bury them in your sugar bowl for homemade vanilla sugar .
Yeah , they ’re expensive ( $ 1 to $ 2 for a single Madagascar bean ) , but when you want the flavor to shine through , they ’re worth it .

Saffron
Tagged as the world ’s most expensive spice -- you can buy a 2 1/2 - pound case of saffron on amazon.com for $ 4,410 -- saffron is the key ingredient in many regional dishes , such as paella and bouillabaisse as well as certain pilafs and tagines .
They depend on its unique grassy flavor and startling yellow color .
Authenticity has its price , of course , but it ’s not so bad when you consider how little you need of the stuff .
It ’s also another one of those wacky ingredients that make you think , wow , who comes up with this stuff ?
Dried crocus stigmas .
What demented gardener thought of putting that in the stew ?
-- A.S.
Microplane
Yeah , you may think that a box grater is all you ’ll ever need -- until you use one of these gizmos for the first time .
The fine metal graters are inexpensive ( around 10 bucks , less if you shop at hardware stores ) and seriously useful .
Grate cheese , nutmeg , a chunk of 70 % cacoa chocolate ; zest citrus without worrying about grating the bitter pith .
And never a scraped knuckle !
I keep mine right next to my stove -- and I have no idea where my box grater is anymore .

“ Larousse Gastronomique ”
The updated 2001 edition of this classic food encyclopedia may weigh 8 pounds and cost $ 85 , but it ’s worth every ounce and every penny .
With listings from abaisse ( a sheet of rolled - out pastry ) to zuppa inglese ( a 19th century “ English ” dessert invented by Neapolitan pastry cooks ) , loads of recipes and definitions , and compiled with the help of luminaries such as Joël Robuchon and Pierre Hermé , it ’s as fun as it is useful .
And if you get tired of reading entries on chicken galantine , it makes a great panini press ( wrap the book tightly in plastic first ) .
-- A.S.
Toaster
The toaster is another one of those kitchen appliances that just takes up too much space for no reason .
Bagels get stuck in them , crumbs burn up in the trays on the bottom , you have to remember to clean the trays on the bottom .
They do n’t have to be dear , but they sure can be : $ 30 for a Black & Decker 2 - slice ; $ 320 for a Dualit 4 - slice .
But who eats toast any more anyway ?
I like grilled bread much better , made outside on the grill or inside in a cast iron skillet .
Ca n’t they put something else on bridal registries ?
If I ever get married again , I want a Pacojet . -- A.S .

Flavored salts
Pricey little tins of “ gourmet ” salts flavored with kaffir lime - coconut , ancho chile - ginger , Madagascar vanilla , green Thai curry , whatever .
Oh , please .
If you want “ gourmet ” salts , just grate some lime or sprinkle some toasted spices into a bowl of sea salt and be done with it .
And really , any product that has to label itself “ gourmet ” to justify the hefty markup ( $ 10 to $ 20 for tins averaging 4 ounces ) is just asking to be scorned .
-- A.S.
Crème brûlée torch
These dainty , prissy little tools , sold in kitchen supply stores for upward of $ 50 , take all the fun out of burning sugar in the first place .
You want a good caramelized top on your crème brûlée ?
Use a blow torch .
They cost about a quarter of the price , work a lot better -- and you can solder pipes with them too .

Filet Mignon
If you have to wrap bacon around a piece of beef to give it flavor , then you ’re better off spending your money on a cut that actually tastes like something .
Filet mignon goes for around $ 30 a pound these days ; a nice New York steak costs two - thirds that , sometimes less , and it has twice the flavor .
No bacon necessary .
-- A.S.
Crêpe pan
Crêpe pans are very cute , and not even that pricey ( maybe $ 40 ) unless you want a copper one ( then try $ 200 ) .
But what ’s the point when you can make terrific crêpes on any nonstick pan or cast - iron skillet ?
If you must get one , buy that obscenely expensive and beautiful copper version .
Because the only thing you ’ll ever use it for is as a prop in a setup for painting watercolor still lifes ( a bowl of fruit , a baguette , a crêpe pan ) .

Fondue and the pots that go with it
A fondue pot ( the contraptions run from $ 50 to $ 150 ) is almost as silly as fondue itself , a questionable ‘ 70s - era dinner party fad .
If you absolutely must have a fondue party , spend your money on a DVD of Ang Lee ’s “ The Ice Storm , ” and melt your cheese or chocolate in a double boiler or a Dutch oven instead .
Fondue forks ?
Use skewers -- or break out your real forks .

Of course , his fall was also softened by a golden parachute .
Nov. 3 , 2008  --
The radio DJ who pulled off one of the most spectacular prank phone calls of all time --- he punk'd Gov. Sarah Palin by posing as French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- said he simply began at the bottom of her staff and worked his way up to get the Republican vice presidential nominee on the telephone .
Marc -Antoine Audette of Montreal radio station CKOI said he could not believe his good fortune -- or the international sensation his audacious hoax caused .
Audette , posing as Sarkozy , had a seven - minute on - air conversation with an unsuspecting Palin that began innocently enough .
But before long , it had him talking about hunting from a helicopter , how his wife was " so hot in bed " and the Hustler magazine video " Nailin ' Pailin . "
The Palin campaign laughed the incident off .
" Gov. Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state , including the real President Sarkozy , and other celebrities in being targeted by these pranksters .
C'est la vie , " Palin spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said in a written statement .
Audette said the prank started with a call to Alaska .
" We started by calling the governor 's office in Alaska , and after that , we were transferred from one person to another .
It took us about four days .
We spoke to about a dozen people , and that 's how we were able to speak to her , " Audette told ABCNews .
" Call it luck , call it perseverance , call it what you want -- but I never thought we would be able to do it . "
Palin joins a long list of boldface names Audette and his radio partner Sebastien Trudel have punk'd .
Bill Gates , Tiger Woods , Mick Jaggar , Donald Trump and Britney Spears are just a few of their prominent victims .
It was hardly the kind of attention Palin needed in the closing hours of a campaign in which she has sometimes been ridiculed as a politician who is not ready for prime - time .
The stunt also touched off a debate about the operations of the McCain - Palin campaign .
" Can you imagine this happening to Barack Obama or to Joe Biden ? " said New York Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf .
" The people running her campaign are not adequately protecting her .
Either they are not doing their work , or they have given up -- which tells you the wheels are coming off the bus . "
But Daniel Schnur , the director of the Institute for Politics at the University of Southern California and the communications director of McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign , said , " I do n't think this incident says a whole lot . "
" Of all the things you want to do to get a vice presidential campaign to operate efficiently in the 60 or 70 days that it exists , having a protocol for screening phone calls from foreign leaders is pretty far down the list .
Give the disc jockeys some credit for pulling a fast one .
Give the campaign credit for taking it in good humor . "
Audette and Trudel flew to New York City Sunday night for a whirlwind of interviews .
Asked how they were able to dupe Palin 's staff and con the candidate , Audette told ABC News , " This will sound stupid , but mostly we just sound convincing . "
In dialing up Palin on Saturday , Audette , a French - Canadian , spoke English in a thick accident that was more Pepe Le Pew than Parisian .
" You know , I see you as president one day , too , " the faux Sarkozy said .
" Maybe in eight years , " Palin replied .
Audette , as Sarkozy , then told Palin he shared her interest in hunting and that they could " go hunting by helicopter like you did . "
He added in French that they could kill baby seals .
Switching back to English , he said , " I just love killing those animals .
Mmm , mmm , take away life , that is so fun .
I 'd really go , so long as we do n't bring along Vice President Cheney . "
" No .
I 'll be a careful shot , yes , " Palin replied .
The phony Sarkozy remarked that " we have a lot in common .
Also , except from my house , I can see Belgium . "
To which Palin replied , " Well , see , we 're right next door to different countries that we all need to be working with , yes . "
The fake French president then told Palin that his wife , the singer and songwriter Carla Bruni , was " hot in bed " and " jealous that I was supposed to speak to you today . "
He added that " I love the documentary they made on your life .
You know , Hustler 's ' Nailin ' Palin ' ? "
Palin answered , " Oh , good , thank you , yes , " Palin said obviously unaware of what he was talking about .
Audette said that most of the time , he is only able to use " 30 to 40 percent of the material " he and Trudel have written for their crank calls before the person they are conning realizes the put on .
" But with Mrs. Palin we got lucky , because we used all the material we had written .
At the end , we had to improvise . "
He added , " I was pretty nervous .
I was wondering if someone was listening and would cut us off , or that maybe Mrs. Palin would say , ' This is not the president of France . '
But once she started calling me Nicolas … I said , ' Maybe I have a chance .
Maybe this could work . '
It is something , is n't it ?
A lot of journalists would love to have a word with her .
We are pretty proud of what we did . "
WASHINGTON 
The ethics trial of Senator Ted Stevens heads to what should be a dramatic climax on Monday : a courtroom confrontation between Mr. Stevens and a Justice Department prosecutor that features a crucial telephone conversation .
Over the last three weeks , a federal jury has heard testimony and seen evidence from both sides .
But all of that could become secondary to what the jurors make of Mr. Stevens , who has made a calculated gamble in taking the stand as the trial ’s final witness .
Mr. Stevens , Republican of Alaska , is charged in seven felony counts with deliberately concealing $ 250,000 in gifts and services from a once - close friend , Bill Allen , to renovate his house in Girdwood , Alaska .
The government has asserted that Mr. Allen deployed his oil services company , Veco , to help remake the Stevens home from a modest A - frame cabin to a two - story residence with wraparound porches , a garage and amenities like an expensive gas grill , a workshop and a whirlpool .
Mr. Stevens , 84 , spent Friday on the stand laying out his defense : he was unaware that Veco or its workers had provided any help in the renovation .
He said he believed that the work had been done by other contractors whom his wife paid .
Michael Signator is Obama 's Man of Mystery
, a 50 - year - old police officer in suburban Chicago , is paid as one of 's campaign staffers -- nearly $ 50,000 during Obama 's Senate campaign in 2004 ; and $ 47,600 from March 2007 through August of this year -- yet no one knows what he looks like , and even Obama staffers did n't know he works for the campaign .
So just who is Michael Signator ?
Although his job description is to provide " supplemental security support " and to coordinate the Obama family 's personal and campaign schedules , Signator appears to be much more than an aide .
Signator owns a home west of Chicago , about an hour from Obama 's home , and also rents an apartment in Regents Park , just a few blocks from the Illinois senator 's Kenwood residence .
When Obama is at home , he works out regularly in the gym on the ground floor of the apartment building , but also occasionally stops by just to hang out with " Sig . "
Sometimes Obama has dropped by multiple times a day , particularly while he was weighing his choice of a running mate .
Obama 's presidential campaign refuses to release details of Signator 's role , citing security reasons , however , campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said it brings Signator into frequent , close contact with the Obamas .
We do know from Obama 's 2006 book , " The Audacity of Hope : Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream " that he was hired as Obama 's driver in 2004 and was the first person Obama informed after being invited to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention .
Obama writes that " the process by which I was selected as the keynote speaker remains something of a mystery to me . "
Though he had gotten word that Kerry wanted him to speak , Obama recalls he did n't know what type of billing he'd get .
Then , one afternoon , as Signator was driving him from Springfield , the state capital where Obama was a state senator , to Chicago , where he had an evening campaign event , Obama got a call from Kerry 's campaign manager , who asked him to keynote the convention .
After he hung up , Obama turned to Signator and said " I guess this is pretty big , " according to " Audacity . "
It reports that Signator nodded and said , " You could say that . "
Signator declined to comment on his relationship with Obama when Politico reached him by phone , saying he " ca n't do any type of interview at all , " directing them to contact the Obama campaign press office .
According to Politico , the campaign press staff at first denied that Signator worked for the campaign , then discouraged Politico from writing about him .
They declined to set up an interview .
There may be a reason other than security that the campaign does n't want Signator talking to the press .
During Obama 's 2004 Senate race , Signator accompanied Obama to an African - American parade in Chicago .
The crowd began chanting " O - ba-ma ! O - ba-ma ! O - ba-ma ! " giving the candidate such a passionate reception that Signator , Obama 's " driver and bodyguard , " joked that he " thought Barack was going to rise up over the people and start saying , ' My children , my children , I have come to free you . ' "
The comment is among the only quotes of Signator on record and furthers sentiments that Obama wants to be President of the world .

Hey There ,
This Saturday 's post is from a pretty interesting site dealing with all things Linux .
It goes by the name of reallylinux.com .
This piece , that I found on there , interested me because , especially in dubious economic times like we find ourselves in these days , I 'm often amazed at the sheer amount of diversity and depth of experience employers seek to acquire for less - than - bottom dollar .
I think I have a fair understanding of the basics of capitalism and a free - market economy , but some folks take it a bit too far .
If you need an Oracle expert , a Unix / Linux sysadmin , a Windows administrator , a Cisco network engineer and a technical manager to flesh out your IT staff , you should be writing up more than one work specification ;)
Maybe I 'm wrong .
Perhaps a good segment of our society out there , who are n't pathologically lying train - wrecks , can do it all and are willing to do so for just enough money per paycheck to inch them closer to homelessness ;)
In that spirit , I present this piece .
You can find the original version here , plus a few other goodies .
Enjoy and have a safe and happy Saturday :)
L inux Job Want Ads Gone Mad
by Walter V. Koenning , for reallylinux.com humor section .
Perhaps it 's a result of the massive
outsourcing of programmer skills ?
Or maybe it's a response to
ridiculous resumes where recent college graduates tout twenty years
of collective experience .
Resumes that include expertise with LISP
and Prolog , and list achievements such as replication of human brain
capacity through neural networks created with spare computer parts
and cottage cheese .
But the result is that Linux related
job ads have started to take on a rather mad style .
I 've seen a
rash of the most ridiculous want ads for Linux computer engineers .
Is the industry so bad off ?
Are some recruiters not getting enough
sleep ?
Here is an example for you to muse
over :
Wanted C/C++ Programmer with Linux
Experience
Opportunity to work in a large
enterprise environment with significant career growth .
Required skills include 10 years
experience with ANSI/C , C++ , TASM or related Assembly experience ,
Linux / UNIX kernel development , OOP experience , and at least 7 years
writing device drivers .
Starting salary $ 29,000 /yr .
Am I missing something ?
Is someone
actually paying for recruitment ads like this ?
This is the kind of
ad that makes me wonder seriously about the software industry .
This is not an isolated case .
I've
seen countless ads that offer ridiculous salaries for extremely
difficult work .
Writing device drivers is no cup of tea .
It's
often a grueling , thankless , taxing job that few are willing to do
even if they can do it .
I 've seen similar ads recently on
some of the big technology websites , offering hourly wages for
writing code .
Here are some quotes :
" Hourly $ 25 - $ 35 based on experience ;
Required : C , UNIX , SQL , Java , embedded Linux "
" $ 45 k Required skills : 8 yrs C programming in the Linux or Unix environment "
On another ad ,
" Caltech , MIT or Berkeley grads
highly preferred . "
No bias at all , really !
They also include " essentials " such
as :
" superior communication skills ,
writing skills and ability to work across teams and organizations "
My favorite one :
" possess aptitude to implement code
and manage the team "
Include tech management as a throw in
for software engineering ... sure why not !
I 've seen management jobs paid as
mid - level tech jobs .
The way the company gets around this is
to advertise it as a " team leader " opportunity .
Hey , why not
manage a handful of programmers while writing C code until 2am ?
After all , you 're expected to live in the office anyway , might as
well get to know the team and write up their annal reviews , work out
vacation scheduling , and address personnel problems so someone else
does n't have to .
These jobs often have salary listings
so outrageous I have to wonder if someone can possibly reply to them .
When they do include something substantial financially , they often
add a statement like :
" must be willing to work 70 + hrs/wk
and weekends "
If this trend continues , and if people
do n't wake up and realize the challenge of finding good code
writers , we may end up having to face ads similar to this :
Wanted : Demi-god Software Programmer
Capability to write code for any device
including pacemakers , wrist watches and staplers .
Requires expertise in all languages
invented since Pascal , and preferably including every toolset and
language with a three letter word ( OOP , ASM .
ARM , iHA , CLI , GSM , ATG ,
XML ) .
Although advertised as a Linux
programmer job , must be willing to write code for any OS including :
BSD , UNIX , Windows NT , Solaris , Windows CE , Amiga DOS , and VMS VAX .
Must be willing to kiss your family
goodbye and work your life off in an enclosed cubicle .
Must be capable of producing at least
30,000 lines of code per week while ingesting coffee that tastes like
river silt .
Must be willing to take any salary we
post and grovel during the interview for an extra $ 300 per month ,
which will be promptly deducted to pay for the increasing health care
costs .
Must be ready to work immediately , with
or without a computer or chair .
In fact , we prefer BYOC , bring your
own computer .
Send us your resume ASAP in order for
us to create the longest possible delay in response time .

( CNN ) -- Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday said Sen. Barack Obama has ties to a Columbia University professor who she said is " a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization . "
The Obama campaign said on its Web site that " ugly insinuations about Barack Obama 's relationship with a former neighbor and university colleague ... are completely false . "
The professor has denied he was a spokesman for the Palestine Liberation Organization .
Palin said her assertion " is not negative campaigning to call someone out on their record . "
" It seems that there is yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with Barack Obama going back several years , " Palin said at an event in Bowling Green , Ohio .
" This is important because his associate , Rashid Khalidi ... in addition to being a political ally of Barack Obama , he 's a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization . "
Watch Palin say the LA Times is ' kowtowing ' to Obama »
Sen .
John McCain 's campaign repeatedly has sought to tie Obama to former 1960s radical William Ayers , who co-founded the Weather Underground .
Ayers is a professor at the University of Illinois .
Khalidi is a leading scholar of Middle Eastern studies at Columbia , and he was a contemporary of Obama 's while on the faculty of the University of Chicago .
Read : Palin blasts Obama for ties to Palestinian professor
Article Correction
An earlier version of this story contained incorrect information about the Palestine Liberation Organization 's relations with the United States and Israel .
Neither Israel nor the United States currently consider the PLO a terrorist organization .
Khalidi has been a harsh critic of U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and has accused the country of " occupying " Palestinian territories .
But he has denied acting as a PLO spokesman during a seven - year period in the 1970s and 1980s .
Khalidi said Wednesday , " I am not speaking to the media at this time , and certainly not until this idiot wind passes . "
The Obama campaign called Palin 's remarks " another recycled , manufactured controversy from the McCain campaign to distract voters ' attention from John McCain 's lockstep support for George Bush 's economic policies . "
In April , the Los Angeles Times published an article about a going - away dinner for Khalidi that Obama attended in Chicago , Illinois , in 2003 .
Khalidi was leaving to become a professor at Columbia .
Watch McCain push Obama 's link to Khalidi »
The paper reported that a young Palestinian - American woman recited a poem at the farewell party that accused the Israeli government of terrorism for its treatment of Palestinians and was highly critical of U.S. support of Israel .
The McCain campaign accused the Los Angeles paper of " intentionally suppressing " a videotape it obtained from that dinner and demanded that it release the footage .
The Times said it wo n't release the footage because a reporter promised a source that the video would not be made public .
Asked why the McCain campaign was bringing the matter up six months after the article appeared , an aide replied , " Because we are one week away from potentially electing Barack Obama . "
At an event Wednesday in Raleigh , North Carolina , Obama said McCain has spent the last few days calling him " every name in the book . "
" I do n't know what 's next .
By the end of the week , he 'll be accusing me of being a secret communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten .
I shared my peanut butter and jelly sandwich , " Obama said .
Watch Obama scoff at ' socialist ' label »
Earlier Wednesday , Palin delivered her second policy address of the campaign season .
Palin said she and McCain are determined to put the country on " a path toward energy independence " and charged that an Obama administration would hinder that process .
Palin pointed to her experience as governor as evidence she can help the U.S. achieve energy security .
" Whatever the good ol ' boys are running these days , I know it 's not the state of Alaska , " she said in Toledo , Ohio .
Palin said that by relying on oil from the Middle East , " we not only provide wealth to the sponsors of terror , but we provide high - value targets to the terrorists themselves . "
The Alaska governor stressed expanding drilling , using nuclear power and tapping into the " American ingenuity " to solve the energy problem .
" Energy security is one of the great questions in this election , " Palin said .
" Sometimes I think it 's no wonder that our opponents do n't want to talk a whole lot about this , because they do n't get it . "
Achieving energy security , Palin said , requires a " clean break " from the policies of the Bush administration and from " 30 years ' worth of failed energy policies in Washington . "
Palin described the energy plans of Obama and Sen. Joe Biden as a " long , labored agenda of inaction . "
The Obama campaign sent out a response from Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland , which said , " Palin attacked her own running mate 's record today by blaming our oil addiction on ' 30 years of failure ' in Washington . "
Later Wednesday , McCain was scheduled to appear on CNN's " Larry King Live " at 9 p.m. ET .
Watch McCain say Obama is at the ' far left ' of American politics »
That interview comes after a 30 - minute Obama campaign ad , which airs during prime - time television Wednesday .
It 's the first time in 16 years that a presidential candidate has bought a slot in prime time to make his closing argument .
The half - hour ad was set to run on NBC , CBS , Fox and Univision at 8 p.m. ET .
The spot , which is estimated to have cost about $ 5 million , includes a live segment from Florida , with voters discussing their problems and Obama laying out his plans for the country .
CNN declined the Obama campaign 's request to air the ad.
CNN said it did not want to pre-empt its programming lineup with a 30 - minute paid commercial program .
Obama 's closing effort also includes an appearance on Comedy Central 's " The Daily Show " and a late - night rally in Kissimmee , Florida , with former President Clinton .
Republicans have been poking fun at Obama 's prime - time blitz .
The McCain campaign released an ad Wednesday morning that says , " Behind the fancy speeches , the grand promises , the TV specials lies the truth ... Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs , and it shows . "
The poll of polls consists of eight surveys : ARG ( October 25 - 27 ) , IPSOS - McClatchy ( October 23 - 27 ) , Pew ( October 23 - 26 ) , ABC / Washington Post ( October 24 - 27 ) , Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby ( October 26 - 28 ) , Gallup ( October 26 - 28 ) , Diageo / Hotline ( October 26 - 28 ) , and IBD / TIPP ( October 24 - 28 ) .
There is no sampling error .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. securities regulators on Tuesday gave the financial industry a reprieve from marking hard - to - value assets down to fire sale prices , throwing a lifeline to an industry beset by strained credit markets and the latest round of bank failures .

The U.S. stock market added to gains on the news , in hopes that regulators ’ new interpretation of fair value , or mark - to - market , accounting rules , will slow or reverse the heavy flow of mortgage - related losses on banks ’ balance sheets .
In the new guidance , first reported by Reuters , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reminded financial services firms that they do n’t need to use fire sale prices when evaluating their hard to price assets .
“ This is a significant first step and adds stability , confidence , and liquidity within the capital markets , ” said Steve Bartlett , president and chief executive of The Financial Services Roundtable .
“ By clarifying how to treat assets in an uncertain market , the SEC is continuing to provide transparency to investors and helping institutions to provide credit in periods of market stress . ”
U.S. accounting rule maker , the Financial Accounting Standards Board said on its Web site on Tuesday that it would change the agenda for its Wednesday meeting to focus on fair value accounting .
The board is contemplating issuing additional guidance through a FASB staff position as soon as Wednesday , according to a person familiar with the matter .
MARK-TO-ESTIMATE
The SEC ’s guidance on Tuesday , came on the last day of the third quarter for most U.S. companies , allowing them to incorporate the changes in their next round of financial statements .
In a document on the matter , the SEC reaffirmed that management ’s internal assumptions can be used to measure fair value when relevant market evidence does not exist .
U.S. accounting rule makers assume that the factors used to come up with fair values are based on an orderly transaction between willing market participants .
The SEC document said that “ distressed or forced liquidation sales are not orderly transactions . ”
“ This guidance will help auditors more accurately price assets that are difficult to value under current market conditions , ” said Edward Yingling , president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association , whose group has been among several pressuring the SEC to clarify the rules for months .
Under U.S. accounting rules , assets can be valued based on a simple price quote in an active market .
But the hardest to value assets are often based entirely on management ’s best estimate derived from mathematical models .
However , as credit markets seized up this year , many banks were forced to rely on models to value complex mortgage securities that used to trade in more active markets .
Critics have complained that accountants forced banks to base their values on fire sale prices in illiquid markets instead of the so - called level 3 input , or unobservable factors , such as the mathematical models used to evaluate their securities .
The SEC ’s guidance says that sometimes the level 3 inputs may be more appropriate than the so - called level 2 , or observable factors .
“ In essence , the SEC wants to stop the avalanche of declining prices , ” said Tom Sowanick , chief investment officer at Clearbrook Financial .
Sowanick said that the new guidance should allow banks to rely more on their own assumptions when they determine fair value rather than the distressed sale prices occurring in the markets .
But fair value accounting has been popular with many investors who said it greatly increased transparency about the risks banks are facing .
“ This letter ( SEC document ) could be titled , pick a number , any number , as it gives bankers great leeway in choosing what numbers they will give to investors , ” said Lynn Turner , who served as chief accountant at the SEC from 1998 through 2001 .
Others , however , said that the changes have not gone far enough .
In a letter to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox on Tuesday a bipartisan group of more than 60 U.S. lawmakers urged the SEC to suspend the fair value accounting rule immediately .
“ Fair value accounting is a utopian dream that ran into the reality of business and litigation , ” said Chris Whalen , co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics , which provides ratings and analytical tools to investors .
“ Equating an opinion with a market price is crazy , ” he continued .
“ It does n’t matter who gives the opinion -- the auditor is still going to say to the client , ‘ Why do n’t you write it down ? ’ ”
Under U.S. accounting rules , a “ Level 1 ” asset can be marked - to - market based on a simple price quote in an active market .
However , the price of a “ Level 2 ” asset is “ mark - to - model ” and is estimated based on observable market prices and inputs .
A “ Level 3 ” asset is so illiquid that its value is based entirely on management ’s best estimate derived from complex mathematical models .
The Android 7.1.2 update that Google has released is causing some major issues on the Pixel devices .
We remind you that this was the latest update that the big search engine company has released and both the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL devices have some serious problems with it .
While the update comes with several bug fixes and improvements , it appears that it ’s also causing some issues related to the fingerprint scanner .
In addition , it also brings other annoying errors , which Google will most likely fix sometime in the near future .
In concordance with Android Police , there are users who have reported that the fingerprint on their Nexus and Pixel devices has stopped working right after they ’ve updated to Android 7.1.2 Nougat .
The affected devices are : Nexus 5X , Nexus 6P , Pixel and Pixel XL .
The users have also tried to fix the issue by themselves by removing the pre-existing fingerprints and adding new ones .
However , that did n’t solve the problem and an error is appearing when trying to add new prints to the handset .
Google has not stated anything about these issues , but there are rumors saying that the big search engine company is already working on a fix for the fingerprint problem .
We also have to mention that there are some Pixel and Pixel XL owners who have complained that their devices have some Bluetooth setup problems .
However , we remind you that this problem has been present since the February security patch was released .
It seems that the Bluetooth feature is failing to connect to cars , which is quite annoying for the users who are using this option while driving .
Have you updated your Pixel or Pixel XL device to Android 7.1.2 Nougat ?

It was a well thought out concept with great vision , but a bad start with constant outages , excuses and no plan in place for scalability .
Entrecard just committed suicide yesterday by changing the rules of their forum .
The Entrecard forums are by far the best value this startup has to offer , and there not state - of - the - art , far from it !
If they had VBulletin or PHPBB I would have a different opinion .
The Entrecard forums ( Marketing forum ) no longer allows members to pay credits to other members to submit , comment or vote your blogs with any social network or bookmark .
This is not the only thing that ruined Entrecard .
The so - called owner / CEO call him what you want is non-existent .
You hardly hear anything exciting other than his announcements about the low cost of $ 50 per month for a 125 ×125 banner advertisement .
It ’s not worth $ 50 to advertise at Entrecard , as their traffic is dropping faster than a piano falling from a 10 story building .
Here are some facts :
I check the Alexa ranking every week and the activity in the Entrecard forums .
You will only see the same 15 to 20 members each day submitting requests , selling credits , etc .
Entrecard announced in their blog that they have 15 thousand members and growing .
They may have 15 thousand members , but there are 14,980 members that no longer participate .
The value of an EC credit is dropping like Sirius Satellite stock .

Kaleb Tierce : Teacher Trades Good Grades for Sex
, a 26 year old high school teacher in Tuscola , Texas until March of this year , has been indicted on three counts of attempted improper relationship between educator and student .
If convicted of the 3rd degree felony he could be sentenced to 2 - 10 years in prison .
Tierce was charged on Thursday and turned himself in on Friday .
He has been released on $ 30,000 bail for the alleged incidents that occurred in 2005 and came to light recently .
Tierce , who taught English and served as assistant football coast at Jim Ned High School , was suspended last year after an investigation was mounted regarding his freshman English reading list .
One book in particular , Child of God , is the story of a murderer who had sex with his dead victims .
During the ensuing firestorm over that controversy , several female students came forward regarding inappropriate behavior that had occurred with Tierce .
He reportedly asked one female student what she 'd do to get a better grade .
Taylor County Sheriff Sgt. John Cummins said , " Tierce asked one girl over to his house under a normal pretense and then allegedly kissed her and exposed himself to her .
A third girl reported that he asked her for sexual favors .
School trustees voted in March not to renew Tierce 's contract based upon the Child of God book fiasco and well before the newest allegations ' hit the fan ' .
A purse party should be a fun gathering of handbag - loving gal pals , not a violent happening to rival an episode of Jerry Springer !
But just try telling that to a couple of women in Missouri City !
Carla Lester and her mother Joyce Payne are the kind of angry women we love to read about , but we 'd never invite them to a party .
They entered the room where the guests were waiting to see the handbags , and apparently did n't like what they saw !
No one 's exactly sure what set the dynamic duo off , but they began to yell at the waiting women and jab their fingers in their faces .
As any attacked woman would do , one retaliated .
With her fists .
According to the The Houston Press it soon became an all - out scuffle .
Ms Payne slashed one woman on the neck and arm with an unknown cutting instrument , while her mother brandished a Louisville Slugger in a threatening manner !
Needless to say , the manic mother and daughter were both charged with assault .
Maybe I 'm just not attending the right soirees , but I do n't think I 've ever been to a purse party which had any weapons just lying around !
I guess they do things a little differently in Missouri City !

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
In chaos theory , the “ butterfly effect ” is the idea that a tiny flap of wings in one country will contribute to a reaction in another that can wildly alter the weather of , possibly , both .
The current global credit typhoon has its own butterflies .
Among them : a modest 2002 home purchase in , say , Stockton , California — financed with a nonprime , or otherwise faulty , mortgage loan .
By the time that home in Stockton was supporting two or three ill - advised loans in 2005 , those loans had disappeared into packages called asset - backed securities ( ABS ) , then were to global banks , insurance companies , and pension funds — particularly in Europe .
Like their US counterparts , the European financiers bought boatloads with borrowed money .
Then they , too , shoved them off books into Structured Investment Vehicles that required no capital charge and little reporting .
With US investment banks making huge profits from packaging churning loans , volume in mortgage securities exploded .
US investment banks then added another link to the chain , repackaging ABS securities into CDOs , or collateralized debt obligations .
In that way , the Belgian - Dutch bank Fortis ( and others ) came to own a piece of Stockton .
If one Stockton home defaults , the global effect is miniscule .
But if lots of home loans go under , the damage reverberates globally — just as it is now .
The current global fallout might have been manageable , if banks had n’t entered a massively interconnected circle of $ 55 trillion worth of privately negotiated credit default swaps .
But that was n’t the case .
While European institutions are getting hit mostly by exposure to toxic US assets , mortgage markets in the UK and Spain also are coming under increasing pressure .
The bigger problem is the global borrowing still going on .
With an average leverage of 10 times , we could be looking at an eventual $ 14 trillion systemwide loss .
That ’s a dark scenario , which is why it ’s imperative that the US government help homeowners in Stockton keep their homes by backing renegotiated lower mortgages with lenders .
John McCain explicitly mentioned this in the last presidential debate .
Barack Obama noted that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson ’s $ 700 billion purchase plan , vague as it was , contained the ability to do this .
Meanwhile , as the leaders of central banks throughout the world realize they are all in this together , they will be forced to keep injecting capital into the banking system .
And , hopefully , to do some thinking .
Three weeks ago , the Federal Reserve decided that saving Merrill Lynch could be accomplished by giving it to Bank of America .
Since everyone calling the shots in Washington has been spectacularly ineffective in preventing the downward spiral of the financial system so far , one wonders why other bank mergers are now going through without examination .
Moreover , why are European banks heading in the same direction ?
Merging murky books with deteriorating ones is not a recipe for strength and stability .
In the absence of a controllable framework , central banks around the world are paying for the excess of an unregulated financial system .
What we need is a Glass - Steagall Act for our times .
Can we regulate the $ 55 trillion credit derivatives industry unleashed by the US Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 ?
Can we have higher global capital requirements going forward , or put a structure in place that will both contain the current fallout and avoid future credit typhoons ?
It ’s time to find out .
In the wild ride that is the McCain presidential campaign , Steve Schmidt has been at the wheel , steering -- some say careering -- from Paris Hilton to Sarah Palin , from abrupt “ suspension ” to abrupt restart .
Schmidt is McCain ’s day - to - day operations boss .
Retained in a summer shake - up intended to right McCain ’s faltering campaign , Schmidt , 38 , quickly put his stamp on the operation , aggressively attacking Democratic nominee Barack Obama , often with biting ridicule , and vying to dominate every day ’s news cycle .
It ’s an approach that would be familiar to Californians .
Schmidt managed Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s reelection campaign two years ago .
Advertisement
But pundits and Republicans have been left confused , particularly after McCain , in a head - spinning 72 - hour period , canceled campaign appearances to work on the Wall Street bailout plan , tried to postpone the first presidential debate , and then showed up after all .
Schmidt tends to shrug off the criticism .
When two high - profile Republicans , unaware their microphones were hot , disparaged Palin , the governor of Alaska and McCain ’s running mate , on national cable television last month , Schmidt offered a two - word reaction : “ Who cares ? ”
For a time , Schmidt ’s tactics seemed to work .
Team McCain was practicing a political jujitsu that kept the Republican close in polls when the Democratic standard - bearer , given George Bush ’s unpopularity , should have had a significant lead .
The effort peaked with the choice of Palin as McCain ’s running mate .
Convinced that McCain needed a dramatic gesture to make the race competitive , Schmidt pressed McCain to pluck the Alaska governor from obscurity .
Advertisement
Other than the candidates , no one in the operation has more riding on that decision than Schmidt .
And no one has worked harder to turn the decision into a success .
He defended Palin against what he called sexist attacks , and traveled to Alaska to brief her before her first TV interviews .
For three days , he was ensconced at McCain ’s spread in Sedona , Ariz. , helping Palin prepare for her performance on the biggest night of her career : the debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Joe Biden .
But a month from election day , Schmidt faces his most difficult professional challenge .
McCain has dropped in polls as Washington struggled to find a solution to a reeling Wall Street .
Polls show voters trust Obama more than McCain to fix the economy .
“ He could run the greatest campaign in the history of campaigns and still lose by a landslide , ” said consultant Chris Lehane , a California Democrat who has worked with Schmidt on several projects for corporate clients .
“ Given the current political environment , the Democrats could nominate a refrigerator and still win . ”
Advertisement
Schmidt -- 6 feet tall , 220 pounds , his head shaved -- is fully aware that his presence can be intimidating .
No less a figure than Bush strategist Karl Rove bestowed on Schmidt the nickname “ Bullet , ” though he and Rove dismiss accounts that he is a Rove protege .
“ He has worked very hard to construct this public persona because it serves him , ” said Dan Schnur , a former McCain advisor who directs the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at USC .
“ A few soft , quiet few syllables from Steve Schmidt can be more terrifying than screaming from someone else . ”
Earlier this year , Schmidt paused from a conversation in his office in Arlington , Va. , and turned up the volume on CNN .
Obama was delivering his speech to 200,000 people in Berlin , and Schmidt winced , acknowledging that Obama is a very polished speaker .
A map of the United States on the wall over Schmidt ’s shoulder served as a low - tech tracking system .
A photo of McCain was pinned to Ohio , showing the candidate was in the state that could decide the election .
Schmidt saw McCain ’s appearance at a German restaurant as far more valuable than the international acclaim showered on Obama ’s turn on a German stage .
Advertisement
Soon after , McCain employed the classic tactic of turning his foe ’s strength -- his oratory skills and popularity -- against him .
Schmidt took a direct hand in the ads that ridiculed Obama by likening his celebrity to Paris Hilton’s .
“ We had been discussing the necessity of digging underneath the Obama facade , ” said Bill Kenyon , a partner in the firm Strategic Perception , which produces McCain ’s commercials .
“ The celebrity thing is something that he suggested . ”
Under Schmidt , the campaign is a tightly run operation .
Previously , McCain allowed reporters almost unfettered access .
Under Schmidt , the candidate went 40 days without a news conference .
Schmidt ’s hard - nosed determination to control the slightest detail is irksome to some members of McCain ’s staff .
One senior aide referred to Schmidt as “ message Nazi . ”
Advertisement
There is , however , another side to Schmidt .
On the day after Palin addressed the GOP convention in a speech that energized the party ’s religious conservatives , Schmidt showed up at a Log Cabin Republicans event and matter - of - factly told gay Republicans that they were “ important to the fabric of this party ” and that his sister and her partner were an important part of his life .
“ I encourage you to keep fighting for what you believe , because the day is going to come , ” he said .
Patrick Sammon , the group ’s president , said , “ I do n’t think anyone could imagine Karl Rove going to a Log Cabin event . ”
The Log Cabin appearance aside , Schmidt ’s pedigree is enough to give chills to Democrats in California , a blue state .
In 1998 , looking to make his mark as a consultant , the green 27 - year - old made his way to California from New Jersey .
He was recruited to run Tim Leslie ’s race for lieutenant governor and later Matt Fong ’s U.S. Senate bid .
Advertisement
“ Pragmatic politics , ” Leslie said , describing Schmidt ’s philosophy .
“ His major concern is how you win the election .
If there were two candidates and one was more conservative , I really could n’t tell you which he would choose . ”
Leslie and Fong lost in the Democratic landslide a decade ago .
Schmidt headed East , where he rose in GOP circles .
He became Vice President Dick Cheney ’s spokesman , and oversaw President Bush ’s 2004 reelection “ war room ” -- the cadre of operatives responsible for attacking Massachusetts Sen.
John F. Kerry and responding to any charges against Bush .
Schmidt then was entrusted with managing the Senate confirmation of John G. Roberts Jr. as chief justice in 2005 , and Samuel A. Alito Jr. as associate justice in 2006 .
With such credentials , it might seem odd that Schmidt found his way back to California .
California First Lady Maria Shriver , niece of President Kennedy and one of Obama ’s more prominent backers , set out to find the ideal campaign manager for Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s reelection .
Several friends recommended Schmidt .

After Schwarzenegger won what turned out to be an easy reelection , Schmidt set up the Sacramento branch of Mercury Public Affairs , a New York - based lobbying , consulting and public affairs firm .
He has said he has no intention of returning East .
The office is a few blocks from the Capitol , next to a tattoo parlor .
A few vanity items on his office walls recount wins from his White House days .
One is a Senate roll - call card tallying the 78 - 22 vote to confirm Roberts .
A second tally sheet shows the 48 - 42 vote for Alito .
On one of the cards , Cheney scribbled : “ Steve , You do great work .
2 for 2 on the Supreme Court .
Dick ”
A third keepsake , inscribed a few days after Bush ’s reelection , reads : “ Steve , I meant what I said Thursday .
Victory would have been impossible without you .
Best , Karl . ”

Shares of Apple are on the rise after Bernstein Research upgraded the Mac maker and said a new MacBook priced at $ 900 would broaden the company 's potential notebook customer base by 50 percent in terms of both units and revenue .
" We are upgrading Apple to Outperform - while reducing our target price from $ 175 to $ 135 , " analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a research note to clients .
" We believe that the stock is overly discounted , that Apple 's short - term financials are likely to remain relatively healthy despite economic weakness , and that the company 's longer term growth story remains intact . "
Sacconaghi turned a particular focus to Mac growth , which he said is the " biggest wildcard among Apple investors today . "
He said that even if the global PC market remains flat in 2009 and Apple 's share gains slow by 25 percent , the company would still see approximately 13 percent Mac growth .
" We feel confident that Apple will be a share gainer , as the company continues to expand distribution and purchase intention remains high , " the analyst wrote .
" Perhaps most importantly , we expect Apple to lower price points to address a much broader market at some point over the next year . "
To this end , Sacconaghi pointed to a recent internal analysis which revealed that a MacBook priced at $ 900 would expand Apple 's addressable notebook market by nearly 50 percent on a revenue basis , and 67 percent in terms of units .
Should rumors of a $ 800 MacBook prove true , it would broaden the company 's addressable market by 69 percent in terms of revenue , the study found .
While such moves would undoubtedly pressure gross margins , the analyst notes that the company already factored this into its forecasts when it guided gross margins down 150 basis points for fiscal 2009 even given the expected positive impact from iPhone sales .
" Apple 's cost structure has high variable costs , creating less earnings downside risk than many investors may realize , " he added .
" Given its extensive use of contract manufacturing , Apple 's COGS ( Cost of Goods Sold ) are nearly entirely variable , and operating expenses relative to gross margins are low ; the upshot is that Apple 's earnings per share suffers less to a given revenue reduction than many of its peers . "
In the short term , Sacconaghi said predicting Apple 's share price and direction may prove difficult given a number of factors , which could lead to fluctuations between $ 75 and $ 135 .
In particular , he said the company 's upcoming revenue guidance for the December quarter could apply new pressure on shares .
The Street is looking for sales just shy of $ 11 billion for the three - month period , but given the company 's traditional practice of providing conservative estimates , management could wind up guiding $ 1 billion below expectations .
Also complicating matters is the difficult compare that exists between the December quarter of 2007 and the December quarter of 2008 , namely expectations of a more than 20 percent fall - off in iPod revenues , a tougher consumer spending environment , and the absence of software revenue generated by last year 's Leopard launch .
Looking a bit further down the line , the Bernstein analyst said he 's confident Apple 's secular growth story remains in tact .
He expects Macs to continue to grow at least 9 - 10 percent annually , and said Apple TV holds the potential to " act as the centerpiece of the digital home , and could ultimately morph into a capable set - top box replacement . "
In the meantime , he believes the company holds a " unique opportunity " to convert its iPod install base — estimated at 120 to 130 million — to iPhones .
Shares of Apple were trading up $ 8.40 ( or 8.69 percent ) to $ 105.20 amid a broader market upswing .

This is one of several articles planned as supplements to the original “ How to Learn ( But Not Master ) Any Language in 1 Hour . ”
This piece focuses on acquisition of new material ; for reactivating “ forgotten ” languages and vocab , I recommend also reading “ How to Resurrect Your High School Spanish … or Any Language . ”
Let us begin …
From the academic environments of Princeton University ( Chinese , Japanese , Korean , Italian ) and the Middlebury Language Schools ( Japanese ) , to the disappointing results observed as a curriculum designer at Berlitz International ( Japanese , English ) , I have sought for more than 10 years to answer a simple question : why do most language classes simply not work ?
After testing the waters with more than 20 languages and achieving conversational and written fluency in 6 , I have identified several cardinal sins that , when fixed , can easily cut the time to fluency by 50 - 80 % …
1. Teachers are viewed as saviors when materials are actually the determining factor .
Teachers are merely conduits for the material and sequencing .
By analogy , it is better to have a decent cook with excellent easy - to - follow recipe than a great cook with terrible recipe .
It is the material that will restrict or elevate the teacher , and a good teacher forced to follow bad material will hinder , not hasten , learning progress .
I do n’t sit in on classes or otherwise consider a school until I ’ve reviewed both hand - out materials and text books .
Judge materials before you judge teachers , and no matter what , do not begin with classes or texts that solely use the target language ( e.g. , Spanish textbooks in Spanish ) .
This approach reflects a school ’s laziness and willingness to hire monolingual teachers , not the result of their search for the ideal method .
2. Classes move as slowly as the slowest student .
Seek a school with daily homework assignments that eliminate — effectively fire — students from the class who do n’t perform .
The school should have a strict curriculum that does n’t bend for a minority of the class who ca n’t cope .
Downgrading students is only possible in larger schools with at least five proficiency levels for separate classes — beginner , intermediate , and advanced is woefully inadequate .
Students can only be moved if the jumps between classes are relatively small and there are a sufficient number of students at each level for the school to justify paying separate teachers .
At the Hartnackschule in Berlin , Germany , where I studied for 10 weeks after evaluating a dozen schools , there are at least 20 different skill levels .
3. Conversation can be learned but not taught .
Somewhat like riding a bike , though unfortunately not as permanent , language fluency is more dependent on practicing the right things than learning the right things .
The rules ( grammar ) can be learned through materials and classes , but the necessary tools ( vocabulary and idiomatic usage ) will come from independent study and practice in a native environment .
I achieved fluency in German in 10 weeks using a combination of grammatical practice at the Hartnackschule ( four hours daily for the first month , two hours daily for the second ) and daily two - person language exchanges with students of English .
Grammar can be learned with writing exercises in a class of 20 , whereas “ conversation ” cannot be learned in anything but a realistic one - on - one environment where your brain is forced to adapt to normal speed and adopt coping mechanisms such as delaying tactics ( “ in other words , ” “ let me think for a second , ” etc. ) .
Separate grammar from conversation practice .
I recommend choosing one school for grammar and several native books or comics to identify sticking points , which are then discussed in one - one - one language exchanges , where your partner provides examples of usage and does not explain rules .
Getting into trouble in Greek and Chinese in Athens with the help of Stefanos Kofopoulos , ouzo , and wine .
4. Teachers are often prescriptive instead of descriptive .
Many teachers take it upon themselves to be arbiters of taste and linguistic conservationists , refusing to explain slang and insisting on correct but essentially unused grammatical constructions ( e.g. , “ with whom were you speaking ? ” versus “ who were you speaking to ? ” ) .
Progress will be faster when you find a teacher who describes rather than prescribes usage .
They should be able and willing to explain , for example , how Konjunktiv II is generally used in place of Konjunktiv I in German , even though it is technically incorrect .
They should also be able to save you time by explaining what to practice based on actual frequency of use , not inclusion in a grammar text .
For example , the simple past is almost always used in place of the perfect tense in Argentina , but some teachers still spend equal time on both .
To avoid those who act as defenders of language purity , it is often easier to target 20 - 30 - year old teachers and those who are good at teaching inductively ( providing examples to explain principles ) .
Ask them to explain a few common colloquial grammatical constructions before signing up .
In conclusion — the learner is the problem ( what ? )
The above sins certainly inhibit the speed of learning , but the principal problem is the learner his or herself , who — more often than not —uses classes as a substitute for , and not supplement to , real ego - crushing interaction .
Classes are easily used to infinitely postpone making the thousands of mistakes necessary to achieve fluency .
In boxing , they say “ everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face . ”
Well , in language learning , we could just as easily say that “ everyone has the perfect conversation in mind until they speak to a real native . ”
Do n’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first - person singular ( I ) and second - person singular ( you ) in the past , present , and future tenses , along with common phrases that illustrate them .
Throw in a few auxilaries ( to want to V , to need to V , to like to V , etc. ) and jump on a plane before learning any more of what you ’ll just need to relearn anyway .
Even after you land , you do not need more than two months of classes in - country , and remember that , like training wheels , the goal is get off of them as quickly as possible .
Do n’t go to classes because you have no social network outside of class , or because you want the illusion of progress with a coddling teacher who understands your Tarzan attempts at her language .
If you are taking classes because they are enjoyable , fine , but understand that you are better off spending time elsewhere .
Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments .
Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense , particularly the small understandable mistakes .
I was able to pass the Certificado de Espanol Avanzado , the most diffucult Spanish certification test in South America , in eight weeks , which is said to require near - native fluency and years of immersion .
How ?
By following the above fixes and making more mistakes in eight weeks than most make in eight years .
“ An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field , ” or so said Physicist Niels Bohr .
Luckily , you do n’t need to be a rocket scientist to use his advice .
Choose schools carefully and then , once they ’ve served their purpose , abandon them .
The real world is where mistakes are made , weaknesses are found , and fluency is achieved .

Jeff Elizalde 's patriotism is as plain as the U.S. flags in his Salem condo , rescued after parades or blown from car lots .
Elizalde has cleaned , pressed and hung them across his windows and walls , next to framed tributes to a World War II radioman -- his dad .
But beyond the stacks of Marine Corps Times and the " USMC " tattoos on each biceps , Elizalde 's own military career is nothing to celebrate .
He was discharged under conditions " other than honorable " after an incident he says " set me into a pattern of drinking and ruined my life . "
Elizalde says he was an 18 - year - old Marine playing spades on an Okinawa , Japan , base in November 1977 when he followed a staff sergeant to look for another party .
As they walked through an empty Quonset hut , he says , the sergeant overpowered and raped him .
" I did n't tell anybody , " Elizalde , 49 , said .
" I did n't know how .
How do you tell someone in the Marine Corps you 've been raped ? "
As the nation grapples with the aftershocks of two long wars , the Department of Veterans Affairs is confronting a quiet wave of veterans with mental health problems linked to sexual misconduct .
New research has uncovered hundreds of cases among those serving in Afghanistan and Iraq , and found that those combat vets are two to three times likelier to suffer depression , post - traumatic stress syndrome , and alcohol and drug abuse .
Help for military sexual trauma
Portland VA 's Mental Health Access Clinic at 503-273-5058 or outside Portland at 800-949-1004 ext. 56409
Earlier this year , Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash . , introduced legislation to provide more money to the VA to treat such cases and strengthen protection for women who seek help .
Congress will not consider the matter this year .
But Murray said Thursday that she 'll relaunch the initiative in January .
She said she acted after " women would pull me aside and whisper in my ear " about being harassed and even raped while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The VA reports that between 2002 and 2007 , 59,345 male veterans and 57,637 female veterans screened positive for some sexual trauma during military service .
In April , clinical psychologist and retired Navy Reserve Capt .
Connie Lee Best warned U.S. senators that sexually traumatized veterans will further swell the wave of mental health needs that will hit in years to come .
" To quote a line ... from ' Jaws ' when one of the characters saw the shark for the first time , " Best said , " We 're going to need a bigger boat . "

In April 2008 , nearly 400 women veterans from Oregon , Washington and Idaho gathered in Pendleton to celebrate their military service , dating to World War II .
They packed one workshop to trade war stories -- of sexual harassment and rape .
" I have that topic at every conference because it's a huge issue with women in the military , and it 's something they do n't talk about if they do n't feel free or safe , " says Valerie Conley , women veterans coordinator for the Oregon Department of Veterans ' Affairs .
Conley was never assaulted .
But after joining the Army in 1982 , the 27 - year - old mother and two other women in their transportation company " took a lot of harassment . "
" It was not teasing , " Conley said .
" It was more vile than teasing .
You did n't walk anywhere alone .
I got to the point where I would n't even walk to the mess hall by myself . "
Most Americans did n't link sexual misconduct to the U.S. military until Tailhook , the raunchy three - day reunion of Navy and Marine aviators in 1991 at which 83 women and seven men were assaulted .
But the scandal shone light on what turned out to be a wider problem .
Until recently , however , the Pentagon 's male - dominated leadership , its allies in Congress and interest groups have largely dismissed allegations as unfounded or exaggerated .
Military officials and independent analysts say punishment varies widely , as does how aggressively some accused are prosecuted .
In 2004 , the Department of Defense established a Sexual Assault Prevention Response program ; all soldiers receive training .
But in September , Brenda S. Farrell , a senior investigator for the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office , told lawmakers that although progress has been made , it 's impossible to know how much because the right questions are n't being asked , and important data are not being collected .
That 's led analysts to conclude that the size of the problem is larger than the Pentagon documents .
" At the 14 installations where we administered our survey , 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months , " Farrell told a House Oversight and Governmental Affairs subcommittee Sept. 10 .
" Of these , 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault . "
GAO investigators said that victims cited " the belief that nothing would be done ; fear of ostracism , harassment , or ridicule by peers ; and the belief that their peers would gossip about the incident . "
They also feared hurting their careers or unit morale and that a report using the restricted reporting option would not stay confidential .
Portland lawyer Kelly Clark , who has represented victims involving the Catholic Church and Boy Scouts of America , says people underestimate how difficult it is for individuals to challenge a powerful institution to which they 've sworn their loyalty and life .
" That 's a huge context that cannot be overstated , " Clark said .
" People do n't have a hard time saying to me , ' I was sexually violated by a stranger . '
But they have a terrible time saying , ' I was violated by Uncle Don , the family hero , or by my commanding officer or my priest . ' "
Psychiatrists say sexual trauma in the military may be so damaging because the victims often continue to live and work alongside the perpetrators and rely on them for safety , basic needs or advancement .
Accusing a colleague also betrays the most sacred tenant of the military : the team .
" In combat , buddies become your brother or sister with whom you live , sleep , shower and share secrets .
They become family , " says Mandy Martin , an Iraq war veteran and outreach worker with the Portland Vet Center .
" So when you tell the secret of a family member , that family now is angry . "
Few understand that better than the people around Suzanne Swift .
The 21 - year - old Army specialist was arrested at her mother 's Eugene home in June 2006 after failing to report for her second deployment to Iraq .
In a case that shot onto the international stage , Swift claimed she could not face returning to duty because she had been harassed or abused by two colleagues in Iraq and one at Fort Lewis .
Swift said she 'd been coerced into a sexual relationship , subjected to humiliating punishments for rebuffing advances and ordered to report for duty to a superior 's bed -- naked .
On the eve of a court - martial that would have ended her career , she pleaded guilty to going AWOL .
She was busted to the rank of private , sent to jail for 30 days and reassigned to a base in California .
One man she named received a written reprimand and was reassigned .
He later left the Army .
The Army did not substantiate claims against the others .
Swift has declined to speak further .
But her mother , Sara Rich , said the experience was more disheartening than she 'd ever imagined .
" You ca n't go up against the military , " said Rich , a family therapist who was the city of Eugene 's human rights commissioner for seven years .
" If you speak out , you get punished .
It 's really hard to survive . "
•
Susan Avila - Smith , an Enumclaw , Wash. , woman who founded one of the largest advocacy groups for women veterans , says cases surface decades later because most veterans are so busy trying to survive that they compartmentalize or suppress the experience until some event causes the floodgates to open .
Usually when post - traumatic stress disorder keeps people from sleeping and doing their job , " pretty soon , someone who was a functioning person with a high security clearance is working at a job washing dogs , " she said .
" I call it hitting the wall .
" Then , after you have no job , no house and nowhere to go , you finally go to the VA . "
But VA experts say men often fail to disclose assaults even when they are far along into other mental health treatment .
Earlier this year , a lead VA psychiatrist told the International Society for Trauma Studies that many kept their trauma secret for 30 years , even after it destroyed their military careers .
She advised caregivers to ask frank questions and look for clues : substance abuse -- often severe -- and lifelong problems with intimate relationships , authority and anger .

Photos of Jeff Elizalde show a trim 145 - pound rifleman in the late 1970s , hair neatly clipped .
He had no disciplinary problems in his first 14 months as a Marine .
Then records show an abrupt descent into alcoholism , including drinking as much as two cases of beer a day , passing out on guard duty , disobeying orders and failing to complete treatment .
" I lost faith in my leaders , " Elizalde says .
" I had to drink to be in the same room with them . "
Within 18 months of the alleged assault , Elizalde faced a court - martial for five drinking - related or disobedient offenses .
A commanding officer recommended that Elizalde accept an other - than - honorable discharge .
He agreed .
He worked in his parents ' restaurant in California , where he racked up two drunken driving convictions in quick succession .
He eventually went to work in construction , following the trades to Salem , where he worked as a union pipe layer .
After a construction accident , he went on 100 percent Social Security disability in 1999 .
He never married .
" It 's hard for me to even be with a gal , " he says .
" Believe me , I 'm straight , but this has affected me so much mentally . "
He was treated for severe depression , anxiety and other symptoms for years .
Still , Elizalde never told anyone until he saw an item on television in 2006 .
It said that if you suffer from severe depression and have a sexual assault in your background , that will affect diagnosis and treatment .
Documents show that on Feb. 9 , 2006 , he first disclosed the rape to the Kaiser Permanente mental health counselor he 'd seen regularly since 2004 .
The counselor and a supervising psychiatrist concluded that his alcoholism , depression , some hallucinations and fear about the security of his home could be the result of the attack .
They later wrote that in treating him for five years , " It is our opinion that your PTSD is more than likely the direct result of personal trauma you experienced on active duty with the United States Marine Corps . "
Shortly after disclosing the attack , Elizalde also contacted the Oregon Department of Veterans '
Affairs , where a caseworker helped him file a claim to upgrade his discharge .
In April 2007 , the Board for the Correction of Navy Records rejected the claim , saying that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an upgrade given his five disciplinary actions .
" Further , there is no evidence in the record to show you were raped or suffered PTSD at the time of your service . "
Elizalde appealed , asking that mental health experts review his records .
He also called congressional offices and even candidates , and exhausted the state employees .
( The department spokesman declined to discuss his case , even with his permission . )
In January , Elizalde was charged with drunken driving -- for the first time since the early 1980s .
Finally , two years after he first spoke out , he tried the federal government , and the Portland VA medical center agreed to see him immediately .
Under a new federal mandate that expands services for potential victims , any veteran is eligible for care for sexual trauma in the military as long as he or she had active service , said Sue Hippe , Psych Mental Health Nurse Practitioner , PTSD Clinical team and sexual trauma coordinator .
So a veteran with a discharge other than honorable is still potentially eligible , based on an evaluation by the regional office .
Elizalde says at the very least , he'd like the VA to cover some of the mental health care .
" This has been my personal battle for 30 years , " he said .
" I 'm a veteran , even though I do n't feel like one .
This has affected every aspect of my life . "

Remarks of Senator Barack Obama
As Prepared for Delivery
Denver , Colorado
Sunday , October 26th , 2008
Colorado , in just 9 days , youll have the chance to elect your next President .
And youll have the chance to bring the change we need to Washington .
That s the good news .
But we re going to have to work , and struggle , and fight for every single one of those 9 days to move our country in a new direction .
We can not let up .
And we wo n't .
Because one thing we know is that change never comes without a fight .
In the final days of campaigns , the say - anything , do - anything politics too often takes over .
Weve seen it before .
And were seeing it again today .
The ugly phone calls .
The misleading mail and TV ads .
The careless , outrageous comments .
All aimed at keeping us from working together , all aimed at stopping change .
Well , this is nt what we need right now .
The American people do n't want to hear politicians attack each other  you want to hear about how we 're going to attack the challenges facing middle class families each and every day .
So what we need now is honest leadership and real change , and thats why Im running for President of the United States .
This is a moment of great uncertainty for America .
The economic crisis we face is the worst since the Great Depression .
Businesses large and small are finding it impossible to get loans , which means they cant buy new equipment , or hire new workers , or even make payroll for the workers they have .
Weve lost more than 750,000 jobs this year .
Wages are lower than theyve been in a decade , at a time when the cost of health care and college have never been higher .
It s getting harder and harder to make the mortgage , or fill up your gas tank , or even keep the electricity on at the end of the month .
At this rate , the question is nt just are you better off than you were four years ago ? , it s are you better off than you were four weeks ago ? 
So what we need right now is a real debate about how to fix our economy and help middle class families .
But that s not what were getting from the other side .
A couple of weeks ago , my opponents campaign said that if we keep talking about the economy , were going to lose , so they said theyd be focusing on attacking me instead .
And thats one campaign promise theyve actually kept .
Senator McCain has been throwing everything hes got at us , hoping something will stick .
Hes even called me a socialist for suggesting that we focus on tax cuts , not for corporations and the wealthy , but for the middle class .
The other day , he took it to a whole new level .
He said that I was like George W. Bush .
You cant make this stuff up , folks .
In what may be the strangest twist of all , Senator McCain said that I would somehow continue the Bush economic policies  and that he , John McCain , would change them .
But then , just this morning , Senator McCain said that he and President Bush   share a common philosophy . 
That s right , Colorado .
I guess that was John McCain finally giving us a little straight talk , and owning up to the fact that he and George Bush actually have a whole lot in common .
Well , we know what the Bush - McCain philosophy looks like .
It s a philosophy that says we should give more and more to folks at the top and hope that it trickles down .
It s a philosophy that gives tax breaks to wealthy CEOs and to corporations that ship jobs overseas while hundreds of thousands of jobs are disappearing here at home .
It s a philosophy that justifies spending $ 10 billion a month in Iraq while the Iraqi government sits on a huge surplus and our economy is in crisis .
For eight years , weve seen the Bush - McCain philosophy put our country on the wrong track , and we cannot have another four years that look just like the last eight .
It s time for change in Washington , and thats why Im running for President of the United States .
We know that the economic crisis that hit Wall Street has been hurting middle class families on Main Street for years .
But during the primaries , Senator McCain was saying that weve made great progress economically  under George Bush , and just last month he was still arguing that the fundamentals of our economy are strong .
That s not change .
We know that we have to get spending under control in Washington so that were not mortgaging our childrens future under a mountain of debt .
But for all of Senator McCains tough talk on spending , he voted for four out of the five Bush budgets that let things get totally out of control .
That s not change .
We know that its time for new ideas and new leadership in the White House .
But Senator McCain voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time over the last eight years .
Just the other day , George Bush returned the favor and voted early for John McCain .
Well , Colorado , you can vote early too .
And you can finally put an end to the Bush - McCain philosophy .
You can vote for change .
You can vote for a new direction for our country .
We know whats coming from the McCain campaign over the next nine days , because its the same kind of politics that weve seen over the last eight years .
It s a politics that is more about tearing your opponent down then lifting this country up .
Well I can take nine more days of John McCains attacks , but the American people cant take four more years of the same failed policies and the same failed politics .
We re not going to let George Bush pass the torch to John McCain .
It s time for change .
And thats why Im running for President of the United States .
I know these are difficult times .
I know folks are worried .
But I believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because I believe in this country .
Because I believe in you .
I believe in the American People .
We are the United States of America .
We are a nation that s faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats .
And at each and every moment , we have risen to meet these challenges  not as Democrats , not as Republicans , but as Americans .
With resolve .
With confidence .
With that fundamental belief that here in America , our destiny is not written for us , but by us .
Thats who we are , and thats the country we need to be right now .
But Colorado , I know this .
It will take a new direction .
It will take new leadership in Washington .
It s time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put Wall Street before Main Street but ended up hurting both .
We need policies that grow our economy from the bottom - up , so that every American , everywhere , has the chance to get ahead .
Not just the person who owns the factory , but the men and women who work on its floor .
Not just the CEO , but the secretary and the janitor .
Because if weve learned anything from this economic crisis , its that were all connected ; were all in this together ; and we will rise or fall as one nation  as one people .
The rescue plan that passed the Congress was a necessary first step to easing this credit crisis , but if were going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up , we need an immediate rescue plan for the middle - class  and thats what I will do as President of the United States .
Ive proposed a new American jobs tax credit for each new employee that companies hire here in the United States over the next two years .
Ill stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas and invest in companies that create good jobs right here in Colorado .
Ill help small businesses get back on their feet by eliminating capital gains taxes and giving them emergency loans to keep their doors open and hire workers .
And I will create a Jobs and Growth fund to help states and local governments save one million jobs and pay for health care and education without having to raise your taxes .
Ill also act quickly to help people stay in their homes .
Ill help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages on affordable terms , and put in place a three - month moratorium on foreclosures to give folks the breathing room they need to get back on their feet .
And I wont let banks and lenders off the hook when it was their greed and irresponsibility that got us into this mess .
We should not be bailing out Wall Street  we should be restoring opportunity on Main Street .
These are the steps that we must take  right now  to start getting our economy back on track .
But we also need a new set of priorities to grow our economy and create jobs over the long - term .
It starts with tax relief .
Theres been a lot of talk about taxes in this campaign .
And the truth is , my opponent and I are both proposing tax cuts .
The difference is , he wants to give a $ 700,000 tax cut to the average Fortune 500 CEO .
I want to put a middle class tax cut in the pockets of 95 % of workers and their families .
My opponent doesnt want you to know this , but under my plan , tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan .
It s true that I want to roll back the Bush tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans and go back to the rate they paid under Bill Clinton .
John McCain calls that socialism .
What he forgets is that just a few years ago , he himself said those Bush tax cuts were irresponsible .
He said he couldnt in good conscience  support a tax cut where the benefits went to the wealthy at the expense of middle class Americans who most need tax relief . 
Well , he was right then , and I am right now .
So let me be crystal clear :
If you make less than a quarter of a million dollars a year  which includes 98 % of small business owners  you wont see your taxes increase one single dime .
Not your payroll taxes , not your income taxes , not your capital gains taxes  nothing .
That is my commitment to you .
For the last eight years , we have tried it John McCains way .
We have tried it George Bushs way .
Weve given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else .
And guess what ?
It didnt .
So it s time to try something new .
It s time to grow this economy by investing in the middle class again .
If I am President , I will invest $ 15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new , green jobs over the next decade  jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced ; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel - efficient cars ; jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from Middle East dictators .
Ill also put two million more Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads , schools , and bridges  because it is time to build an American infrastructure for the 21st century .
And if people ask how were going to pay for this , you tell them that if we can spend $ 10 billion a month in Iraq , we can spend some money to rebuild America .
If I am President , I will finally fix the problems in our health care system that weve been talking about for too long .
This issue is personal for me .
My mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 53 , and Ill never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed , fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre-existing condition and didnt want to pay for treatment .
If I am President , I will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again .
Like George Bush , John McCain wants to tax your health care benefits for the first time in history , and let insurance companies keep discriminating against people who need health care the most .
It s the same , failed , insurance company first / your family last health care policy  and were going to change it .
My health care plan will make sure insurance companies cant discriminate against those who are sick and need care most .
If you have health insurance , the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums .
If you dont have health insurance , youll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves .
And well invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families , businesses , and the entire economy .
That s the change we need .
And if Im President , well give every child , everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker , anywhere in the world .
I will not allow countries to out - teach us today so they can out - compete us tomorrow .
It is time to provide every American with a world - class education .
That means investing in early childhood education .
That means recruiting an army of new teachers , and paying them better , and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability .
And it means making a deal with every American who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college .
My opponents top economic advisor actually said that they have no plan to invest in college affordability because we cant have a giveaway to every special interest .
Well I dont think the young people of America are a special interest  they are the future of this country .
That s why Ill make this deal with you : if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford your tuition .
No ifs , ands or buts .
You invest in America , America will invest in you , and together , we will move this country forward .
Now , make no mistake : the change we need wont come easy or without cost .
We will all need to tighten our belts , we will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever , we are all in this together .
At a defining moment like this , we dont have the luxury of relying on the same political games and the same political tactics that are used every election to divide us from one another and make us afraid of one another .
With the challenges and crises we face right now , we cannot afford to divide this country by class or region ; by who we are or what policies we support .
There are no real or fake parts of this country .
We are not separated by the pro-America and anti-America parts of this nation  we all love this country , no matter where we live or where we come from .
There are patriots who supported this war in Iraq and patriots who opposed it ; patriots who believe in Democratic policies and those who believe in Republican policies .
The men and women from Colorado and all across America who serve on our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents , but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag .
They have not served a Red America or a Blue America  they have served the United States of America .
We have always been at our best when weve had leadership that called us to look past our differences and come together as one nation , as one people ; leadership that rallied this entire country to a common purpose  to a higher purpose .
And I am running for President of the United States of America because that is the country we need to be right now .
This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we havent seen in nearly a century .
And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test .
Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose ?
When we allowed the same divisions and fear tactics and our own petty differences to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession ?
Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame ?
When we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each others success ?
This is one of those moments .
I realize you re cynical and fed up with politics .
I understand that you re disappointed and even angry with your leaders .
You have every right to be .
But despite all of this , I ask of you whats been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history .
I ask you to believe  to believe in yourselves , in each other , and in the future we can build together .
Together , we can not fail .
Not now .
Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save .
Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes .
Not when there are families who cant afford to see a doctor , or send their child to college , or pay their bills at the end of the month .
Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves .
We can do this .
Americans have done this before .
Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can ; maybe I can't have my own business but my child can .
I may have to rent , but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own .
I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate .
I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America .
Now it falls to us .
Together , we can not fail .
And I need you to make it happen .
If you want the next four years looking like the last eight , then I am not your candidate .
But if you want real change  if you want an economy that rewards work , and that works for Main Street and Wall Street ; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs ; if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete ; then I ask you to knock on some doors , make some calls , talk to your neighbors , and give me your vote .
In Colorado , you can vote early right here , and right now .
To find out how , just go to voteforchange.com .
And if you stand with me in nine days , I promise you  we will win Colorado , we will win this election , and then you and I  together  will change this country and change this world .
Thank you ,
God bless you , and may God bless America .
Ken Burns turns his focus to national parks Six - part series to air on PBS in fall of 2009

It 's too early for civilians .
As dawn 's first light falls on the jagged peaks , creeps down the dwindling glaciers and glides across glass - faced Swiftcurrent Lake , most of the tourists in the Many Glacier Hotel are still snoozing .
But down at water 's edge , three early risers huddle around a camera .
One of the guys , leaning on a tripod and waiting for the clouds to arrange themselves over the jagged peaks , has a Beatles haircut , the build of a shortstop and a face you 've seen before somewhere .
Perhaps during pledge week .
" I want more of the color , " he says , peering through a viewfinder .
" OK , I 'm doing it . "
And the film rolls .
Yes , it 's Ken Burns , solemn PBS documentarian of the Civil War , jazz , baseball , Frank Lloyd Wright , Mark Twain , Congress , the Brooklyn Bridge , and more than a few other American characters and institutions .
Beside him stand cinematographer Buddy Squires and writer Dayton Duncan .
Upstairs in the hotel , Burns ' wife and 3 - year - old are sleeping .
So what exactly is Burns doing on his summer vacation ?
A six - part , 12 - hour series , of course .
" The National Parks : America 's Best Idea " is to air in autumn 2009 on PBS .
This choice of topic might surprise some people , given the body counts and civil - rights gravity of some subjects Burns has chosen .
His last series , nominated for several Emmy awards , covered World War II .
Other projects in the pipeline depict Prohibition , the Dust Bowl and the Vietnam War - doom , destruction and gangsters on every side .
So why drag his cameras out here to the Canadian border , amid the peace , quiet , scampering children and slowly retreating glaciers ?
When you boil it down , Burns says , almost all of his work is about the way American geography connects with the American character .
And one of the country 's most startling innovations , he says , was the creation of a national park system in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
" For the first time in human history , land was set aside not for the pleasure of kings and noblemen and the very , very rich , but for everybody , for all time , " says Burns , lounging in a chair downstairs at the Many Glacier Hotel .
If that phrasing sounds suspiciously like a Burns script , that 's not so surprising .
Burns , the son of an anthropologist , has been exploring American institutions on film for more than 30 years , ever since his graduation from Hampshire College in Massachusetts in 1975 .
Those first few years were lean - he remembers using food stamps in 1977 , grossing $ 1,200 in 1978 while trying to woo backers for his first documentary .
" I looked 12 years old , and I was trying to sell the Brooklyn Bridge , " he recalls fondly .
" I 've got two binders of rejections at home . "
Of course , he did sell the project eventually .
" Brooklyn Bridge " aired on PBS in 1982 , and the work has been steady , if not frenetic , ever since .
Burns splits his time between tiny Walpole , N.H. , and Manhattan and , at 55 , still radiates boyish enthusiasm , his conversation quick and thick with literary and historical allusions .
Trail talk
Out on the trail , you do n't hear a lot of hikers huffing out phrases such as " the apotheosis of our exploration " and " the portal to immortality , " but Burns does .
Then again , he 's also sound - bite - savvy enough to sum up his life 's work in three words .
" Race and space , " he says .
In works on the Civil War , baseball and jazz , he explored race relations in American culture .
In works on the West and Lewis and Clark and Mark Twain , he explored how this country 's geography and culture have shaped each other .
With the parks project , he says , he wants to explore the movement that set aside Yellowstone and Yosemite and created the national park system .
These seem like astonishing , out - of - character moves , he says , " in a culture so dedicated to the almighty dollar , so dedicated to a kind of extractive and acquisitive mentality .
It 's phenomenal .
So how did this happen ?
Who were these people ? "
The project , written and co-produced by Burns ' longtime collaborator and New Hampshire neighbor Duncan , also will look at other tensions that have long preoccupied park - watchers - the constant jostling among recreation proponents , preservationists and commercial interests , for instance , and the big businesses that shaped the system in its early decades , especially the railroad moguls and road - builders .
Things to notice
Here at Glacier , that means taking notice of Louis Hill , whose westward routing of the Great Northern Railroad helped determine the park 's territory .
And George Bird Grinnell , the naturalist and anthropologist who pushed for the area 's designation as a national park in 1910 .
And Stephen Mather , the early National Park Service director who in 1921 chose the route for Going - to - the - Sun Road , an epic 53 - mile highway that crosses the Continental Divide , its higher reaches chiseled into stony slopes .
It took 11 years to build the road , which opens in summer and is buried by snow the rest of the year .
( Autumn snows usually close Going - to - the - Sun Road by late October or early November .
This year , road - improvement work will limit access beginning Monday .
For details : www.nps.gov/glac.)
Besides Swiftcurrent
Lake 's mountain views , the pseudo - Swiss architecture of the Many Glacier Hotel and Going - to - the - Sun Road , Glacier 's attractions include Logan Pass , where you can tramp around on midsummer snowfields about 6,600 feet above sea level , a snowball 's toss from the Continental Divide ; and Lake McDonald Lodge , where a gallery of mounted animal heads gazes down upon the woodsy lobby .
Because so much of the parks project is in the can , Burns and his team have the rare luxury of relaxing here .
Duncan has brought his wife and son .
When Burns is n't chasing the good light at dawn and dusk , he and his wife , Julie Brown , take their 3 - year - old daughter , Olivia , to play with pebbles on the shore , to sit for a moment on a horse at the stables near the hotel and to glide around Josephine Lake on a midday boat cruise .
It 's their first time here .
Fortunately for nature lovers with short attention spans , the big ideas and historical details in the Burns project will come with a hefty dose of sweet scenery .
Along with the archival photography that has become a hallmark of Burns projects , the filmmakers have spent about $ 15 million over five years gathering fresh footage of just about all of the 58 parks .
Duncan , in fact , has been to every national park but the one in American Samoa .
Burns , juggling multiple projects , has been to far fewer .
But after all these years , he and the gang fall into an easy rhythm , their patter playing on footnotes in American history , lines from long - ago scripts and pratfalls from three decades of stumbling around North America in the predawn dark .
It is understood that most mornings , Burns will wake up first , Squires will be last and Duncan will turn up sometime in between , filling idle moments by fussing with his pipe , always ready to drive miles for a good slice of pie .
Squires will bring his own coffeemaker and get the best pictures .
" In the material world , " Squires says , " light and weather equals emotion equals storytelling .
So you take advantage of what nature gives you . "
" God is our gaffer , " Burns says that night , scanning the dusk horizon for possibilities .
" And he 's not working today , " says Squires , seeing none .
A power hike
By the third afternoon in the park , the shooting is all but done .
Burns grabs Squires and me and another guy for a power hike toward Grinnell Glacier .
Through the loose rock and bear grass we climb , Burns leading the charge and quizzing Squires about changes in camera technology .
At about 6,000 feet , we reach a spectacular spot above Grinnell and Josephine lakes , and I pull out my camera .
Burns , who has been waiting for me to catch up , can't help but sidle over .
" Now if you put these four trees in the foreground , with the lake behind , " he says , " I think you can get the depth of field to work for you in a sort of Impressionistic way . "
The next morning , just before he and his family head off to Lake McDonald Lodge for the last few days of this quasi-vacation , I ask Burns about his own history as a park tourist .
Clearly , he has been waiting for the question .
" My family life was horrifically tragic , " he begins .
" There was never a moment when I was n't aware that my mother was tremendously sick with cancer .
I was told when I was 6 or 7 that she was going to die within six months .
She died a few months short of my 12th birthday .
I did n't have a childhood . "
But one weekend when Burns was 6 or 7 and the family was living in Delaware , his father met him after school and drove young Ken to spend the night at his grandmother 's house in Baltimore .
The next morning before dawn , Burns ' father woke him and they hopped in the car .
" We drove from Baltimore to Front Royal , Va. , which is at the top of Skyline Drive , at the top of Shenandoah National Park , " Burns recalls .
" The Skyline Drive runs down the spine of the Shenandoah Mountains , and it is spectacular .
We drove through tunnels , which I 'd never done .
We drove through clouds , which I 'd never done .
We saw deer on the road , which I had never seen .
We saw a bear .
We stayed in a little cabin , just my dad and me .
We had a campfire .
We took a hike to see a waterfall , which I had never seen .
We turned over logs and saw these bright orange salamanders .
And they scampered away , and I caught one .
" And I will never forget the thrill of it .
...
It is n't just these places .
It 's who you see them with . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
You survived the stock - market crash of 2008 .
Congratulations .
Now comes the hard part : Buying stocks and mutual funds that can survive -- and even thrive -- in the bear market .
Buying in a bear market ?
That 's what Warren Buffett is doing .
The famed investor was blunt about why : " Be fearful when others are greedy , and be greedy when others are fearful , " he wrote in an opinion piece Friday in The New York Times .
" Bad news is an investor 's best friend , " he added .
" It lets you buy a slice of America 's future at a marked - down price . "
Read Buffett 's editorial .
The key , as always , is what you buy and how patient you are .
Buffett is n't banking on a quick turnaround ; he knows that patience is rewarded .
You can average in to stocks over time -- there 's no reason to back up the truck .
Markets are bracing for another shock : the specter of the first consumer - led recession in almost two decades .
" This volatility is signaling the end of an era , " said Rich Bernstein , chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch .
" If you 're picking stocks or looking for a fund , the characteristics you want are the ability to continue to enhance shareholder value .
Think of it in terms of companies that are self - funding .
Look for companies that have excess cash flow . "
Let that be your bear - market investing guide .
You want an investment portfolio of high - quality stocks and mutual funds that not only can weather this economic storm but come through it stronger .
That naturally steers you to traditionally defensive consumer staples and health - care companies , but do n't limit yourself .
There will be opportunities in other sectors , but the new leaders , regardless of their business , will demonstrate the financial strength and self - sufficiency to flourish in what will be an increasingly Darwinian market .
So think like an acquirer ; think like Buffett .
Keep the following five criteria uppermost in mind when you evaluate a stock or the companies in a fund 's portfolio :
1 . Free cash flow
Free cash flow is essentially a company 's budget surplus .
Excess cash -- not earnings -- is for many investors the true measure of a company 's flexibility because unlike earnings , cash flow is tough to fudge with accounting tricks .
" Look for strong and growing free cash flow , " said Rob McIver , co-manager of Jensen Portfolio JENSX , - 0.33 % .
" Cash flow is harder to manipulate than earnings per share . "
To calculate free cash flow , take net income plus amortization and depreciation , minus changes in working capital and capital expenditures .
Companies with excess cash have options .
They can invest in the business or make acquisitions , and give investors a boost by increasing dividend payments and buying back shares .
Many of the 28 stocks in the Jensen fund are large - cap consumer goods and health care companies fitting this bill .
Top holdings as of Sept. 30 included medical - device giant Stryker Corp.
SYK , - 0.93 % , pharmaceutical leader Abbott Laboratories ABT , +0.71 % and consumer products titan Procter & Gamble Co. PG , - 0.54 % .
The fund also has a newer position in software developer Cognizant Technology Solutions CTSH , - 0.46 % .
Said McIver : " There 's a place in everyone 's portfolio for high - quality companies where predictability and sustainability of earnings is valued . "
2. Little or no debt
The most profitable areas for much of this decade -- real estate , energy , financials , commodities , emerging markets -- all benefited from cheap and easy credit .
Now credit is not readily available and not so cheap .
Accordingly , credit - sensitive sectors are underperforming .
" Companies that are levered or need to tap the capital markets are going to struggle in terms of being able to get financing at a reasonable price -- or at all , " said John Buckingham , editor of The Prudent Speculator newsletter and manager of the Al Frank Fund VALUX , - 0.71 % .
Concentrate on companies that can finance their own growth and have low debt as a percentage of total capital .
Organic growth , as opposed to growth through acquisition , is also crucial .
" Focus on balance sheet strength , " Buckingham said .
" We like Microsoft MSFT , - 1.04 % because it does n't need to tap the capital markets . "
Big blue - chip technology companies such as Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO , - 0.17 % and Oracle Corp. ORCL , - 0.18 % " are excellent places for investors , " he added .
In a market where cash is king and earnings predictability is paramount , Buckingham is also bullish on big pharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline Plc GSK , - 1.13 % and Merck & Co. MRK , - 1.03 % and health insurers Aetna Inc. AET and Humana Inc. HUM , +0.53 %
" The important thing , " Buckingham said , " is does the company have the ability to navigate the difficult environment we 're in or does it have to go to the markets for capital , and the markets are not exactly friendly right now . "
3. Strong market share
Companies involved in basic businesses with a national or global footprint , or that help other companies be more productive have a competitive advantage in a miserly market .
Marshall Kaplan , senior equity strategist with Smith Barney Private Client Investment Strategy , uses the example of oil service companies that can charge a premium for extracting oil and gas , or technology companies that make it easier to process data .
" Ask yourself , is it a viable franchise ? "
Kaplan said " Are you talking about products and services that are going to be needed not for brief periods but over the long term ?
Is the quality of earnings there ?
You 've got to make sure you 're in a situation where the business can be maintained at levels that are conducive to growth . "
Stocks on Smith Barney 's recommended list that meet this criteria include Apple Inc. AAPL , - 0.75 % , ConAgra Foods Inc. CAG , +0.05 % , Johnson & Johnson JNJ , - 0.03 % , Kimberly - Clark Corp. KMB , - 0.82 % and National Oilwell Varco Inc. NOV , - 6.02 %
" It 's tough for the individual investor to keep his or her head about them in a market like this , " Kaplan said .
" These types of names create a stronger level of support .
The days of buy - and - hold , one - decision stocks are gone , but you could have a longer holding period in the names with these characteristics . "
4. Solid management
Companies in top financial shape have management that 's proactive and capable .
" Honorable , " is how McIver , the Jensen fund manager , puts it .
" Understand what creates and what destroys shareholder value , " he said .
" You can't run a company from quarter to quarter to meet earnings targets .
You have to make long - term decisions and capital expenditure decisions that will reap rewards . "
The Jensen fund wo n't invest in a company until the managers visit executives on their home turf .
Moreover , these corporate chieftains must have delivered return on equity -- net income divided by shareholders ' equity -- of at least 15 % annually on average for 10 consecutive years .
One slip , and the stock is booted from the portfolio .
" By knowing the companies well , we can minimize business risk , " he said .
5. Attractive valuation
Investors have tossed out stocks in panic , including those with strong fundamentals .
Market sentiment is mired somewhere between despondency and ye of little faith .
But many professionals are taking a page from Buffett .
" I 'm looking for stocks that are already cheap , " said Tom Forester , manager of Forester Value Fund FVALX , - 0.39 % , which counts consumer goods leaders H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ , Kraft Foods Inc. KFT and Johnson & Johnson among its top holdings .
" They tend to have a lot less downside , but they also have plenty of upside potential . "
He 's also finding bargains in technology .
" I 'll buy Microsoft at 12 times earnings , " Forester said .
" For a tech stock it 's very cheap .
I like the cash , the stock buybacks , and revenue streams are steady . "
Buckingham 's picks include General Electric GE , - 1.29 % , United Technologies UTX and IBM IBM , - 0.64 % .
" There 's a lot of opportunity in large - cap stocks right now , " he said , " and arguably you 've got a greater margin of safety . "
In this market , investors will need the margin of safety that a low price brings .
The crash was just the end of the beginning .
Now comes what could be many months of head - fakes and hopeful rallies that wind up in dead ends .
You 'll be Charlie Brown charging the football with head held high , only to land flat on your back .
While it wo n't make the challenges any easier , take to heart what veteran stock analyst Bob Farrell noted in his iconic 10 " Market Rules to Remember " :
Bear markets , he wrote , have three stages -- " sharp down , reflexive rebound , and a drawn - out fundamental downtrend . "
See related story .
Where it stops , nobody knows , but a portfolio with strong defensive stocks stands a fighting chance .

Last week we went over the fantasy baseball busts of 2008 .
Now we ’ll look at the guys that gave you the best value for their draft picks — the hitters edition .
I figured out the top twenty best draft picks of 2008 the same way I figured out the busts , using our fantasy baseball player rater .
Dur .
Now when it came to the busts , it was a bit harder to figure out because some guys were injury busts — cough V - Mart cough — but all of the best draft picks ( or undrafted pickups ) played and played well this year , which made it easier to figure out the best value picks .
So yay for me .
In each entry , I put the Average Draft Position ( ADP ) and the Minutes of Erection ( MOE ) metric , which I made up to illustrate how much you enjoyed owning these fantasy baseball hitters .
Anyway , here ’s the 20 best draft picks of 2008 , the hitters :
20 . Stephen Drew – I think I ’ve mentioned this before , but I ’m too lazy to look it up in the side search bar .
JD
Drew is injury - prone as all get - out and he always seems overvalued .
While his brother is going to be better than him at a better position and he seems to go unnoticed .
Weird !
ADP , 227 — MOE , 2:08
19 . Jason Bay – I do n’t like him , which does n’t mean you ca n’t like him .
You can , if you wanna be argumentative .
ADP , 87 — MOE , 4:40
18 . Carlos Delgado – Eeny , meany , miney , moe… .
Which aging 1st baseman will I take ….
Konerko !
D’oh !
ADP , 136 — MOE , 7:35
17 . Manny Ramirez – Manny does whatever it is that Manny wants to do when Manny ’s being Manny .
If you had this year , you got the great Manny .
ADP , 37 — MOE , 12:10
16 . Melvin Mora – Mora was good this year .
I still do n’t like him .
As distant cousin , Jim Mora , would say , “ Diddly Poo ! ” ADP , 333 — MOE , 10:22
15 . Milton Bradley – Milton Bradley ’s your neighbor and his dog repeatedly craps on your lawn .
Do you A ) Say something .
B ) Move . C ) Threaten him and watch as he injures himself running at you .
ADP , 325 — MOE , 14:49
14 . Jose Lopez – Fourteenth ?
Really ?
Hmm …
I guess he had a good season and I did tell you to pick him up the first week of the 2008 season .
But still , 14th ?
Wait , I ’m supposed to be celebrating these guys .
Jose Lopez ?
Woo - hoo !
(< –Actually halfway through that “ woo - hoo , ” I was thinking about free tacos at Taco Bell . )
ADP , Undrafted — MOE , 3:50
13 . Andre Ethier – Once The Pierre Situation™ became The Juan No More Situation™ , Ethier did his thing .
As the kids say , Ethier was da bomb diggity in the final months .
ADP , 332 — MOE , 16:17
12 . Ryan Doumit – You lost Victor Martinez and you gained Doumit .
Small whoop ?
Maybe .
Medium - sized whoop ?
Possibly .
No big whoop .
ADP , 305 — MOE , 20:04
11 . Jhonny Peralta – See , Khalil , that ’s how someone with a weirdly - placed , silent H performs .
ADP , 173 — MOE , 25:42
10 . Jorge Cantu – I can attest to the MOE for Cantu .
Cantu said to me , “ Hey , Grey , why so down ? ” “ Pronk left a stank on my team . ”
Cantu , “ Aw , geez …
That ’s not nice of him .
Maybe you should just pick me up . ”
“ Thanks , man !
Oh , and Cantu , could you take your hand off my shoulder ? ”
ADP , Undrafted — MOE , 25:40
9. Xavier Nady – Dooode !
You know he was sitting on your waivers into May and you never grabbed .
You know it !
How do I know ?
I was right there with you .
ADP , 309 — MOE , 34:00
8. Mark DeRosa –
You in the comments , “ Okay , should I drop DeRosa or Ian Snell ? ” Me , “ Snell . ”
You , “ Okay , I think I ’ll hold onto Snell .
Thanks , Grey ! ” ADP , 331 — MOE , 35:10
7. Kevin Youkilis – I think Youuuuuk ’s actually going to show more power in 2009 .
As I said in the preseason , does he look like a guy that ca n’t hit 30 home runs ?
No , I do n’t think so either .
ADP , 171 — MOE , 41:20
6. Carlos Quentin – Probably would be at the top of this list if he did n’t have an altercation with his bat at the end of the season .
ADP , Undrafted , MOE , 48:59
5. Aubrey Huff – Eh , I probably told you to ignore Huff .
My bad , but he ’s like a poor man ’s Mike Lowell .
One year , he hits 30 home runs , next year he hits 12 home runs and is injured for half the year .
When I say , “ No rhyme … ” You say , “ No reason … ” “ No rhyme … ” “ No reason … ” “ No rhyme … ” “ No reason … ” Nice .
ADP , 329 — MOE , 49:01
4. Nate McLouth –
You thought you were the cat ’s pajamas when you drafted this guy , did n’t you ?
You did !
ADP , 272 — MOE , 54:12
3. Josh Hamilton –
To think in four years , Hamilton went from hanging out with crackheads to hanging out with Milton Bradley .
Some would argue he was safer with the crackheads .
ADP , 151 — MOE , 57:56
2. Dustin Pedroia – Poppa Pedroia , “ You ’re only four feet tall , Dusty !
You can not play baseball !
You have to run the pizzeria ! ” Dustin , “ I must Poppa !
It ’s my dream ! ” ADP , 177 — MOE 57:59
1. Ryan Ludwick – Well , there you have .
The number one most valuable guy was a 30 - year - old Minor League journeyman .
What ’s right is wrong and what ’s wrong is right .
Do n’t try and figure it out , you ’ll hurt your medulla oblongata .
ADP , Undrafted — MOE , 59:19

The children 's shelter was started five years ago when Sam Itauma , a Nigerian , opened his house to four youngsters accused of witchcraft .
Today , he and his five staff are caring for 150 youngsters .
" Every day , five or six children are branded as witches , " he says " Once a child has been stigmatised as a witch , it is very difficult for someone to accept that child back .
If they go out from this community ... there is a lot of attacks , assault and abuses on the children . "
Children often arrive at the shelter with severe wounds , but few clinics or hospitals will treat a child believed to be a witch .

The one thing Google Chrome was missing that kept a lot of the Firefox faithful from making the switch was the browser 's lack of add - on support .
Well , that 's set to change , according to Google engineer Ojan Vafai .
Both add - ons and user scripts ( á la Greasemonkey ) will be supported in the near future .
Currently , they 're working on ensuring that plug-ins and add - ons keep the browser as stable as it is without them , but as soon as they get that worked out , look for them to come to Chrome , probably by the time it 's out of beta .
What do you think , will being able to get Adblock for Chrome motivate you to switch ?
Also , stop using Adblock , you jerks , ads pay my bills .

We were talking about things that we wish we had known before while developing for Django the other day in IRC .
I proclaimed that we should write them down somewhere .
So I ’m writing a post to get this effort started .
Please feel free to leave comments with your own tips and tricks , and I ’ll compile them in some kind of good fashion .
These are mostly just pointers , and not full - blown writeups , just more of a big list of stuff you should think about .
I think these tips will really help out new people when they ’re trying to get the hang of Django .
App level ¶
Local library installation ¶
When you do n’t have root access on a machine , and you want to use easy_install , you can install files into a designated directory .
I use ~/ lib to hold my python modules , so when I do easy_install I simply use the -d option like so : easy_install -d ~ / lib nose
Use iPython¶ IPython is a python distribution that gives you lots of handy features like tab completion , syntax highlighting , better debugging , and lots of other nice features .
Poke around , I find more and more stuff I like every time .
Use django command extensions ¶
This is one project I use every time I do some new code .
I wrote up a whole post and screencast about how good they are .
They have gotten even better since then , highly recommended .
Performance tips from the man himself ¶ Jacob ( co - BDFL ) wrote up some performance tips back in ‘ 05 that are still relevant today .
Some big architectural stuff , but they still make sense .
Use mod_wsgi¶ mod_wsgi is currently the best way that I know of to run Django .
I did a simple write up a while back that has proved popular .
Running out of memory ?¶
Web faction has a good blog entry about how to keep memory usage down .
Might be useful even if you ’re not running on their hardware .
Use pdb¶ Pdb is a great debugger .
Simon has a great post on it , and I took a lot of his ideas and expanded them to do my debugging django screencast series .
Using pdb
Read b-list.org archives ¶
My tips here are short and sweet , James has a wealth of amazingly informative Django information stowed away in his blog archives .
Do yourself a favor and peek through it and be enlightened .
Do n’t be afraid of Reusable apps ¶
Watch James ’ presentation on Reusable apps at Djangocon .
Learn it , and use it .
A lot of the functionality that you want to do has already been done for you .
Check out Pinax which has a ton of nice reusable apps .
django - basic - apps also has a ton of really nice reusable apps that use best practices .
I use the blog here and it ’s a great way to learn how to use django well .
Learn by other people ’s awesome examples !
Watch the Djangocon videos ¶
The videos from Djangocon give you some great insights into Django .
Search and replace ¶ Search and replace across an entire directory .
This is useful for changing template vars or doing basic refactoring ( good editors should do this for you too ) perl - pi - w - e 's / foo/bar/g ' *. html
Check out virtualenv¶ virtualenv is an awesome python tool that allows you to create mini-sandboxes of python .
You can contain an entire django install ( and supposedly you can get mod_wsgi and some other stuff inside ) .
I have n’t played with it too much , but it sounds really nice to keep a contained python environment , and allows you to run different versions of libraries , django , and anything else you can think of .
Use Django snippets ¶
Django snippets is a great place to post your tips , or get other peoples code examples .
It ’s a big cookbook of helpful and neat things about django .
It does n’t have search , so use google ’s site : djangosnippets.org syntax to find what you need .
Building Ajax - enabled auto - complete and cascading drop - down controls
Using JSP TagLib , JSON , and Ajax
Two key technologies enable next - generation Web sites : Ajax and JSON .
Business - line applications can benefit from these technologies to provide more intuitive and responsive user interfaces .
This article describes how to add Ajax and JSON to Java™ Platform , Enterprise Edition ( Java EE ) Web applications by building reusable JSP TagLib controls based on Ajax .
Within the article , I show how to build a cascading drop - down control that dynamically populates values in an HTML SELECT control based on other form field values .
I also describe how to build an auto - complete control , similar to Google Suggest , that displays a suggestion list that is updated in real time as a user types .
You 'll build the controls by integrating JSON , JavaScript , CSS , HTML , and Java EE technologies .
Technical overview
The primary design goals of the controls developed in this article are :
Provide easy integration with existing Web applications .
The controls should encapsulate all logic and JavaScript code to simplify the deployment process .
Be configurable .
Minimize data- and page - size overhead .
Leverage CSS and HTML standards .
Provide cross - browser support ( Microsoft® Internet Explorer , Mozilla Firefox ) .
Leverage common design patterns / best practices to improve code maintainability .
To meet the goals of easy integration and configurable controls , the article 's examples use configurable tag attributes where possible .
In addition , you define interface / contracts to provide a straightforward way to integrate custom data / value providers with the controls .
The article uses an additional control to encapsulate common JavaScript functions , and thereby minimizing data and overhead .
You use JSON to minimize data exchange when making asynchronous calls .
The articles 's examples use Web standards , including CSS and HTML , for cross - browser support .
The JavaScript , HTML , and CSS emitted by the controls are tested against Internet Explorer 7.x and Mozilla Firefox 2.x/3.x .
The data and value providers are built based on common Object - Oriented Programming design patterns and best practices , such as an n- tier architecture , the adapter design pattern , and interface - based programming .
Technical considerations for implementing the example controls
There are a few key technical considerations for the Ajax - enabled controls you develop in this article , including the mechanism to provide values to the Ajax controls , a data - exchange format for asynchronous communication , the class design , and the data model .
Mechanism to provide responses to asynchronous calls
You have three options to expose data asynchronously to Ajax - enabled controls :
JavaServer Pages ( JSP )
Servlets
SOAP or RESTful Web services
This article uses Servlets due to their efficiency and minimal overhead .
A JSP page is simpler to implement than a Servlet , but it is n't as clean from an implementation perspective .
Data - exchange format considerations
Data providers for Ajax - enabled controls can use XML or JSON as the data - exchange format .
XML is generally more human - readable than JSON , but it has the following disadvantages :
Larger data size compared to JSON
Slightly more difficult to parse within JavaScript
For these reasons , this article uses JSON .
Data model
The data model for the sample application comprises two entities :
State , which contains state abbreviations and names
Location , which contains city , zip code , and other location data
Figure 1 shows the data model used for the sample pages in this article .
Figure 1 . Data Model
Class model
The example in this article consists of the Data Abstract Layer ( DAL ) , Data Transfer Objects ( DTOs ) , the Business Logic Layer ( BLL ) , the Presentation Layer , and supporting helper classes .
The following figures show UML class diagrams for these classes .
The helper classes provide database and presentation layer supporting classes ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 . UML class diagram -- helper classes
The Data Abstract Layer consists of a single class to provide location - related data to the business layer ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 . UML class diagram -- Data Abstract Layer classes
You use two DTOs to pass data through the three tiers ( see Figure 4 ) .
StateDTO holds state - related data , and LocationDTO holds location - related data , including zip code , city name , state , latitude , and longitude .
Figure 4 . UML class diagram -- Data Transfer Object classes
The Business Logic Layer consists of the value providers that provide data to the Ajax - enabled controls ( see Figure 5 ) .
Value providers for the auto - complete control must implement the IJsonValueProvider interface .
The location service receives the collection of DTO objects from the data layer and generates the corresponding JSON data for use in the presentation layer .
Figure 5 . UML class diagram -- Business Logic Layer classes
The Servlets provide the interface to which the client - side asynchronous calls are made ( see Figure 6 ) .
These Servlets interact with the value providers to provide JSON data to the Web browser .
Figure 6 . UML class diagram -- Business Logic Layer , Servlet classes
JSP TagLib controls
You 'll create the following Ajax - enabled controls :
Cascading drop - down control -- Dynamically populates value options in SELECT controls based on other form fields or business rules .
-- Dynamically populates value options in controls based on other form fields or business rules .
Auto - complete control -- Displays a suggestion list , similar to Google Suggest , in real time as a user types .
The suggestions are dynamically displayed using asynchronous communication with a data provider servlet .
In addition to the two JSP TagLib controls , you need a third control to encapsulate all reusable JavaScript functions , such as clearing / populating values , handling keyboard / mouse events , and supporting asynchronous communication .
Figure 7 illustrates these three control classes .
Figure 7 . UML class diagram -- JSP TagLib control classes
Build the data provider and data layer
The LocationDataService class is a data provider to retrieve location - related data from the database .
It returns TreeMap objects containing LocationDTO and StateDTO objects .
It 's highly recommended that the data provider cache the results in memory for optimal performance , particularly because the data is consumed through asynchronous server calls .
Build a JSP TagLib control
You create a JSP TagLib control by extending TagSupport or TagBodySupport and overriding the doStartTag ( ) , doAfterBody ( ) , or doEndBody ( ) method to render the control 's content ( HTML code , JavaScript ) during page processing .
Listing 1 shows an example of an overridden doStartTag method .
Listing 1 . JdbcQuery class
/* ( non-Javadoc ) * @see javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport#doStartTag( ) */ @ Override public int doStartTag ( ) throws JspException { JspWriter out = pageContext.getOut ( ) ; try { //
An example of rendering output within a JSP page out .
print ( " This is a string that will be rendered " ) ; // A more practical example out . print ( " < h1 id=' heading 1 '>
This is a Heading < / h1 > " ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; }
After you create the implementation of the JSP TagLib control , you must define a TagLib Library Definition ( TLD ) in the / WEB - INF / tlds directory , as shown in Listing 2 .
Listing 2 . Sample JSP TagLib library definition file
<?xml version = " 1.0 " encoding = " ISO - 8859 - 1 " ?>
<!
DOCTYPE taglib PUBLIC "-// Sun Microsystems , Inc.//DTD JSP Tag Library 1.1//EN " " http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-jsptaglibrary_1_1.dtd " > < taglib > < tlibversion >1.0</tlibversion > < jspversion >1.1</jspversion > < shortname > ajax </shortname > < info> Ajax control library < / info > < tag > < name> sample</name > < tagclass>com.testwebsite.controls.SampleJspTag</tagclass > < bodycontent >JSP</bodycontent > < info >
This is a sample control </ info > < attribute > < name >id</name > < required > false </ required > < rtexprvalue> false</rtexprvalue > </ attribute > </tag > </tagLib >
You can place the control in any JSP page by adding the code from Listing 3 .
Listing 3 . Sample JSP page
< %@ page contentType= " text / html ; charset=ISO - 8859 -5 " %> < %@ taglib prefix= " ajax " uri= " / WEB-INF/tlds/ajax_controls.tld " %> < html > < head > < title > This is a test page </ title > < link href= " core.css " rel=" stylesheet " type =" text /css " /> </ head > < body >
This is a test page .
< ajax : sample /> </ body > </html >
Build the Ajax page JSP TagLib control
The < ajax : page / > control renders the standard JavaScript functions that are needed to add asynchronous support to JSP pages .
It also renders helper functions for the < ajax : autocomplete / > and < ajax : dropdown /> controls .
The helper functions are covered in the respective control sections Build the auto - complete JSP TagLib control and Build the cascading drop - down JSP TagLib control .
Where possible , it 's best to keep supporting JavaScript functions in the < ajax : page / > control rather than in individual controls because doing so reduces the page size .
Alternatively , you can store them in an external JS file , but that slightly complicates deployment by reducing encapsulation within the control .
The XMLHttpRequest object , which is accessible in JavaScript , is central to asynchronous Web communication .
Unfortunately , XMLHttpRequest is n't an approved standard , and vendor support varies slightly .
For Opera , Mozilla Firefox , and Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.0 and later , it 's a matter of using the new XMLHttpRequest ( ) JavaScript syntax .
For prior versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer , you create the object using new ActiveXObject (' Microsoft.XMLHTTP ') .
Listing 4 shows how to initialize the XMLHttpRequest for cross - browser support .
Listing 4 . Create the XMLHttpRequest object
var req ; function initializeXmlHttpRequest ( ) { if ( window.ActiveXObject ) { req=new ActiveXObject (' Microsoft.XMLHTTP ') ; } else { req=new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; } }
As mentioned , you render JavaScript code to a page by adding the code from Listing 5 to the tag - implementation class .
Listing 5 . Render the JavaScript initialization function for the XMLHttpRequest object
/* ( non-Javadoc ) * @see javax.servlet.jsp.tagext.TagSupport#doStartTag( ) */ @ Override public int doStartTag ( ) throws JspException { StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer ( ) ; html.append ( " < script type='text/javascript ' language= ' javascript ' > " ) ; html.append(" var req ; " ) ; html.append ( " var cursor = - 1 ; " ) ; // Generate functions to support Ajax html.append (" function initializeXmlHttpRequest ( ) { " ) ; //
Support for non-Microsoft browsers ( and IE7 + ) html.append (" if ( window.ActiveXObject ) { " ) ; // Support for Microsoft browsers html.append (" req=new ActiveXObject (' Microsoft.XMLHTTP ' ) ; " ) ; html.append ( " } " ) ; html.append ( " else { " ) ; html.append (" req=new XMLHttpRequest ( ) ; " ) ; html.append ( " } " ) ; JspWriter out = pageContext.getOut ( ) ; try { out.append( html.toString ( ) ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { e.printStackTrace ( ) ; } return this .
SKIP_BODY ; }
The req variable can now be used globally within the Web page .
Listing 6 illustrates how to make an asynchronous call .
Listing 6 . Use the XMLHttpRequest object
// If req object initialized if ( req! =null ) { //
Set callback function req.onreadystatechange=stateName_onServerResponse ; //
Set status text in browser window window.status= ' Retrieving State data from server ...' ; //
Open asynchronous server call req.open( ' GET ', dataUrl , true ) ; // Send request req.send ( null ) ; }
When the ready state of a request changes , the function specified in req.onreadystatechange is invoked .
req.readystate contains one of the following status codes :
0 =initialized
1=Open
2=Sent
3 =Receiving
4=Loaded
Use XML as a data - exchange format The XMLHttpRequest object also has a responseXML property to retrieve XML data responses .
JavaScript's DOM can then be used for processing .
Normally , anything but Loaded is ignored because typically nothing needs to occur until the server response is complete .
A value of Loaded for an asynchronous call does n't guarantee success .
As with any Web page request , it 's possible that the page was n't found or that another problem occurred .
If the req.status is anything but 200 , something went wrong .
Listing 7 shows how to handle the server response .
Listing 7 .
Handle the response to the asynchronous request
function stateName_onServerResponse( ) { if ( req.readyState !=4 ) return ; if ( req.status != 200 ) { alert ( ' An error occurred retrieving data . ' ) ; return ; } //
Obtain server response var responseData = req.responseText ; ... Processing of result }
You 've now had a good overview of how to make asynchronous calls and handle responses .
The next step is to start building the first control : < ajax:autocomplete /> .
Build the auto - complete JSP TagLib control
The following steps are required to build the auto - complete control :
Build a value provider to supply suggestions for the control .
Create a Servlet interface to expose the value provider for asynchronous calls .
Create a JSP TagLib control to encapsulate everything in a control that can be used in JSP pages .
The following sections explain these steps in detail .
Build the value provider to supply suggestions for the auto - complete control
The value provider supplies the suggestion list to the auto - complete control .
A value provider must implement the IJsonValueProvider interface , which defines a single method getValues ( ) that returns a JSONArray object containing the suggestion list .
The interface is shown in Listing 8 .
Listing 8 . IJsonValueProvider interface
public interface IJsonValueProvider { JSONArray getValues ( String criteria , Integer maxCount ) ; }
JSONObject and JSONArray
These objects are part of JSON for Java , an open source wrapper for using JSON in Java .
Refer to Related topics for additional information regarding this library .
The next step is to create CityValueProvider , the implementation of this interface , which provides city data for the < ajax : autocomplete /> control .
Note the following key things about the getValues ( ) implementation :
Data is retrieved from the Location Data Provider -- a Data Abstract Layer ( DAL ) component -- which caches all locations in memory .
A two - phase approach is required to process the data ( TreeMap containing LocationDTO objects ) , because the Location Data Provider returns a TreeMap sorted by zip code .
The results need to be sorted based on the city name for the CityValueProvider .
Listing 9 illustrates how this is done .
Listing 9 .
City value provider
package com.testwebsite.bll ; import java.util.
Iterator ; import java.util .
Set ; import java.util .
TreeMap ; import org.json.JSONArray ; import com.testwebsite.dal.LocationDataService ; import com.testwebsite.dto.LocationDTO ; import com.testwebsite.interfaces.IJsonValueProvider ; /** @model * @author Brian J. Stewart ( Aqua Data Technologies , Inc. http://www.aquadatatech.com) */ public class CityValueProvider implements IJsonValueProvider { /* ( non-Javadoc ) * @see com.testwebsite.interfaces.IJsonValueProvider#getValues(java.lang.String ) */ @ Override public JSONArray getValues ( String criteria , Integer maxCount ) { String cityName = " " ; //

0 ) { cityName = criteria.toLowerCase ( ) ; } // Get Location data from Data Provider TreeMap < Integer , LocationDTO > locData = LocationDataService.getLocationData( ) ; // The LocationDataService Data Provider returns a TreeMap containing // LocationDTO objects that are sorted by Zip Code . //
First build a temporary TreeMap ( sorted list ) filtering with // only unique city names matching the specified cityName parameter TreeMap < String , String > cityData = this.getCityData( locData , cityName ) ; //
Finally iterate through sorted City list // and create JSONArray containing // the number elements specified by the maxCount parameter JSONArray json = this.getJsonData( cityData , maxCount ) ; return json ; } /** *

Get current location data if ( curLocation != null ) { String curCityName = curLocation.getCity ( ) .toLowerCase ( ) ; //

The getJsonData method returns a JSONArray contain a list of strings * with the city name specified with a maximum number of elements as specified * by the maxCount parameter .
* @param cityData TreeMap containing unique list of matching cities * @param maxCount Maximum number of items to include in the JSONArray * @return JSONArray contain sorted list of city names */ protected JSONArray getJsonData( TreeMap < String , String > cityData , int maxCount ) { int count = 1 ; JSONArray json = new JSONArray ( ) ; //
Get city name keys Set < String > citySet = cityData.keySet ( ) ; // Iterate through query results Iterator < String > cityIter = citySet.iterator ( ) ; while ( cityIter.hasNext ( ) ) { // Get current item String curCity = cityIter.next ( ) ; // Add item to JSONArray json.put( curCity ) ; // Increment counter count ++; //
If maximum number of entries has been met , then exit loop if ( count >= maxCount ) break ; } return json ; } }
Create a Servlet to handle asynchronous requests to the value provider
The next step is to build the AutoCompleteServlet Servlet , the interface for the Web browser to call the IJsonValueProvider implementations .
The Servlet is straightforward , with one minor exception .
To meet the goal of " easy integration / deployment , " you should only need to worry about implementing a value provider , rather than the Servlet interface .
To support this goal , you use reflection to instantiate the value provider at runtime using the classname attribute of the < ajax : autocomplete /> control .
See Listing 10 .
Listing 10 .
Auto - complete Servlet
package com.testwebsite.servlets ; import java.io.IOException ; import java.io .
PrintWriter ; import java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException ; import java.lang.reflect .

Create a JSP TagLib control that can be used in a JSP page
The auto - complete control renders a standard INPUT tag , sets up the event handlers , and renders the Suggestion List Container DIV element and appropriate CSS for formatting .
You need to add the following supporting JavaScript functions :
Handle keyboard events -- < ajax : page />
Handle server response and post - asynchronous invocation processing -- < ajax : autocomplete /> , with helper functions rendered in < ajax : page / >
, with helper functions rendered in Highlight a specified item in the suggestion list -- < ajax : page / >
Hide the suggestion list -- < ajax : page />
Handle the selection of an item in the suggestion list ( when the user presses Enter ) -- < ajax : page / >
Handle when the control loses focus -- < ajax : page / >
Let 's start with the onSuggestionKeyDown function , where the Esc key , Enter key , and other control keys are handled .
If the user presses Esc , the suggestion list should be hidden and subsequent events in the JavaScript event chain canceled ( for example , the Key Up event should n't be processed because the event was already handled by hiding the suggestion list ) ; see Listing 11 .
Listing 11 .
Code fragment for handling Esc key
var keyCode = ( window.event ) ?
window.event.keyCode : ev.keyCode ; switch ( keyCode ) { ... // Handle ESCAPE key case 27 : hideSelectionList( curControl , suggestionList ) ; ev.cancelBubble = true ; // IE if ( window.event ) { ev.returnValue = false ; } // Firefox else { ev.preventDefault ( ) ; } break ; ...
If the user presses Enter , the current item should be copied to the input control and the suggestion list hidden .
To hide / display the suggestion list , you use standard CSS for formatting in conjunction with JavaScript to change the class name .
The display property is set to none to hide the control and to block to display the list .
Listing 12 shows the JavaScript function , which you add to the < ajax : page / > control because it can be used with any < ajax : autocomplete /> control .
Listing 12 .
Code fragment for handling the Enter key
... // Handle ENTER key case 13 : handleSelectSuggestItem(curControl , suggestionList ) ; ev.cancelBubble = true ; // IE if ( window.event ) { ev.returnValue = false ; } // Firefox else { ev.preventDefault ( ) ; } break ; ...
The key - down event handler calls handleSelectSuggestItem , which is defined in < ajax : page / > ( see Listing 13 ) .
Listing 13 .
Handling the Enter key
function handleSelectSuggestItem(curControl , suggestionList ) { //
Get selected node // Cursor is a global variable that is incremented / decremented // when the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key is pressed .
var selected Node = suggestionList.childNodes[cursor ] ; //
Get selected value var selected Value = selectedNode.childNodes[0].nodeValue ; //
Set the value of the INPUT control curControl.value = selected Value ; // Finally hide the selection list hideSelectionList ( curControl , suggestionList ) ; } function hideSelectionList( curControl , suggestionList ) { //
If suggestion not found if ( suggestionList == null || suggestionList == undefined ) { return ; } //
Clear the suggestion list elements suggestionList.innerHTML='' ; // Toggle display to none suggestionList.style.display='none ' ; curControl.focus ( ) ; }
There is n't much to handling the pressing of control keys ( Shift , Alt , and Ctrl ) .
You need to ignore these keyboard events by doing the following :
Preventing changes to the input control during the return by setting returnValue on the EVENT object to false ( for Internet Explorer ) and executing preventDefault ( ) on the EVENT object ( for Firefox )
on the object to ( for Internet Explorer ) and executing on the object ( for Firefox ) Canceling the event chain for the keyboard event by setting the cancelBubble property on the EVENT object to true
The complete code for onSuggestionKeyDown appears in Listing 14 .
Listing 14 .
Complete key - down event handler
function onSuggestionKeyDown( curControl , ev ) { //
Get suggestion list container var suggestionList= document.getElementById(curControl.id + ' _suggest ' ) ; //
Get key code of key pressed var keyCode = ( window.event ) ?
window.event.keyCode : ev.keyCode ; switch ( keyCode ) { //
Ignore certain keys case 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 : ev.cancelBubble = true ; // IE if ( window.event ) { ev.returnValue = false ; } // Firefox else { ev.preventDefault ( ) ; } break ; // Handle ESCAPE key case 27 : hideSelectionList( curControl , suggestionList ) ; ev.cancelBubble = true ; // IE if ( window.event ) { ev.returnValue = false ; } // Firefox else { ev.preventDefault ( ) ; } break ; // Handle ENTER key case 13 : handleSelectSuggestItem(curControl , suggestionList ) ; ev.cancelBubble = true ; // IE if ( window.event ) { ev.returnValue = false ; } // Firefox else { ev.preventDefault ( ) ; } break ; } }
The key - up event handler is slightly more interesting .
If the user presses the Up Arrow or Down Arrow key , the highlighted selection should change .
If the user has entered the minimum number of characters ( default : 3 ) , then the asynchronous call should be made to the server to populate the suggestion list .
If the user presses the Up Arrow or Down Arrow key , the global cursor variable is incremented / decremented accordingly .
The cursor variable tracks the currently selected item .
The highlightSelectedNode function is than called to highlight the value .
See Listing 15 .
Listing 15 .
Code fragment of the key - up event handler for handling the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys
... switch ( keyCode ) { // Ignore ESCAPE case 27 : // Handle UP ARROW case 38 : if ( suggestionList.childNodes.length > 0 && cursor > 0 ) { var selectedNode = suggestionList.childNodes [-- cursor ] ; highlightSelectedNode( suggestionList , selectedNode ) ; } break ; // Handle DOWN ARROW case 40 : if ( suggestionList.childNodes.length > 0 && cursor < suggestionList.childNodes.length -1 ) { var selected Node = suggestionList.childNodes [++cursor ] ; highlightSelectedNode( suggestionList , selectedNode ) ; } break ; ...
Listing 16 shows the highlightSelectedNode function for highlighting an item .
CSS rules are defined for selected and unselected items .
The className is toggled using JavaScript .
The highlight for the previously selected element is then removed .
Listing 16 .
Highlight an item in the suggestion list
function highlightSelectedNode( suggestionList , selectedNode ) { if ( suggestion List == null || selected Node == null ) { return ; } //
Iterate through all items searching for a node that // matches the node selected for ( var i=0 ; i < suggestionList.childNodes.length ; i++) { var curNode = suggestionList.childNodes[i ] ; if ( curNode == selected Node ) { curNode.className = ' autoCompleteItemSelected ' } else { curNode.className = ' autoCompleteItem ' ; } } }
If the user presses any other key and has entered at least the minimum number of characters , an asynchronous call to the server is made to retrieve a JSON array of suggestions .
After the ready state changes , the function specified in the req.onreadystatechange property is invoked ( see Listing 17 ) .
Listing 17 .
Code fragment for handling any other key
// If control not found ( should n't happen ) // or minimum number of characters not entered if ( curControl == null || curControl.value.length < minChars ) { // Hide selected item hideSelectionList( curControl , suggestionList ) ; return ; } // Initialize XMLHttpRequest object initializeXmlHttpRequest ( ) ; //
If req object initialized if ( req! =null ) { //
Set callback function req.onreadystatechange=cityName_onServerResponse ; //
Set status text in browser window window.status= ' Retrieving State data from server ...' ; //
Open asynchronous server call req.open( ' GET ', dataUrl , true ) ; // Send request req.send ( null ) ; }
When the server - response function is invoked , the readyState is checked to make sure it 's Loaded .
The status is also checked .
If all is well , the string representation of the JSON array is converted to an array using the eval JavaScript function .
The array is then passed to the populateSuggestionList function , which adds the elements to the Suggestion List .
Listing 18 shows the server - response function .
Listing 18 .
Server - response handler ( generated dynamically by the < ajax: autocomplete / > control )
function cityName_onServerResponse ( ) { //
If loaded if ( req.readyState !
=4 ) { return ; } //
If an error occurred if ( req.status != 200 ) { alert ( ' An error occurred retrieving data . ' ) ; return ; } //
Get response and convert it to an array var responseData = req.responseText ; var dataValues=eval ( ' (' + responseData + ' ) ' ) ; //
Get current control var curControl = document.getElementById('cityName ' ) ; /// Populate suggestion list for control populateSuggestionList( curControl , dataValues ) ; }
The populateSuggestionList function , which is rendered in the < ajax : page / > control , is responsible for populating the suggestion list with the values returned from the asynchronous server call .
The array is then iterated through , and a DIV element is created for each item in the array .
The DIV element is added to the Suggestion List .
Listing 19 shows populateSuggestionList .
Listing 19 .
Populate the suggestion list ( rendered in the < ajax : page / > control )
populateSuggestionList( curControl , dataValues ) { //
Get Suggest List Container for control var container = document.getElementById(curControl.id + ' _suggest ' ) ; //
If container not found ( should n't happen ) , then simply return if ( container == null ) { return ; } // Clear suggestion list container container .
innerHTML
= ''; //
If no values return , hide suggestion list if ( dataValues.length < 1 ) { container.style.display='none ' ; return ; } // Show suggestion list container.style.display='block ' ; container.style.top = ( curControl.offsetTop+curControl.offsetHeight ) + ' px ' ; container.style.left = curControl.offsetLeft + ' px ' ; //
Iterate through all values // 1 . Create DIV element // 2 . Set attributes and text node value // 3 . Append new element to the container for ( var i=0 ; i < dataValues.length;i++ ) { //
Get current value var curValue= dataValues [i ] ; //
If value is not blank if ( curValue != null && curValue.length >
0 ) { // Create DIV element var newItem = document.createElement ( 'div ' ) ; //
Append current value as a text node newItem.appendChild( document.createTextNode(curValue ) ) ; // Set attributes newItem.setAttribute ( ' class ' , ' autoCompleteItem ' ) ; // Finally append new element to container container.appendChild( newItem ) ; } } //
Set first item as the selected node cursor =
0 ; // Get first node var selected Node = container.childNodes[cursor ] ; //
If first node is equal to the first node , hide the selection list if ( selectedNode.childNodes[0].nodeValue == curControl.value ) { hideSelectionList( curControl , container ) ; } else { // Highlight the first node highlightSelectedNode ( container , selected Node ) ; } }

Build the cascading drop - down JSP TagLib control
Typically , business - line applications include selection lists whose values are dependent on other form fields ( for example , a product name that depends on the product category ) .
Prior to Ajax and asynchronous Web programming techniques , you were forced to render all values to the Web page ( typically in a JavaScript array ) and to dynamically populate the values within JavaScript .
The JavaScript arrays were either multidimensional or contained tokens , such as the | character to delimit cascading values .
Alternatively , the entire page would be refreshed to retrieve the values for cascading selection lists .
Neither of these approaches are appealing when you 're dealing with large data sets or trying to build user - friendly Web applications .
With Ajax and asynchronization techniques , you can now provide the same rich and intuitive user experience typically only found in desktop applications .
The following sections describe the steps to create the cascading drop - down control :
Create a value provider / Servlet interface that can be called from JavaScript .
Create the JSP TagLib control to encapsulate everything in a control that can be put in any JSP page .
Create the value provider and interface ( Servlet )
Similar to the value provider you created for the auto - complete control , you create a Servlet to return a JSON array containing the values .
Value providers for cascading controls take a little more effort , because the requirements and data often require separate Servlets or Web services to apply the business rules .
Alternatively , you can use embedded JSP TagLib controls ( controls included in the body of another tag ) , but that complicates things slightly .
Using separate Servlets provides greater flexibility in terms of returning data to the client .
The values can be dependent on other form fields or other complex business rules that are defined in the Servlet .
Listing 21 shows the two value providers for the cascading drop - down controls .
The first is the City value provider , which is dependent on the State value .
The second value provider is for County , which is dependent on the State and City values .
Both Servlets return JSON arrays and use the Location Data Provider ( a DAL component ) .
The code is similar to developing a value provider for the auto - complete control ; the key difference is that you use separate Servlets to keep the implementation simple and flexible .
Listing 21 . CityServlet Servlet
package com.testwebsite.servlets ; import java.io.IOException ; import java.io .
PrintWriter ; import javax.servlet.ServletException ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest ; import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse ; import com.testwebsite.bll.LocationService ; public class CityServlet extends HttpServlet { private static final long serialVersionUID = 3231866266466404450L ; @ Override protected void doGet ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws ServletException , IOException { String data = null ; //

Stewart ( Aqua Data Technologies , Inc. http://www.aquadatatech.com)

If format is not null and it's ' json ' if ( format != null && format.equalsIgnoreCase ( " json " ) ) { data = LocationService.getCountiesAsJson(countyName , stateName , cityName ) ; resp.setContentType(" text / plain " ) ; } //

Get writer for servlet response PrintWriter writer = resp.getWriter ( ) ; writer.println(data ) ; writer.flush ( ) ; } @ Override protected void doPost ( HttpServletRequest req , HttpServletResponse resp ) throws ServletException , IOException { super .doPost ( req , resp ) ; } }
Create the JSP TagLib control
The cascading drop - down control works as follows :
The page is rendered with an empty SELECT control .
control .
The user selects the SELECT control .
When it receives focus , an asynchronous call is made to retrieve the values from the server .
control .
When it receives focus , an asynchronous call is made to retrieve the values from the server .
The server sends the JSON array of values back to the client .
The client dynamically populates the SELECT control with the values in the JSON array .
control with the values in the JSON array .
After the user selects a value from the list and the control loses focus ( upon the blur event ) , the controls that are dependent on the current field are cleared .
This is done to preserve data integrity ( if the State value is change , the City value likely wo n't be valid ) .
The < ajax : page / > control renders the common functions that are usable by all cascading drop - down controls on a page , and the < ajax : dropdown / > control renders the JavaScript specific for an individual control instance .
Render the SELECT control for the cascading drop - down control
The rendering of the SELECT control is straightforward .
The event handlers for the onfocus and onblur events are rendered as shown in Listing 22 .
Listing 22 .
Render the SELECT control for the cascading drop - down control
... /** *
The getSelectControlHtml method returns the html code to render the drop down ( html * select ) control .
* @return Html code for drop down ( html select ) control */ protected String getSelectControlHtml ( ) { StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer ( ) ; // Render dropdown / select control html.append ( " < select id= ' " ) ; html.append(this.getId ( ) ) ; // Render on focus event handler html.append ( " ' onfocus= ' " ) ; html.append(this.getId ( ) ) ; html.append(" _onSelect( this ) ' " ) ; // Render on change event handler html.append ( " on Change= ' " ) ; html.append(this.getId ( ) ) ; html.append (" _onChange ( this ) ' " ) ; //
Render css class if specified if ( this.getCssclass ( ) != null && this.getCssclass().length ( ) >
0 ) { html.append ( " class= ' " ) ; html.append(this.getCssclass ( ) ) ; html.append ( " ' " ) ; } //
Render width if applicable ( not 0/default/auto- fit ) if ( this.getWidth ( ) >
0 ) { html.append ( " style= ' width : " ) ; html.append(this.getWidth( ) ) ; html.append ( " px ' " ) ; } html.append ( " / > " ) ; return html.toString ( ) ; } ...
Event handlers for the cascading drop - down control
In the onSelect event handler , the values for the controls , from which the current control cascades , are retrieved , and the URL is built to send the asynchronous request to the server .
Upon receiving the response , the SELECT tag is populated with values returned in the JSON Array using JavaScript ( see Listing 23 ) .
Listing 23 .
On - select event handler
function stateName_onSelect( curControl ) { if(curControl.options.length >
0 ) { return ; } clearOptions ( curControl ) ; //
Set waiting message in control var waitingOption = new Option ( ' Retrieving values ...' , '' , true , true ) ; curControl.options[curControl.options.length]=waitingOption ; //
The dataUrl is built dynamically based on the cascadeTo control var dataUrl = '/ TestWebSite / State?format=json&stateName= ' + getSelectedValue('stateName ' ) ; // Initialize the XMLHttpRequest object initializeXmlHttpRequest ( ) ; //
If initialization was successful if ( req! =null ) { //
Set callback function req.onreadystatechange=stateName_onServerResponse ; //
Set status text in browser window window.status= ' Retrieving State data from server ...' ; //
Open asynchronous server call req.open( ' GET ', dataUrl , true ) ; // Send request req.send ( null ) ; } }
The following things happen in the server - response handler CONTROL - NAME_onServerResponse , which is dynamically generated by the cascading drop - down control tag :
Ignore status changes unless Loaded
Notify the user if an error occurred during the asynchronous call
Get the current control , and clear all OPTION elements
elements
Get the response data , and convert it to an array containing strings
Populate the SELECT control using the array
Listing 24 is dynamically rendered by the < ajax : dropdown / > control .
Listing 24 .
Server - response handler ( generated dynamically by the control )
function cityName_onServerResponse( ) { //
If not finished , then return if ( req.readyState !
=4 ) { return ; } //
If an error occurred notify user and return if ( req.status != 200 ) { alert ( ' An error occurred retrieving data . ' ) ; return ; } //
Get current control var curControl = document.getElementById('cityName ' ) ; // Clear options clearOptions ( curControl ) ; //
Get response data var responseData = req.responseText ; // Convert to array var dataValues=eval ( '(' + responseData + ' ) ' ) ; // Populate SELECT tag with OPTION elements populateSelectControl( curControl , dataValues ) ;window.status= '' ; }
The populateSelectControl function , which is generated by the < ajax : page / > tag , adds a blank OPTION to the SELECT control , as well as an OPTION element for each value in the dataValues array .
The dynamically generated code fragment is shown in Listing 25 .
Listing 25 .
Populate the SELECT control
function populateSelectControl( curControl , dataValues ) { // Append blank option var blankOption= new Option ( '' , '' , false , true ) ; curControl.options[curControl.options.length]=blankOption ; // Iterate through data value array for ( var i=0 ;i< dataValues.length ;i++ ) { //
Create option var newOption= new Option ( dataValues [i ] , dataValues [i ] , false , false ) ; //
Add option to control options curControl.options[curControl.options.length]=newOption ; } }
In the onChange event handler , all controls that are dependent on the current control are cleared ( see Listing 26 ) .
Listing 26 .
On - change event handler
function stateName_onChange( curControl ) { //
Array dynamically generated by the control var toList= [ ' cityName ' , 'countyName ' ] ; //
If no controls are dependent on this function , simply return if ( toList == null || toList. length == 0 ) { return ; } //
Iterate through list of controls that are dependent on // the current control for ( var i=0 ; i < toList.length ; i++) { //
Get current control name var curControlName = toList[ i ] ; //
Get current control var curToControl = document.getElementById(curControlName ) ; //
If control not found , then exit if ( curToControl == null ) return ; // Clear the current control clearOptions ( curToControl ) ; } }
The clearOptions function , which removes all items in the parent SELECT control , is rendered in the < ajax : page / > control ( see Listing 27 ) .
Listing 27 .
On - change event handler
function clearOptions ( curControl ) { //
If current control is null then exit if ( curControl == null ) { alert ( ' Unable to clear control ' ) ; return ; } //
Check if control is already blank and return if it is if ( curControl.options.length < 1 ) { return ; } // Clear the options curControl.options.length = 0 ; }

Build the test Web pages
The next step is to build sample pages to test the Ajax - enabled controls .
You 'll test the < ajax : autocomplete /> control with the Create New Contact page , and you 'll test the < ajax : dropdown / > control with the Create New Employee page .
Figure 9 shows the test Create New Contact page , which demonstrates how the auto - complete control looks from a user perspective .
Figure 9 . Create New Contact page demonstrates how to use the auto - complete control
The JSP code for this test page is shown in Listing 29 .
Listing 29 .
Sample page to demonstrate using the auto - complete control
< %@ page contentType= " text / html ; charset=ISO - 8859 -5 " %> < %@ taglib prefix= " ajax " uri= " / WEB-INF/tlds/ajax_controls.tld " %> < html > < head > < title > New Contact Information </ title > < link href= " core.css " rel=" stylesheet " type =" text/css " /> < ajax : page /> </ head > < body > < div id =" container " > < form > < div class =" dialog " > < div class=" dialogTitle " >
Contact Information </div > < div class=" contentPane " > < div style = " font - weight : bold " >
First Name :</div > < div > < input type =" text " id =" firstName " size = " 40 " /> </div > < div style = " font - weight : bold " >
Last Name :</div > < div > < input type =" text " id =" lastName " size = " 40 " /> </div > < div style = " font - weight : bold " >
Address :</div > < div > < input type =" text " id =" streetAddress " size = " 40 " /> </div > < div style = " font - weight : bold " >
City :</div > < div > < ajax:autocomplete id=" cityName " width = " 40 " providerclass=" com.testwebsite.bll.CityValueProvider " /> </div > < div style = " font - weight : bold " > County :</div > < div > < input type =" text " id =" countyName " size = " 40 " /> </div > < div style = " font - weight : bold " >

The City Name field is now Ajax enabled .
As the user types text in the City Name field , suggestions are dynamically displayed , similar to Google 's auto - suggest .
Create a new employee
Figure 10 shows the Create New Employee page , which illustrates the cascading drop - down control from a user perspective .

Conclusion
In this article , you learned a few asynchronous communication techniques and how you can add JSON and Ajax to business - line applications through reusable JSP TagLib controls .
Business - line applications can significantly benefit from Ajax - based controls thanks to the improved user experience and more responsive and intuitive user interfaces .
The code is n't tremendously complex ; you just need to integrate the key blocks ( JavaScript , CSS , and J2EE technologies ) to build the Ajax - enabled JSP controls .
You can extend the controls further to do the following :
Support cascading to / from other types of controls ( in addition to SELECT controls )
Add mouse - event handling to the auto - complete control
Add encoding and checking for asynchronous requests

| article by Ken Thompson in Social Networking ( 36 )
I have been checking out social network analysis ( SNA ) tools which allow social network data ( directly input or imported from external systems ) to be displayed , manipulated and analysed graphically in a number of ways .
I was also looking for SNA tools which are free or have a free version .
Here 's 4 tools which look very useful !
SNA tools typically allow a number of different types of social network analyses typically :
Centrality
Centrality as an actor - level coefficient reflects the degree of access to information ( or resources ) of an actor and hence the probability of that actor to acquire a leadership position in the group .
As a network - level coefficient , centrality measures the distribution of information ( or power ) within the group .
Sociometric Coefficients
In a communication network , actor - level sociometric coefficients measure the level of communicational activity of a specific actor .
Distance - Related Coefficients
This category of measures is based on the concept of geodesic distance .
Given two nodes of a network , say node A and node B , the geodesic distance from A to B is the length of the shortest possible path from A to B .
In terms of specific SNA tools here are 4 which have a free version :
Socilyzer - www.socilyzer.com.
Socilyzer is built for managers and consultants to conduct their own basic analyses .
The aim of the tool is to make it as easy as possible by integrating questionnaire design , data collection and data visualization .
There are also good resources on the website explaining how to interpret the SNA diagrams .
Well worth trying out .
SocNetV - " Social Networks Visualiser " .
It has a very nice gui , runs on Linux , Windows and Mac , supports GraphML and .net files , and is swift to compute centralities and distances .
It does some network layout , as well .
Check it out .
NodeXL .
NodeXL is a free , open - source template for Microsoft ® Excel® 2007 and 2010 that makes it easy to explore network graphs .
With NodeXL , you can enter a network edge list in a worksheet , click a button and see your graph , all in the familiar environment Excel .
NodeXL is an easy way into SNA for those who like spreadsheets .
Agna is a platform - independent application designed for social network analysis , sociometry and sequential analysis .
Agna was the first good tool I found in this area when I wrote the original version of this article way back in 2008 .
Agna can still be downloaded but I do n't believe there is any support or software updates .
Agna still a neat tool and runs on both PC and Mac .
Wikipedia also now has a very useful page Social network analysis software which offers a comprehensive list of nearly 70 SNA tools and summarises them in a table covering Main Functionality , Input Formats , Output Formats , Platforms , Licensing and costs .
For a great introduction to social networks and social network analysis see these two articles by Richard Cross :
Social Network Analysis : an introduction
Social Network Analysis in practice
Finally , you can check out my change management simulation game which uses SNA to establish the effects of social and reputational influence on key stakeholders in a major company change management programmes .

September 24 , 2008 --
We are living a decisive moment in the history of humankind .
The threats looming over the world put the very existence of the human species at risk .
The promotion of peace , solidarity , social justice and sustainable development is the only WAY to ensure the future .
The prevailing world order , unjust and unsustainable , must be replaced by a new system that is truly democratic and equitable , based on respect for international law and on the principles of solidarity and justice , putting an end to the inequalities and exclusion to which the great majorities of the population of our planet have been condemned .
There are no alternatives .
Those responsible for this state of affairs , the industrialised nations and , in particular , the sole superpower , have to accept their responsibilities .
Fabulous fortunes cannot continue to be wasted while millions of human beings are starving and dying of curable diseases .
It is not possible to keep on polluting the air and poisoning the oceans ; this destroys the living conditions of our future generations .
Neither the peoples nor the planet itself will permit this without great social upheaval and extremely serious natural disasters .
The wars of conquest , the aggression and illegal occupation of countries , military intervention and the bombing of innocent civilians , the unbridled arms race , the pillage and usurping of the Third World ’s natural resources and the imperial offensive to crush the resistance of the peoples who are defending their rights , constitute the greatest and most serious threats to peace and international security .
Concepts such as limitation of sovereignty , pre-emptive war or regime change , are an expression of the desire to mutilate the independence of our countries .
The so - called war on terrorism or the false promotion of their freedoms , are an excuse for aggression and military occupation , for torture , arbitrary arrests and the denial of the right of self - determination of peoples , for unfair blockades and unilaterally imposed sanctions , for the imposition of political , economic and social models that facilitate imperial domination , in open disdain for history , cultures and the sovereign will of the peoples .
Rich and poor
The gap between the rich and the poor widens with every passing day .
The very modest Millennium Development Goals constitute an unreachable dream for the vast majority .
While a trillion of dollars is spent on weapons in the world , more than 850 million human beings are starving , 1.1 billion people do n’t have access to drinking water , 2.6 billion lack sewage services and more than 800 million are illiterate .
More than 640 million children lack adequate housing , 115 million do not attend primary school and 10 million die before the age of five , in most cases as the result of diseases that can be cured .
The populations of the South are suffering with increasing frequency from natural disasters , whose consequences have been aggravated by climate change .
Haiti , Jamaica , Cuba and other Caribbean countries are examples of that .
Let us make a plea for solidarity especially for our sister country of Haiti as it faces its dramatic situation .
The rise in oil prices is the result of irrational consumption , strong speculation and imperial war adventures .
The desperate search for new sources of energy has pushed the criminal strategy driven by the United States government to transform grains and cereals into fuel .
For a large part of the non-aligned countries , the situation is becoming unsustainable .
Our nations have paid , and they will continue to pay the cost and the consequences of the irrationality , wastefulness and speculation of a few countries in the industrialised North who are responsible for the world food crisis .
They imposed trade liberalisation and the financial prescriptions of structural adjustment on the developing countries .
They caused the ruin of many small producers ; they denied , and in some cases destroyed , emerging agricultural development in the countries of the South , turning them into net food importing countries .
They are the ones who maintain obscene agricultural subsidies , while they force their rules on international trade .
They set prices , monopolise technologies , impose unfair certifications and manipulate the distribution channels , the financing sources and trade .
They control transportation , scientific research , genetic banks and the production of fertilisers and pesticides .
We have not come here to complain .
We have come , on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned countries , to demand and defend the vindication of thousands of millions of human beings who claim justice and their rights .
Commitments
The formula is not difficult nor does it require great sacrifices .
All we need is the necessary political will , less egotism and the objective understanding that if we do not act today , the consequences could be apocalyptic and would affect the rich and poor alike .
For this reason , Cuba once again calls on the governments of the developed countries , on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , to honour their commitments and , in particular , Cuba urges them to :
Put an end to the wars of occupation and to the plunder of the resources of the Third World countries and to free up at least a part of their millions in military spending to direct those resources towards international assistance for the benefit of sustainable development .
Cancel the foreign debt of developing countries since it has been already paid more than once , and with this , additional resources would be released that could be channeled to economic development and social programs .
Honour the commitment of directing at least 0.7 % of the gross domestic product for Official Development Assistance , unconditionally , so that the South countries would be able to use those resources for their national priorities and promote access of poor countries to substantial sums of fresh financing .
Direct one - fourth of the money that is squandered each year on commercial advertising to food production ; this would free up almost 250 billion additional dollars to fight hunger and malnutrition .
Direct the money being used for the North ’s agricultural subsidies to agricultural development in the South .
By doing this , our countries would have about a billion dollars per day available to invest in food production .
Comply with the Kyoto Protocol commitments and set commitments to reduce [ greenhouse gas ] emissions more generously starting in 2012 , without wanting to increase restrictions for countries that , even today , maintain per capita emission levels that are much lower than those of the North countries .
Promote the access of the Third World to technologies and support the training of their human resources .
Today , in contrast , qualified personnel from the South are subjected to unfair competition and incentives presented by discriminatory and selective migratory policies applied by the United States and Europe .
And something that is today more urgent than ever , the establishment of a democratic and equitable international order , and a fair and transparent trading system where all States will participate , in sovereignty , in the decisions that affect them .
Moreover , it is our deepest belief that solidarity between peoples and governments is possible .
In Latin America and the Caribbean , ALBA and PETROCARIBE have demonstrated this .
The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has remained faithful to its founding principles .
We support the cause of the Palestinian people and their inalienable right to self - determination in an independent and sovereign State , with its capital in East Jerusalem .
We support the cause of all those other peoples whose sovereignty and territorial integrity is being threatened , like Venezuela and Bolivia , and we endorse the right of Puerto Rico to be independent .
We condemn the imposition of unilateral coercive measures in violation of international law , and attempts to implant a single model for a political , economic and social system .
We object to the negative practices of certifying countries according to the patterns and interests of the powerful .
We strongly oppose political manipulation and the application of double standards in the matter of human rights , and we reject the selective imposition of politically motivated resolutions against the member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement .
The establishment of the Human Rights Council gives us the opportunity to open up a new era in the promotion and protection of all human rights for all , on the basis of international cooperation and constructive dialogue .
Those who caused the demise of the old Human Rights Commission are now trying to disqualify the council because they have not been able to bend it to serve their own self interests .
They refuse to participate in its work to escape the scrutiny of the international community in the framework of the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism .
The legitimacy of the council does not depend on the perception that the Empire has about its work , but on its capacity to discharge its mandate with the strictest adherence to the principles of universality , objectivity , impartiality and non selectivity in the treatment of human rights issues .
The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries will continue to defend the interests of the Third World and promote the building of a world which is more just , more democratic and with more solidarity .

Cuba has had to pay a very high price for the defence of its independence and sovereignty .
The heroic people of Cuba have endured the longest and cruelest blockade in history , imposed by the most powerful nation on Earth .
Despite the fact that this General Assembly has repeatedly and resoundingly pronounced itself in favour of ending this genocidal policy , the United States government has not only ignored the will of the international community , but in marked disregard of the same , has gradually intensified its economic war against Cuba .
Never has the foreign policy against a country been armed with such a broad and sophisticated arsenal of aggressive measures in the political , economic , cultural , diplomatic , military , psychological and ideological domain .
Cuba has just been lashed by two intense hurricanes which have devastated its agriculture and seriously affected part of its infrastructure and damaged or destroyed more than 400,000 homes .
Allow me to take advantage of this opportunity , on behalf of the Cuban government and people , to thank all those countries , organisations and persons who in one way or another have honestly and sincerely contributed with resources or moral support to the reconstruction efforts undertaken by my country .
That stands in contrast with the position of the United States government which continues to ruthlessly apply their blockade .
Cuba has asked for no gifts from the United States government .
It has simply asked and asked again that it be allowed to purchase in the United States the materials that are indispensable for the reconstruction of homes and power grid and that US companies be authorised to grant Cuba private commercial credits to buy food .
The answer has been negative , and it has been accompanied with an attempt to manipulate information in such a manner that the government of the United States seems to be concerned for the wellbeing of the Cuban people while the government of Cuba is perceived to be turning down their offer .
If the United States were really so concerned for the Cuban people , the only moral and ethical behaviour would be to lift the blockade imposed on Cuba for the last five decades , in violation of the most elemental rules of International Law and the Charter of the United Nations .
This irrational policy has a clear aim : to destroy the process of profound revolutionary transformations undertaken by the Cuban people from 1959 , in other words , trampling on its right to self - determination , wresting away its freedom and its political , economic and social conquests and plunging it backwards to its former neocolonial status .
The Bush administration intends to justify the intensification of its policy against Cuba by turning once more to fraud and deceit , with the cynicism and hypocrisy that characterises it .
Its determination to dominate and re-colonise Cuba is being presented , no less , like an endeavour to liberate and democratise .
Who , other than its accomplices , recognises that the United States government has any authority in this world in the matter of democracy and human rights ?
What authority would such a government claim , one that hunts down and cruelly mistreats the illegal migrants at its southern border , that legalises the use of torture and keeps in concentration camps , such as the one installed in the territory illegally occupied by the US base at Guantánamo , people who have not been proved of or even charged with any crime ?
What respect is due to a government that attacks the sovereignty of other states using the excuse of the fight against terrorism , while at the same time guaranteeing impunity to anti-Cuban terrorists ?
What kind of justice can be promoted by an administration that illegally keeps imprisoned five Cuban patriots who were only seeking information to prevent the actions of the terrorist groups operating against Cuba from the United States ?
Cuba appreciates the solidarity which it has received from this General Assembly in its fight against the blockade and the aggressions which it has had to confront for almost five decades .
Cuba reaffirms its unyielding decision to defend its sovereignty and independence .
Cuba reaffirms its will to carry on , together with members of the Movement for Non-Aligned Countries , in the battle for a better world , where the rights of all peoples for justice and development are respected .

Live News 24 Hours a Day Feedback
There 's been some recent news coverage about Wikimedia 's ongoing migration of servers to Ubuntu Linux .
While much of the coverage is fairly straightforward and fact - based , there are some common questions and misconceptions I 've seen in comments .
Was this in response to ( insert recent event ) ?
No .
We started standardizing on Ubuntu in 2006 , and have been migrating various subsystems over time .
Why did you stop using Red Hat Enterprise Linux !?!?
We never used Red Hat Enterprise Linux -- we originally had an ad - hoc mix of old Red Hat 9 and Fedora 2 , 3 , and 4 systems , which we were interested in replacing with a more standardized infrastructure to simplify our internal server setup and administration .
Why not stick with Fedora ?
We like the predictable release schedule and the idea of infrastructure packages being up to date , but ...
Security updates cut off very quickly for stable systems , so we did n't like leaving old installations in place , but ...
New releases feel too bleeding edge , so we did n't like upgrading existing installations either .
To top it off , while RPM is n't too awful , yum is slow and annoying as a package manager and we just do n't like it .
Do you know fedora apt - get and fedora smart ?
Yes , we used it back in the day and it was still a bit awkward .
Why not Red Hat Enterprise Linux / CentOS ?
The insanely slow release cycle is a bit of a turn - off ; we need to make sure we have our RAID drivers and reasonably up - to - date LAMP and image - rerendering infrastructure software .
As with Fedora , yum as the package manager is a big turn - off .
It also seems silly to go with something where we'd have to play distro - clone games when using it without a support contract .
( Hey , at least it 's not IceWeasel ! )
Why not Debian ?
Many of our admins had more of a Debian background and preferred its file layout , but ...
Debian has an unpredictable and insanely slow release cycle for stable , while being too shifty and bleeding - edge on testing / unstable .
But with RHEL / CentOS / Debian could n't you just install package backports for updated software you need ?
We could , and we do so on Ubuntu when we need to use patched , customized , or newer versions than are available .
But it 's nice to not have to backport a hundred library dependencies to get an updated librsvg renderer .
Why not ( insert any other distro here ) ?
Sorry , your favorite distro was n't cool enough to even get seriously mentioned for consideration .
Why Ubuntu in particular ?
It 's got the things we like about Fedora ( predictable release schedule with reasonably up to date infrastructure packages ) with a longer security update schedule , plus the things we like about Debian ( nicer package manager and general Debian - style file layout which some of our admins prefer ) .
But why is Ubuntu so earth - shatteringly good that this is news ?
In many ways , it was more important that we standardized on something than that we standardized on Ubuntu specifically .
But as stated above , there are definitely things we like about it !
Was the availability of commercial support an important factor ?
Commercial support availability was not a significant factor .
Longer security update availability was a factor -- the long - term support releases were just being announced around the time we chose to standardize on Ubuntu .
Note that even the non-LTS releases get security updates longer than Fedora ( 18 vs 12 months , which is significant in the context of a 6 - month release cycle ) .
Do you have a support contract with Canonical ?
Do you pay for it ?
Canonical has recently provided us with a support contract free of charge because they think we 're cool .
We have not actually used it so far ; these sorts of support contracts are usually more symbolic than practical for us , since we tend to escalate issues directly to engineers as is . ;)
Wikimedia must be a big rich corporation with your fancy website ; you should pay Canonical to support Open Source instead of freeloading !
We 're actually a small non-profit that relies on donations to operate .
A large part of what we do is Free / Open Source software development , including our own MediaWiki and improvements to Squid and other software we use .
Ubuntu is a desktop distro , is n't it stupid to put it on a server ?
Ubuntu is based on Debian , which according to rumor is a great server distro .
We find it works pretty well in a server configuration .
I had a bad experience with Ubuntu two years ago , which proves it is terrible and you are idiots for using it .
When I was six , another kid kicked a soccer ball right into my nose during a game , and I cried all the way home .
It would , however , be a logical fallacy for me to conclude from this that soccer is a terrible game which no one should play .
Wanting both frequent updates and stability / support is just wishing for a pony !
Well , we 're riding our ponies to the tune of several billion page views per month .
Where 's your pony ?
Oh , you did n't get one ?

[ In this passionate opinion piece , Codemasters principal designer Phil O'Connor outlines 10 different ways you can spot a " real game designer " during the resume and interview process , and avoid hiring ineffective or unqualified applicants . ]
I have the incredible fortune of being paid to design games .
I consider this a privilege , the result of some luck , but at the same time , it ’s something I worked for years at achieving .
I wanted to be a game designer from a very young age , and I built up the experience and knowledge that eventually convinced people to hire me to do this .
As someone who worked so hard to break into the industry , I have a somewhat stronger opinion than most about the quality of game designers that get in .
I feel that every designer should pay their dues before they 're allowed anywhere near game design , and that they should be supremely qualified as students of gaming !
Sadly the demand for designers has created a situation in the industry where many people getting into design positions do n’t fit the bill .
Game design is one of the most tricky and contentious positions in the game industry .
No two companies I have worked with have treated the position of design in the same way .
Some designers have producer - type duties / powers , others treat them like artists , and yet others do n’t have design positions at all but instead assign the job to a producer , coder or artist .
The only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that you need game designers .
The problem is , however , that everyone is a game designer , or thinks they are .
What I mean by that is everyone can come up with game design ideas , ideas are a dime a dozen .
Game Designers Suffer From a Credibility Problem
The art of game design is getting the right combination of ideas for a game , communicating them effectively to the team , and executing those ideas through the cycle of development ( from conception , to prototyping , to modification , and to the final implementation / cut stage ) .
The problem is that game designers suffer from a credibility problem .
One of the causes of this is the lack of professional accreditation for game design .
I realize there are schools now that supposedly “ teach ” game design , and you can even get a degree in it now , but most developers laugh at the idea of a 23 - year - old graduate in game design having any clue about designing a computer game .
The best school for game design remains industry time , at least the years development experience and , at the very minimum , one shipped title .
Since most designers working in the industry do n’t have a degree in design , many of your peers are reluctant to treat you as an authority in your field , especially since anyone and their dog can come up with game ideas .
There is constant skepticism from colleagues holding computer science degrees and art diplomas about your qualification to make critical decisions about the game .
Producers are also prone to “ suggest ” designs because they have managerial authority , and this makes them sometimes believe that they are better qualified to make design decisions than you are .
Another obstacle to the credibility of game designers is that the field attracts a good degree of charlatanry .
The very nature of game design work ( mostly ideas driven , no professional qualification necessary ) attracts the kind of people who think they can BS their way into the job .
Too many of them succeed and thus give designers an even worse name .
For development studios , this can have a fatal effect , and in an effort to improve the reputation of my profession among my peers and help developers hire the right people , I am providing some advice on how to properly interview for game design positions .
Obviously , if the candidate has dozens of shipped AAA titles under their belt and has a proven record , you do n’t really need this list .
Any candidate who has less than three years in the industry is more difficult to assess , so hopefully these suggestions will help pick the right people .
Ten Ways to Spot a Real Game Designer
The Resume :
1. Look for signs of a deep interest in gaming .
The resume should indicate gaming as a way of life , not just a job .
Modding experience is especially a key sign .
Anyone who wants to be a game designer has an extensive record of making games in their spare time , for free : making levels for favorite games , modding , writing game material , creating board games , RPG background , story writing , etc .
Game designers must be gaming fanatics , not just playing them , but making them in multiple mediums .
Beware any game designer that does n’t play games every spare second of their time or have an extensive history of game making .
Look for a long history of gaming interest , not just a sudden career change decision .
Some developers decide that they are tired of being producer / artist / programmer and they want to go into game design .
Although experienced , they may not be suitable for design work despite this .
Candidates that have a knack for game design usually have demonstrated a passion for game mechanics stretching from early adulthood .
2. Look for a wide variety in gaming taste : A real designer should have a wide interest in games , not just a single format .
Look for signs of this wider interest in their hobbies , or ask them what kinds of games they play .
Ask them to describe what they like about each kind of gaming .
They should be able to do this at length .
I am talking cross platform , boardgames , RPGs , and the classics : cards , chess , backgammon , etc .
Good designers borrow the best ideas from all mediums .
3 . If the resume lists design credit on shipped games , ask them to describe in detail what their design contribution was to those games .
A real designer should be able to go into extensive detail on this , most designers are proud of the work .
If the response is vague , you are probably talking to a charlatan .
The Interview :
If you follow these steps in an interview process , you should be able to spot the bull from the real deal :
1 . Any designer should be able to describe mechanics in a way that is understandable .
If you ask the designer candidate to come up with a sample feature for your game , ask them to describe how the feature will work mechanically .
A real designer can describe mathematically and mechanically how a feature will function and be implemented with other game systems , down to every detail .
For example , if a designer talks about how the AI will be able to react to the player ’s actions , they should be able to detail exactly how that will work : will it be based on how many “ bad behavior ” points the player has accumulated , will it depend on triggers set in the dialogue system that will play specific responses , will it be based on a proximity system that the AI checks when the player is within range , assessing the player ’s reputation points , shown weapons , clothing , etc .
If a candidate cannot describe probabilities , mathematics , or outline game systems supporting a feature , then they probably are not the real deal .
2 . A game designer should be able to explain clearly any of their design ideas .
If they can not make you understand how their idea works , then you should pass .
All true designers are able to explain how their ideas work and play to any audience .
That is one of the biggest jobs of game design , translating the feature to the team in a manner that they can understand it and integrate it from their point of view : for coders its codese , for artists its artese , sound language , producer talk , and marketing speak .
3 . Making the game is also selling the game .
A designer must be able to communicate why the game is fun to you .
They have to be able to do this in under a minute and leave you with the unmistakable feeling that they are right .
Any designer who does n’t understand that you are selling it the minute you start making a game , is not a designer .
A designer has to sell to all sections of development , not just the management and marketing departments .
Designers have to tell everyone working on the game how fun it ’s going to be without a playable version for many months to come .
They are the cheerleaders for the project early on until there is something to show .
In an interview , ask the potential candidate to pitch you a favorite game concepts they would like to work on , and if you are not convinced it ’s fun , them maybe they are not right for you .
4 . A true game designer should be able to describe in detail what they like / dislike about a game .
Ask them to talk about their favorite and least favorite games .
Ask them to explain why they like / dislike them .
Lackluster opinion in this area is a Bad Sign .
So is an answer that amounts to them not liking the color of the interface or the names of some of the characters .
They should be able to provide clear and solid reasons for their opinion .
5 . Wide areas of interest : A real game designer is inspired by the world around them : books , news events , music , history , movies , art , etc .
Depending on the type of game you are interviewing for , this may be one of the most critical questions you can ask .
Ask the candidate to talk about their personal interests , what kind of books they read , movies they watched , any other personal interest them may have .
A real designer should have extensive and wide interests , bringing those interests to bear in their design .
One question I ask is what their favorite movie is and why .
The answer can tell you a lot about the kind of designer they are .
A short answer is usually a Bad Sign .
6. Attitude : Beware the Ideas Man .
Some people think game design is just about coming up with bright ideas .
They fancy themselves the smartest person in the room , therefore employers should be begging to hire them so they can get their hands on their wonderful ideas , which naturally will make millions .
This attitude is fairly easy to spot .
Stay away !
Another type to stay away from is the Industry Fanboy .
A fanboy is someone who is intimately aware of the debates and major conventions of gaming , knows all the top games and the buzz about them , but does n’t understand game design or have anything original to contribute .
They rely on the game press and popular opinion for their understanding of games , basically copying what other people have said and done .
They known the canon , but cannot elaborate on it or expand on it themselves .
Some may think this is not such a bad thing , so as an illustration consider someone who has learned a guitar piece by heart : they can play it perfectly , note for note , but if you ask them to interpret the piece by adding a blues feel to it or a jazzy tone , they cannot comply .
They known the piece , but they do n’t know much about music .
Designers can be like that .
Listen to the candidate talk about games and the gaming industry -- if a lot of it sounds familiar , if it sounds straight off the pages of the game press , or if the words are not their own , you are probably dealing with a fanboy .
7 . No design survives first contact with code :
Ask them to describe an example of a feature change / cut and how they adapted to it .
If they worked on a game , they should be able to describe at least one feature in the original design that was cut ( for whatever reason ) , and describe why they chose that feature and how it impacted the rest of the game .
Make sure they go into detail on how the cut impacted other gameplay features , as well as how they took that into account .
A real designer should be able to recall in detail the circumstances surrounding such traumatic ( but inevitable ) events .
If they sound like they did n’t care about the feature in the first place , or if do n’t have a feature cut story , this could be a bad sign .
Conclusion
Note that none of these 10 points on their own are an indication that the candidate is not suitable .
But if you sense that the person in front of you checked off a good number of these warning signs , you might want to reconsider giving them a position on your team .
Of course , even if your candidate checked positive on all of them , there is no guarantee that the person will work out for your project or your culture .
There are many factors that make someone a good employee that are beyond the scope of this article , but at least you may have better confidence that they are actually real game designers .
Happy hiring .

The government plans have provoked a series of nationwide strikes
Air traffic , urban transport and public services have ground to a halt in Greece , where hundreds of thousands of people have walked out on strike .
Thousands marched through Athens in protest at privatisation , caps on pay and reforms to the pension system .
A small group of protesters threw stones and clashed with riot police , who fired tear gas .
But there were no reports of injuries and for the most part rallies in the capital passed off peacefully .
Country 'at a halt '
Public offices across the country were forced to close , with hundreds of thousands of people thought to have joined the nationwide strike , called by two unions representing some 2.5 million people .
Nearly 200 domestic and international flights and many train services were cancelled , and ferries were forced to remain in port .
State hospitals ran on skeleton staffs , while schools , universities and post offices kept their doors closed .
Bank staff , lawyers , journalists and civil engineers also joined the strike .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The country has effectively come to a halt , " said union spokesman Efstathios Anestis .
" Participation is very high , in many sectors it exceeds 90 % of the work force . "
There was no confirmation of that estimate from the government , and with journalists also on strike , reliable news was sparse .
Two marches wound their way through Athens , displaying opposition to the 2009 draft budget , due to go before parliament this week .
Many of the protesters called for increased government support - demanding the minimum wage be doubled .
They decried a 28 bn - euro ( £ 22 bn ) government rescue package to banks hit by the international credit crisis - one banner read : " Not one euro to support the capitalists . "
The unions are also opposing the government 's plans to privatise the loss - making Olympic Airlines .
The conservative government of Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis wants to press ahead with its privatisation plans and the overhaul of the country 's debt - ridden pension system .
The plans include eliminating most early retirement schemes , merging pension funds and capping auxiliary pensions .
Mr Karamanlis has promised to shield consumers from price rises and compensate workers from privatised firms .
However , the plans have provoked a series of nationwide strikes and demonstrations .
When you put a price on the “ services ” that forests provide , deforestation costs the world economy between $ 5 and $ 7 trillion every year .
But when you put a price on those services , and use that financial incentive to provide so - called carbon offsets , the law of unintended consequences reigns supreme .
A new study reported in the Guardian shows that those unintended consequences may themselves be hazardous to the environment in other ways than just carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) emissions or deforestation .
As the article says , the idea is to make trees more valuable standing and growing than chopped down and reduced to firewood or timber .
The problem is that the supposedly win - win market systems have n’t worked .
The article points out that monoculture ( single species ) tree plantations destroy local biodiversity in the quest for finding fast growing species that , theoretically , soak up more CO 2 from the atmosphere .
Indigenous people who have been engaged in reforestation projects are finding themselves unable to plant crops or native plants because the local government , more interested in foreign carbon offset investment than in biodiversity , reclassifies the forest in a way that permits it to be logged and then replanted with a tree farm .
If this is what carbon offsets reaps , then it ’s hardly any wonder that a growing number of environmental activists oppose the practice .

Salt water marsh restoration may efficiently sequester carbon
Deforestation .
Biodiversity .
Clean water .
Carbon sequestration .
Wetlands protection .
Shoreline restoration .
Most major environmental problems facing the world are connected in some way to other .
For that reason , most of the connected environmental problems must be solved more or less simultaneously .
Take clean water , shoreline restoration , wetlands protection , and climate change – wetlands are known to efficiently clean both freshwater and salt water , they help restore the shoreline and protect it from storm damage , and , if the preliminary results from a recent U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) hold , they grow fast enough to sequester significant amounts of carbon too .
Two months after starting a wetlands restoration research project in California ’s Sacramento −San Joaquin River delta , the USGS researchers reported that their project was capturing 30 times the amount of carbon per square meter than Kyoto Protocol - compliant reforested agricultural land .
This is because wetlands grow so fast and convert that growth into low - oxygen , slowly decomposing peat bogs and , ultimately , into new land over hundreds or thousands of years .
However , freshwater wetlands have enough oxygen in the water to produce large amounts of methane .
And since the USGS study has n’t yet measured the amount of released methane , the total carbon sequestered may in fact be largely or even entirely negated by methane releases .
According to the ACS article , though , salt water marshes do n’t suffer from the same problem , or at least not to the same degree .
Because the salt water marshes grow as fast as their freshwater counterparts , they sequester as much carbon .
But because there ’s a lot more sulfate in salt water , bacteria do n’t produce methane in significant amounts , and so methane emissions are unlikely to offset the CO 2 absorption in the marsh .
And as the marshes pull CO 2 out of the air , they ’ll also clean the water , reduce shoreline erosion , slowly build new land , and provide food and shelter for wildlife .

Shallow ground water modeling shows effects on climate
In an interesting development , a new study reported in Environmental Science & Technology shows that the amount of ground water in a area has an effect on that area ’s climate .
According to the ES&T article , new modeling based on a watershed in Oklahoma suggests that not only does climate affect the water table , but the water table also affects climate .
This feedback effect is produced due to changes in how much water plants suck out of the ground and release into the atmosphere ( a process known as transpiration ) , how river flow changes as a result of water table changes , etc .
Reed Maxwell of the Colorado School of Mines is quoted by ES&T as saying that this new hydrologic modeling will improve climate modeling in general by integrating hydrology and climatology together .
However , as there are significant issues with data and modeling of both on similar scales , so it ’ll be quite some time before integrated global models are available to climate researchers .

Electronics manufacturing compound a strong greenhouse gas
The Carboholic mentioned an unregulated industrial compound called NF 3 used in the manufacturing of liquid - crystal displays ( LCDs ) back in July .
NF 3 is nitrogen triflouride , and it ’s a potent greenhouse gas ( GHG ) .
A new report last week found that the amount of NF 3 in the atmosphere is 4.5 times what atmospheric scientists had previously thought , and concentrations are increasing at 11 % per year .
While the gas is currently unregulated , because of its potency as a GHG and how much of it is entering the atmosphere ( 16 % of the entire global production of NF 3 , not 2 % as researchers had previously thought ) , scientists are already recommending that it be included in the next climate disruption treaty to be hashed out in Copenhagen in 2009 .
While this is certainly important news , it is not , as The Hindu ’s headline claims , ” NF3 contributes more to global warming than CO2 ″ .
This headline goes beyond misleading – it ’s flat out wrong .
Unfortunately , The Hindu article is the featured article on Google News for this news topic as I ’m writing this week ’s Carboholic and it has been been for at least two days .
This means that there are certainly deniers who have , or will , latch onto this headline and claim that it debunks the whole body of anthropogenic climate disruption science when it does nothing of the sort .
In fact , anyone who reads the article in The Hindu will find that the article actually contradicts the headline .
[ C]urrent nitrogen trifluoride emissions contribute only about 0.04 per cent of the total global warming effect caused by current human - produced Carbon dioxide emissions , [ the scientists ] added .

Deutsche Asset Management : climate and financial crises may work together
According to Fortune Magazine ’s Investor Daily , the confluence of two crises , one of global finance and one of climate , presents a unique opportunity .
Specifically , a recently release report by Deutsche Asset Management ( DAM ) suggests that companies and governments that are willing to invest in new technology and upgrades will position themselves for a very profitable future .
According to the Investor Daily article , the International Energy Agency estimates that the clean energy market is $ 45 trillion between now and 2008 .
This market is regulated and nearly guaranteed as interstate , national , and international agreements are made that will force people to make dramatic changes to how they consume energy in all its forms .
And because of all the government support , companies that provide energy efficiency technologies , renewable energy , an so forth have what Mark Fulton , global head of climate change investment research for DAM and primary author of the report , calls “ a significant safety net . ”
Of course , the article points out that falling prices for fossil fuels may turn the market for renewable energy and energy efficiency on its head even with government support .
Unfortunately , as NYTimes commentator Thomas Friedman pointed out last week , the U.S. has been here before – in the 1980s , following the oil embargo .
But this time we do n’t have the luxury of time , if we ever really did .

A few months ago we had a watershed moment here in MetaTalk .
We established that AskMe , even perhaps Metafilter itself , was and perhaps still is , a boys club .
That misogyny ran rampant here and that it made the women uncomfortable when it reared its ugly head .
That was an important discussion and there is no two - ways about it .
It 's good that we had that discussion and hopefully things have started to change .
Now it 's time we had another discussion about a less well known topic .
Indeed , it is a topic that is described by a word that even my spell checker , which recognizes the word ' misogyny ' with ease , dose n't know .
That word ?
Most of you may be unfamiliar with the word .
This is understandable .
Google Fight shows that ' misogyny ' beats ' misandry ' with a score of 1,740,000 hits to a mere 153,000 hits .
So just what is misandry ?
Those of you who did not read the linked Wikipedia article will read that it is a " hatred ( or contempt ) of men or boys " and that it is " parallel to misogyny - the hatred of women .
" I have to say I 've not seen much examples of misandry on Metafilter , but Ask Metafilter is full of examples .
Far too many to link to here , in fact .
But time and time again we see examples in AskMe , mostly in relationship - filter questions , where men are denigrated and put down for no other reason than that they are men and must be , at least in some way , evil .
Jessamyn would ( and does ) disagree with me .
Recently I expressed this feeling to which she replied " I 'm sorry a question you asked there once went badly , but I really do n't see this as the case generally .
" I have the greatest respect and admiration for the job that the moderators do here , but I feel that this is an issue that ’s slipping under the radar .
And I owe jessamyn a great deal and though we are likely bound to disagree on this topic , I know ( hope ? ) she ’ll understand that I hold her in high esteem but also that she ’ll understand why I feel this way .
As she said , a question I once asked about my own relationship , one which I regret asking and one which I freely admit sounded misogynistic but which was asked when I really was n’t in the clearest state of mind , turned into a blood bath with most people calling me a misogynist , a claim I still resent and refute to this day .
And ironically , the more I recanted , the more I tried to defend myself , the bigger a misogynist I seemed to become .
At least according to most of those who participated in the thread .
This is why I ’m posting this in my sockpuppet account .
That , and a fear that the mere fact I have raised this topic as a matter of concern for discussion will once again paint me as a misogynist .
Back to the topic at hand ; jessamyn does not see this as the case but I do and I wonder if the community would do as well , when presented with some evidence ( or at the very least the notion in general ) .
For the purposes of this discussion , , as I have no issue with the latter .
Those that are n’t are questions that are along the lines of " My boyfriend is beating me " or " My husband drinks a lot and gambles away all my money " or something similar within which people answer DTMFA .
This is an entirely understandable response to that situation and certainly the best course of action as these are quite often clear cut cases in which the man in question deserves to be called out for the loser that he is .
But all too often a woman will ask a question like " I love my boyfriend and he loves me but I have a fear of commitment " or " My husband and I had an argument the other night about money .
He treats me well but I think he spends irresponsibly sometimes .
How can I rectify the problem ? " , and the answers will invariably come back as " DTMFA . "
All to often a man will ask “ One of my girlfriends habits is a problem for me .
How can I overcome it ? ” , only to be shouted down as controlling , abusive , passive aggressive and , you guessed it , a misogynist .
In my view , AskMe always seems to come down on the side of women and more often than not seems to imply that men are vile pigs who can't ever be trusted so just do n't .
Recent examples include this question , in which a woman explains that she has been with her boyfriend for five years and they get along great but she is freaking out about moving in with someone .
She 's never lived with anyone before and so its understandable that she'd be a little nervous , right ?
Well according to some , she should run because the guy is probably being a tad misogynistic in his behavior towards her .
Says Lesser Shrew " Run .
Do n't do it .
In fact , take a vacation by yourself right now ....
If I am reading this right , your need for solitude is a defining feature of you .
And your boyfriend shrugs this off as a " quirk , " feels free to tell you that what you think and feel about your own thoughts and feelings is less important than his own opinion that " you 'll be fine . " " Lesser Shrew repeats this pattern of misandrystic behavior quite often , it seems .
In this question , a woman questions her compatibility with her boyfriend .
She says " I love my boyfriend but I fear we are n't compatible for the long term .
How to know if it these are things that are important enough to justify breaking up sooner rather than later . "
The questioner goes on to say that her boyfriend is " a lovely man [ who ] treats me really well , and I love him " Lesser Shrew disagrees , painting this man to be the misogynistic pig his girlfriend clearly dose n't know he is " If he owes you any money at all , even eight bucks , get out now .
Also , it 's entirely possible that he does n't " settle " so much as he does whatever comes along that does n't cause him to much trouble and get in the way of the rest of his life .
" Another woman asks " I think I 've met The One .
Or , I thought I had .
At the three - month mark , insecurities are plaguing me .
I 'm a long - time commitmentphobe .
Help ? "
Is n't that great folks ?
She 's met The One !
She 's happy but afraid of commitment but he 's The One so she needs help getting past that .
But according to Lesser Shrew , she needs to realise this man is bad news .
Seizing upon an admission that The One often comments on the attractiveness of other women , she opines " Exactly how and why does he tells you other women are hot ?
If you are in fact commenting , and saying " do you think she is hot ? "
Stop .
No good will come of that .
Men have days when they think the bat wing upper arms of elderly woman who just lost 86 pounds are hot .
Let it go .
If he is volunteering the information that other women are hot , well , then relax , enjoy this for what it is now , and do n't forget to notice other men in case you need a new boyfriend in a month or two ...
" So clearly he 's not The One .
He 'll probably be gone in a month or two but in the meantime , accept that all men will have sex with anything that breathes .
That 's just how men are .
I do n’t mean to single Lesser Shrew out , however , as she is not the only person to display such misandrystic behavior .
For instance , a woman asks Metafilter about communication problems with her " wonderful S.O "
She clearly states she does not want advice that suggests she DTMFA .
What kind of advice does she end up getting ?
Apart from a lot of advice that essentially says " Well , I 'd say DTMFA but you 've ruled that out " , she also gets this pearl of wisdom from beccyjoe " i think he is being manipulative by not saying " i love you " - he knows you 'd like to hear it .
he holds so much power over you by holding back .
what 's so hard - if he does love you - about saying it ?
if he has trouble getting the words out he could write it on a card .
past traumas my ass .
" Clearly her wonderful S.O is a manipulative misogynist !
His past experiences in love and life matter naught !
He 's controlling you !
Run !
Run now while there 's still time !
How about this question , where a woman asks for help about her boyfriend who does n’t seem to like her dog ?
Advice in that thread ranges from more examples of " His feelings do n't matter and he should get over it " , advice that he 's a jerk and being passive - aggressive and of course , that old chestnut , DTMFA
Then there was the question about the boyfriend described as " kind and loving and thoughtful in almost all ways " who , after three years of dating , had displayed some potentially misogynistic behavior .
In a conversation he had had with his girlfriend , he had explained a tradition in his family wherein the women serve the men at Thanksgiving dinners .
Granted , the tradition sounds entirely sexist in its roots but bear in mind that after three years , this conversation was the first time he had ever displayed any kind of misogynistic behavior , and that it had only arisen in reference to a tradition his family holds , one that he was explaining to his girlfriend to prepare her for what might be expected of her when she visited his family for the holidays .
I do n't need to link to examples of how that thread went .
I think you can pretty much guess for yourself .
I could go on but I wo n't .
The point I 'm trying to make here is that in light of our conversation here in MetaTalk a few months ago where we realized that misogyny and sexism are two things that should not be tolerated here on Metafilter ( and rightly so ! ) , AskMe allows a disturbing amount of misandry to go unchecked .
If women were being routinely put down in such ways on AskMe , I strongly argue that it would NOT be tolerated .
If a man asked " My wife wants me serve her food at Christmas and I feel uncomfortable about it , is she a misandrist ? " the answer would be " get over it you baby . "
If a man asked how he could get his girlfriend to like his dog , the answer would be " dispose of the dog and stop trying to control her , you pig ! " AskMe appears to routinely reinforce the notion that misandry is fine , that men are by and large misogynists and that their feelings in relationships matter little to not at all when compared to those of their women .
Does the community agree that this is the case ?
If so , should this change , or at the very least be more heavily moderated than it currently is ?
If not , why is one form of apparent sexism tolerable in comparison to another that is not ?
Well , I thought it was a good debate .
My hats off to Bob Shieffer … and my blouse too if he plays his cards right .
( Just do n’t tell my husband . )
But who the hell is Joe the Plumber ?
Seriously .
What the hell was that all about ?
Joe the Plumber ?
Joe Six Pack ?
The new McCain strategy seems to be banking on a lot of guys named Joe with a beer in one hand and a pipe wrench in the other .
Is this a political campaign or a dating service for the Palin women ?
And while I am talking about Governor Good Hair from the North I just want to say good for Sarah Palin that she has an interest in helping special needs children .
They need all of our help and every child should come into this world being wanted and loved .
Sarah you have my full support on this matter .
It ’s just too bad you also have to worry about a special needs Senator for a running mate .
John McCain thinks Americans are angry ?
Really ?
I think he needs to look beyond his rallies .
Americans are not angry .
Republicans are angry .
Bush screwed ’em over and now McCain is rubbing salt in the wound .
It looks to me like The Straight Talk Express is stuck in traffic and its driver is experiencing a little road rage .
The rest of us are hopeful and anxious , but certainly not angry .
We want change and it is so close we can almost taste it .
The next three weeks will be the longest of my 82 years .
Folks , I ’m tired and I do n’t have another fight in me .
It ’s now or never .
So to all of you I say this : Give your money .
Give your time .
Give your voice .
Get up .
Get out and do something .
Anything .
If America takes a chance on Maverick the Clown and his side kick , Clarabell , we will find ourselves so far down the crapper even Joe the Plumber ca n’t reach us .
Get out there and vote !
Thank you for stopping by .
I mean it .
Really .
5 Dirty Aspects of " Clean " Coal
October 9th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
Clean coal has been getting a lot of attention lately .
Both Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama consider it to be an important piece in their energy plans .
Even the recent $ 900 billion bailout package included $ 1.5 billion for clean coal .
Because coal is so plentiful and relatively cheap in the US , the notion of clean coal is particularly appealing .
Unfortunately , clean coal is a myth .
Here ’s why clean coal is so dirty :
1. Clean Coal Requires More Coal
30 % more energy is required to pump carbon underground for carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) .
The captured carbon dioxide has to be compressed to 100 times the atmospheric pressure , transferred to an underground storage reservoir and then pumped in the ground .
All of this requires large amounts of energy , thus the coal plant must burn an additional 30 % more coal to generate the same amount of usable electricity .
2. High Expenses Make It Unfeasible
$ 5.2 billion in taxpayer money has been spent to foster this technology in the US , yet the results are dismal .
A recent government report found that of the 13 projects examined , eight had extended delays or financial problems , six were years behind schedule , and two had gone bankrupt .
3. Commercial Carbon Capture Unlikely by 2020
A study from Australian energy consultancy ACIL Talisman states that CCS will not be available in the short - term to generate electricity with low carbon emissions and that technology breakthroughs are still needed to make this technology feasible .
The study does however find that concentrated solar , geothermal , and wind energy already are or will be in commercial use by 2020 .
4. Unproven Technology
No commercial scale examples exist .
The FutureGen plant in Illinois was to be the showcase for clean coal technology .
A total of $ 50 million was spent , $ 40 million of which was federal funded .
The price tag for the $ 1.8 billion plant had nearly doubled .
The government pulled support for the project due to concern that costs would continue to climb .
5. Coal Mining is Very Harmful
The US averages 30 coal mining deaths annually , while China averages a staggering 8,000 .
Mountaintop removal mining , a method that is common in Appalachia , destroys ecosystems and has permanently buried over 1,200 miles of streams .
Coal mining causes water pollution and lowers the quality of drinking water in neighboring communities .
Unfortunately , clean coal technology does not address the many negative impacts of coal mining and could even require large amounts of coal to be mined because of the additional energy needed to sequester carbon emissions .

President Obama Must Appoint a Consumer Protectionist as FDA Commissioner , no Big Pharma & Big Junk Food Corporate Hack !
Right now there is a huge battle going on in New Zealand regarding whether the nation should ban Aspartame , the Neurotoxic Carcinogenic Artificial Sweetener found in 7000 or so foods and medicines , including children 's vitamins , even though it is metabolized as , among things , methanol , formaldehyde , and a proven brain tumor agent called DIKETOPIPERAZINE .
Having tried twice in the New Mexico Legislature and once in the Hawaii Legislature to ban the poison by statute , and all 3 times , watching the bill get eviscerated then strangled in committee , largely the result of corporate lobbyists , my highest faith now is considering what kind of FDA Commissioner it will be who President Obama appoints .
It wo n't continue to be Andrew Von Eschenbach , the Bush appointee .
Unless it is a true consumer protectionist , and my personal favorite candidate is one of the few I completely trust , Dr. Howard Dean , aspartame will stay on the market .
I mean for God 's Sake : even Richard Nixon had the brains to give a Presidential Order to rescind FDA approval for Cyclamates , after evidence of its cancer causing neurotoxicity was presented to him by physicians and Washinton Attorney and former Nader Raider James Turner , co-author with Nader of The Chemical Feast , one of the first books on this I ever read , back in the early 70's .
The early 80's saw Donald Rumsfeld as CEO of G.D. Searle force the FDA to approve aspartame with his crony Arthur Hull Hayes as Commissioner .
The entire grim nasty truth and sordid history is in an article RUMSFELD'S BIOWEAPON LEGACY , and elsewhere in purely legislative language in Hawaii Senate Concurrent Resolution 191 from 2008 which I wrote with Dr. Betty Martini .
To read it , click here .
My reason for writing this has more to do with illuminating you as to what is going on in New Zealand .
It started when an actress , Abby Cormack , realized that what was causing several chronic and undiagnosable or misdiagnosed neurologicail ailments was her consumption of sugarless gum and diet sodas .
Ten months ago in OpEdNews , I published this article , Aspartame Research Needed , Not Coca - Cola Soft Sell
This was basically a press release put out by consumer activists in New Zealand .
Betty Martini , Honorary Doctorate of Humanities , a few days later published this at OpEdNews , Aspartame and New Zealand .
This has heated up and about ten days ago , a Coca Cola Toxicologist and Abby had a debate on New Zealand National Television in an almost 9 minute broadcast , longer of course than would be possible in the American media in the post - Rumsfeld era , and of greater interest to New Zealanders that it would be to most Americans , who get that battered guinea pig look of boredom , if you speak of such things as neurotoxic food additives in almost all Junk Food .
Is it genocide ?
Well , perhaps , but that is another discussion beyond the scope of this article .
Here is the news coverage from Channel 3 New Zealand introducing the video of the " debate " between Abby Cormack and the Coke lobbyist ( or what ever else you want to put after Coke ) , reporting , which by American Standards , might seem a bit objective :
" Aspartame is the artificial sweetener commonly found in products such as diet soft drink , lite yoghurt and sugar free gum to name just a few .
But recent reports linking it to a range of diseases including cancer and brain lesions have seen sales of aspartame - containing products plummet as New Zealanders returned to consuming their high - sugar alternatives .
Is there any foundation to the claims ?
Dr Bernadene Magnuson is a toxicologist who is in New Zealand , sponsored to present a series of seminars by Cocacola .
Both she and Abby Cormack , who believes she is a victim of aspartame poisoning , spoke to Sunrise .
This is the video of the newscast / debate .
This is my own personal response : First , the Coke Toxicologist 's " study " was totally funded by industry .
" I commend Channel 3 for covering this more than would be possible in the SA , where people seem bored with neurutoxicity discussions and where Coca Cola and Big Junk food control the media , preventing such " radical " talk in toto .
The rent - a - toxicologist championing industry - paid - for " studies " is works for Coca Cola !
She could never explain why Coca Cola and Ajinomoto of Japan ( world 's largest manufacturer of Aspartame as well as another neurotoxic additive , MSG ) workers unloading Aspartame tankers must wear Hazardous Materials Suits .
Aspartame was forced on the market by now - disgraced Donald Rumsfeld and his crony Arthur Hull Hayes in 1981 ; google RUMSFELD'S BIOWEAPON LEGACY , plus medical texts by HJ Roberts and Russell Blaylock .

Against the Employment Paradigm in Videogames
Videogames are often discussed under the concept of “ play ” , but this is not always how gamers themselves talk about their experience : they use instead vocabularies of desperate competition or violence .
Take the very common expression of satisfaction after completing a game : “ I beat the game . ”
What exactly does it mean to beat a game ?
You ca n’t have a meaningful contest against an inert digital artefact .
From the game ’s point of view , you did not beat it .
On the contrary , you did exactly what the game wanted you to do , every step of the way .
You did n’t play the game , you performed the operations it demanded of you , like an obedient employee .
The game was a task of labour .
From this perspective , playing a videogame looks as much like work as play .
( ( This is the paper I gave at the very awesome F.R.O.G. conference , Vienna 2008 .
It was subsequently published as a chapter in the book of conference proceedings , Edges of Gaming ( Vienna , 2010 ) .
I also considered the alternative titles “ I Got All the Fucking Work I Need “ , and “ Fuck You , I Wo n’t Do What You Tell Me “ , but I was n’t sure about the etiquette of swearing in the titles of papers for academic conferences . ) )
Of course work is a large component of many types of game .
The professional chess player competing in a tournament game does not have the carefree , leisurely attitude sometimes implied by the term “ playing ” : she is performing massive amounts of cognitive work .
Similarly with poker players or tennis players : they are not merely fooling around but labouring mightily .
Because it has rules , a game is never just a game but also a system of coercion , freely entered into .
This in itself is not surprising : as Johann Huizinga reminded us , the idea of play can comprehend , and is not threatened by , a fanatical seriousness .
( ( Huizinga , Johann , Homo Ludens : A Study of the Play - Element in Culture ( 1944 ; London , 1980 ) . ) )
And the workload of videogames in particular is recognised in their description by some scholars as a species of “ ergodic literature ” .
But videogames seem more and more to resemble work in a different sense : working for the Man .
They hire us for imaginary , meaningless jobs that replicate the structures of real - world employment .
And this represents a surprisingly literal fulfilment of the criticism Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer advanced of industrial entertainment more than 60 years ago :
Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work .
It is sought after as an escape from the mechanized work process , and to recruit strength in order to be able to cope with it again .
But at the same time mechanization has such power over a man ’s leisure and happiness , and so profoundly determines the manufacture of amusement goods , that his experiences are inevitably after - images of the work process itself .
The ostensible content is merely a faded foreground ; what sinks in is the automatic succession of standardized operations .
What happens at work , in the factory , or in the office can only be escaped from by approximation to it in one ’s leisure time .
All amusement suffers from this incurable malady .
Pleasure hardens into boredom because , if it is to remain pleasure , it must not demand any effort and therefore moves rigorously in the worn grooves of association .
No independent thinking must be expected from the audience : the product prescribes every reaction : not by its natural structure ( which collapses under reflection ) , but by signals .
(( Adorno , Theodor W , & Horkheimer , Max , Dialectic of Enlightenment ( 1947 ; London , 1997 ) , p137 . ) )
If games are supposed to be fun , Adorno and Horkheimer might have asked , why do they go so far to replicate the structure of a repetitive dead - end job ?
Increasingly , videogames seem to aspire to a mimesis of the mechanized work process .
I mean by this something different than the external recruitment process observed in the phenomena of beta releases and the mod scene , where players become unpaid testers and then contributors to the profitable extension of the corporate product .
( ( See Sotamaa , Olli , “ Have Fun Working with Our Product ! ” : Critical Perspectives on Computer Game Mod Competitions ” , DiGRA conf. 2005 . ) )
Rather , I want to point to the way that the classic single - player game already represents an “ after - image of the work process itself ” .
Shop till you drop
Today , the most common paradigm for progress in games , for example , is the idea of “ earning ” .
Follow the rules , achieve results , and you are rewarded with bits of symbolic currency — credits , stars , skill points , powerful glowing orbs — which you can then exchange later in the game for new gadgets , ways of moving , or access to previously denied areas .
The only major difference between this paradigm and that of a real - world job is that , whereas the money earned from a job enables you to buy beer and go on holiday — that is , to do things that are extraneous to the mechanized work process — the closed videogame system rewards you with things that only makes it supposedly more fun or involving to continue doing your job , rather than letting you get outside it .
It is , you might say , a malignly perfect style of capitalist brainwashing .
Even Hideo Kojima ’s masterpiece , Metal Gear Solid 4 , whose narrative is a satire of modern military Keynesianism and the global “ war economy ” , has you buy new guns from an arms dealer by earning “ Drebin points ” .
In a great many games , the overarching economic system boils down to a matter of shopping .
New skills — whether they be new physical moves , spells , or the ability to transform into a demon — are acquired instantaneously and thoroughly through currency exchange .
In this way , adding insult to injury , the player is cast as a wage - slave in her leisure activity as well as in her daily life .
( In the mean time the existence of real economies in online multiplayer worlds such as World of Warcraft or Second Life is widely welcomed as progress , as a sign that these games are really serious to the extent that they can replicate and extend real - world commercial systems , and offer the player “ the pleasures of wealth and desirable commodities ” .
( ( Molesworth , Mike , & Denegri -Knott , Janice , “ The Pleasures and Practices of Virtualised Consumption in Digital Spaces ” , DiGRA conf. 2005 . ) ) )
You are not the boss of me
Who , then , is paying the player ’s salary ?
The characters we call “ bosses ” in videogames are the large monsters we have to defeat at the end of a level , but everywhere there are more insidious types of bosses , who better resemble micromanaging employers .
The videogame designer often exerts his authority through a non-playable character , an ostensibly loveable sidekick who will bombard the player with increasingly heavy hints about what has to be done next .
It ’s not a suggestion ; it is an order .
We have all had the experience of arriving in an new area in a role - playing game , only to be greeted by a character who refuses to help us in our quest until we have collected the five pieces of her arbitrary amulet .
Everywhere you go , you are told what to do .
Of course a comprehensible goal - oriented structure is a useful thing , to stop a videogame becoming a sprawling mess of undermotivated wandering and backtracking .
But while the just - following - orders structure works acceptably in military - themed games such as Splinter Cell , which after all do pretend to be more or less “ realistic ” representations of the job of a counter - terrorist or special forces agent , where a commander delivers objectives and the soldier finds ways to implement them , the idea seems more rebarbative the further one strays from quasi-simulation into pure fantasy .
Apart from comic early representations of menial jobs such as in 1980s arcade games Tapper or Burger Time , some kind of military position was for a long time virtually the only real - life job represented in videogames ( apart from the venerable genre of football management or the odd train - driving simulator ) .
Yet what we are seeing now is an increasing labourisation of the game atmosphere : from the wry alternative employment market of GTA , to almost all modern racing games , games become structured around a fictional career .
Remarkably , the WipEout games , for example , even count points for your “ loyalty ” to a particular team , be it Auricom or Feisar .
The idea of inculcating loyalty to an entirely fictional organization is fascinating .
In the modern “ flexible ” labour market , where people may be fired on a whim and companies rename themselves or merge from one day to the next , it might be thought useful to train the population in an idea of “ loyalty ” that is instant , portable — and , of course , unrequited .
Perhaps the predictable and reliable nature of the virtual jobs at which we work in videogames is a consolation for the increasingly unreliable nature of employment in real life .
Be loyal , keep your head down , earn currency .
Nothing could be a more perfect advert for what is sometimes called the “ American way ” than The Sims .
Buy a Sim a large mirror and she will be happier , by virtue of being able to gaze at her reflection .
Buy him a new oven , and he ’ll become more popular after giving dinner parties .
Help your
Sim climb the slippery pole of a career as a politician or scientist .
This is a game in which the brutal rules of free - market capitalism are everything .
More money makes a Sim happier ; social dissidents are not allowed .
Do you want to drop out of the rat-race , wear charity - shop tweed suits and spend your days playing chess in the park ?
Sorry .
Such gameplay possibilities are ruled out by the political assumptions buried deep in the game ’s structure .
This fact ought to remind us that , even in what are commonly called God games , being God is still a job .
You are not allowed to be the kind of God who makes up his own laws : there is no digital equivalent of virgin stone tablets on which to inscribe your own commandments .
In a God game , God is still subordinate to the true boss , the game ’s designed system of rules .
In Shenmue , there was a famous episode where you actually had to go and get a job driving fork - lift trucks within the gameworld .
Perhaps that was an ironic acknowledgment already of the job - like nature of too many games .
Possibly it is inevitable that , as products of decadent late capitalism , most videogames will , consciously or not , reflect the same values .
You go through a period of training , and then it ’s all about success and shopping , keeping your head down , doing what the system expects .
Make - believe jobs , as Adorno and Horkheimer might have concluded , are the opiate of the people .
Or , as Morrissey put it : “ I was looking for a job and then I found a job / And heaven knows I ’m miserable now . ”
(( The Smiths , “ Heaven Knows I ’m Miserable Now ” ( Rough Trade , 1984 ) . ) )
The critical site in contemporary games of this paradox — and its obverse — is Grand Theft Auto 4 .
The game ’s structure leads you through a great many “ jobs ” or missions , while at the same time even the process of maintaining friendships becomes Taylorized , broken down into discrete , manageable , repetitive pieces .
You have regularly to perform the chore of taking a friend to a bar or lapdancing club in order to assure his “ loyalty ” .
The game even requires you to manage your life through a virtual cellphone , which , given the constraints of console cybernetics , is much less pleasant to operate than a real cellphone .
We thus arrive at the absurd position where it is supposed to be fun to use a complex piece of technology to emulate badly the experience of using a less complex piece of technology .
It is rather like performing keyhole surgery on an immaterial hunk of communications plastic .
And yet GTA4 , like its predecessors , also allows the player to ignore its employment structure and just wander around the city .
Indeed , there seems to be a significant minority of players who , after trying to follow a few missions , give up on the game ’s demands and are content merely to do their own thing , considering the game worthwhile for the opportunity it affords as a sandbox : an arena where the player can really play rather than work .
This aspect of the game is seriously limited — most buildings cannot be entered , and your interactions with others are limited as usual to acts of violence or commercial sex — but it answers to a desire on the part of players to , as an employer might generously say , write their own responsibilities .
One player ’s criticism of the “ official game ” within the game represents just such a call for more opportunities for real play :
Missions should allow for more freedom and room for creativity [… ]
Make the failure requirements less arbitrary and allow me to experiment . [ … ]
The engine is built , have faith in it to produce fun moments without the need for scripted set pieces .
Industrial action
Alternatively , if games try to imprison us in jobs , there is always the option of industrial action .
No doubt we have all at one time or another found ourselves doing something like the following .
Recently , I was playing Race Driver : Grid , and missed a corner , spinning into the sand .
Fed up with my imaginary team ’s exhortations through the headset , I decided to spend the rest of the race seeing how long it would take to smash my car up beyond repair , noting with satisfaction the alarm of the spectators as I steered grimly at full speed into crash barriers , and parking myself in the middle of the track so that as many as possible of the rest of the pack crashed into me on their next lap .
Part of the pleasure of such a bloody - minded interlude , of course , is breaking the game — seeing where its limits of verisimilitude are drawn .
Since my team manager never commented on my outrageously dangerous behaviour , I decided they were n’t worth my loyalty after all .
Many of us have probably also deliberately shot a non-playable character we were supposed to be protecting ( for example , in Goldeneye or MGS4 ) , simply because they were so annoying and incapable of taking the least precaution for themselves .
Of course , such defiant assertions of player freedom ( or “ transgressive play ” ( ( Aarseth , Espen , “ I Fought the Law : Transgressive Play and the Implied Player ” , DiGRA conf. 2007 . ) ) ) are only fleetingly satisfying , because you usually end up in a lifeless digital cul de sac , obliged to reload and try again .
But arguably , moments such as these , when the gamer plays against the grain and refuses to do what the game defines as his job , better fit the definition of “ play ” than what the videogame actually expects of us .
Here ’s a famous distinction by Mark Twain :
Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do , and [ … ]
Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do .
( ( Twain , Mark , The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ( 1876 ) , p23 . ) )
On this definition , obediently following a game ’s narrative or challenge - reward structure is nothing but work .
Only when the player does something that is n’t mandated by the system can she be said to be playing .
Nintendo , in its Mario and Zelda series , has often made sure that its games contain “ minigames ” or activities that are not obligatory — for instance , fishing or catching chickens .
But these do not exactly count as non-work either : they merely replace the game ’s overarching instruction set with a temporary new one .
For the time that you are playing the fishing subgame , fishing is now your job , with a parallel set of ironclad rules and rewards .
A cunning subterfuge to keep the masses happy : you think you are on holiday from the game , but you are still caught within the system .
Smell the coffee
A more complex recent model in this regard is Nintendo ’s game Animal Crossing : Wild World .
On the one hand , this replicates the capitalist ideology of games such as The Sims .
In Animal Crossing , the main purpose of the game is simply to earn money in order to buy nicer furniture for your house .
Life revolves around the village shop , where you sell the fruit or fish you have collected , and can then buy a new armchair or rug .
Gathering goods and trading them is the job .
On the other hand , there is a café in your village where you can go and sit on a stool at the bar and order a cup of coffee , prepared by a laconic pigeon .
Drinking the coffee serves no purpose in the game — indeed , it even costs some of your hard - earned currency .
And yet it is an example of pure play , at least on Mark Twain ’s definition .
You are not obliged to drink the coffee .
Drinking the coffee changes nothing .
And of course the coffee does n’t even exist .
You ca n’t smell or taste it .
But you can drink the coffee whenever you like ( subject to the café ’s opening hours ) .
And there is something mysteriously pleasurable about it .
It is a gratuitous , interstitial moment , offering the player a chance to admire the scenery , perhaps listen to some Japanese electro - jazz , and meditate on nothing in particular along with her avatar , sipping an imaginary beverage .
If this is a kind of freedom , it must be acknowledged that it is a a limited one : it is a preprogrammed token of freedom , rather than the thing itself .
But it represents a mode of videogaming that is removed from the usual paradigm of insatiable demand and control .
Can a fruitful alternative design philosophy grow from such seeds ?
Consider another observation about modern life , from the founder of Slow Food , the worldwide movement against accelerated industrial agricultural practices and the hurried eating of junk :
The culture of our times rests on a false interpretation of industrial civilisation ; in the name of dynamism and acceleration , man invents machines to find relief from work but at the same time adopts the machine as a model of how to live his life .
( ( Portinari , Folco , “ Il Manifesto ” ( 1987 ) , cited in Andrews , Geoff , The Slow Food Story : Politics & Pleasure ( London , 2008 ) , p30 . ) )
What would videogaming look like if it rejected the machine as a model for play , if more games incorporated gratuitous moments of relaxation from their constant , accelerated striving ?
Or if more games did not treat us as employees but as autonomous co-creators ?
Scattered germs of this possibility are visible not only in Animal Crossing , but also in the surreal 1980s games of Automata such as Deus Ex Machina , and maybe too in Sony ’s LittleBigPlanet .
( In the latter , however , it can be argued that your job is now that of game designer , though one limited to working with the tools that the true boss has decreed available . )
The recent Echochrome draws a perfect allegory of the player ’s usual relationship to a videogame .
The wireframe wooden puppet character represents the player , led by the nose through a series of arbitrary contortions according to the artist - designer ’s purposes , in a weightless dance that soon fades into nothingness .
“ Congratulations ” , the videogame says at the end , “ you adopted all the poses that were required of you .

WASHINGTON  A new analysis of the best time to begin HIV treatment found that starting early sharply improves survival , doctors said Sunday .
Doctors say the new evidence is certain to prompt many doctors to change the way they treat patients , and to prompt health officials to begin examining the evidence underlying guidelines for treating the AIDS virus .
The study of 8,374 patients in the USA and Canada showed that those treated later in the course of HIV infection are 70 % more likely to die than patients treated sooner , says lead researcher Mari Kitahata of the University of Washington - Seattle .
What makes the finding so striking , Kitahata says , is the " magnitude " of the survival difference between the two study groups .
" Seventy percent is a significant and substantial increase in the risk of death , " she says .
The finding surfaced from the biggest comparison of the two treatment strategies ever carried out .
The data were drawn from 22 studies from 1996 to 2006 in an attempt to answer a decade - old question about when to begin HIV treatment .
" The guidelines committees are certainly going to look hard at these data next time they meet , " says Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which sponsored the research .
Current guidelines say that patients should begin treatment only when their levels of a type of white blood cell called CD4 T - cells fall below 350 per cubic millimeter .
HIV targets these cells , which in healthy people throttle up the immune response .
But the guidelines have never adequately been tested , Kitahata says .
The new research found that patients fare better when they begin treatment when their CD4 counts are much higher , between 350 and 500 cells per cubic millimeter .
" There 's reason to believe you would have even better survival using drugs available now , " she says .
Early treatment , however , depends on awareness .
Studies show that fewer than four in 10 U.S. adults have been tested for HIV .

A police commander was ambushed by gunmen as he left home early Monday , becoming the 12th officer slain in the central state of Mexico in five days .
The spate of killings has claimed state and municipal officers in half a dozen cities and towns since Thursday .
State authorities said the attacks appeared to be the work of criminal gangs that have sought a foothold for drug trafficking and other illegal activities in Mexico state , which borders Mexico City on three sides .
Early Monday , Nestor Peña Sanchez , a state police commander , was shot dead as he left his home in Toluca , the state capital , law enforcement officials said .
Police are frequent targets in Mexico ’s rising drug violence that has claimed about 4,000 lives this year .
More than 500 police officers and soldiers have been slain since President Felipe Calderon declared an offensive against drug traffickers two years ago .
Corrupt police officers often work on behalf of gangs , making it difficult to tell in many cases whether they died while enforcing the law or violating it .
In Mexico state , the burst of violence against police began Thursday with shootings of six state officers at separate road checkpoints set up to hunt for drugs and guns .
Five more officers -- two state police and three municipal officers -- were shot to death Saturday .
Over the weekend , police announced the arrests of 10 suspects in the shootings .
The state ’s attorney general , Alberto Bazbaz , said many of the suspects were from the neighboring state of Michoacan , which serves as base for a drug trafficking gang known as La Familia .
Mexico state officials said the ambush - style attacks and use of large - bore , semiautomatic weapons signaled the likely involvement of organized - crime groups .
It was unclear whether the police slayings were related .
In other violence against police , authorities in the northern border state of Sonora reported the assassination of the state ’s second - ranking police official .
Sonora officials said Juan Manuel Pavon Felix died Sunday night in an attack on the hotel where he was staying in the border city of Nogales .
Assailants fired guns and tossed two fragmentation grenades as he entered the hotel ; two officers were wounded .
Pavon had taken part in a police operation in Nogales , a drug smuggling hub , officials said .
In the central state of Guanajuato , four police officers were slain Monday in a pair of shootings that left two others injured , according to Mexican news reports .
In early October , hooded killers fatally shot the mayor of Ixtapan de la Sal after he reportedly rebuffed drug traffickers .
Authorities said he refused to allow dealing in his town , which is best known as a spa getaway .
In September , authorities found the bodies of 24 men piled in a wooded park just outside Mexico City .
Police arrested two men , including a municipal police commander , as suspects .

So you want a dynamic form
So I havent really been doing much writing lately .
That ’s mostly a consequence of the fact that :
Django 1.0 was released , and meeting the schedule for that took up an enormous amount of time .
After that , there was DjangoCon .
Oh , and there are all sorts of things in my life , including a book , a gigantic codebase and dozens of sites , which all need to be updated .
Our entire team here in Lawrence has been running short on sleep for a good long while now .
Anyway , I ’m going to force myself to break out of that every once in a while and write something useful and fun , because if I do n’t I ’ll probably go insane .
Fortunately , there ’s a whole community full of people talking about Django these days , so I ’m not short on topics .
Most recently , I ’ve been quietly watching some discussion in the Django ticket tracker and on IRC about how to build “ dynamic forms ” in Django , where a “ dynamic ” form is one whose behavior or fields change depending on , say , the current user or some other bit of current information .
This is n’t something that ’s really documented , but personally I think that ’s because it falls into a sort of gray area ; like many useful things you can do with Django , it ’s not actually Django - specific .
It just requires a little bit of knowledge of Python and of some standard programming practices .
In a nutshell , there are two ways you ’ll want to go about this :
Write a form class which knows how to adapt itself , say by doing some shuffling around in __init__ ( ) ( and possibly taking some custom arguments to tell it what sort of shuffling to do ) .
Write a factory function which knows how to build and return the type of form you want .
So let ’s dive in .
Constructing in your constructor
The easiest and most common way to do a little bit of dynamic customization in any Python class is by overriding its __init__ ( ) method and adding your own special - case logic there .
For sake of an example , let ’s consider a contact form : you want a form that lets people get in touch and send you messages .
But since there are a lot of evil spammers out there , you also want to avoid automated submissions .
Suppose you put together a CAPTCHA system and implement it as a Django form field , maybe called CaptchaField ; then you ’d just add it to the definition of your form , like any other field .
But let ’s add a twist to this : let ’s say that we only want to have this field when the form is being filled out by an anonymous visitor , and not when it ’s coming from an authenticated user of the site .
How could we do that ?
One way would be to write two form classes — one with the CaptchaField and one without — and have the view select one after checking request.user.is_authenticated ( ) .
But that ’s messy and leaves duplicated code lying around ( even if you have one form subclass the other ) , and Django ’s all about helping you avoid that sort of thing .
So how about a form which automatically sprouts a CaptchaField as needed ?
We can do that pretty easily with a custom __init__ ( ) method and a single extra argument : we ’ll have the view pass in the value of request.user , and work out what to do based on that .
Here ’s how it might look :
class ContactForm ( forms .
Form ) : def __init__ ( self , user , * args , ** kwargs ) : super ( ContactForm , self ) .
__init__ ( * args , ** kwargs ) if not user .
is_authenticated ( ) : self .
fields [ ' captcha ' ] = CaptchaField ()
That ’s not so hard .
All it requires is a little bit of knowledge of Python ( namely , overriding __init__ ( ) to change the way instances of the class are set up , and using super ( ) to get the parent class ’ behavior as a starting point ) , and a tiny bit of knowledge about how a Django form works : it has a dictionary attached to it , named fields , whose values are the names of the form fields and whose values are the fields themselves .
Once we have that , it ’s easy to just stick things in self .
fields as needed .
Similarly , you can use this to modify the behavior of a field in the form ; if you wanted to change the max_length of a CharField , for example , you could simply pull it out of self .
fields and make the changes you wanted .
You could also overwrite things there with completely new fields according to what your form will need .
And you can even compare the fields as they currently exist with the fields as they were originally defined on the form class : the base set of fields defined for the class lives in a dictionary called base_fields and is n’t overwritten when you change fields , so comparing the contents of self .
fields to the contents of self .
base_fields lets you see quickly what ’s changed ( and unless you really know what you ’re doing , do n’t mess around in base_fields ; you ’ll thank me for that advice later ) .
These sorts of techniques can take you a long way ; I ’ve written some fairly interesting and complex forms using nothing but __init__ ( ) tricks ( features at work like this one are constructed using some extremely - dynamic form systems , for example ) , and generally it ’s pretty easy and pretty useful .
Form , function and factory
Of course , there are limits to what ’s practical to do in an overridden __init__ ( ) ; sooner or later the amount of code required ( and the gymnastics you ’ll hve to do for things like custom validation methods ) simply gets to be too much and you find yourself needing something a little more powerful .
Typically , the solution for those cases is a factory function ( or factory method , if you prefer ) which knows how to build form classes .
One good example is in django - profiles , which needs to generate forms based on the user - profile model you ’re using , and also needs to ensure that certain fields never show up in them ( since , for example , we do n’t want you being able to change the User instance associated with your own profile ) .
This is solved by two functions in django - profiles : one knows how to retrieve the currently - active user - profile model , and the other knows how to build a form for it , minus the User field .
The second function is the one we ’re interested in , and the code for it is short and sweet :
def get_profile_form ( ) : " " " Return a form class ( a subclass of the default ``ModelForm`` ) suitable for creating / editing instances of the site - specific user profile model , as defined by the ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting .
If that setting is missing , raise ``django.contrib.auth.models.SiteProfileNotAvailable`` . " " " profile_mod = get_profile_model ( ) class _ ProfileForm ( forms .
ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = profile_mod exclude = ( ' user ' , ) #
User will be filled in by the view .
return _ ProfileForm
You ’ll notice that the docstring for this function is almost as long as the actual function itself ; all it does is fetch the user - profile model ( that ’s what get_profile_model ( ) does ) , then define a ModelForm subclass based on that model and exclude the user field ( because of the way user profiles work in Django , the field must be named user ; if that requirement did n’t exist , introspection of the profile model could just as easily determine which field to exclude ) .
Then it returns that newly - defined class .
Then , whenever a form for editing user profiles is needed , the view which will display the form can simply do something like this ( the get_profile_form ( ) method lives in a module in django - profiles named utils ) :
form_class = utils . get_profile_form ( ) if request .
method == ' POST ' : form = form_class ( data = request .
POST , files = request .
FILES ) if form .
is_valid ( ) : # Standard form - handling behavior goes here ...
This works because Python supports a few features ( most notably closures , a topic far too big to tackle here ) which make it easy to define and work with new classes while your code is running .
And in general , this is an extremely powerful feature to have : it means that instead of writing huge , complex classes which try to anticipate everything you might need to do , you can usually just write one or two simple functions which build and return brand - new tailor - made classes that do exactly what you want .
The example above was fairly easy because it just defined a ModelForm subclass , and those are typically short and easy to write , but it works just as well with more complex forms ; you can define a full form , with fields , custom validation and whatever else you like , inside a function and then return it to be used immediately .
There ’s also a useful shortcut you can use if you know you ’re just going to slap together a collection of fields and do n’t want to bother with writing them all out : Python ’s built - in type ( ) function , which puts together a class on the fly .
The type ( ) function takes three arguments :
The name you want to give to your class .
A tuple of one or more classes it will inherit from , in order .
A dictionary whose keys and values will end up as the basic attributes of the class .
Let ’s return to our original example : a contact form which sprouts a CAPTCHA field if the user is n’t authenticated .
We could write a function which takes a User as an argument , and then returns either of two possible form classes , like so :
def make_contact_form ( user ) : #
The basic form class _ ContactForm ( forms .
Form ) : name = forms .
CharField ( max_length = 50 ) email = forms .
EmailField ( ) message = forms .
CharField ( widget = forms .
Textarea ) if user .
is_authenticated ( ) : return _ContactForm class _CaptchaContactForm ( _ ContactForm ) : captcha = CaptchaField ( ) return _CaptchaContactForm
This defines the form class on the fly , and if the user is n’t authenticated immediately defines a subclass which includes the CAPTCHA .
But this is pretty ugly ; let ’s see how it works using type ( ) :
def make_contact_form ( user ) : fields = { ' name ' : forms .
CharField ( max_length = 50 ) , ' email ' : forms .
EmailField ( ) , ' message ' : forms .
CharField ( widget = forms .
Textarea ) } if not user .
is_authenticated ( ) : fields [ ' captcha ' ] = CaptchaField ( ) return type ( ' ContactForm ' , ( forms .
BaseForm , ) , { ' base_fields ' : fields })
That ’s much nicer ; type just wants to know the name of our new class ( ContactForm ) , what classes , if any , it should inherit from ( when doing this , use django.
forms .
BaseForm instead of django.forms .
Form ; the reasons are a bit obscure and technical , but any time you ’re not declaring the fields directly on the class in the normal fashion you should use BaseForm ) and a dictionary of attributes .
Recall from our earlier look at fiddling with a form ’s fields that base_fields is the attribute which holds the baseline set of fields for the form class , so our attribute dictionary simply supplies base_fields with a collection of form fields , and adds the CAPTCHA only when needed .
This is a bit more advanced in terms of Python programming , but is an extremelyuseful technique ; Django uses it all over the place to build classes on the fly , and you can too .
Where to go from here
There is one further way to dynamically control the way a class is set up in Python , and it gives you absolute control over every step of the process ; writing a “ metaclass ” .
But , in the words of Python guru Tim Peters : “ Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99 % of users should ever worry about .
If you wonder whether you need them , you do n’t . ”
If you ever do get to the point where you ’re convinced you do need them , there are plenty of tutorials on Python metaclasses floating around the Web .
Django uses them in a few places ( in fact , in more places than it strictly needs to ) , but that does n’t mean you have to ; doing work in __init__ ( ) or writing a factory function which knows how to build the class you want will easily cover 99 % or more of all the cases you ’re like to run into in the real world .
And though here we ’ve been talking about Django forms specifically , I ’d like to point out once again that this is n’t really Django - specific ; these approaches work well with lots of different types of probems in Python and even in programming in other languages ( although not every language makes it as easy to , for example , define new classes on the fly ) .
Reading up on Python and getting to know some standard idioms and programming patterns will drastically improve your ability to reason out solutions like the ones I ’ve given above , so if you ’re interested in further reading , curl up with either the Python documentation or some material on programming practice ; they ’ll do you good .
In this experimental feature - length film that played at Cannes in 2012 , director György Pálfi constructed a love story using clips from 450 films that span nearly the entire history of cinema .
I was afraid this would be gimmicky , but it ’s so well constructed and so smoothly adheres to the tropes of romantic movies that I got totally sucked in .
It reminded me a lot of Christian Marclay ’s The Clock , a 24 - hour film made from hundreds ( thousands ? ) of other movies and TV shows where the on - screen action is synced to the viewer ’s time of day .

For Kurzgesagt ’s latest video , they explore the challenges the world faces in attempting to get the rate of climate change under control before it ’s too late and how to get there .
Climate change is just too much .
There is never any good news .
Only graphs that get more and more red and angry .
Almost every year breaks some horrible record , from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt .
It ’s endless and relentless .
We have known for decades that rapid climate change is being caused by the release of greenhouse gases .
But instead of reducing them , in 2019 the world was emitting 50 % more CO2 than in the year 2000 .
And emissions are still rising .
Why is that ?
Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases ?
According to the video , global population growth and economic growth will be working against us over the next few decades and that increasing our energy efficiency and lowering emissions from energy sources are the main ways in which we will be able to slow things down .
It ’s worth noting that on the wizard vs. prophet continuum , this video is firmly in the wizard camp .
That ’s not wrong or bad ; it ’s just that other people have different ideas about how to combat climate change .
Oliver Sacks : His Own Life is a new documentary film by Ric Burns about famed author and neurologist Oliver Sacks .
A month after receiving a fatal diagnosis in January 2015 , Oliver Sacks sat down for a series of filmed interviews in his apartment in New York City .
For eighty hours , surrounded by family , friends , and notebooks from six decades of thinking and writing about the brain , he talked about his life and work , his abiding sense of wonder at the natural world , and the place of human beings within it .
Drawing on these deeply personal reflections , as well as nearly two dozen interviews with close friends , family members , colleagues and patients , and archival material from every point in his life , this film is the story of a beloved doctor and writer who redefined our understanding of the brain and mind .
The film is playing in virtual cinemas around the country right now : you can check out the list at the end of this page for more information and showtimes .
Reagan Ray ( previously ) surveyed 100s of iconic covers of jazz albums ( Blue Note , anyone ? ) and isolated the lettering of the artists ’ names .

I do n’t know whether it ’s our dry weather , my increased appreciation for Vermont due to our relative sanity during the pandemic , or just because I ’ve been trying to spend as much time as I can outside appreciating nature before the snow flies , but this year ’s foliage display seems extra good .
Mother Nature just spilled her box of crayons everywhere .
I do n’t want to give away too much about this movie but I ’d recommend watching the trailer and then the movie ( you can find it on Netflix ) .
I watched it last night at Kevin Kelly ’s urging :
This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen .
Nothing about its subject would suggest greatness , but it was perfectly crafted .
It ’s such a simple movie but it packs a surprising emotional wallop and is philosophically rich .
Even ( or perhaps especially ) the bits that seem problematic are thought - provoking .
Highly recommended .

Hannah Beech reports on how the United States1 is perceived by the outside world these days due to our poor response to the Covid - 19 pandemic and the continuing failure of our political system .
Myanmar is a poor country struggling with open ethnic warfare and a coronavirus outbreak that could overload its broken hospitals .
That has n’t stopped its politicians from commiserating with a country they think has lost its way .
“ I feel sorry for Americans , ” said U Myint Oo , a member of parliament in Myanmar .
“ But we ca n’t help the U.S. because we are a very small country . ”
The same sentiment prevails in Canada , one of the most developed countries .

“ Personally , it ’s like watching the decline of the Roman Empire , ” said Mike Bradley , the mayor of Sarnia , an industrial city on the border with Michigan , where locals used to venture for lunch .
And I had to chuckle at this part : “ The U.S.A. is a first - world country but it is acting like a third - world country , ” said U Aung Thu Nyein , a political analyst in Myanmar .

I got a bunch of pushback on that statement but after the past eight months , the pandemic has laid America ’s deficiencies bare for the whole world to see clearly .
As winter approaches in North America and Europe , cities should be thinking about how to encourage and enable people to spend as much time outdoors as possible to help keep everyone sane and safe from Covid - 19 .
From a great piece in CityLab by Alexandra Lange : Dress in layers , invest in silk and wool long underwear , get over your prejudice against parkas .
Many people do this as a matter of course when gearing up for a day of skiing or a turn around the ice rink .
But in cities , people dress for the destination , not the journey .
“ People dress saying , I ’m going from my home to this business .
What ’s the least amount of clothing I can wear for the tolerance of walking x feet ? ” says Simon O’Byrne , senior vice president of community development for global design consultancy Stantec .
“ We have to switch that , and dress to loiter . ” O’Byrne , who is also co-chair of the WinterCity Advisory Council , adds , “ Stickiness encourages people outside .
Moscow does year - round farmers markets .
The artists ’ community has been pulverized by Covid .
As much as we can , we should embrace things to help the local artists , community . ”
He suggests commissioning visual artists to illuminate dark spaces , via murals or light installations , and hiring musicians for distanced outdoor concerts .
Cities should also invest in places to loiter .
All of those outdoor restaurants that are supporting local businesses and bringing liveliness back to the streets ?
In New York City , at least , they are scheduled to shut down at the end of October , while the mayor and governor bicker over indoor dining .
But cities need to catch up to ski areas , which long ago figured out how to make après ski activities like outdoor bars and music venues as much of an attraction as the slopes .
Wind breaks ( with openings above and below for ventilation ) , patio heaters and sun orientation can all take outdoor dining further into 2020 .
WinterCity ’s Four Season Patio Design
Tips also include higher insulation value materials , like wood or straw bales rather than metal seating , as well as simple solutions like blankets , which offer customers the winter equivalent of being able to reposition your chair in the sun — though that works year - round .
And indeed , NYC just announced that the increased outdoor dining that the city has allowed during the pandemic will become “ permanent and year - round ” .
Tens of thousands of parking spaces will be permanently repurposed from free private vehicle storage for use by the city ’s struggling restaurant owners as part of a revolution in public space unleashed on Friday by Mayor de Blasio .
On WNYC ’s “ Ask the Mayor ” segment , Hizzoner revealed that restaurants would be allowed to occupy curbside spaces - which more than 10,000 are already doing — for outdoor dining , not just through the coronavirus pandemic , but all year and , apparently , forever .
It may turn out to be the single biggest conversion of public space since , well , since car drivers commandeered the curbside lane for free overnight vehicle storage in the 1950s .
But whatever measures are taken , they need to be inclusive for the diverse populations that live in cities .
Here ’s Lange again , who spends several paragraphs in her piece on this issue :
Snow clearance has become an ongoing political issue for winter cities , with disabled people , the elderly , and parents and caregivers arguing that sidewalks and crossings deserve the same priority as cars , lest people be essentially trapped in their homes .
Many physically disabled people have already had their mobility limited during quarantine due to pre-existing health risks , the inability to avoid using elevators and the difficulty of maintaining social distancing .
Temporary urban design changes also need to be inclusive .
Speaking of realism , while researching this post on Arinze Stanley , I noticed that American realist painter Robert Bechtle died yesterday .
I ca n’t exactly remember which of the paintings shown above ( ‘ 61 Pontiac at the Whitney , Alameda Gran Torino , 1974 at SFMoMA ) I saw in person first , but I do remember being instantly drawn to his work .
The level of detail combined with objects of such mundanity sent my mind spinning off into all kinds of interesting realms .
Nigerian artist Arinze Stanley uses hyperrealistic techniques to draw surreal portraits in stunning detail .
From his artist statement : I draw inspiration from life experiences and basically everything that sparks a feeling of necessity , I find myself spending countless hours working on an artwork to stimulate deep and strong emotions in order to connect more intimately with my viewers

I work with my Principle of the Three P’s namely Patience , Practice and Persistence .
These have guided me over the years towards perfecting my craft . ”

I ’ve posted before about how the language we ’ve been conditioned to use about slavery and the Civil War obscures reality .
From historian Michael Todd Landis : Likewise , scholar Edward Baptist ( Cornell ) has provided new terms with which to speak about slavery .
In his 2014 book The Half Has Never Been Told : Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism ( Basic Books ) , he rejects “ plantations ” ( a term pregnant with false memory and romantic myths ) in favor of “ labor camps ” ; instead of “ slave - owners ” ( which seems to legitimate and rationalize the ownership of human beings ) , he uses “ enslavers . ”
Small changes with big implications .
These far more accurate and appropriate terms serve his argument well , as he re-examines the role of unfree labor in the rise of the United States as an economic powerhouse and its place in the global economy .
In order to tear down old myths , he eschews the old language .
@absurdistwords had a great thread on this recently , urging us to “ stop obscuring the horror with detached , antiquated , euphemistic terms ” .
Clear Language on Slavery : Slaves = Hostages
Slave Owners = Human Traffickers
Slave Catchers = Police
Plantations = Death Camps
Mistresses = Rape Victims
Discipline = Torture / Murder
Overseers = Torturers
Trading = Kidnapping
Profit =
Theft
Middle Passage = Genocide
For example : “ The prominent slave owner never publicly recognized the offspring of he and one of his slave romances but allowed him to serve in the house ” is really “ The rich human trafficker raped his female hostage and then held their son hostage as well at the death camp he owned ”
And from an earlier thread :
When you replace “ Owned slaves ” with “ Was an active and willing participant in a vast conspiracy to kidnap children from their families in order to force them into industrial and sexual servitude ”
It becomes harder to write slave owning off as just a blot on one ’s record .
For instance : George Washington was our first President and was an active and willing participant in a vast conspiracy to kidnap children from their families in order to force them into industrial and sexual servitude
They continue : America treats slavery like an oopsie rather than a centuries - long campaign of nightmarish , brutal terrorism .
America sees the systemic and sadistic destruction of Black families as an etiquette violation .
Which is why it will excuse slave owners so readily .
This is an excellent piece in The Atlantic by Barton Gellman on The Election That Could Break America .
Excellent and hair - raising .
It outlines several of the ways that Donald Trump & the Republicans could disrupt the election process to produce an ambiguous outcome and use the chaos to retain the presidency .
The worst case , however , is not that Trump rejects the election outcome .
The worst case is that he uses his power to prevent a decisive outcome against him .
If Trump sheds all restraint , and if his Republican allies play the parts he assigns them , he could obstruct the emergence of a legally unambiguous victory for Biden in the Electoral College and then in Congress .
He could prevent the formation of consensus about whether there is any outcome at all .
He could seize on that un-certainty to hold on to power .
Trump ’s state and national legal teams are already laying the groundwork for postelection maneuvers that would circumvent the results of the vote count in battleground states .
Ambiguities in the Constitution and logic bombs in the Electoral Count Act make it possible to extend the dispute all the way to Inauguration Day , which would bring the nation to a precipice .
The Twentieth Amendment is crystal clear that the president ’s term in office “ shall end ” at noon on January 20 , but two men could show up to be sworn in .
One of them would arrive with all the tools and power of the presidency already in hand .
Read on for the details about how that could happen ( voter suppression , mail - in voting , the “ blue - shift ” , the expired consent decree governing “ ballot security ” operations at polls , deploying the military to “ Democrat - run cities ” to “ protect ballots ” , hand - picked electors in Republican - controlled swing states ) .
But Gellman is clear : some or all of this is going to happen .
Let us not hedge about one thing .
Donald Trump may win or lose , but he will never concede .
Not under any circumstance .
Not during the Interregnum and not afterward .
If compelled in the end to vacate his office , Trump will insist from exile , as long as he draws breath , that the contest was rigged .
Trump ’s invincible commitment to this stance will be the most important fact about the coming Interregnum .
It will deform the proceedings from beginning to end .
We have not experienced anything like it before .
( As a quick aside , just yesterday , after Gellman ’s piece was finalized , Trump again declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power . )
I ’m not a political scientist nor a therapist , but as someone who has been writing for years that Trump will never willingly leave office , I urge those of you who do n’t want America to slide further into autocracy to acclimate yourself to the worst case scenario here so that you ’re not completely devastated and immobilized when Election Day and then Inauguration Day comes and this shit happens .
Do n’t ignore this , optimistically rationalize it away , or stuff it deep down inside you ; face it now , directly , and be prepared to assist in the fight for democracy and justice that ’s coming .
Update : Here ’s a thread by lawyer & author Teri Kanefield responding to The Atlantic piece that ’s gotten some attention on Twitter .
First , remember that each state has rules that govern the certifying of their elections .
Yes , laws still matter .
The Trump legal advisor wants you to think they do n’t .
Why ?
Because when enough people lose confidence in democracy , democracy will fail .
That ’s why …a goal of active measures is to get you to lose confidence in democratic processes .
Trump is trying his best to get you to lose confidence in democratic processes .
He is trying to make you think he can pull this off .
New polls came out today showing that Trump is ten points behind nationally .
The Strongman needs you to think he ’s strong .
He does n’t want you talking about the polls .
If he was winning , he ’d want you talking about the polls .
There are some good details in there , but ultimately she ’s really only talking about one aspect of the piece ( the election certification ) and it remains to be seen whether national polling during a pandemic and more than a month before the election will have anything to with reality when it comes to actual counted votes in a selection of swing states .
As the 2016 election showed , all you really need is to bend things your way a little bit in a few states and you ’ve got yourself an election or crisis or whatever .

Pictured : Elephants march through hotel lobby after it was built on their migration trail
These amazing pictures show why you should n't get between an African elephant and its favourite food .
Mfuwe Lodge in Zambia happens to have been built next to a mango tree that one family of pachyderms have always visited when the fruit ripens .
When they returned one year and found the luxury accommodation in the way , they simply walked through reception .
Let the porter grab your trunk :
An elephant wanders through Mfuwe Lodge , in the South Luangwa National Park , Zambia
The animals came in two - by - two : Hotel staff and visitors have got used to the elephants ' impromptu strolls through reception
Now the family group , headed by matriarch Wonky Tusk , return every November to gorge on mangos - up to four times a day .
Andy Hogg , 44 , director at the Bushcamp Company that runs the Lodge , has lived in South Luangwa National Park since 1982 .
But in all his years of dealing with wild animals he has never seen such intimate interaction between man and beast .
' This is the only place in the world where elephants freely get so close to humans , ' says the 44 - year - old .
' The elephants start coming through base camp in late November of each year to eat the mangos from our trees .
' When they are ripe they come through and they stand about for four to six weeks coming back each day or second day to eat the mangos . '
Living in the 5,000 square mile national park , the ten - strong elephant herd are led to the lodge each day by Wonky Tusk .
Migration route :
The hotel was built directly in the path of the elephants ' route to one of their favourite foods - mangos
' The most interesting thing about this is that they are wild animals and are certainly not tame , ' explains Andy .
' They come through the lodge to eat the fruit .
' There are ten in that herd and it is only that herd that comes through .
It is a strange thing .
' The matriarchal in the herd is Wonky Tusk , and she brings the nine others through and they come and go as they please . '
Mfuwe Lodge consists of seven camps and the base camp where the elephants come through .
Employing 150 staff , the management of the lodge are happy to report that there have been no incidents involving the elephants to date .
' The elephants do get reasonably close to the staff as you can see with the pictures of the elephants near the reception , ' he explains .
' But we do not allow the guests to get too close . '
Check - in :
But it 's unlikely the lodge has a room big enough for its elephant guests
' Guests can stand in the lounge are but as long as there is a barrier between the elephants and the guests that is okay , ' he added .
' The elephants are not aggressive but you do n't want to tempt anything as they are wild animals .
' It is the elephants choice to come into base camp and they have been doing it for the last ten years .
' There are other wild mango trees around and they seem to prefer this one . '
And even thought the lodge was unwittingly built upon the path , Andy says they had no idea the elephants would insist on returning .
' It was n't a design mistake - no - one really knew they were going to come through , ' he says .
' The lodge was built and then the elephants started coming through afterwards .
Gentle giants :
The leader of the ten - strong herd is matriarch Wonky Tusk
' We keep people at a safe distance .
They are obviously close enough to see what is going on from pretty close quarters but we also make sure we have staff around to make sure the elephants do n't get too close .
' But as I said they are still wild and still dangerous .
They are huge beasts and untamed .
' We have bricks and walls between the elephants and the guests such as the counter and other barriers to stop them getting to people and if they try to there is enough time for people to get away . '
Naturally , the lodge becomes a busier attraction for both elephants and guests during November time .
' We find that we get more people visiting us during the elephant migration because of the unique experience of being so close to wild animals in an unusual environment , ' says Andy .
' But as I said this is a totally natural phenomenon , the elephants come here of their own accord and it is certainly a rare but magnificent sight . '

There may be a virus aboard , and the crappers were once waste distributors instead of collectors , but the one criticism we can no longer level at the International Space Station is a lack of wireless .
That 's because it has it now !
Let astrophysics tests no longer be confined to the lab — astronauts can now complete them , blogger - style , from the comforts of their bunk .
Further details from NASA Watch :
" After transitioning the JSL ( Joint Station LAN ) network to the new Netgear wireless APs ( Access Points , WAPs ) which provide the ISS with WiFi ( wireless + Ethernet ) connectivity , Gregory today repeated functionality tests , abandoned earlier this week , in three Kibo JPM ( JEM Pressurized Module ) locations from the wireless SSC - 11 laptop , and later also in the COL ( Columbus Orbital Laboratory ) .
Afterwards switching to " Proxim " APs , the new WiFi " Dolphin " BCRs ( Barcode Readers ) were also tested . "

I found a better way to peel peaches .
Most recipes say to blanch them in boiling water for a minute , shock them in ice water , and pull off the skin .
This is messy and time consuming .
Rather than battle with a slippery orb of peach flesh bars and extra pots and bowls , simply slice each peach in half , twist , pull out the topping pit , and slice each half into fourths .
Take each wedge , and with a sharp paring knife , slice off the skin .
Much easier !
I used almond flour in this pie recipe because I think it adds a little filling of something blueberry , but to be honest , last year , Super Target was selling bags of almond flour for $ 1.99 .
I do n’t think they meant to do this .
Anyway , I bought about six bags of it and now it ’s all stored in my freezer .
I try to use it as much as I can .
Since then , Target has fixed the price , and now it ’s about $ 13.00 a bag .
So , if you want to leave it out , just substitute with regular flour .
It ’ll still be great .

1/4 teaspoon pure almond extract
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

Residents continue to flee the city because of insecurity
The world should be shocked at the systematic destruction of Somalia 's capital , Mogadishu , and its residents , says lobby group Human Rights Watch .
The organisation told the BBC the city had become a zone of free - fire between government and insurgent forces .
It said if such a situation was happening anywhere else in the world , like Georgia or Lebanon for example , it would be considered a travesty .
Instead Somalia was the most ignored tragedy in the world today , HRW said .
Meanwhile , a group of 52 non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) has issued a statement saying the international community had " completely failed Somali civilians " .
The aid groups estimate that almost 40,000 people had been displaced from Mogadishu in the last few weeks , with 1.1 million uprooted in the last nine months .
Eerie BBC World Affairs correspondent Mark Doyle recently visited Mogadishu and says the city on the Indian Ocean , which was previously one of Africa 's trading hubs with the Middle East , is dying .
Ghost city wracked by war Video :
In Somalia 's danger zone Now whole swathes of it are rubble or skeletons of buildings without doors or windows or roofs , he says .
He adds that the most shocking , eerie aspect of it is that in many parts of the capital all the people have fled .
The fighting is between the US - backed government and Islamist and nationalist insurgents , who Washington accuses of having links with al - Qaeda .
There are no international aid workers left as they are threatened with kidnap for ransom or are murdered .
The fighting has been much worse for the ordinary residents of Mogadishu than even the infamous period in the early 1990s that spawned the film Black Hawk Down , a portrayal of US troops killed in Somalia at that time , our World Affairs correspondent says .
In the early 1990s not a night passed without explosions lighting up the sky , he says .
But even that did not empty the capital of Somalia like the daily fratricidal confrontations now taking place between the government and its armed opponents .

Barack Obama is noted for his powerful intellect , but I do n’t think he gets nearly enough credit for the mental dexterity it takes to be simultaneously an Islamic theocrat , atheistic communist and national socialist while posing as a center left candidate .
Those must be the compartmentalization skills they taught him at that Manchurian madrasah in Indonesia .
The fact that Obama embodies the worst nightmares of so many on the political right says far more about them that it does him .
In this piece at The Corner , Mark R. Levin , bristling over normally rational conservatives like Colin Powell and Charles Fried falling under Obama ’s demagogic spell , pushes ajar the door to his inner psyche , where the horrors are of the communist - cum - Nazi variety .
Levin does n’t go in much for the Obama as closet Muslim nightmare .
I ’m sure it ’s just a failure of imagination .
Obama has noted this before , as has Jon Stewart – the fact that Republican politicians admire stupidity and ignorance .
They wear their lack of education , their incompetence , their failure as a badge of honor .
And it ’s certainly an American tradition , having disdain for intellectuals .
But when push comes to shove , do you really want bubba , or bubba with lipstick , in charge of your 401k and your life savings ?
At some point America has got to get over its love affair with stupid .
Or the mistakes of the last eight years , when we elected stupid to an art form , will continue to repeat themselves .
Here ’s tomorrow ’s editorial in the New York Times about the debate :
In the end , the debate did not change the essential truth of Ms. Palin ’s candidacy : she can learn her talking points and make a good impression under controlled circumstances .
But Mr. McCain made a wildly irresponsible choice when he picked someone with far too little experience or evident knowledge for the post .
That choice shattered the image that Mr. McCain created for himself as the tempered , seasoned , experienced man of principle and judgment .
Picking Ms. Palin was either an act of incredible cynicism or appallingly bad judgment .
The ensuing weeks cemented those images in our minds .
Ms. Palin initially injected some energy into the McCain campaign , especially among members of the right - wing Republican base , who never liked or trusted the Arizona senator — and still do not .
Then , she began lurching from one embarrassing public appearance to another , culminating in her shocking performance in interviews with Katie Couric .
In those exchanges , Ms. Palin was inarticulate and shockingly unable to answer the most basic questions about government policy and even her own political philosophy .
The Republicans have tried to present the negative reaction to Ms. Palin as a matter of liberal elites sneering at someone who does not share their privileged backgrounds .
That is a distraction .
The problem with Ms. Palin ’s candidacy , which she underscored in her appearance at the debate on Thursday night , is not that she did n’t attend a fancy school or go backpacking in Europe after college .
It is her disdain for knowledge , education , experience and contemplative leadership .

Polls : A CBS / New York Times poll gives Obama a 13 - point lead among likely voters -- Obama 52 % , McCain 39 % -- and shows he's also ahead of McCain among several demographics who voted for Bush in ' 04 , including married women , suburbanites -- and white Catholics , who 've voted with the winner for decades .
Gallup 's daily tracking poll narrows slightly to Obama 51 % , McCain 45 % , and suggests that , contrary to much punditry , Obama is easily winning the Jewish vote .
Headline of the day , on a piece about how far the intra-McCain campaign blame game has already gone : " GOP forms circular firing squad . "
One former McCain strategist captures the atmosphere : " The cake is baked .
We 're entering the finger - pointing and positioning - for - history part of the campaign .
It 's every man for himself now . "
There 's apparently barely any communication between the campaign and the national party , and much despair at the endlessly changing campaign messages .
[ Politico ]
Then again -- in a piece that admittedly strains to make its point , though it'd be unwise to dismiss the argument -- the New York Times 's Adam Nagourney sketches how McCain could still win .
[ New York Times ]
The New York Times announces its endorsement for president .
And let me just say this : Bob Barr is one very , very happily surprised man this mor -- oh , sorry , actually they 've gone for Obama .

Former Bush press spokesman Scott McClellan endorses Obama too , completing his alienation from his old conservative friends .

More and more questions emerge over the horrible story of the McCain campaign worker who says she was attacked in the street in Pittsburgh by a black man who carved the letter ' B ' on her face and told her : " You are going to be a Barack supporter . "
Police now plan to administer a lie - detector test over contradictions in her account .
" If the incident turns out to be a hoax , " writes a senior Fox News executive , " Senator McCain 's quest for the presidency is over , forever linked to race - baiting . "
In the last eight years , we 've grown accustomed to expecting that election night will be a down - to - the - wire , all - night drama .
But your election night party could be over sooner than you think : here 's why November 4 could all be over by 9 pm eastern time , or 2 am in the UK .
[ New York Observer ]
Unusually , Sarah Palin gives a newspaper interview , insisting the $ 150,000 clothing bill story is " just bad !
Oh , if people only knew how frugal we are ... " [ Chicago Tribune ]
Even if she loses , she wins : " Producers and agents across the entertainment world are discussing possibilities for capitalizing on [ Palin 's ] fame , ranging from an Oprah - style syndicated talk show to a Sean Hannity - like perch in cable news or on radio . "

Ever wonder why alcoholics and problem drinkers drink so much ?
It ’s because alcohol produces in them a pleasure greater than all others — an unspoken pleasure far greater than the normal survival drives of sex , eating , family life , the desire to succeed in life , and physical safety .
The resulting drive to repeat that pleasure is proportionately stronger than normal survival drives .
Alcohol is a synthetic , man - made substance , among a group of synthetic drugs that produce pleasure greater than evolution has prepared us to manage , a disorienting pleasure that causes one 's moral compass to point south toward death rather than toward true north and life .
Ever wonder why alcoholics never really get better , but only stay sober one - day - at - a - time ?
It is because alcoholics believe … [ more inside … ]

The Barest Essentials of AVRT ®
©2010 , Jack Trimpey .
All rights reserved .
You are not your body .
You are a conscious , self - identity — a human being residing in the body of an animal , homo sapiens .
“ Human ” means , “ not animal . ” A party animal is an animal being .
Addicted people are animal beings .
Recite this to yourself : " I am me , a human being .
My body is it , an animal being .
It , not I , wants to drink / use .
I will never drink / use again . "
Feel your body 's alarm when you say this .
As a conscious , human being , you cannot be an addict or alcoholic because you are not a physical entity .
Addicts function as animals , party animals , but are no less animal than a dog .
Your body lives by the law of the jungle .
It wants you to do many animal things you know are stupid , immoral , gross , self - destructive , and harmful to others , some of which are also criminal .
In addiction , your body is running the show .
Alas , you are responsible for everything your body does , however much your body may want to do its animal things .
You run your body .
Your body is powerless to do anything without your direction or consent .
Your body wants to run your life , but it can't .
It must talk to you in your head , in English , commanding and telling you in a thousand ways to do animal things related to survival , especially pleasurable activities such as eating , sex , and the ultimate pleasure -- your favorite fix .
Humans live by universal family values , such as these : Honesty , integrity , personal responsibility , industriousness , love , affection , loyalty , self - discipline , compassion , cheer , generosity , and mutual respect
In addiction , these human traits are lost without being missed by the addict .
Through human eyes , significant others see the addict 's coarse , animal disposition and feel alienated from him / her .
Here are some key definitions : Addiction :
The high life .
Persistent use of alcohol and other drugs to obtain addictive pleasures , against your own better judgment .
Addiction is the pursuit of pleasure that exceeds the pleasures associated with survival , e.g. , food , sex , O2 , safety , shelter , etc .
The desire for addictive pleasure is accordingly stronger .
Therefore , the desire for pleasure , even addictive pleasure , is a sign of robust health , not of disease .
Addiction is a natural function of a healthy body exposed to synthetic substances and experiences .
Addictive Voice® ( AV ® ) :
Any thinking , in words and images , that directs , supports or suggests the possible future use of alcohol and other drugs .
The Beast : Addictive desire .
The animal desire for addictive pleasures , to get high .
Your Beast is a perverted survival drive that speaks with awesome , sometimes God-like , authority , but takes on charming and seductive tones as well .
Bark —> Dog = AV —>
Beast Your AV will give you a hard time as you attempt to make your Big Plan .
That ’s what AVRT ® is for : defeating the thoughts produced by your body which perpetuate habitual self - intoxication .
Remember , AVRT - based recovery is effortless for you , but a frightening , painful experience for the Beast .
Poor thing .
The Big Plan : A principled commitment to lifetime abstinence from alcohol and other pleasure producing drugs , with no allowance for relapses , i.e. , “ I will never drink / use again . ”
The Recoil and the Reply : When you make your Big Plan , you ’ll feel an emotional recoil — anxiety or a sinking feeling .
You 'll also hear your head voice saying “ Yeah , right .
You ca n’t say never , ” or “ You ’re doomed to fail , ” or , “ Life ’s no good without drinking / using . "
The emotional recoil is the Beast .
The head noise is your AV , i.e. , “ It . ” Your Big Plan forces the Beast into consciousness , creating the “ I / it split ” of AVRT - based recovery .
Abstinence Commitment Effect ( ACE ) :
The immediate and sustained , uplifted feelings arising from your Big Plan .
The return of your human spirit and family values .
Recoveryism : Addiction disguised as recovery .
Life according to the rules of addiction , e.g. , “ Never say never , ” one - day - at - a - time sobriety , “ Imanalcoholic , ” recovery group disorder , infinite tolerance of self - intoxication , disease concept of addiction .
( Clue 4 U : Recovery groups and substance abuse counseling are based on doctrinal forms of the Addictive Voice® .
Check it out , using the definition of the AV , above . )
The goal in AVRT ® - based recovery is to live comfortably with residual addictive desire , and not to silence or stave off your Addictive Voice .
You should welcome the AV as a sign of health , and not as a threat , because your Beast is utterly powerless to act independently of your will .
Stay away from recovery groups of all kinds , substance abuse counselors , and other bad company as well .
Set your confidence for lifetime abstinence arbitrarily at 100 % , recognize all self - doubt as your Addictive Voice , seek worthy relationships , and you ’ll do fine .
The Family Strikes Back !
© 2010 , Jack Trimpey .
All rights reserved .
No family can survive addiction of even one of its members .
Addiction is a black hole that consumes all of a family ’s finances and emotional resources , and then still demands more .
Families of addiction live under a cloud of uncertainty and deception , not only the lying , betrayal , and manipulation of addiction , but also the deceit of the disease concept of addiction , which transforms a perfect ass into a sacred alcoholic .
Here is an action plan for any family or family member to take against the addicted family member , while also granting him the sense of freedom necessary for self - inspired recovery .
Notice the absence of sweetness , compassion , tolerance , and support as you read this simple plan protect you and your family .
Review the other resources at this website to get broader understanding of Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® ( AVRT ® ) .
1 . How long ?
Decide , with as much agreement in the family as possible , how much longer you will tolerate his drinking / using or other vice .
You can measure how long in time , like days , weeks , years , or you may decide on a certain number of betrayals .
Six months ?
Three more “ relapses , ” like three strikes and you ’re out ?
Till death do us part , as in the marriage vows ?
One more week ?
One more drop / fix ?
Keep in mind that the addiction has continued in large part because the family has been accommodating it , tolerating endless betrayals , accepting one - day - at - a - time sobriety , even sharing in the responsibility for his drinking / using as an “ enabler ” or “ codependent . ”
Be assured that the addict will continue drinking / using as long as you and the rest of the family will tolerate it , and perhaps longer as well .
Addiction expands into the tolerance that surrounds it .
2. Make a Plan B Before the Family Council , when he ’ll be told how much longer you and the family will tolerate his addiction , decide exactly what you will do if he chooses to continue drinking / using .
This could be something quite mild , such as refusing to speak to him , keep him in a will , cook for him , or use the same master bedroom , or occupy the same room in the house , or plan any vacations with him .
Or , it might be separation or divorce .
If children are involved , they will need protection against the long - term ugliness of addiction .
3 . Plan the zero - tolerance ultimatum
This is quite unlike the famous intervention , a social sobfest of “ tough love ” while the rehab van idles outside .
The ultimatum is just that — a final demand accompanied by your solemn promise to take a certain action if he continues to indulge his addiction .
However , keep in mind that your zero - tolerance ultimatum is not a way of getting rid of your addicted family member , and not a demand that he quit or even stop his addiction .
It is simply a demand that he choose between addiction and his family .
Big difference .
However he chooses , everyone is a winner , because everyone is exercising free will .
Make sure every family member has a copy of The Art of AVRT® , one of which your addicted family member will be given during or prior to your ultimatum .
Tell your addicted family member that AVRT ® is a summary of the ( your last name ) family values , and that sobriety is n’t good enough for you , for the family , nor for him .
4 . Here are the words for your zero - tolerance ultimatum : Convene the Family Council before he has had his first drink of the day .
Begin , without anger or spite , “ I / we have decided that I / we will no longer accept your addiction because it is too painful , ugly , and depressing .
We love the memory of the better person you once were , but we do not love the stinky , dangerous animal you ’ve become .
Now you must choose between your addiction and this family .
You ca n’t have it both ways any longer .
You must answer this question , so listen carefully :
What is your plan for the future use of alcohol and other drugs ?
Are you going to use again in this lifetime , or are you not ?
You do n’t have to answer me immediately , but I must have an answer by ____ .
( Say when , but keep it within 24 hours maximum , preferably 2 - 4 hours later ) .
We hope you ’ll choose to stay in the family , but please believe me , your next drink / fix will be your way of leaving this family .
If you continue your self - intoxication , wherever you are , you will be free to follow your your addiction wherever it takes you , but you will no longer be welcome here or in our hearts . ”
Tell him you expect a personal guarantee that he ’ll never drink again , and with only one strike and he ’s out .
For success , the addicted family member should be expected to permanently withdraw from recovery group participation and addiction treatment services , and , of course , the family must desist from participating in the anti-family , addiction - coddling programming of Al - Anon .
The AVRT ® zero - tolerance ultimatum applies to all addicted family members including minors and persons under psychiatric care .
The only exception is for mentally incompetent people , gravely disabled and unable to enter into personal agreements , an extremely rare situation .
Addiction does not fall into any psychiatric category , no matter how many diagnostic manuals insist otherwise .
5 . Take the Crash Course on AVRT ® for Families , which will improve your insight and develop some emotional muscle so you can force your addicted family member to choose between addiction and good standing in the family .
Distribute copies of Rational Recovery : The New Cure for Substance Addiction to all of the key family members who are affected by this addiction , including you .

Zero-Tolerance Ultimatum for Your
A ddicted S pouse or S ignificant Other ( ASS )
©2010 , Jack Trimpey .
All rights reserved .
Addiction is insatiable , and will consume all of any family ’s emotional and financial resources , and still demand more .
In contrast to the addict - centered , disease / treatment way of thinking that puts the addict at the center of a family support system , AVRT ® - based recovery , is family - centered , requring the addicted family member to guarantee permanent abstinence as a condition of the benefits of family life .
Families exercise their legitmate authority to force the addicted member to choose between his addiction and Plan B , an exact plan of self - protective action the family will take if and when the addict persists with self - intoxication .
Plan B may include disownment , termination of family membership , separation , divorce , ending financial support , or other means of family protection .
Accordingly , we heartily endorse the zero - tolerance ultimatum , in which a family spokesman confronts the addict with , " Today you must choose between your addiction and ( Plan B ) . "
Refusal to guarantee lifetime abstinence , including the promise of recovery group participation or addiction treatment services , should be interpreted as " Yes , I will have yummy relapses any time I really feel like it , " and set in motion Plan B .
Families are the source of legitimate , moral authority at the base of public law .
Thus , families have powerful means at their disposal to deal directly and effectively with addiction within the ranks .
Sadly , fellowships of addiction have conspired for over eighty years to dominate their families so that they become the political center of family life , requiring support , tolerance , and patient understanding in order to avoid continuing drunkenness , abuse , criminality , financial downfall , and mayhem .
The culprit is the bogus disease concept of addiction , which transforms the ugliness of addiction into alarming symptoms of a major medical disease , makes addictive self - indulgence into innocent behavior , changes sociopathic addicts into disease victims worthy of compassionate attention , understanding and care .
In short , the disease concept of immorality transforms the family 's perfect ass into a sacred alcoholic at the center of family life .
The result of this medically - sponsored deception is that families of addiction feel unauthorized to deal logically and effectively with their adult , addicted family members .
Following mainstream cultural beliefs and values , they interpret the ugly betrayal of addiction as a medical mystery and seek outside advice and professional advice .
Eagerly awaiting them is an inverted family system , Al - Anon , a fellowship based upon the beliefs and values of addicted people , that views addiction / alcoholism as a family disease .
Al - Anon is a auxilliary of AA that changes the real victims of addiction , innocent family members , into “ enablers ” and “ codependents ” who are largely responsible , genetically and psychologically , for the onset and perpetuation of addiction .
In AVRT - based recovery , however , enablers and codependents are considered suckers , falling for the most transparent excuse for self - intoxication , the disease concept of addiction .
Fellowships of addicted people , gathered separately as addicts and families , then spawn an endless stream of clinical - sounding excuses , e.g. , triggers , stress , depression , isolation , missing meetings , hunger , anger , lonliness , fatigue , " untreated addiction , " etc .
The over - arching threat to families is that , if an addicted person under duress " relapses , " comes to harm or dies , then responsibility lies with the self - protective acts of the family .
In other words , the disease concept of addiction is the foundation of emotional blackmail of individual families and the larger human family that makes up society and the nation .
Along the same lines , you may have heard of “ interventions , ” in which the family has a little surprise party for their substance abuser , with the aim of shaming him / her into immediate enrollment in an addiction treatment center at which the staff are mostly " in recovery " themselves , estranged by addiction from their own families , and reserving for themselves the option of having yummy relapses under certain perfect conditions .
The “ tough - love ” action of intervention is most unlikely to restore your addicted family member to your family , no more so than those " in recovery " who provide services at rehabs who " relapse " at an alarmingly high rate .
Obviously , intervention is better called rehab abduction , and your family will come under the influence of recovery doctrines basesd upon the beliefs and values of chronically addicted people .
For example , your family life will revolve around your ASS , who will reserve the option to have deeply pleasurable " relapses , " while you are expected to live under the uncertainty of one - day - at - a - time sobriety .
It is not surprising that the secure , abstinent outcome of addiction treatment services is so low that no such data is collected to support " evidence - based treatment . "
Setting the stage for action :
To follow in this article is a clear , 10 - point outline to guide your family through …
[ More inside ] Jack and Lois Trimpey , Co-Founders Background
When Lois and I decided to create a better path to addiction recovery back in 1985 , it seemed we could improve on what already existed — the recovery group movement and its business arm , the addiction treatment industry .
We launched a network of recovery groups based upon the idea that addiction is a psychological hangup which can be overcome through group discussions of cognitive - behavioral therapy .
Following my professional pedigree , I linked Rational Recovery ® strongly with the addiction treatment industry by recruiting hundreds of professional counselors to oversee local RR groups .
In doing so , I had joined two of the key features of AA that account for its dismal failure to arrive at prompt , full recovery , ( 1 ) the group format that allows fellowships of addiction to emerge as surrogate families , and ( 2 ) the clinical mindset of the psychological disease concept of addiction that views self - intoxication by problem drinkers and drug addicts as an innocent act committed by innocent individuals .
The network spread into a thousand cities , with participants " in recovery " joined together in the evenings , away from their families , socializing with other local substance abusers .
RR groupers kept coming back year after year in a quest for sobriety based upon emotional comfort , inner peace , rational viewpoints , self - understanding , and the perverse , emotional support of a surrogate family of other substance abusers .
By offering a secular alternative very similar to " the real thing , " Rational Recovery dovetailed with mainstream thinking and became a mainstream media news story for several years .
" Rationality " naturally became an exciting , new flavor of the more pious , 12 - step , “ spiritual ” doctrine created long ago by and for addicted people .
The agenda reached far beyond defeating addiction , into evangelistic atheism .
Group facilitators even boasted of causing “ humanist conversions , ” revealing the inherent political strivings of addicted people to create a society in their own base image .
Finally it became obvious that nothing had really changed because we had inadvertently created Rational Recovery in the image of Alcoholics Anonymous , the Avis and Hertz of the sobriety society .
During that time , a massive , federal research study , Project MATCH , revealed no difference in the effectiveness of cognitive - behavioral therapy and 12 - step recovery , especially in the measure of secure , abstinent outcome .
Little wonder , for I had practically cloned 12 - step recovery by ( 1 ) providing RR group members with a rich source of clinical excuses for relapses and ( 2 ) encouraging the formation of relationships between chronically addicted people , relationships that common sense would identify as bad company .
The groups necessarily continued the uncertainty principle of one - day - at - a - time sobriety , and reinforced the anti-family attitudes of shamelessness and guiltlessness that typify addiction itself .
Having been seriously addicted for many years myself , I finally understood the brutal truths -- that ( 1 ) any means of recovery devised by people in recovery , i.e. , in addiction , will necessarily preserve and extend addiction , ( 2 ) clinical thought , my own included , is a perfect expression of the Addictive Voice , and ( 3 ) never - addicted people , professional or not , have little insight into the subjective experience of addiction and the commonplace experience of abrupt recovery based upon family values .
The RR groups had merely substituted secularism for faux religion , and perpetuated the addict - centered approach we now call recoveryism .
These insights alone brought about the end of the Rational Recovery ® Self - Help Network ( RRSN ) as well as severance from the addiction treatment industry .
Rational Recovery today is family centered .
Our flagship , Addictive Voice Recognition Technique® ( AVRT® ) , is based upon universal family values , as opposed to clinical thought and scientific reasoning , meaning the addicted family member gets only the support that his own family sees fit to provide .
Often this means no support , which is both logical and constructive , because addicts are not disease victims but traitors to their families who must earn respect through immediate , prolonged , guaranteed abstinence with zero - tolerance for any further indulgence .
AVRT - based recovery is not tough love , not only because it 's tough to love an addicted person , but mainly because addicts are loveless beings who fail to distinguish between love and affection and interpret love and support as tolerance for chronic , open - ended addiction .
We know that behind their craziness , however , addicted people are usually good family people who can shoulder the burden of abstinence and grow strong from doing so .
For a more in - depth understanding of independent recovery , read the acclaimed article , Why Self - Recovery ?
We both wish AVRT ® had been available when we needed it almost 30 years ago .
That would have definitely saved our family enormous difficulties and despair .
Our lives are dedicated to making AVRT ® a viable option for all addicted people , including your family .

On the other side is the public , which increasingly believes that climate change is real and worries about it , but which rarely ranks it as a high priority .
A 2007 survey by the U.N. Development Programme found that 54 % of Americans advocate taking a " wait and see " approach to climate - change action — holding off on the deep and rapid cuts in global warming that would immediately impact their lives .
( And it 's not just SUV - driving Americans who take this position — similar majorities were found in Russia , China and India . )
As a result , we have our current dilemma : a steady drumbeat of scientific evidence of global warming 's severity and comparatively little in the way of meaningful political action .
That 's where Sterman 's research comes in .
" There is a profound and fundamental misconception about climate , " he says .
The problem is that most of us do n't really understand how carbon accumulates in the atmosphere .
Increasing global temperatures are driven by the increase in the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere .
Before the industrial age , the concentration was about 280 parts per million ( p.p.m. ) of carbon in the atmosphere .
After a few centuries of burning coal , oil and other fossil fuels , we 've raised that concentration to 387 p.p.m. , and it continues to rise by about 2 p.p.m. every year .
Many scientists believe that we need to at least stabilize carbon concentrations at 450 p.p.m. to ensure that global temperatures do n't increase more than about 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level .
To do that , we need to reduce global carbon emissions ( which hit about 10 billion tons last year ) until they are equal to or less than the amount of carbon sequestered by the oceans and plant life ( which removed about 4.8 billion tons of carbon last year ) . "
Time
We can add forests that soak up carbon , but they take space we might otherwise want to use .
Humanity needs a plan for when it stops growing , and governments that can enforce it , or we 'll dominate all of earth .
Global warming is n't our only environmental problem .
Pollution , land overuse , species genocide , decrease in genetic fitness of species , ecosystem interruption , and oversaturation with beneficial chemicals are all part of the problem .
No matter how much we individually reduce our carbon footprint , it 's irrelevant if we keep growing as a species .
Overbreeding , immigration , and political instability contribute here .
Great article ; what we can add that he can't , because it 's politically unpopular :
A few things to keep in mind when you hear public figures bloviating about global warming .
The 90s had Smashing Pumpkins ' Melon Collie And The Infinite Sadness , Springsteen 's The River , the Boo Radleys ' Giant Steps , Spiritualized 's Laser Guided Melodies , the Wu - Tang Clan 's Wu-Tang Forever and Sonic Youth 's Dirty .
The 80s had Sign O ' the Times , Blood and Zen Arcade .
And in the 70s it seemed all major bands were contractually obliged to knock out a lumbering great double album every three years or so as Pink Floyd , ELO , Chicago , the Who , Led Zeppelin , the Rolling Stones , Genesis and Yes knocked out multiple discs .
Back then , if you could n't string together 30 - odd tracks telling the psychedelic story of , say , a lamb feeling slightly knackered on Broadway , you were nobody .
Most decent bands , and Red Hot Chili Peppers , have marked their creative high point with a monolithic double - disc masterpiece and many a generation has been defined by them .
In my youth in the late 70s most HMVs were a battleground as Out of the Blue waged bloody war with London 's Calling for control over popular culture .
But as the major labels tighten their belts , dropping new bands and scything away at their payrolls with furious abandon , is the double album the latest industry dinosaur to face the chop ?
I mean , you 'd expect the Cure - a band with past double opus form , thanks to 1987's Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me - to be able to release a double album , right ?
Er , sadly not .
Their new album 4:13 Dream is the " light " first half of a double collection , with the second " dark " half to be released separately in 2009 .
Robert Smith recently told me the rather shocking factors behind the release strategy .
Basically , Geffen were only prepared to pay them royalties equivalent to a single album , even if the album was priced as a double .
In effect the label were penalising the band for wanting to give their fans more music for less .
Smith insisted he did n't care about making any more money but the principle was paramount ; he was furious at the idea of a major label conning him out of making the record he wanted .
So he held back the second half of the album for six months and one day later , the earliest moment that his contract permitted .
The concept would be intact , it would just be up to the fan to Sellotape the two " episodes " together .
Is this the ( disappointingly thin ) shape of things to come ?
The noughties have seen a notable decline in the standard of doubles – Speakerboxx / The Love Below was fatally lop - sided , American Idiot brutally crass and Stadium Arcadium , well , a Red Hot Chili Peppers record .
Instead the likes of Muse , prime candidates for gatefold glory , are promising to release batches of songs on the internet rather than crowbar them onto a single CD .
Will our burgeoning young artists now be robbed of the chance to make their White Album ?
There is hope for this endangered rock species .
This week Patrick Wolf announced that his next album would be a double – one " light " half and one " punky , aggressive " half – featuring Alec Empire from Atari Teenage Riot .
Wolf claims it will be a politically charged record tackling his depression , near insanity and redemption in the arms of fresh love .
Fingers crossed for this generation 's The Wall ?
ID cards for foreign nationals are the thin end of the wedge , whatever they look like – and the home secretary , who unveiled their design today , knows it .
Here 's how it goes :
Step 1 : Target a weak group who have no political voice in the UK and who benefit from little public backing or support , and make them the guinea pig for a deeply unpopular policy .
Step 2 : Once the sacrifice of their rights has embedded as " standard procedure " , pick off the next target – airport workers perhaps – or a group similarly small and likely to fly under the public radar .
Step 3 : Involve other public service workers in " sensitive " positions , followed next by students , and so it will go until we have all had our privacy surrendered to Labour 's surveillance state .
This strategy rests on a highly cynical assessment of the British people .
At best it hopes we wo n't notice when others are having their civil liberties brazenly suspended .
At worst it assumes that our fear of outsiders will allow us to sit idly by as innocent people are forced to hand over personal details to a government database .
Bear in mind that these are people already living legally in the UK , with the papers to prove it , who have moved here from outside of the European Union to study or to be with the person they love .
If the aim of this scheme was genuinely to combat illegal immigration and working , as ministers profess , there are more sensible solutions .
Better exit checks and stricter controls on unscrupulous employers would be far more effective .
The government keeps saying ID cards will make us safer .
But I doubt that terrorists will be trembling at the prospect of the new cards – they 're mandatory in Madrid yet failed to prevent the tragic train bombings in 2004 .
The key obstacle in catching terror suspects is rarely naming them , but is more about monitoring them and building up a case for prosecution .
Issuing these ID cards – no matter how fancy – is an expensive distraction .
That 's why the millions to be wasted on this scheme are better spent putting 10,000 more police on the beat .
It is shameful for ministers to exploit powerless groups to impose the new cards by stealth , and to stoke public fear by tainting foreigners with suspicion .
It is patronising that they think we will not speak up for our privacy , and the privacy of others .
The liberal commitment to freedom is universal , it should n't be determined by the colour of your skin .
It is still not too late for Gordon Brown to cancel the most powerful , most expensive and most intrusive database in the world .
He should know that an increasing number of people will not accept their details being handed over to a government that has repeatedly shown itself incapable of keeping personal data safe .
Labour 's boneheaded refusal to heed public opinion is exactly why this government is hitting the rocks .
There could be no more dramatic way for Gordon Brown to show that he 's finally listening and learning .
It is high time he musters the courage to cancel this wasteful government folly .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some breakfast cereals marketed to U.S. children are more than half sugar by weight and many get only fair scores on nutritional value , Consumer Reports said on Wednesday .
A serving of 11 popular cereals , including Kellogg ’s Honey Smacks , carries as much sugar as a glazed doughnut , the consumer group found .
And some brands have more sugar and sodium when formulated for the U.S. market than the same brands have when sold in other countries .
Post Golden Crisp made by Kraft Foods Inc and Kellogg ’s Honey Smacks are more than 50 percent sugar by weight , the group said , while nine brands are at least 40 percent sugar .
The most healthful brands are Cheerios with three grams of fiber per serving and one gram of sugar , Kix and Honey Nut Cheerios , all made by General Mills , and Life , made by Pepsico Inc ’s Quaker Oats unit .
“ Be sure to read the product labels , and choose cereals that are high in fiber and low in sugar and sodium , ” Gayle Williams , deputy editor of Consumer Reports Health , said in a statement .
Honey Smacks has 15 grams of sugar and just one gram of fiber per serving while Kellogg ’s Corn Pops has 12 grams of sugar and no fiber .
Consumer Reports studied how 91 children aged 6 to 16 poured their cereal and found they served themselves about 50 to 65 percent more on average than the suggested serving size for three of the four tested cereals .
Consumers International , which publishes Consumer Reports , said it would ask the World Health Organization to develop international guidelines restricting advertising and marketing of foods high in sugar , fat or sodium to children .
However , the group noted that breakfast cereal can be a healthful meal and said adults and children alike who eat breakfast have better overall nutrition , fewer weight problems , and better cognitive performance throughout the day .
Kellogg said it was working to make its food more nutritious .
“ Kellogg recently reformulated a number of our cereals including Froot Loops , Corn Pops , Rice Krispies , Cocoa Krispies and Apple Jacks in the U.S. with improved nutritional profiles , ” a company spokeswoman said by e-mail .
“ To put Consumer Reports ’ information in perspective , yogurt contains more sugar and sodium than a serving of Honey Smacks cereal ( 25 grams of sugar vs. 15 grams of sugar in Honey Smacks ) . ”
Consumer Reports , like other groups , compares the sugar content of food with its fiber , mineral and vitamin content .
Many cereals are fortified with vitamins and minerals .
Unlike government entities , private businesses have the right to promote religion as they see fit .
Short of discriminatory practices ( e.g. , erecting " Christians only " signs ) , businesses do not need to worry about church - state violations .
If a company such as Wal - Mart wants to give money to local churches or even to Republican theocrats , they may do so .
Of course , that is not to say that we consumers are powerless to do anything about it .
As private citizens , we may express our dissatisfaction with such practices .
If that is n't sufficient , we can organize protests and even picket .
Another potent tool consumers have at their disposal is simply shopping elsewhere .
After driving past a large furniture store with which I previously had a positive association and observing quotes from the Christian bible on their massive reader board , I decided to go elsewhere .
Such is my right as a consumer .
If I want to , I can follow up with a letter to inform the store that they lost my business and why .
Should I feel strongly enough , I could inform others and even promote a boycott of the store .
Although I have no plans to do so , it is nice to know that I could .
In this case , I am satisfied with taking my business elsewhere .
As atheists , I 'm not sure we do this enough .
Christmas music at the grocery store annoy you ?
Find another store and let the manager of the previous store know why you wo n't be coming back .
Find out that a company you like regularly contributes large sums to a political cause you oppose ?
Take your money elsewhere , and tell others about the donations you 've uncovered .
I 'm not saying this will lead to massive changes overnight , but at least we wo n't be contributing to the problem .
There are plenty of things to despise about our consumer culture , but failing to use our power as consumers to bring about positive change is on us .
While the politicos in D.C. navel gaze and ponder how to win their next election , Rome is burning .
You see , the markets do n't care about your Senate seat or whether the " fat cats " are going to get bailed out .
What matters right now is that the credit markets are at a standstill .
People can't borrow and businesses around the globe that rely on the short - term liquidity of the credit markets are being badly hurt .
We wo n't hear about the brilliant entrepreneur denied her small business loan , but how about McDonald 's ( NYSE : MCD ) franchises being denied credit to build new coffee bars , or General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) needing to raise billions just to cover basic operating expenses ?
Retailers like Home Depot ( NYSE:HD ) are closing stores , and apparel retailers like Macy 's ( NYSE : M ) face their toughest holiday season in years .
And airlines like Southwest ( NYSE : LUV ) and American Airlines parent AMR ( NYSE : AMR ) are cutting flights .
Sure , you still see advertisements for mortgage loans , but have you tried to get one ?
A colleague of mine with an excellent credit rating made the attempt and was quoted 11 % for a 30 - year fixed mortgage with a 20 % down payment .
That 's the equivalent of the " open " sign being left on , but the doors being locked .
A survey conducted by The Association for Financial Professionals of many large - company finance executives found that the locked - up credit market has already caused them to stop hiring and to cease capital spending projects .
The media is n't focusing on that so much ( and shame on them ) .
They 'd rather focus the attention on raw - meat issues like limiting CEO compensation .
As if that matters right now .
T-E - D
Fool , meet TED -- Ted Spread , to be specific .
The TED Spread is the difference in rates between the interest rate paid on three - month U.S. Treasury Bills ( the " T " ) , widely considered the most secure of all investments , and the three - month Eurodollars ( the " ED " ) contract , represented by the London Interbank Offering Rate , or LIBOR .
( Eurodollars are , quite simply , U.S. dollar - denominated deposits held at banks outside of the United States . )
The spread is a measure of the credit risk that the market perceives in the general U.S. economy .
It measures the rate of return the banks are requiring over the risk - free Treasury Bill rate to lend to other banks .
It shows the level of concern banks have that other banks are going to default .
It is , if you will , one of the purest measures of the perception that banks are going to fail -- kind of a measure of our economic blood pressure .
When the economy is strong , the TED spread is quite low .
But when the economy weakens in systemic ways , it can skyrocket as banks choose to sock their assets away in Treasuries rather than take a chance that another bank will default .
Call the TED spread an indicator of the risk of an economic heart attack .
Historically , the TED Spread has been around 0.5 % .
Just prior to the past two recessions , 2001 - 2002 and 1990 - 1991 , the spread exploded to around 1.25 % .
When the Paulson financial recapitalization plan failed to pass the House of Representatives yesterday , the TED spread shot up to an all time high of 3.5 % .
If the economy were a medical drama , doctors would be running around shouting " Push 500 mls of ( insert drug name here ) , stat ! "
Keep in mind that the raised TED Spread is a sign of the perception of credit risk .
It does n't mean that the credit market is seizing up .
It means that those who are in the best position to know think that the chances of default are much higher , and that they demand compensation from other banks in the form of a much higher interest rate as a result .
That is expensive , and it means that some banks might reasonably refuse to cash checks drawn on other banks .
If things get much worse , $ 700 billion will look like a bargain .
Here 's a solution for our elected officials :
Put a provision in the bill that ups the FDIC insurance limit from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 .
Restoring customers ' confidence in their deposits reduces the risk of withdrawals that sealed the fate of Washington Mutual ( NYSE : WM ) , thus making banks feel more comfortable lending to each other .
That 'd pass in a heartbeat , and it'd likely quell the anger of their constituents .
A naked man found wedged in the chimney of a supermarket in Wigan has been arrested on suspicion of burglary .
Police officers discovered him trapped in a chimney breast of a Tesco Express store on Ormskirk Road , Pemberton .
Firefighters were called to rescue the man who had become trapped in the chimney as he tried to get out .
Police said that because the man was naked he was taken to hospital as a precaution but was treated and discharged before being arrested .
A GMP spokeswoman said : " It is believed some of his clothes came off as a result of him struggling to get out of the chimney . "
A 22 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and remains in police custody .
Prostitute at sixteen years in Switzerland and it ’s legal !
Reading Le Matin
Bleu the other day made me feel blue .
That ’s ok because a moment later I started seeing red and heated up a bit .
Why ?
The story of the day was the fact that in the whorehouses of Zurich girls as young as sixteen are being offered to clients .
What is more upsetting is the fact that it is legal .
In Switzerland the legal age of sexual maturity is fixed at sixteen .
Therefore , it is legal for a girl ( yes , girl ) of sixteen to prostitute her body .
I find this very upsetting .
What is more upsetting is that there is an important glitch in all of this legality .
Le Matin online reports :
Remarque de spécialiste : la loi suisse qui n’interdit pas la prostitution des mineurs semble en contradiction avec les conventions internationales signées par notre pays : « La convention 182 [ de l'Organisation internationale du Travail ] interdit justement la prostitution des mineurs » .
Basic translation : The Swiss law does not forbid the prostitution of minors .
However , it is in contradiction with International Labor Conventions signed by Switzerland .
The Convention 182 ( Convention concerning the prohibition and immediate action for the elimination of the worst forms of child labour , Geneva , June 17 , 1999 ) forbids the prostitution of minors .
I think that the prostitution of minors should be legally stopped and it should be done immediately .
I can not for the life of me understand why the Swiss allow such a horrible thing to happen in what I ( and the world ) thought of as a modern and intelligent country .
The prostitution of minors is n’t a modern or progressive way of thinking .
It is not intelligent .
Even more to the point it is not moral even if it is legal by Swiss law .
Should n’t the laws of a country protect the children of that country ?
THE COMPANY THAT HE KEEPS ….
Here ’s John McCain ’s latest line of attack : “ Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever befriended an unrepentant terrorist , or had a convicted felon help them buy their house . ”
Substantively , this is ridiculous , of course , but everyone , everywhere , knew this was coming .
We can , however , take this a step further .
Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever befriended a convicted felon who advised his supporters on how best to shoot federal officials in the head .
John McCain has .
Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever used the money of a convicted criminal to help them buy their house .
John McCain has .
Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever befriended a radical televangelist who has lashed out at the Roman Catholic Church , calling it , among other things , “ the great whore ” and “ a false cult system . ” John McCain has .
Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever sought economic advice from a far - right former lawmaker who “ has diminished American solvency and power beyond the wildest dreams of anti-American terrorists . ”
John McCain has .
Americans need to ask themselves if they ’ve ever befriended a radical televangelist who blamed the attacks of Sept. 11 on Americans .
John McCain has .
My point is n’t that the presidential campaign should be based on who the candidates have met ; my point is that we could probably play this foolish game all day long .
And on balance , McCain ’s ties to a pretty motley crew are far more direct and meaningful than Obama’s .
So maybe we can just skip it and debate substance for the next month ?
Rezko ?
Keating .
Ayers ?
Liddy .
Wright ?
Hagee .
Hell , we ’ve barely started to talk about some of the high - priced lobbyists on McCain ’s campaign staff and their controversial client lists .
This is what McCain and his cronies want to spend the last 29 days of the campaign debating , because to them , anything beats talking about the economy .
How very sad .
The Republican strategy of making the rest of the campaign about Bill Ayers and Tony Rezko is very tiresome , painfully unnecessary , and as Ezra explained last night , probably self - defeating .
Just what every passionate Christian ever wanted .
The Prayer Booth could be just as big as the phone booth was before cell - phones hit the market .
Think about it , there ’s hardly a time when any Christian does n’t feel like asking God for a favor , or thanking him for something , but we ca n’t just drop to our knees in the middle of the street , put our hands together and start talking to the Man upstairs .
The Prayer Booth is the perfect solution to the problem , put down your bags , enter the booth , follow the clever instructions and you ’re done .
Still , you probably wo n’t see a Prayer Booth in your neighborhood anytime soon .

NEW DELHI : Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 's initiative to establish eight new Indian Institutes of Technology ( IITs ) has drawn flak from his own scientific adviser CNR Rao , who said on Friday that the opening of so many new IITs is a “ disaster ” .
“ Opening so may IITs in one year is a disaster .
I had no idea that so many IITs have already come up in our country , ” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event at the Federation of Indian Cambers of Commerce and Industry ( FICCI ) .
Six new IITs - in Orissa , Bihar , Rajasthan , Punjab and Andhra Pradesh - have started operations from the current academic session .
India now has 13 IITs .
“ This is not a play .
To open IITs , you need proper planning .
There are makeshift campuses and some are even attending classes in old IITs , ” said the renowned scientist .
“ I came to know about this development after the institutes admitted students .
This is sad and I have told the prime minister and even the human resource development minister ( Arjun Singh ) about this .
I am dissatisfied with the developments , ” said Rao , a visiting professor at Cambridge University .
IITs are premier engineering colleges of the country .
Manmohan Singh has already announced that India will have eight new IITs , including the six opened this year , to boost engineering and technology education .
Heroes
Heroes has lost two of its own - from behind the scenes .
Co-executive producers and writers Jesse Alexander and Jeph Loeb , who have been with the show since its 2006 inception , were fired due to creative differences , Variety reports .
NBC brass is reportedly unhappy with the series ' direction ( lest we forget , this is the season of " Villains " ) and the frequent overruns on Heroes ' already large $ 4 million - per- episode budget .
The double axing is the latest blow to the once white - hot drama as it finds itself struggling with tepid ratings and fielding grievances from critics and fans alike this season .
Alexander and Loeb were the right - hand men to creator / executive producer Tim Kring .
It is unknown if they will be replaced .
What do you think of this major shakeup ?
Is it all downhill from here for the show , or can it start anew ?

Canada 's prime minister calls early election Associated Press
Published : Sunday September 7 , 2008
Print This Email This TORONTO  Canada 's prime minister dissolved Parliament on Sunday and called an early election next month in hopes of strengthening his Conservative minority government 's hold on power .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's party must win an additional 28 seats in the Oct. 14 election to gain a majority in Parliament .
The Conservatives unseated the Liberal Party in 2006 after nearly 13 years in power , but as a minority government the Conservatives have been forced to rely on opposition lawmakers to pass legislation and adopt budgets .
Analysts believe the Conservatives will have a better shot of winning than if they waited until being forced into an election by the opposition with a confidence vote when the Canadian economy might be worse off .
On Sunday , Harper visited Governor General Michaelle Jean and asked her to dissolve Parliament .
The governor general is the representative of Britain 's Queen Elizabeth II , who is Canada 's head of state , but the position is purely ceremonial and obeys the wishes of the prime minister .
" Between now and Oct. 14 , Canadians will choose a government to look out for their interests at a time of global economic trouble , " Harper said after the meeting .
" They will choose between direction or uncertainty , between common sense or risky experiments , between steadiness or recklessness . "
Harper has said he is running on economic issues and stresses his opposition to an energy tax proposed by the Liberals .
But Robert Bothwell , director of the international relations program at the University of Toronto argued the move was political .
" Harper is going for a majority government .
That 's really the only issue , " he said .
Observers also say Harper wanted a ballot ahead of the U.S. election .
Bothwell said if Democrat Barack Obama surges in the next month in the United States , it will help Canada 's opposition Liberal party .
" It will be bad for Harper .
Canadian politics do n't exactly mirror those of the United States but if something happens in the United States it will find an echo in Canada , " Bothwell said .
The vote will be Canada 's third national ballot in four years .
Electoral legislation that Harper helped enact after he came to power in 2006 fixed the date for the next election in October 2009 , but a loophole allows the prime minister to ask the governor general to dissolve Parliament .
The Conservatives now fill 127 of the 308 seats in Parliament .
The Liberals have 95 , Bloc Quebecois 48 , the New Democrats 30 and the Greens have one seat .
Three seats are held by independents , and four are vacant .
Since becoming prime minister , Harper has extended Canada 's military mission in Afghanistan .
Canada has lost 96 soldiers and as the death toll approaches 100 the mission could become an issue in the campaign .
Harper also pulled Canada out of the Kyoto Protocol , which commits industrialized nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
Liberal leader Stephane Dion , a former environment minister who named his dog Kyoto , wants to increase taxes on greenhouse gas emitters .
“ And they ’re asking for another 11 percent increase next year and the next , and that ’s where I ’m saying I just do n’t know how , ” Fawzia Keval , the school ’s principal , said .
“ I ’m spending sleepless nights . ”
Across the nation , far more schools failed to meet the federal law ’s testing targets than in any previous year , according to new state - by - state data .
And in California and some other states , the problem traces in part to the fact that officials chose to require only minimal gains in the first years after the law passed and then very rapid annual gains later .
One researcher likens it to the balloon payments that can sink homebuyers .
Part of the reason for the troubles was that the states gambled the law would have been softened when it came up for reauthorization in 2007 , but efforts to change it stalled .
This year Congress made no organized attempt to reconsider the law .
With the nation facing urgent challenges , including two wars and economic turmoil , it could be a year or more before the new president can work with Congress to rewrite the law .
The law requires every American school to bring all students to proficiency in reading and math by 2014 .
When it was first implemented six years ago , it required states to outline the statistical path they would follow on their way to 100 percent proficiency , and about half set low rates of achievement growth for the first few years and steeper rates thereafter .
Here in California , which in 2002 had only 13.6 percent of students proficient in reading , officials promised to raise that percentage on average by 2.2 points annually from 2002 to 2007 , but starting this year greatly accelerate the progress , raising the percentage of proficient students by 11 points per year through 2014 .
IN a scene from the fourth season of the HBO mob saga “ The Sopranos , ” the crime boss Tony Soprano gathers his crew chiefs together for a dressing - down .
The 2002 recession is in full swing , but that is no excuse , he tells them .
They are not earning enough for the family .
He asks his consigliere , Silvio Dante , to name the two industries that are known to be recession - proof .
“ Certain aspects of the entertainment business , ” Mr. Dante says .
“ And our thing . ”
With all due respect , Mr. Dante was wrong .
Some economists argue that no industry is really recession - proof , or at least it depends on the characteristics of a given recession .
Organized crime , in part because it meets much of the demand for vices , can be recession - resistant , as can “ certain aspects of the entertainment business . ”
But while the cable television business , for instance , has historically done well during downturns , the situation gets complicated when it comes to premium and pay - per- view services , as Gary Kim noted this week at TMCNet .
There are plenty of other industries , though , that have historically done well in recessions  particularly those that serve basic needs like food , energy and health care .
This , Daniel Gross wrote this week in Slate , explains why Wal - Mart is doing so well lately , while many other retailers are struggling .
“ In a pinched economy , consumers are embracing their inner skinflint , ” he wrote .
“ And Wal - Mart is a penny pincher ’s paradise . ”

I continue to be struck by the relevance of Henry Hazlitt 's Economics in One Lesson even though it was published over sixty years ago .
The Mises Institute 's new edition , with an introduction by Walter Block , will make Hazlitt 's insights accessible to a new generation of students and readers .
We have made much progress during the decades since Hazlitt first put pen to paper and applied Frederic Bastiat 's insights about " that which is seen , and that which is not seen " to a variety of issues .
Fortunately , the Soviet Union is no longer with us and the Berlin Wall has been a thing of the past for almost twenty years now .
However , billions of people the world over still live in abject poverty .
And poverty kills : many , especially children , will die of diseases that are easily treated in the developed world .
Hazlitt 's insights remain as relevant today as they were when the first edition of the book was published .
Hazlitt pulls no punches from the outset , reminding us that " Economics is haunted by more fallacies than any other study known to man . "
As we have seen , the human costs of these fallacies are massive .
" The Lesson " Hazlitt teaches is timeless .
If we are going to evaluate policies — whether they be policies enacted by governments , corporations , institutions , or individuals — we have to look at how those policies affect everyone , not just favored constituencies or select groups .
Consider , for example , the oft - repeated claim that natural disasters are good for a local economy .
It might very well be that income in an area where there was a hurricane might go up as a result of government transfers , insurance payments , and other redistributions , but these resources have to come from somewhere .
He explains this straightforward insight in his first few chapters by considering whether the world is a better place because a hoodlum smashes a window .
The glazier earns income , but society loses the services of the window .
Moreover , the glazier could have earned income in another line of work , and the resources used to replace the window could be used to create something else .
Destruction , whether it occurs because a vandal breaks a window , because a hurricane wrecks a major city , or because a waiter drops a load of dishes , makes us poorer .
Hazlitt applies this very simple ( and some would say obvious ) insight to less - apparent situations .
Consider , for example , the claim that a government can " create jobs " by subsidizing different projects or " protect jobs " by obstructing trade or technological advancement .
Hazlitt points out that " public works mean taxes " in chapter 4 , and " taxes discourage production " in chapter 5 .
Government employment programs can only create some jobs by destroying others , and government attempts to protect some jobs can only succeed if the government sacrifices other jobs .
In both cases , these interventions make us poorer .
Consider one of economists ' favorite examples , the government - financed sports arena .
Stadiums and arenas are very large , very visible projects that are usually intended to " revitalize " places , and the picking of the taxpayers ' pockets is usually justified on the basis of the alleged increases in employment and incomes that will result from the project .
However , a government cannot revitalize one area without devitalizing another , and to add insult to injury , the consensus among economists as I understand it is that government - financed arenas are net drags on a local economy .
If a stadium project genuinely created value , it would be profitable .
If the project were profitable , it would not need government subsidies .
Hazlitt takes on a similar idea when discussing government interventions designed to protect certain industries .
Tariffs on imports might make some people in some industries richer in the short run ; however , if we protect workers in industries where Americans do not have a comparative advantage ( some kinds of manufacturing , for example ) , their increases in employment and income only come at the expense of others ' employment and income .
By saving or protecting some industries , we are destroying or hurting others .
A classic example ( originally proposed by David Friedman ) suggests that there are two ways the United States can produce cars : we can build them in Detroit , or we can grow them in Iowa .
Imagine there were a machine that could convert corn into cars .
Then imagine we could get more corn and more cars if we grew only corn and used the machine instead of dividing our efforts among corn and cars .
Clearly , having the machine makes us richer .
Now imagine that this machine is called " Japan . "
That 's how trade works : it allows us to get more output using fewer inputs .
Some of Hazlitt 's most useful discussions concern the role of prices and of the system of profit and loss .
Profits and losses tell entrepreneurs whether they have created value or wasted resources , and market prices tell people what others are willing to give up to get an additional unit of a good or service .
If the market is left to its own devices , the price will be an accurate reflection of what something is worth at a given point in time .
When the government intervenes , it forces the prices to lie : the signals about the costs and benefits of different actions will be distorted .
The minimum wage , for example , creates unemployment by making it illegal to hire units of labor that are not productive enough to justify the minimum wage .
Similarly , rent control creates shortages by making it less attractive for investors to provide housing .
Economics in One Lesson presents a very simple explanation of important economic principles .
Given the popularity of many government interventions , it is a lesson we have n't fully learned yet .
With the publication of this new edition of Economics in One Lesson , the timeless truths elucidated by Henry Hazlitt will become that much easier to communicate .
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
Dungeons and Dragons adopted a Vancian magic system ( based on the novels of Jack Vance ) early on , wherein spellcasters must “ memorize ” a limited number of spells at the beginning of the day and , once used , that “ memorization ” leaves the character ’s mind .
Gary Gygax reportedly chose this system of magic for its tractability in game design — allowing dramatic power to be wielded by spellcasters without unleashing game balance destroying Wizards on the game — and because it did not much resemble any real - world occult belief system .
Unfortunately , that decision completely ignored another important factor in game design : suspension of disbelief .
There simply is n’t any reasonable way to explain the metaphysics of the traditional D&D system of magic — or , if there is , I have n’t come up with it in almost thirty years of thinking about it .
That ’s a crying shame , considering the basis of the system does n’t really have to be tweaked very much to come up with something that at least has a system that lends itself more easily to suspension of disbelief .
Dealing With It
I ’ve created a number of different alternate magic systems over the years , but there have also been many times when I ’ve just decided to try to ignore the absurdity of D&D ’s take on the Vancian magic system .
Glossing over the ludicrous , inexplicable workings of the magic system behind the scenes with metagaming “ I already used my last Protection from Evil spell ” comments between players , so that players know to not have their characters rely on the party Wizard without having to try to figure out how the characters would talk about this resource shortfall , becomes the standard way to handle such things .
Otherwise — what do you say ?
Does Magnar the Munificent say “ I already cast that spell , so I forgot it ” ?
Does the party ’s Fighter then ask “ Why the hell did n’t you do a better job of memorizing it ? ”
If I was the party ’s Fighter , and the party Wizard told me “ That ’s just the way magic works , ” I ’d be positive he was pulling my leg .
“ What ? ” I might say .
“ That does n’t make any damned sense . ”
Of course , some people might say “ It ’s magic .
It ca n’t make sense , by definition ! ”
That ’s kind of ludicrous , though , considering that a Wizard supposedly studies magic .
How does one study something that , by definition , does n’t make sense ?
There goes the whole notion of the Wizard class .
Instead , you just have to metagame the problem away — a suboptimal solution , to say the least .
So Much For Game Balance
Unfortunately , D&D 3E introduced the Sorcerer to the game .
Someone , somewhere , must have decided that the problem with Wizards had to be worked around , so that person came up with the Sorcerer class .
The Sorcerer has similar limits on spells cast per day , but does not need to “ memorize ” spells .
He or she can cast whatever spells he or she knows , up to the maximum number of spells .
The number of spells one can cast is still limited to an arbitrary number based on level progression , and divided between spell levels .
Thus , a fourth level Sorcerer can cast six cantrips today , plus six first - level spells , plus three second - level spells .
That reduces some of the bookkeeping of playing a spellcaster and makes the spellcaster a bit more flexible , but does n’t really solve the suspension of disbelief problem .
Wizards are still part of the game , too .
The existence of Sorcerers , unfortunately , makes Wizards effectively obsolete .
For general - purpose adventuring , Wizards are now entirely outclassed .
Some point to a greater “ flexibility ” in the fact that Wizards are n’t limited to a specific number of spells they can learn , but that flexibility pales beside the far more practical flexibility of being able to choose one ’s spells on the fly rather than trying to guess at the likelihood of needing Knock today .
Would you rather have five second - level spells than three of them , but only be able to choose two that you ’ll be able to cast today , or have two that you know and be able to cast them each several times , at will , without having to worry about making sure that being able to cast one of them three times today will stop you from being able to cast the other enough times if things go poorly ?
Worse , in order to get those five spells , the Wizard has to actually learn them — whereas a Sorcerer ’s newly known spells just appear , fully - formed , in his or her head .
Others claim that the fact Wizards can cast higher - level spells sooner than Sorcerers helps balance them out , but that ’s an even weaker argument .
Sure , a Wizard can cast fifth - level spells at ninth level , and a Sorcerer ca n’t — but he can only cast one a day , and it only goes up to two a day at tenth level .
Meanwhile , at tenth level , a Sorcerer can suddenly cast three fifth - level spells .
In other words , all this supposed advantage for Wizards means is that a Wizard has a slight advantage one level , and the Sorcerer then gets a staggering advantage the next — because the Sorcerer then gets to cast more of the highest - level spells both can cast in a given day , and more of the lower - level spells they can both cast , and does n’t have to plan out his or her day in advance due to the ability to cast whatever spell he or she likes as long as the Sorcerer still has spells of that level left to cast that day .
The real value of the Sorcerer class , it seems to me , is to provide an alternate set of game mechanics for arcane spellcasters .
I do n’t mean a set of mechanics in addition to those for the Wizard , but mechanics that can be used instead of those for the Wizard , if you feel so inclined .
Pick one or the other , and go with it — and ignore all the flavor text explaining how Wizards and Sorcerers are different .
If you include them both in a single game , you ’re just looking at a new way for Wizards to suck .
Adding insult to injury , the only way to make Wizards at all palatable power - wise is to make them specialists in a particular school of magic .
Unfortunately , doing so cuts away some of their already paltry “ flexibility ” , and it also turns them into one - trick ponies in a way they are n’t as generalists .
It ’s bad enough supposedly learned men like Wizards get the shaft on skill points .
Variant Rules That Make Sense
So . . . there are two different arcane magic systems I have developed in the last year or two that can be generally applicable to D&D and Pathfinder games .
One is meant to be a single option from among several different traditions of arcane magical study , though I have not developed the other options at all yet .
Alchemist
Alchemy is a set of mechanics I created for my Midian campaign , and is not really meant to entirely replace Wizards .
I conceived of this set of variant rules first , and it ’s meant to be part of a series of different Wizard types , with the generic from - the - book Wizards being replaced by a whole slew of different scholarly traditions of arcane magic .
I call this system Alchemy , in the older sense of the term — where magical power is related to the improvement of the very essence of a thing , or at least the transmutation of that essence .
Spellcasting is heavily ritualized in general , and there is no limit on how many times you may cast a spell you already know .
In fact , Alchemists in this system do not really “ know ” spells the same way generic Wizards from the book do ; instead , they have books with complex rituals described in them in some detail , and there are general principles that can be used even to develop new rituals on the spot .
The way it works , basically , is that you can :
spend a bunch of time setting up a ritual and executing it to “ cast ” a “ spell ” ; this involves inscribing a mystic circle , setting out candles or stones or some other crap , sprinkling stuff , intoning invokations , and so on do something similar , but slightly abbreviated and modified , to “ charge ” a later spellcasting ; then , later in the day , you complete the ritual by performing some predetermined triggering action to release the magical energies that have been “ charged ” , producing the desired spell effect
The second option is an effective means of making the Vancian style of spellcasting somewhat more believable than as presented in the PHB .
The first is a necessary component of a magic system that supports the in - game justification for the second , and it also provides Alchemists with a slight boost in flexibility of their power ( especially with the capability of modifying alchemical ritual practices at the time they ’re set up ) so that they can be brought up to par somewhat with Sorcerers .
In addition , the available power levels of spells / rituals is slightly improved , to help balance things out further — and Alchemists get more than 2 + INT Modifier skills per level , because they ’re meant to be highly educated scholars , and because Wizards having only 2 + INT Modifier per level sucks .
Rituals that have been set up with a trigger to be completed at a later time last until you cast them or until you sleep , whichever comes first .
A conscious mind is required to maintain such triggered effects in place , ready to be used .
There is no theoretical limit to how many such triggered effects can be set up , though each one takes time ( less time the higher the character ’s experience level ) , thus placing a practical limit on how many can be charged up before the character must sleep again .
For races that do not sleep per se , some other rejuvenating event takes the place of sleep as a means of blanking the slate so that characters cannot simply spend months at a time banking hundreds of spell effects for use in a single encounter .
In some cases , it might even make sense to simply prohibit a certain race from employing alchemical magic in this manner .
Since I have yet to have a single non-Sorcerer spellcaster show up in person in my Midian campaign with the PCs around seventh level , there ’s little need to develop the several different scholarly arcane traditions any time soon .
The only reason Alchemy has gotten any significant attention , in fact , is the fact that I started writing fiction set in the Midian gameworld a year ago , and some of the characters are Alchemists .
I do n’t have the Alchemy system fleshed out fully .
It ’ll be a fair bit of work to get it fleshed out so much , since developing it completely will involve a lot of boring minutiae like coming up with custom “ spell ” lists for the various alchemical rituals and a set of categorical principles of Alchemy from which new rituals may be developed — and I have to make the existing rituals and the categorical principles match .
In other words , it is n’t done yet , but it will be .
Mage
The Mage class was developed just this last weekend .
Unlike the system involving Alchemy , et al. , this is just a single - class replacement for the Wizard class .
In fact , it ’s really just the Wizard class with some changes in how spell progression , casting , and memorization works .
It even uses exactly the same spell lists as the Wizard class .
It is not meant to coexist with the Alchemist and other , related arcane spellcasting traditions at which I hinted above .
With this system , spellcasting draws upon the inner reserves of the spellcaster , essentially in the form of physical damage ( hit points ) .
When casting a spell , a save is made , and if the player fails his or her character ’s save , the character takes a number of points of damage equal to the spell ’s level ( or “ magnitude ” , as I renamed it for this system ) .
That ’s not the preferred means of spellcasting , however .
In addition to the above , the Mage can also prepare spells .
A total number of spell magnitudes determined by the character ’s level can be prepared at any one time .
A prepared spell can be cast as long as it stays prepared , as a standard action ( or different action type as appropriate to a particular spell , in nonstandard cases ) , without wiping itself from “ memory ” ( since this is n’t a matter of memorization ) .
Each time it is cast , however , a save must be made to determine whether the preparation fails , at which point one can no longer cast that spell except as described above for spells that have not been prepared in advance — complete with the danger of taking damage .
There are other details to the system , including a spell “ mastery ” mechanic that I wo n’t go into at this time .
I ’ll post details for the magic system used for this alternate class at a later date .
The point is that , unlike the Wizard from the PHB , this variant class is actually functionally balanced with the Sorcerer class , and allows one to play a Wizard - like scholarly spellcaster class that can compete with Sorcerers on equal footing thanks to a completely different set of advantages .
Details Forthcoming
I plan to provide details of how these two alternate arcane spellcaster classes work , in terms of game mechanics , at a later date — and under the terms of the OGL .
The Mage will appear first , as the essential differences from Wizards for D&D 3.5 are already worked out in some detail .
It just needs to be polished up a bit with explanatory text and maybe some flavor text ( a matter of a few minutes ’ work ) and provided with some additional material for integrating with the Pathfinder RPG rules , since Wizards are somewhat modified there .
The Alchemist will have to come later — much later — because it is nowhere near finished being specced out at this time .
I have enough done to write fiction about the class , but not nearly enough to make and play an Alchemist character in an actual game , regardless of whether the game is D&D 3.5 or Pathfinder RPG .
I will , of course , make sure that as I get them posted , I have links to them from here .
If the links do not appear near this paragraph in particular , they will appear in comments as “ pingbacks ” .

The Australian government has given the green light to a plan to establish one of the world ’s largest electric car recharging infrastructures , powered entirely by renewable energy .
The A$ 1 billion ( $ 676 million ) project could see the establishment of as many as two million recharging points , as well as more than 500 battery swap stations , where drivers can exchange depleted batteries without the need to wait for a recharge .
Australian utility AGL Energy has committed itself to supply enough energy from renewable sources to power all cars using the system .
Responsibility for building the charging points goes to Shai Agassi ’s Project Better Place , with financial backing from Macquarie Capital Group .
Project Better Place have a track record of setting up EV recharging systems , and are currently working on large - scale projects in Israel and Denmark .
Agassi says that the Australian system will be around five times bigger than the Israeli one , where the company is already building 350,000 to 500,000 recharging points and teaming up with Renault - Nissan to supply electric cars .
One of the chief reasons for deciding upon Australia was an A$ 500 m green car innovation fund , as well as strong backing from the Victoria state government .
The work is scheduled for completion in 2012 , by which time the consortium will have built EV charging stations across the densely populated east coast , as well as Perth in Western Australia .

Arizona State University , anticipating at least $ 25 million in budget cuts this fiscal year  on top of the $ 30 million already cut  is ending its contracts with as many as 200 adjunct instructors .
Boston University , Cornell and Brown have announced selective hiring freezes .
And Tufts University , which for the last two years has , proudly , been one of the few colleges in the nation that could afford to be need - blind  that is , to admit the best - qualified applicants and meet their full financial need  may not be able to maintain that generosity for next year ’s incoming class .
This fall , Tufts suspended new capital projects and budgeted more for financial aid .
But with the market downturn , and the likelihood that more applicants will need bigger aid packages , need - blind admissions may go by the wayside .
“ The target of being need - blind is our highest priority , ” said Lawrence S. Bacow , president of Tufts .
“ But with what ’s happening in the larger economy , we expect that the incoming class is going to be needier .
That ’s the real uncertainty . ”
Tough economic times have come to public and private universities alike , and rich or poor , they are figuring out how to respond .
Many are announcing hiring freezes , postponing construction projects or putting off planned capital campaigns .
The GNOME Foundation announced today that Google and Motorola have joined the organization 's advisory board and will sponsor ongoing development of the open source desktop environment .
The foundation says that the new funding will be used to facilitate usability studies and improvements to localization and accessibility .
The advisory board has no direct authority over the GNOME project , but it provides guidance to the foundation 's elected board of directors .
The advisory board consists of non-profit organizations that are invited to join at no cost as well as corporations that make an annual financial contribution of $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 depending on the size of the company .
The current lineup of corporate members includes Canonical , Novell , Red Hat , IBM , HP , Intel , Imendio , ACCESS , and several others .
Google is a major investor in open source software and also sponsors the efforts of the Linux Foundation and other similar groups .
Google has already funded a lot of GNOME development through its annual Summer of Code program and uses the GNOME desktop environment internally on Ubuntu workstations .
In a statement issued today , Google 's Chris DiBona said that the search giant is " pleased to continue our collaboration with the GNOME Foundation through our membership on the Foundation 's Advisory Board . "
Motorola uses the GNOME mobile technologies in its Linux - based MOTOMAGX platform which is LiMo - compatible and ships on a variety of handsets .
" For mobile Linux , Motorola believes in open standards and open source technologies , " said Motorola software platforms vice president Christy Wyatt in a statement .
" The Gnome Foundation allows us to expand our reach to the vibrant Gnome communities and be active in projects that we currently utilize from the Gnome stack , SQLite , gStreamer , and Bluez to name a few . "
Oddly enough , Motorola 's decision to join the GNOME Foundation follows shortly after news that the handset maker is shifting its focus to Android , which uses a Java - base middleware stack and does n't leverage any components of the GNOME Mobile platform .
Motorola 's decision to join the GNOME Foundation could be a sign that Motorola 's commitment to MOTOMAGX is n't going to be entirely abandoned as the company experiments with Android .
The GNOME project is gaining a lot of momentum , especially in the mobile space .
Various technologies associated with GNOME are used in Maemo , ALP , MOTOMAGX , Moblin , Ubuntu Mobile , and OLPC's Sugar environment .
The addition of Google and Motorola to the lineup of GNOME supporters is further evidence that Linux is making headway on the desktop and on handheld devices .
Go ahead , Met fans – make their day .
Sluggers David Wright and Carlos Delgado are two of the city ’s newest young guns – both were granted pistol permits over the last year .
Wright ’s permit allows him to keep a handgun at his $ 6 million Flatiron District penthouse .
The Met third baseman , a 25 - year - old Virginia native , is no stranger to pistols ; his father is a police chief .
First baseman Delgado , 36 , applied for a permit to carry a gun – which was denied – but was granted permission to keep one in his Upper East Side apartment , according to a source familiar with the process .
Former Met Shawn Green , 35 , also applied for a carry permit last year , but was denied , the source said .
Wright and Delgado , whose team has enraged and disappointed fans two years in a row with late - season collapses , are among some 36,000 people with gun permits in the Big Apple – a list that includes celebrities , billionaires and politicians .
The number of permits has dropped to 35,210 , following a downward trend since 2003 , when there were 41,173 active license holders , according to the NYPD , which issues the permits .
“ The process can be intimidating and grueling .
It may take up to 18 months , ” said Manhattan lawyer John Chambers , who has specialized in gun licenses for 20 years .
“ And New York is probably one of the most difficult cities in which to get a concealed - carry license . ”
It costs $ 340 to file a permit application , and there ’s a $ 94.25 fingerprinting fee .
Among those permitted to carry guns are Robert De Niro , artificial - heart inventor Robert Jarvik , Donald Trump and billionaire supermarket king John Catsimatidis .
To qualify for carry permits , applicants must show documented threats against them or prove that they routinely transport cash or valuables in business .
Carrying a firearm without a permit is a felony punishable by more than a year in prison .
Permit holders must get them renewed every three years .
Gristedes grocery mogul Catsimatidis , who mulled an election run against anti-gun Mayor Bloomberg , has held a license for nearly 30 years , said spokesman Rob Ryan .
“ He got it back then for the obvious reasons , ” Ryan said .
“ New York was a very different place back then .
If the business lost a day ’s worth of receipts , it could drive him out of business . ”
Permit holder Alexis Stewart , daughter of homemaking queen and ex-convict Martha Stewart , told The Post that she applied for a gun license after 9/11 .
She said she got a gun , now kept in a lockbox in her $ 3 million TriBeCa apartment , to euthanize her elderly dogs in the event that another calamity struck and forced her to abandon them .

On Friday afternoon , just at the time of the week when people unveil unhappy news releases in order to minimize media coverage , the McCain - Palin campaign released Sarah and Todd Palin 's federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 .
The returns do not include as taxable income any of the per diem allowances or travel expense reimbursements that the State of Alaska paid for travel by Sarah or Todd Palin , or by three of their children ( Bristol , Willow , and Piper Palin ) , in 2007 .
At roughly the same time as it released the returns , the campaign also handed out an opinion from a Washington , D.C. tax lawyer that purports to address at least some aspects of the propriety of the omission of the travel money from the 2007 tax return .
Since then , one commentator has reported that there is now a " wonky debate " as to the correctness of their omitting the travel money from their tax returns .
We disagree .
There is no serious debate ( at least , none that has been brought to our attention ) about the fact that at least the amounts paid for the children 's travel -- $ 24,728.83 in 2007 , according to the Washington Post -- are taxable .
The campaign 's tax lawyer has got at least that much of the law , and perhaps more , wrong .
The opinion is from Roger M. Olsen , an M Street solo practitioner who was a tax official in the Reagan administration .
His specialty appears to be the criminal side of the federal tax laws .
Olsen 's three - page letter never comes out and directly says " It 's my opinion that the travel payments the Palins received were not taxable to any of them . "
1 Instead , it bobs and weaves a fair amount and never lands squarely on point :
Unless employees have reason to know that the W - 2 is incorrect , the IRS expects employees to rely on the employer 's W - 2 as prepared & filed with the IRS , as Governor Palin did .
The income tax aspects of fringe benefits are complex and highly technical , and not subject to second - guessing by laymen .
The State of Alaska is confident that its position is correct .
Its employees were entitled to rely on that determination .
So was Governor Palin .
Finally , under State law , the spouse of the Governor ( or other family members on occasion ) is entitled to payment of travel costs by the state when conducting official State business .
I find no reason or rule of law that would lead me to a different conclusion as to his receipt of such State payments .
Such payments for family members traveling on state business would not properly be included as taxable income on Governor Palin 's federal tax returns .
Let 's take the two paragraphs in order .
The first one never actually says the payments were n't taxable income .
It says that the Palins were " entitled to rely " on what the state did and did n't include on the W - 2 .
What is that supposed to mean ?
If Olsen is saying that the federal tax consequences of payments from one 's employer are conclusively determined by one 's employer 's treatment of the payments on the W - 2 , that 's just flat - out wrong .
Granted , the employer 's omission of the payments might help the employee defend against any civil or criminal penalties that might be asserted , but no one with any credibility has suggested that the Palins have committed any fraud or behaved negligently .
( The " tax cheat " headlines pouring out of the blogosphere over the last day or so are idiotic . )
The Palins , who had their tax returns done by HR Block , simply got it wrong .
And the fact that the state payroll office got it wrong , too , does n't erase the Palins ' unpaid tax liability .
On to the second paragraph just quoted .
After one totally irrelevant sentence about state law , and another sentence referring back to the baffling first paragraph , Olsen finally does say -- or comes close to saying -- that the amounts the Palins received for travel were not taxable ( not to Governor Palin , anyway ) .
But here , there is no doubt that he 's at least partly wrong .
There is no question whatsoever that the payments for the Palin children 's travel -- $ 24,728.83 -- were indeed taxable to Governor Palin .
The money paid for Todd Palin 's travel -- $ 18,761.37 -- might possibly turn out to be tax - free , but it would be quite a stretch .
And the per diems and other travel payments to the governor herself ( $ 16,951 ) may or may not be taxable , but certainly not because state law or the state payroll office says so .
The children 's travel payments are clearly taxable income .
In our earlier post on this back on September 10 , we theorized that Section 274 ( m ) ( 3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code required that the payments be reported as income .
Just yesterday , Bryan Camp , a tax professor at Texas Tech Law School , uncovered an obscure regulation 2 ( at least , it was obscure to us ) that renders Section 274 ( m ) ( 3 ) inapplicable to the Palins ' situation .
But that regulation puts them back under the tax regime for deductions for business travel under older law ( pre-1986 ) , 3 and under that older set of rules , there is still no way they can exclude the payments for the children .
The Palins , living as they do in Alaska , are governed by Ninth Circuit law .
The key case on deductibility of family travel expenses in this circuit is Stratton v. Commissioner , decided in 1971 .
In Stratton , a State Department foreign service officer 's own travel expenses were ruled deductible , but his wife and children 's travel expenses were held to be nondeductible .
The court of appeals declared , in a passage that would seem quite applicable to the Palin children , if not also to Todd Palin :
Mrs. Stratton and the children are not employed by the Department .
There is no mandatory requirement either by statute or regulation , that they accompany the employee on home leave .
The reason that the family customarily does accompany the employee is no doubt due in large measure to the fact that the Secretary of State is authorized to pay their travel expenses to and from this country .
22 U.S.C. Sec. 1136 ( 1964 ) .
However , the fact that these expenses are so paid does not clearly indicate that the Department , as a matter of policy , or that Congress in adopting Sec. 1136 , felt that the family 's reorientation to the American way of life was necessary to the conduct of Stratton 's trade or business as a foreign service officer .
At best , it represents an accommodation by the Department to enable the family to fulfill its personal needs in reacquainting itself with the homeland at the same time that the employee is renewing his knowledge for business reasons .
Finally , the asserted " public relations " duties of Mrs. Stratton are unspecified and , without further support in the record , must be considered to be incidental to her husband 's business within the meaning of [ the regulations ] .
4
The Palin children cannot be performing more than incidental services for the state -- if they provide any at all .
Under Stratton , then , there is no " business purpose " for their travelling between Juneau and Wasilla , and thus their travel payments are taxable .
Which brings us to Todd Palin , the state 's " First Dude . "
Could his travel meet the test of the regulations ?
They state ( pardon the sexist language -- they 're old regulations ) :
Where a taxpayer 's wife accompanies him on a business trip , expenses attributable to her travel are not deductible unless it can be adequately shown that the wife 's presence on the trip has a bona fide business purpose .
The wife 's performance of some incidental service does not cause her expenses to qualify as deductible business expenses .
The same rules apply to any other members of the taxpayer 's family who accompany him on such a trip .
And the Stratton case makes clear that the spousal services must assist the employee spouse 's business of being an employee , not the employer 's overall business .
Can whatever Todd Palin does for the State of Alaska as an unpaid volunteer meet this test ?
Can he even make that claim with a straight face ?
As for Governor Palin herself , questions have been raised as to how she could be " away from home " for tax purposes -- that is , away from her principal place of business -- when she was in Wasilla .
Olsen 's opinion baldly states that her " tax home " was Juneau , the state capital , but that is hard to square with the fact that the governor spent the majority of her time in Wasilla and in Anchorage , where she works at a state office building .
If Olsen is wrong and Anchorage was her " tax home , " reimbursements for time spent in Anchorage and vicinity would appear to be taxable .
Even if Juneau is her " tax home , " there is also the real possibility that her frequent trips between Juneau and Wasilla are simply long - distance commuting , which is a completely nondeductible , personal expense .
In that case , all allowances and reimbursements for gubernatorial travel between the two cities would be taxable .
5
There is more to brood about on the Palins ' returns , to be sure .
Last year Todd Palin claimed losses from his snowmobile racing " business " as a tax shelter against his fishing income .
He also claimed deductions for use of a portion of the Palins ' residence in his fishing business -- deductions that are difficult to claim legitimately , and which may be further complicated if , as reported , the state reimbursed the Palins for use of that home as a travel allowance .
But leaving all of that aside , the Palins should have reported as taxable income , at the very least , the $ 24,728.83 of travel reimbursements for the children .
That income would have been taxable to them at somewhere between 25 and 28 percent , and so they are in the hole to the government for more than $ 6,000 , plus interest since at least April 15 at the rate of between 5 and 6 percent a year .
They should file an amended return and pay the resulting tax and the interest .
And if somebody at the IRS took a good , hard look at the payments for Sarah and Todd , we would bet that there would be some additional tax due there as well .
UPDATE , 10/6 , 3:26 a.m. :
An important fact has emerged that makes what first appeared to be an honest mistake by the Palins into a potentially more serious matter .
It now appears that State of Alaska finance officials did not follow their own official policy on tax reporting and withholding on long - term per diems in the case of Governor Palin 's per diems .
We have details here .
UPDATE , 10/8 , 3:08 a.m. :
It has come to our attention that the dollar figures in the Washington Post story covered a 19 - month period , not just 2007 .
Regardless , much of the money was paid during that year , none of it was reported , and most of it should have been .
The state should have withheld income tax on it and reported it on the governor 's W - 2 -- and should be doing so now .

What happens when you take a really skanky sex story and dress it up in a lot of flowery words ?
You get the Bible .
Or large chunks of it , anyway .
Sure , rather than using phrases such as " reverse frog squat , " or " slinging manjam , " Biblical sex is referenced almost exclusively as " coming in unto " ( a phrase still used by porn stars who tend to drop the " in unto " ) .
But once you get past the unimaginative verbs , the Bible has some nasty , nasty stories .
Such as : Advertisement

Speaking of people who might want to steer clear of drinking games , the Bible seems to blame the whole thing on booze , a strategy you 'll recognize from work the morning after karaoke night .
The alcohol in this case is wine , which raises the question : how much wine do you have to drink before you became oblivious to the fact that you were having sex with your daughter ... a second time ?
So , you do n't want to nationalize all the bad banks , and neither does Megan McCardle .
After all , America is not Sweden , we 're heterogeneous and fractious and really gosh - darn big .
American politics are nasty , brutish , and interminable — no way to run a lemonade stand let alone a bank .
Okay .
Unfortunately , the private sector approach to reorganizing and recapitalizing banks , forced debt - to - equity conversions , is too harsh on creditors .
Yes , it is the free - market solution , and it's what we normally do ( via the bankruptcy process ) when firms are viable but undercapitalized .
But , we are afraid of hurting lenders at a moment where credit markets are wobbly and a strike by lenders could be catastrophic .
Okay .
Maybe these are two great tastes that taste great together .
What if both the state and junior creditors could took equity stakes in reorganized firms , fifty - fifty .
The former creditors would run the place without government interference , isolating management from politics and diminishing concerns of creeping socialism .
Taxpayers would enjoy the upside as passive investors in ordinary , profit - maximizing businesses , and would buy shares at a bargain price ( book value after very aggressive write - downs have been taken ) .
Some creditors would still have to endure the indignity of being converted to equity , but the amount of debt that would have to convert would be cut in half ( approximately ) , giving converted debtors a lot of capitalization bang for their buck .
Junior creditors would go from owning very dodgy debt to relatively safe shares , and more senior creditors would see the value of their positions spike and stabilize as solvency concerns abate .
Here 's how this would work :
Regulators would go over bank balance sheets , and come up with a very conservative account of their assets .
Nothing would be carried at more than market , in - quantity bids .
That 's a fire sale price ?
Too bad .
There 's no market bid at all ?
That 's a zero then .
Any bank that is undercapitalized on this basis , that is beneath the regulatory thresholds for an adequately capitalized bank , is insolvent .
Equityholders , common and preferred , are wiped out .
Sorry , Charlie .
You levered up , you bought crap , you lost .
That 's how it goes .
I love the smell of capitalism in the morning .
We choose a " well capitalized " leverage ratio , and that will tell us how much debt we 'll need to convert to equity .
Here are the formulas , if I 've got my algebra right : government_equity = converted_equity =
( total_assets / ( 2 * target_leverage - 1 ) )
reqired_conversion = converted_equity - old_book_equity ... where old_book_equity is the book value ( a negative number ) of the now wiped old equity .
We define two classes of stock , one voting and one nonvoting but convertible to the voting shares , each with a par value of $ 1 .
The government puchases its share , by purchasing government_equity shares of the nonvoting stock at par .
The government is forbidden from exercising the conversion option .
The required amount of debt is converted to converted_equity shares of voting stock , which is distributed to creditors pro rata based on the amount of equity converted .
( Equivalently , a conversion rate of required _conversion / converted_equity is established . )
The firm would have the option of paying unsecured contingent liabilities that arise from contracts entered into prior to the reorganization in stock at the conversion rate established for other creditors .
This has the effect of placing undercollateralized derivative counterparties where they belong , in the same boat as the most junior creditors of the firm .
It 's also good from a " moral hazard " perspective — we really , really want people to take counterparty risk seriously in whatever OTC derivaties market survives this episode , but we do n't want to wipe out existing counterparties and set - off a cascade or meltdown .
Counterparties to reorganized firms would take a haircut , and salutary uncertainty would be introduced in valuation schemes that too often begin by assuming away counterparty risk .
If a firm is so profoundly insolvent that , even with the government capital infusion , the required debt - to - equity conversions would have to hit depositors ( at banks ) or claims on assets held on behalf of clients ( e.g. stocks held for clients by brokerages ) , then the firms should be liquidated , with the government honoring FDIC and SIPC guarantees .
If any such firms are systemically important , they'd have to be nationalized outright , like AIG .
Half - measures can't save such firms .
( Thanks to Winterspeak for pointing out this issue . )
The aggressiveness of the writedowns in Step 1 is the core protection for taxpayers in this plan .
If that 's watered down , this could become a taxpayer subsidy to converted creditors .
Also , to protect taxpayers , creditors should never be able to purchase shares more cheaply than the government .
Under the formulas above , that would happen when the book equity of the reorganized firm is positive , but less than regulatory capitalization thresholds .
In this case , the new owners effectively get a subsidy , a wealth transfer from old equityholders , during the reorganization .
This subsidy should be shared by converted creditors and the government .
The formulas above allocate old book equity to converted creditors , to ensure that creditors rather than taxpayers bear prereorganization losses , and would have to be modified when old book equity is positive :
government_cash_infusion =
( total_assets - ( old_equity * target_leverage ) ) /
( 2 * target_leverage - 1 )
government_equity = converted_equity =
( total_assets + government_cash_infusion ) /
( target_leverage * 2 )
reqired_conversion = converted_equity - ( 0.5 ) * old_book_equity
... and the government would buy shares at the same conversion rate paid by creditors , rather than at par .

“ Believing that fundamental conditions of the country are sound and that there is nothing in the business situation to warrant the destruction of values that has taken place on the exchanges during the past week , my son and I have for some days been purchasing sound common stocks ”
~ John D. Rockefeller , October 29th 1929 .
I ’ll tell you what the real purpose is behind Warren Buffett ’s recent column in the New York Times .
Buffett writes , “ Buy American .
I Am . ”
He goes on to say that Americans should not panic and flee equities , but instead , they should buy them .
That ’s right — Warren Buffett wants people to buy equity stakes in American companies .
Buffett is doing the government ’s dirty work in trying to calm the fears of the masses .
That was the whole purpose of his column .
He agreed to become an instrument for the establishment , and when Buffett speaks , people tend to listen .
The timing was perfectly executed .
As the markets splintered and rocked the world of regular people everywhere , they were exiting their speculative adventures in equities and escaping to safe havens in their 401k accounts .
And here was the respected , industrious , sensible folk hero , telling everyone that the fear felt by others should be a sign to us , and let that dictate our speculative strategy .
Warren Buffett is an admired man .
He is admired , even by the middle and lower classes , for his frugality , wisdom , no - nonsense delivery , plain - folk personality , and yes , his hard - earned wealth .
Readers may know that I deeply respect this man because I reflect on his business acumen frequently .
But his latest column puts him in the role of being a propagandist for the government and its bull market - perpetual bubble - sustainable boom doctrine .
The government and its Wall Street cronies are big on building " investor confidence " these days , especially when it comes to selling you on the stock market game and the ever - increasing Dow .
Warren Buffett is working to convince you , the unsophisticated investor , to have unmitigated confidence in the market so that you will continue to buy and prop up market fantasies , even in a time of rapid decline and volatility .
I find his reason for not fearing the equity speculation game to be a bit odd .
He says ,
But fears regarding the long - term prosperity of the nation ’s many sound companies make no sense .
These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups , as they always have .
But most major companies will be setting new profit records 5 , 10 and 20 years from now .
Essentially , he ’s suggesting that the Dow can only move upward — eventually ! — but he does not provide any reasonable justification for this belief .
He ’s careful , here , to not give out strict advice because it makes him uneasy .
So he ’s telling us that the profits will be there in “ 5 , 10 , and 20 years . ”
Is it 5 or is it 20 ?
Or anything in between ?
Or more than 20 years ?
Of course , no one knows , but to middle - class Joes it makes a heck of a difference whether it ’s 5 , 10 , or 20 years , or even at all , because most of us do n’t have the cushion to be wrong ( and 20 years off the mark ) , as does Warren Buffett .
Twenty years can be almost a half of one ’s working life in the middle class , and that kind of time is not available to most people to find out whether or not they won or lost the roll of the dice .
The supermajority of the population cannot ever have an investment strategy like that of Warren Buffett .
We can take much ( and I do ) from his value - investing blueprint and sensible roadmap for avoiding speculative pitfalls while engaging serious investment analysis .
But Joe the Plumber and his friends cannot afford to gamble away their financial futures on the hunch that the stock market “ can only go up . ”
On BubbleVision the other day , two desk jockeys also questioned Buffett ’s BUY advice — amazing ! — and they noted that since he ’s working on a much larger scale than the rest of us , how does his top - level recipe for success apply broadly to a populace of terrified people who are losing big on a lifetime accumulation of wealth ?
The answer is that it does n’t apply .
That is to say , amateur “ investors ” ( they are really speculators ) cannot apply his big - picture advice because every person he speaks to about the “ long term ” has a unique age , time to retirement , ability to save , and capability to bear risk .
In retrospect , Warren Buffett ’s posture on political issues shows us that in spite of being a remarkable value investor , he has sanctioned collectivist state hysteria and policies from climate change to taxes to fiscal policy .
In fact , his nod of approval for some of government ’s most destructive taxation tactics has clearly distinguished him as an unabashed redistributionist .
Finally , Mr. Buffett presents us with " a little history " when he notes that :
During the Depression , the Dow hit its low , 41 , on July 8 , 1932 .
Economic conditions , though , kept deteriorating until Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933 .
By that time , the market had already advanced 30 percent .
I ’d like to extend that history .
The Dow did hit 41 in July 8th , 1932 , after plummeting from a high of 381 on September 3rd , 1929 .
However , the Dow did not get back to 381 until November of 1954 , twenty - five years after the peak .
But we are supposed to believe that things are different now .
The Dow is a predictable and perpetual bull ride .
In fact , every so - called expert " in the media has declared that another Great Depression can never occur because , after all , " the fed has our backs . "
They have all the right safeguards in place to assure us that such a catastrophe can never happen again .
The Fed has intervened on a massive level not seen since FDR ’s New Deal takeover of the economy .
They do n’t have our backs , they have our balls .
Certainly , we have come to expect FDR - style fascism on steroids from the ratfinks who have co-opted the ranks of the current regime .
On the other hand , Warren Buffett ’s unequivocal endorsement of Washington ’s ruling class and its scheming agenda to lure the middle and lower classes with the promise of financial bread and circuses is a sign that we must not trust Omaha any more than we do Washington D.C. or Wall Street .

Next to a steak … or a salad … or simply on its own with a glass of wine ( or a Fresca , if that ’s more your poison ) , there are few things more perfectly simple than Risotto .
Grate 2 cups of cheese .
Peel and finely dice 3 to 4 cloves of garlic .
Dice ½ of a large onion .
Heat a large skillet over medium - low heat and add 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil .
Then add 1 tablespoon of butter .
Throw in the garlic and onion and sauté for a couple of minutes until the onion is translucent .
Add 1 pound of Arborio rice and stir to coat the rice thoroughly .
Adding 1 cup at a time , add 7 - 8 ounces of chicken broth , stirring constantly after each addition .
As soon as it appears that the rice has absorbed each helping of broth , add in the next helping .
Do not stop stirring .
This process will take at least 20 minutes .
Rice is done when it no longer has a hard bite .
When more of the broth is absorbed pour in 1 to 1 ½ cups of heavy cream .
Next add the grated cheese and stir thoroughly .
Add in plenty of fresh cracked pepper and about 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped chives .
Add salt to taste .
Make it .
Make it now .
Eat !
Enjoy !

The first time I ever tasted Risotto , I was living and working in Los Angeles , which means black pumps only left my feet for an average of about seven hours a day , i.e. only when I slept .
Anyway , our office went out to dinner one night with the CEO and the CFO and the COO , all visiting from Connecticut , and when the waitress took our order , all three of the big wigs ordered the special of the night : Risotto .
Because I wanted to be a big wig too , I went ahead and ordered Risotto too .
I had no idea what it even was .
But if it was good enough for those homeboy big wigs , it was good enough for me .
I do n’t remember anything else that happened that evening , and it ’s not because of the 874 bottles of chardonnay that passed around the table ; it ’s because once I took the first bite of that Risotto all creamy and textural and perfectly flavorful — I was transported to another plane of existence entirely .
After that first bite , I lost all feeling in my elbows , my eyes closed softly , and my scalp began to tingle , and not because the Santa Ana winds were in high gear that night .
After that first bite , my life changed forever .
I had eaten a perfectly prepared Risotto .
And I never wanted to go back to the way I was before .
Well , I would n’t mind weighing 123 again .
That would be nice .
But you see , Risotto and 123 are not harmonious .
They do not mesh .
They can not coexist .
They war violently , and only one can win .
In my world , Risotto won .
Long , long ago .
There are dozens and dozens of variations on Risotto : stirring in fresh pumpkin , adding lots of fresh herbs , mushrooms , shrimp … you name it .
And though I love jazzing it up from time to time , most of the time I like to strip it down to a simpler , more basic recipe : a little garlic , a little cream , and lots of freshly grated cheese .
Because it ’s hard to improve on perfection .
The only downside to Risotto — well , besides the fact that it establishes permanent residence on your bottom — is that it takes around thirty minutes to make , and that thirty minutes is spent slaving over the stove , slowly adding in liquid in increments , then stirring until it reaches the right texture .
In fact , the phrase “ slaving over a hot stove ” originated in a tiny town in Italy , when a cobbler actually chained his dutiful wife to their kitchen stove for three weeks , forcing her to make Risotto over and over and over .
Chilling tale , is n’t it ?
Okay , so I made that up .
But Risotto does require a little effort so just make sure you plan for that .
I happen to think that ’s part of the joy of Risotto , though — the organic process of cooking and stirring and cooking and stirring … plus it burns an extra twelve calories so you can have an extra…grain or two .
Let ’s go make it !
The Cast of Characters : Butter , Olive Oil , Onion , Garlic , Arborio Rice , Chicken Broth , Heavy Cream , any one or combination of Parmesan , Romano , and Asiago cheese , Salt , Pepper , and Chives .
Get ready for greatness , my homies .
Before we go any farther , I bring you the following breaking news alert :
Pioneer Woman does not use processed Parmesan cheese in her Risotto .
She uses …
ACK !
Parmigiano Reggiano !
What ’s gotten into me ?
What ’s the world coming to ?
WHAT’S HAPPENING ?
You can use whatever cheese you like .
I happen to like the real stuff for this recipe — it just takes the final dish over the top in flavor .
Okay , first we need to grate the cheese , because if we wait ’ til the Risotto’s on the stove we wo n’t be able to break away long enough to get it grated .
Basically , you need a total of 2 cups grated cheese .
I start with the Parmigiano Reggiano .
It makes me feel like , totally awesome .
Ahhh , yes .
There ’s my baby .
Come to mama , baby .
Come to mama .
I also like to use a cheese called Pecorino Romano .
It ’s very bitey and flavorful .
It ’s also slightly softer and easier to grate .
And that ’s always a nice break .
As you grate the different cheeses , just throw it into a bowl together .
Then it ’ll be easy to dump it in at the end .
This time I used Parmesan ( top left ) , Romano ( top right ) , and Asiago ( front ) .
But you can use all of one or just two if that ’s what you have .
Now peel 3 to 4 cloves of garlic .
I used 3 because I ’m 39 and I have this thing called HEARTBURN if I eat garlic after 5:00 .
Yeah , and my Arthur - itis is givin ’ me fits and my goiter is goitering and I have liver spots on my hands .
It ’s all downhill from here .
Just chop the garlic pretty finely .
Please note :
This is not my favorite knife .
My favorite knife was in the sink and I did n’t have time to wash it .
And I realized I no longer like any knife except that one .
Next , dice 1/2 large onion .
And now it ’s time to slave over a hot stove !
Do it for chained up Italian wives everywhere .
Heat a large skillet over medium to medium - low heat , and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil .
Then , add in 1 tablespoon butter .
It ’s for the flavor , man .
Now throw in the garlic and onion , and do n’t be like me .
The heat was too high and it sorta fried the garlic a little .
But I totally meant to do that .
As far as you know .
Go ahead and saute for a couple of minutes until the onion is translucent .
Now !
Dump in 1 pound Arborio rice , right on top of things .
Then stir it around to coat the rice thoroughly .
Now !
Here ’s what we ’re going to do .
Using approximately 7 to 8 cups of chicken stock or broth , we ’re going to add in about 1 cup at a time , stirring constantly after each addition .
As soon as it appears the helping of broth has been absorbed by the rice , add in the next helping .
It ’s important not to leave the stove , and not to stop stirring gently .
Here ’s the first addition of broth .
Stir it around for a minute or two …
And when it looks like the liquid is mostly absorbed …
Add in a little more of the liquid .
We ’re going to repeat this several times until we ’ve used all the liquid .
NOTE : It ’s important not to get the skillet too hot .
I really keep it on the low side of medium ; you do n’t want the rice to start sticking to the bottom of the pan .
And remember to stir .
Sorry I ’m so bossy .
Here ’s another liquid addition …
It ’s amazing how quickly the rice absorbs the liquid .
Blessed is the rice that hungers and thirsts for chicken broth ; for it shall be filled .
So basically , you ’re going to keep up this craziness for at least 20 minutes , maybe more .
The point is to add the liquid in small doses , and stir it as it absorbs .
* 20 minutes elapses
Oooh , look !
We ’re getting close .
When it starts to get puffy like this , you ’ll want to taste a couple of grains .
If it still has a hard / firm bite to it , keep up the liquid / cooking process .
The amount of liquid you ’ll need to use varies ; not all Arborio behaves the same .
* 5 more minutes elapses
It ’s ready !
I tasted a few grains and though it ’s still firm and nice , the hard bite is gone .
And now .
And now it ’s time to get serious .
When most of the liquid is absorbed , pour in 1 to 1 1/ 2 cups heavy cream .
Do n’t be afraid .
I would n’t lead you astray .
Next , dump in the grated cheese .
DON ’T BE AFRAID .
I would n’t do anything to hurt you .
Now stir the whole dadgum mess together .
And go ahead and pass out now so you can save up your energy to eat .
Add in plenty of black pepper …
And a tablespoon or two of chopped chives .
Next , add a little salt if it needs it , but remember the cheese is quite salty .
Give it one final stir , and serve it right away .
Because I ca n’t wait another minute or I ’m going to wig out .
But in a ladylike way , of course .
To serve , just place a not - too - large - because - it ’s - richer - than - all - get - out portion in your favorite dish .
I think I ’ll go for this Jadite soup plate .
Sprinkle some chives on top ( or any ol ’ herb will do . )
And if you ’re feeling fancy , do something like this .
Only unlike me , please give your hand a dusting of bronzing powder .
Man , that ’s a pale hand .
It may not look like much , but let me tell you one thing :
This Risotto … is delicious .
There ’s no other word I can use .
Next to a steak …or a salad …or simply on its own with a glass of wine ( or a Fresca , if that ’s more your poison ) , there are few things more perfectly simple than Risotto .
Make it .
Make it now .
Eat !
Enjoy !

Well , what do you expect ?
The singer , who rose to fame as Cat Stevens , changed his name to Yusuf Islam when he converted to Islam in 1977 but now wants to be known as Yusuf Cat Stevens , is candid about his conversion and the fallout that ensued .
Stevens shared , “ That was very difficult because at one point [… ]
Now this is the Henry Waxman that I ’ve been waiting to see .
Wall Street still thinks that they can call the shots and get away with anything including $ 70 billion in year end bonus money and bonus increases .
Now is the time to have this argument .
January is too late .
From the Washington Post :
Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , noted that before the infusion , the banks had spent or allocated $ 108 billion on employee compensation and bonuses for the first nine months of 2008 , nearly the same amount as last year .
“ I question the appropriateness of depleting the capital that taxpayers just injected into the banks through the payment of billions of dollars in bonuses , especially after one of the financial industry ’s worst years on record , ” Waxman wrote in a letter to the banks .
Lawmakers across the political spectrum want to ensure that the government ’s bailout program results in increased lending , not bigger paydays for executives .
Banking industry officials said they fully intend to use money from the government ’s bailout program to make loans and increase liquidity .
They noted that bonuses are a normal part of compensation packages .
The fact that the allocations on compensation so far in 2008 are identical to last year suggests that the bailout money will be not used to boost bonuses , they said .
“ Waxman ’s barking up the wrong tree , ” said Scott E. Talbott , senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable , which represents the nation ’s most powerful banks , brokerages and insurers .
“ We reject his basic premise .
The institutions fully intend to use the money to start making loans . ”
But a new study suggests that financiers are still bullish about their bonuses .
More than two - thirds of Wall Street professionals are expecting a bonus this year , and 36 percent are anticipating a larger bonus than last year , according to a survey by eFinancialCareers , a career networking company .
Sept. 6 , 2000 --
If you really want to make more people go to the polls on election day , put someone on the ballot a lot of people hate .
That ’s because we are far more likely to turn out because we ca n’t stand someone than because we think one candidate is a really swell person .
That ’s one of the conclusions of an ambitious study of voter attitudes spanning a 24 - year period led by Jon A. Krosnick , professor of psychology and political science at Ohio State University .
Reacting to the Bad Guy
“ People are more motivated by the threat of something bad than the opportunity for something good , ” says Krosnick .
But the research also turns up this bit of surprising news :
We really want to like these folks .
The study shows that there is an element of optimism in how we approach politicians .
“ Our work shows that people approach each new politician with hope and optimism that maybe this will be the hero they ’ve been hoping for , ” he says .
If it turns out that we ca n’t stand either candidate , we ’re not very likely to vote because either way , we lose , and the dismal choice turns us off .
And if we like both candidates about the same , we ’re also less likely to vote because either way , we win .
So in order to have high voter turnout , we need a saint and a villain .
But apparently , what we ’ve seen in the last few decades has done more to turn us off than fire us up .
Following John F. Kennedy ’s defeat of Richard Nixon in 1960 , voter turnout declined streadily through 1988 .
It rose slightly again in 1992 , and then fell again in 1996 .
There are probably many reasons for the decline , but the researchers point out that the fire in the belly of most voters cooled significantly over the past four decades , with few candidates managing to raise passions either pro or con .
We have become , in a word , uninterested .
Mud-Slinging Works
The research also suggests that a lot of campaign managers are right about one thing :
Negative advertising really works , provided it ’s done with enough taste to keep the mudslinger from getting a bit tarnished by his or her own mud .
It takes a touch of class to sling mud effectively .
The study , involving researchers from Princeton and Northwestern universities and the University of Chicago , builds upon data collected in face - to - face interviews with thousands of Americans over the course of many elections by the National Election Study .
The ongoing study , which began at the University of Michigan in 1952 , has been funded for the last 30 years by the National Science Foundation .
Results from that larger study are available to scholars across the country , and it is on that body of work that the researchers base their conclusions about why we bothered to vote at all during the years from 1972 through 1996 .
The bottom line , Krosnick says , is we approach politicians the same way we approach other people and issues , like who we want to marry and which breakfast cereal we prefer .
We want to give the other guy the benefit of the doubt , but if we feel betrayed , we want to throw the rascal out .
As an old political pol once told me , issues do n’t decide elections .
Personalities decide who wins and who loses .
Never mind the future of social security .
The winning candidate needs to know how to smile convincingly .
We ’ve got to like the person more than agree with how he or she stands on the issues .
Perhaps the most surprising result of the study is how we regard emerging politicians about whom we know very little .
The study shows that most people approach a politician they do n’t know the same way they approach anybody else .
“ When people know nothing about a new person they are about to meet , they walk into that interaction slightly optimistically , hoping and expecting that the person will be pleasant , competent , enjoyable , ” Krosnick says .
It does n’t matter if the new person is a blind date or a presidential candidate .
We still hope for a pleasurable experience .
Maybe what that suggests is we really want to like each other , regardless of occupation .
Love / Hate at First Site
That first meeting , incidentally , turns out to be very important down the road .
First impressions really do matter most .
The study shows that if people liked , or disliked , the candidate at the first encounter , that opinion proved really hard to change later on .
That suggests that current marketing strategies for candidates — saving the big bucks for the end of the campaign — is dead wrong .
“ Candidates tend to save their money so they can have the biggest blitzes of advertising at the end of the campaign , right before people vote , on the assumption that people will have forgotten everything they heard earlier , ” Krosnick says .
“ Our results show that if you can spend the same dollar making a first impression on people , that will have more impact on their ultimate behavior than throwing in something at the last minute . ”
But in the end , he adds , what really seems to make a difference is the success of one candidate at vilifying an opponent , without looking too nasty in the process .
“ It ’s not all that surprising that people put more weight on the failings of candidates than they do on the strengths of them , ” Krosnick says .
In other words , it ’s easier to cross someone off because there ’s something about him or her that you ca n’t stomach than it is to search out the virtues that would make the candidate a good public servant .
And as so many candidates have shown over the years , it ’s pretty easy to stumble out there , giving voters an easy target .
So , George and Al , or Al and George , it appears that it ’s your election to lose .
You ’ll make it easier on us busy voters if one of you lays a giant egg sometime before the election .
We may be basically optimistic , but if you give us a reason to hate you we will turn out in droves to blast you out of the sky .
Unless , of course , the other guy lays an egg of equal stench .
Then we will just stay away from the polling booth .
What a system .
But as political commentator David Brinkley once noted , somehow it works .
Lee Dye ’s column appears weekly on ABCNEWS.com .
A former science writer for the Los Angeles Times , he now lives in Juneau , Alaska .
Ron Silliman reports on a new publication , modestly entitled Issue 1 . ( I was first alerted to this by The Mumpsimus ) .
This e-text is 3785 pages long (! ) ; each page contains a “ poem ” attributed to one of 3785 3164 writers .
The names of the writers range from Silliman himself and other language poets , through a number of ( now dead ) poets and writers , onto various bloggers ( especially ones who appear in Silliman ’s blogroll , it would seem ) .
In point of fact , none of the writers have actually written the pieces attributed to them .
My name appears among the list of authors , together with the names of several people I know , including some who read ( and sometimes comment on ) this blog .
My own “ poem ” appears on page 1893 ; for what it ’s worth , it does n’t strike me as being very good , nor is it like anything that I could ever imagine myself writing , either in style or in sentiment .
I kind of wonder how other “ victims ” of this hoax ( if that ’s what it is ) respond to it .
Silliman seems kind of pissed off , as do many ( but not all ) of the commenters on his blog entry .
Matthew Cheney ( of The Mumpsimus blog ) seems more or less amused :
The whole thing strikes me as a stunt pulled by someone who desperately wants attention .
( And now I ’m giving it to ’em .
So it goes . )
I ’m still amazed that anyone would put the time into creating something like this , but the amazement now is the sort of amazement one has when watching the totally insane rather than watching the harmlessly obsessive .
Me , I think that the stunt raises all sorts of interesting questions ( or perhaps I should say , in Palin - speak , that lots of interesting questions “ rear their heads ” ) .
Early - 20th - century Dadaist stunts raised meta-questions about art , about what could be considered art , etc .
But such meta-questions have long since been so well assimilated into our culture ( both artistic culture and commercial culture ) that they scarcely raise an eyebrow any longer .
Today , we can only be blase about self - referentiality , conceptual art , and so on .
In such a context , Issue 1 attempts to up the ante , by asking meta - meta - questions , as it were .
Most notably , there ’s the difficulty of deciding whether the publication actually is some sort of interesting conceptual art , or whether it is rather just a dumb prank , or a malicious hoax .
Then there is the issue of obsessiveness that Matthew Cheney raises .
Certainly a lot of modernist and post - modernist art is quite obsessive ( I am thinking of everything from Yayoi Kusama ’s polka dots to Henry Darger ’s weather chronicles ) .
But Issue 1 might well only be pseudo - obsessive ; it seems to be something that would have required an insane amount of time and energy ( if only to collect all those author names and write all those poems ) , but I would n’t be surprised to learn that it was all generated by a computer program in just a few hours .
Even insanity is n’t what it used to be , in our age of digital simulation .
Finally , given all the questions about the status of the author that have been raised in the last half - century or so , it only makes sense that I should be credited with the authorship of something that I had nothing to do with writing .
Remember , Roland Barthes proclaimed “ the death of the author ” more than forty years ago , in 1967 .
And even well before that , in 1940 , Borges proposed a literary criticism that would “ take two dissimilar works — the Tao Te Ching and the 1001 Nights , for instance — attribute them to a single author , and then in all good conscience determine the psychology of that most interesting homme de lettres … ” ( from “ Tlon , Uqbar , Orbis Tertius ” ) .
Issue 1 is a logical outgrowth of the situation in which such ideas no longer seem new , or radical , or outrageously counterintuitive , but have instead been entirely assimilated into our “ common sense . ”
In short , Issue 1 makes sense to me as a conceptual art project precisely to the extent that it marks the utter banalization , routinization , and digitization of any sort of conceptualism and experimentalism in art , and of all supposedly “ avant - garde ” gestures .
There is something melancholy in coming to this conclusion ; but perhaps something liberating as well , since it suggests that the whole strain of avant - gardism that starts in the 19th century , goes through dadaism and other forms of radical modernism , and moves through conceptualism in the 1960s and 1970s to the supposedly oppositional political art of the last few decades , has finally outlived its relevance and its usefulness .
We have finally reached the point where we can shake off the dead weight of the anti-traditionalist tradition , and perhaps move on to something else .
This does n’t mean rejecting all the art of the avant - garde tradition , much of which I still very much love .
But it does mean seeing that art historically , just as we see the art of the Baroque historically , or as we see the science fiction of the “ Golden Age ” of the early - to - mid 20th century historically .
It ’s still there to be tapped ( or looted ) for clever ideas , formal approaches , and so on .
But modernist experimentation and avant - gardism is no longer a living resource ; in an age of arcane financial instruments capable at one moment of generating huge quantities of fictitious wealth , and at another moment of sending shockwaves through the entire society , wiping out retirement accounts , causing businesses to go bankrupt and jobs to disappear , etc , etc — in such a climate , modernist avant - gardism fails to be “ as radical as reality itself . ”
( I am fully aware that financial panics with real effects upon people ’s lives are as old as capitalism itself ; what ’s new in the present situation comes from the way that new technologies have a multiplier effect , as well as adding additional layers of meta - referentiality and meta - feedback into the system ) .
I am sorely tempted to add the “ poem ” of mine which appears in Issue 1 , and which I had absolutely nothing to do with producing , to my CV .
HIV is a master of disguise , able to rapidly change its identity and hide undetected in infected cells .
But now , in a long - standing collaborative research effort partially - funded by the Wellcome Trust , scientists from Oxford - based Adaptimmune Limited , in partnership with the Universities of Cardiff and Pennsylvania have engineered immune cells to act as " bionic assassins " that see through HIV 's many disguises .
The findings of the study in Nature Medicine may have important implications for developing new treatments for HIV and slowing or even preventing the onset of AIDS .
Over 33 million people were estimated to be living with HIV worldwide in 2007 .
Although anti-retroviral drugs have been successful in delaying the onset of AIDS for several years , the drugs are expensive , have serious side effects and must be taken for life .
No vaccine or cure yet exists and drug resistance is increasingly becoming a problem .
When viruses enter our bodies , they hijack the machinery of host cells in order to replicate and spread infection .
When our body 's cells are infected with a virus they expose small parts of the virus on their surface , offering a " molecular fingerprint " called an epitope for killer T - cells from the immune system to identify .
This triggers an immune response , eliminating the virus and any cells involved in its production .
Killer T cells given a new version of the natural T cell receptor are able to recognize all versions of a key HIV ' fingerprint ' on the surface of the infected cell and clear HIV infection in the laboratory .
Credit : Adaptimmune Ltd.
As with other viruses , HIV enters the body and replicates itself rapidly .
However , it also has the ability to mutate quickly , swiftly disguising its fingerprints to allow it to hide from killer T - cells .
" When the body mounts a new killer T - cell response to HIV , the virus can alter the molecular fingerprint that these cells are searching for in just a few days , " explains Professor Andy Sewell from Cardiff University , co-lead author of the study and long - term collaborator with Adaptimmune .
" It 's impossible to track and destroy something that can disguise itself so readily .
As soon as we saw over a decade ago how quickly the virus can evade the immune system we knew there would never be a conventional vaccine for HIV .
" Now , Professor Sewell and colleagues from Adaptimmune Ltd and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine have engineered and tested a killer T - cell receptor that is able to recognise all of the different disguises that HIV is known to have used to evade detection .
The researchers attached this receptor to the killer T - cells to create genetically engineered " bionic assassins " able to destroy HIV - infected cells in culture .
" The T - cell receptor is nature 's way of scanning and removing infected cells – it is uniquely designed for the job but probably fails in HIV because of the tremendous capability of the virus to mutate , " says Dr Bent Jakobsen , co-lead author and Chief Scientific Officer at Adaptimmune Ltd , the company which owns the technology .
" Now we have managed to engineer a receptor that is able to detect HIV's key fingerprints and is able to clear HIV infection in the laboratory .
If we can translate those results in the clinic , we could at last have a very powerful therapy on our hands .
" The researchers believe that HIV 's chameleon - like ability may still prevent the virus from being completely flushed out of the body .
It could mutate and change its fingerprint further , hiding behind these new disguises and evading detection .
However , each time the virus is forced to mutate to avoid detection by killer T - cells , it appears to become less powerful .
"
In the face of our engineered assassin cells , the virus will either die or be forced to change its disguises again , weakening itself along the way , " says Professor Sewell .
" We 'd prefer the first option but I suspect we 'll see the latter .
Even if we do only cripple the virus , this will still be a good outcome as it is likely to become a much slower target and be easier to pick off .
Forcing the virus to a weaker state would likely reduce its capacity to transmit within the population and may help slow or even prevent the onset of AIDS in individuals .
" Pending regulatory approval , Professor Carl June and Dr James Riley from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia will shortly begin clinical trials using the engineered killer T - cells .
"
We hope to begin testing the treatment on patients with advanced HIV infection next year , " says Professor June .
" If the therapy in that group proves successful , we will treat patients with early stage well - controlled HIV infection .
The goal of these studies is to establish whether the engineered killer T cells are safe , and to identify a range of doses of the cells that can be safely administered .
"
" The AIDS virus evades human immunity in all it infects , " says Professor Rodney Phillips , from the University of Oxford , where the collaborative research effort first began in 2003 .
" Until now no - one has been able to clear the virus naturally .
Immune cells modified in the laboratory in this way provide a test as to whether we can enhance the natural response in a useful and safe way to clear infected cells .
If successful the technology could be applied to other infectious agents .
" The researchers are now exploring using engineered receptors on killer T - cells as a way of improving immune responses to cancer .
Mozilla Messaging has launched the third alpha release of Thunderbird 3.0 , a major update of the open source e-mail client .
The current prerelease series , which is codenamed Shredder , is highly experimental and not intended for production use .
The new alpha introduces tons of minor improvements and a handful of significant new features , including some of the first usability enhancements that are part of a major user interface overhaul .
Development on Shredder has been moving forward swiftly .
Those of us who have been tracking the project 's progress by following the Rumbling Edge bug digest blog are awed by the rate at which bug reports are being resolved .
The complete list of fixes and improvements that were made for alpha 3 top 280 items .
The most significant changes in alpha 3 are various performance and usability improvements .
The IMAP implementation got a boost in this release , and provides better support for offline usage .
The new message view includes some contextually - relevant controls , such as buttons to reply , forward , and delete a message .
Small star icons displayed next to the individual e-mail addresses in message headers can be used to quickly add contacts to the addressbook .
This feature works in much the same way as the new quick bookmarking feature in Firefox 3 .
The user interface changes in alpha 3 are just the beginning , and many more are coming soon .
Thunderbird designer Bryan Clark has written several blog entries about user interface improvement ideas and the actual features that are appearing in the nightly builds .
He recently described efforts to implement a tabbing system with session restore support .
He has also written about some ideas for status bar improvements and subject autocompletion .
Mozilla Messaging got its start last year when it was spun off from the Mozilla Foundation and given $ 3 million in seed funding .
This step was taken to give Thunderbird development more autonomy and so that Mozilla could reduce the scope of its own agenda and focus more closely on the browser ecosystem .
The Mozilla Messaging organization , which is now headed by former ActiveState CTO David Ascher , first revealed its strategy for Thunderbird 3 earlier this year .
Mozilla Messaging plans to make Thunderbird an appealing mail option by incrementally improving the application 's underlying architecture , refining the user interface to improve workflow and ease of use , and integrating calendaring functionality by leveraging the code of the Lightning extension .
The organization also plans to explore other messaging mediums and extend the program so that it can accommodate more of the communication requirements of its users .
The original Thunderbird 3 alpha release , which took flight earlier this year , was the first to include Gecko 1.9 , a much - improved version of Mozilla 's rendering engine that is also used in Firefox 3 .
Integration of the Lightning calendar extension is going to be one of the most important tasks for the Thunderbird developers as they get ready for the 3.0 release .
The Calendar QA team is looking for some users to help test Lightning with Thunderbird trunk builds in preparation for beta 1 .
To participate , follow the instructions on the Mozilla calendar blog and help run some Litmus tests for Lightning .
The alpha 3 release is available for download from the Mozilla Messaging web site .
For additional information , check out the release notes and launch announcement .

LA CROSSE , Wis. , Oct 1 ( Reuters ) - U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Wednesday it was crucial for lawmakers to pass a $ 700 billion financial bailout package in order to avert an economic catastrophe .
“ To the Democrats and Republicans who have opposed this plan , I say this : ‘ Step up to the plate .
Do what ’s right for the country , because the time to act is now ’ , ” Obama told rally in La Crosse , Wisconsin .
Obama , a Democratic senator from Illinois , plans to fly back to Washington later to cast a vote in favor of the plan in the Senate .
“ It is clear that this is what we must do right now to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe , ” he said .
Obama said the country would be in for a “ long and painful recession ” if the bailout bill is not passed .
“ Thousands of businesses could close .
Millions of jobs could be lost , ” he said .
Obama ’s Republican rival in the Nov. 4 election , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , is also heading back to Washington for the vote as is Obama ’s running mate , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , a Democrat .
But believe it or not , pornography and politics are not necessarily strange bedfellows , as we explore now in Ten Pornstars who ran for public office .
We 've often commented on YesButNoButYes that the porn industry is the ultimate memetracker , seemingly jumping on a trend and executing against it before most can even react .
One of our most read stories is the Top Ten Adult Versions of Oscar Winners .
Now , just in time for Nov 4th , we have Who 's Nailin ' Paylin , a political parody brought to you by the genius minds at Hustler .
You betcha !
# 10 - Marilyn Chambers
Let 's start with one of the most famous porn stars of all , the legendary star of the Mitchell Brother 's classic Behind The Green Door , Marilyn Chambers .
While she went on to have a long and enthusiastic career in porn , you may not know that in the 2004 US Presidential Election , she ran for Vice President on the Personal Choice Party ticket , a quasi- libertarian party , for which she received a total of 946 votes .
# 9 - Milly d'Abbraccio
The first of three Italian entries on our list , socialist and veteran pornstar Milly D'Abbraccio ran in April 2008 for a seat on Rome 's city hall , and featured her ass prominently on all campaign posters .
The star of The Kiss of the Cobra and Paolina Borghese , Imperial Nymphomaniac said that - if elected - she would create a red light area with strip clubs , erotic discos and sex shops called " Love City " just miles away from the Vatican .
# 8 - Peter Bond
In 2002 , a former German pornstar and game show host named Peter Bond ran for a seat in parliament on the liberal Freed Democrats ticket .
No word on whether lederhosen and bratwurst featured in his manifesto .
# 7 - Mimi Myagi
The DD - breasted Filipino porn star Mimi Myagi was running a very successful live nude chat webchat when , in 2006 , she filed as a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state of Nevada , under her birth name , Melody Damayo , with the slogan " I 'm bare and honest at all times " .
Her campaign was even endorsed by Wonkette .
# 6 - Goeran Eurenius
Georan Eurenius was actually already in office - as a councilor in Haerryda , Sweden - when his past career of acting in " at least " 14 porn movies was revealed , much to the surprise of his Leftist Party ( what a great name ) who were known for supporting feminist and anti-pornography views .
Err , whoops .
# 5 - Cheri Manescu
Romanian Pornstar Cheri Manescu was another who believed her experience getting screwed for money in public was somehow a fine qualification to become Mayor of Rome .
Actually , now that I think about it ....
# 4 - Sonny Landham
Landham started out acting in pornographic movies such as Naked Came The Stranger before branching out into mainstream acting , including parts in movies such as The Warriors and Southern Comfort .
He also appeared in Predator along with Governors - To - Be Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura , and maybe this is where he got the inspiration to run for Governor of Kentucky in 2003 .
# 3 - Linda Lovelace
Ok , so no , Linda Lovelace never actually ran for President .
But she did make a film called Linda Lovelace For President , and she 's arguably the most famous porn star of all time .
So cut me some slack - Top 9 Pornstars who ran for public office did n't quite have the same ring .
# 2 - Marey Carey
And as if art always imitates life , here 's Marey Carey , following Linda Lovelace 's footsteps by running for Governor of California in 2003 .
Her platform included making lap dances tax deductible , create a ' Porn for Pistols " campaign to reduce handgun numbers and install live webcams in the Governor 's Mansion .

Hungarian - born Italian Pornstar La Cicciolina , who is - according to Wikipedia - the first hardcore performer in the World to be elected to a democratic parliament .
Specifically , she was elected to the Italian Parliament in 1987 with 20,000 votes .
Her platform includes the ' absolute sexual freedom " including " the right to sex in prisons " , presumably without having to bend down to pick up the soap .
Because it would be sexist to not ask …

Treat her like any other candidate , right ?
Ever since Clinton was asked on that MTV thing back in 1992 , every candidate has had to answer the question “ boxers or briefs ? ” and John Kerry recently joked that McCain ’s answer was “ Depends … ”
So in the spirit of not being sexist , when do we get an answer from Sarah Palin about her undergarment preference ?
Thong or boy shorts ?
Granny Panties or T - back ?
Cotton or commando ?
Inquiring minds want to know …
… especially what kind of underwear one gets on a $ 150,000 shopping spree .

I think Sarah Palin has already answered that question :
“ I ’m back to wearing my own clothes from my favorite consignment shop in Anchorage , Alaska , ” she noted .
She ’s back to granny panties !
… but I still wonder what she got to go with these outfits :

update : Via MSNBC on November 2 , 2008 , John McCain wants us to know :
DVLA still sell your data without checks as 30,000 requests a month bypass vetting system
The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency ( DVLA ) is still selling the names and addresses of motorists to wheel - clamping firms without carrying out checks on their background and credentials , despite a pledge by Ministers to introduce tougher controls .
Three years ago , the Government said more would be done to prevent data on car owners falling into the hands of rogue parking firms .
Action was promised after The Mail on Sunday disclosed that drivers ' details were being sold by the DVLA for £ 2.50 a time to unlicensed operators and even to criminals imprisoned for extortion .
Scandal : Only one in 1,000 applications for information about drivers is turned down
The Department for Transport responded by bringing in fresh checks on about 80 companies entitled to receive information via a secure electronic link to the DVLA database of Britain 's 38 million motorists .
These involved a six - month probationary period for firms wishing to join the register , criminal - record checks on their directors and compulsory membership of an accredited industry organisation such as the British Parking Association .
Announcing the crackdown , the then Transport Minister Stephen Ladyman declared : ' Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of individuals is critical . '
Now , however , it has been revealed that personal details of hundreds of thousands of motorists continue to be sold to firms that have not undergone rigorous vetting procedures - simply because they make individual applications for the information , bypassing the vetting system .
Parking firms that apply for information by post are not obliged to undergo any of the security procedures that apply to operators seeking data via the email link .
All they have to do is fill in a form entitled Request For Information For Those Who Issue A Parking Charge Notice and send it back to the DVLA .
The one - page document , which can be downloaded without restriction from the internet , requires no criminal - record checks , referees or documentary evidence about the company 's credentials .
The applicant is asked to give the registration number of a vehicle and then answer the questions : ' Why do you want the information ? ' and ' How are you going to use the information ? '
The astounding number of requests made in this way suggests it is being widely used to avoid background checks .
Notorious wheel clamper Gordon Miller was able to obtain drivers ' addresses from the DVLA
Figures obtained by Lib Dem transport spokesman Norman Baker show that 334,569 enquiries - about 20 per cent of the total - were made by this method in the past year .
Of these postal requests , only one in 1,000 was turned down on the grounds that the applicant had no right to receive the information .
In one month , not one such request was rejected out of 28,501 enquiries .
The following month saw four out of 26,607 deemed unjustified .
In all , from October 2007 to September 2008 , only 324 postal requests were rejected for failing to meet the ' reasonable cause ' criteria .
In addition , just one form can be used to submit requests for information on up to 15 drivers .
In the same 12 - month period , 1.4 million applications were made by firms - which had undergone the new security checks - using the password - controlled email link to the DVLA 's headquarters in Swansea .
Ministers ordered an inquiry in 2005 after The Mail on Sunday revealed that two criminals , Darren Havell and Gordon Miller , had obtained drivers ' details from the DVLA .
The men , who ran a wheel - clamping company in Portsmouth called Aquarius Security , deliberately trapped drivers by blocking them in with a van .
They also demanded a £ 300 fee to release cars .
The pair were convicted of extortion , with Havell sentenced to three years in jail and Miller to four .
Astonishingly , they had been able to find out where a car owner lived simply by giving the DVLA a registration number .
Despite the Government 's pledge to do more to prevent private information about motorists falling into the wrong hands , MPs , motoring organisations and privacy campaigners remain concerned .
The postal form that bypasses security checks
Parking enforcement on private land such as retail parks , hospitals and railway stations is an unregulated industry and it is difficult and expensive for motorists to challenge fines .
Campaigners are also angry that DVLA officials are not required to notify vehicle keepers when a request for their personal data has been made .
The latest statistics , released last week by junior Transport Minister Jim Fitzpatrick in response to questions from Mr Baker , refer only to applications from private companies and do not include those from the police , local authorities and other public bodies .
Mr Baker said last night : ' Despite all the campaigning and all the promises , it 's clear that nothing much has changed .
' Companies with something to hide or that fall short of the standards required can get round the rules without difficulty . '
DVLA officials say the law obliges them to disclose drivers ' names and addresses to parking operators , solicitors , banks , finance companies , petrol stations , bailiffs and private investigators .
Critics , however , claim the system is open to abuse and want the Information Commissioner , who supervises the data protection laws , to intervene .
The DVLA said the income it receives from selling names and addresses - about £ 15 million in the past five years - is not profit and covers only the cost of running the operation .
It said : ' Unauthorised parking on private land is a widespread problem .
The DVLA has to strike a balance , allowing fair enforcement but protecting motorists . '
A spokesman for Information Commissioner Richard Thomas said they would study The Mail on Sunday 's story and would ' not hesitate to take further action if required ' .
He added : ' If drivers have evidence that their information is being used inappropriately , they should complain to the Information Commissioner 's Office . '
WASHINGTON  A new poll finds that nearly six in 10 white Southern evangelicals believe torture is justified , but their views can shift when they consider the Christian principle of the golden rule .
The poll released Thursday , commissioned by Faith in Public Life and Mercer University , found that 57 % of respondents said torture can be often or sometimes justified to gain important information from suspected terrorists .
Thirty - eight percent said it was never or rarely justified .
But when asked if they agree that " the U.S. government should not use methods against our enemies that we would not want used on American soldiers , " the percentage who said torture was rarely or never justified rose to 52 % .
" Presenting people with this argument and identifying with the golden rule really does engage a different part of people 's psyche and a part of their heart , their soul , and really does shift their views on torture , " said Robert Jones , president of Public Religion Research , which was commissioned to conduct the poll .
The findings of this poll , which did not define torture , compared to a Pew Research Center poll from February that found that 48 % of the general public think torture can be justified .
The new poll found that 44 % of white Southern evangelicals rely on life experiences and common sense to determine their views about torture .
A lower percentage , 28 % , said they relied on Christian teachings or beliefs .
The poll was released on the seventh anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and comes after several religious groups have joined a public campaign to oppose the use of torture in interrogating suspected terrorists .
Results were unveiled during the National Summit on Torture at Mercer in Atlanta , which was co-sponsored by Evangelicals for Human Rights .
David Gushee , a Christian ethics professor at Mercer and the president of the evangelical group , said the poll numbers should tell leaders , including presidential nominees Barack Obama and John McCain , who oppose torture that people can change their minds about this issue if it is discussed from a moral standpoint .
" Opinion on this question is movable , " he said .
Pollsters also found that 53 % of white Southern evangelicals believe the government uses torture in its anti-terrorism campaign , despite claims by government officials to the contrary .
About one - third , or 32 % , said the government does not use torture as a matter of policy .
Researchers also found that 65 % of white Southern evangelicals support McCain , 14 % support Obama and 21 % remain undecided .
The telephone poll of 600 white evangelical Christian adults in 14 Southern states was conducted Aug. 14 - 22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

THURSDAY , Sept. 4 ( Health.com ) —
The special terrors of the Iraq war have shone new light on post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) as it is suffered by U.S. soldiers .
But medical patients undergoing arduous procedures and treatments can experience PTSD symptoms too , according to a California pain expert .
At the PainWeek conference in Las Vegas this week , Thomas Strouse , MD , professor of clinical psychiatry at UCLA , stressed the importance of minimizing pain , fear , and other trauma that accompany cancer treatment , in particular .
Cancer patients , Dr. Strouse says , may feel they are under terrifying physical threat , may feel a loss of control , and may experience prolonged pain or other discomfort such as profound nausea , laying the groundwork for PTSD .
According to Dr. Strouse , PTSD symptoms have been most clearly described in adolescent patients who relive the trauma of childhood cancer treatment when they have to go in for tests and checkups .
But , he says , “ It can happen in adults who have gone through arduous medical experiences as well .
One of the big unanswered questions in PTSD research is :
Why do some people exposed to a trauma get PTSD and others do n’t ? ”
Complex genetic and social factors probably spare some patients and burden others , he says .
But the lesson for patients going into a traumatic medical experience , such as cancer surgery and chemotherapy , is that all efforts should be made to anticipate and reduce discomfort and the sense of helplessness that these procedures can induce .
“ Talk about the procedures , ” Dr. Strouse advises patients who deal with doctors .
“ Talk about both behavioral and medication preparation that will help you get ready for the procedure . ”
Although pain is only one aspect of the trauma that can spark PTSD , it is especially relevant in the context of medical treatment , and physicians now recognize that pain control is vitally important in the recovery process .
If you ’re slated for an operation ( or helping a child through the experience ) , “ Talk about what postoperative pain control will be like , ” Dr. Strouse says .
“ What will be done to reduce my pain ?
Who can I get in touch with if I do n’t like my pain control ? ”
The goal is not only to reduce the pain of a medical procedure , but to avoid the pain of reliving a bad experience .
That message is getting out to doctors , Dr. Strouse says , even if they do n’t frame it in terms of PTSD .
“ I ’m not sure it ’s discussed in PTSD language , but it ’s well understood now that it ’s better to reduce the trauma of procedures at every level , right down to treatments on babies . ”

Is it important to write good code ?
Sunday , October 12 , 2008
The last three weeks I have visit several companies and talked about writing good code .
It 's amazing to see how different developer thinks about writing good code .
Here are some comments when I asked if it 's important to write good code :
- I do n't care as long as it works it 's fine .
- I do n't have the time to write good code .
- The customer do n't see the code , so as long as the application works , I 'm satisfied .
- Most customers want to pay as little as possible for as much as possible , and to deliver it in time , I make sure the code only works .
- I know that we can use refactoring to make the code more readable , but we do n't have the time to do it .
When I asked about reading other peoples code and also maintain it , most people answer :
- It 's not easy all the time
- It 's horrible and hard to understand what the code does .
That are some of the results when developers only write code to make stuff works and write code for them self and do n't care to write code for other humans to understand .
Here is an example which I use during my presentation , it 's a method which will calculate the price for renting a movie , the price differs between different type of customers and also different types of movies .
public class MovieRenter { public double CalculatePrice ( string customerType , string movieType ) { if ( customer Type == " VIC " && movieType == " Transfer " ) return 20 ; else if ( customer Type == " Regular " && movieType == " Transfer " ) return 30 ; else if ( customer Type == " VIC " && movieType == " Normal " ) return 10 ; else if ( customer Type == " Regular " && movieType == " Normal " ) return 20 ; else return 50 ; } }
MovieRenter movieRenter = new MovieRenter ( ) ; double price = movieRenter.CalculatePrice ( " VIC " , " Transfer " ) ;
I asked the attendance if the method looks ok , I got surprised when the answer was " Yes " .
Some one told me , well I should have used enumeration and switch statement instead of strings and if statements .
I did some refactoring and use an enumeration and switch statement instead with the help of the attendance , the result was the following code :
public class MovieRenter { public double CalculatePrice ( CustomerType customerType , MovieType movieType ) { switch ( customerType ) { case CustomerType.VIC : switch ( movieType ) { case MovieType .
Transfer : return 20 ; case MovieType.Normal : return 10 ; default : return 20 ; } break ; case CustomerType.
Regular : switch ( movieType ) { case MovieType .
Transfer : return 30 ; case MovieType.Normal : return 20 ; default : return 30 ; } break ; default : return 30 ; } } public enum MovieType { Transfer , Normal } public enum CustomerType { VIC , Regular }
MovieRenter movieRenter = new MovieRenter ( ) ; double price = movieRenter.CalculatePrice( CustomerType.VIC , MovieType.Transfer ) ;
When I asked if we can do it even better , someone wanted to split the switch statement inside of the case CustomerType .VIC into a separate method , the same with the switch statement in the case CustomerType .
Regular .
I did that changes to the code and everyone was happy .
The problem with conditional statement in code , is that they can be hard to maintain , if I need to add a new kind of movie and customer , I need to add more conditions to my code .
Sooner or later it will be difficult to maintain .
So one thing we can do , is to replace a conditional statement with polymorphism .
If we look at the code , we can see that we have a customer and a movie to which a customer wants to rent .
So we create two entities , one Customer entity and one Movie entity .
We can then add a Rebate property to the Customer class and a Price property to the Move class .
A movie have the price , and Customer have a rebate .
Now when we have a Customer and a Movie , we need to make sure we also have the different type of Customers and Movie represented as classes , we do n't want to add a CustomerType or MovieType property to the Customer and Movie class , if we do so , we will en up with a new conditional statement .
So we create a new class called CustomerVIC which will inherit from Customer , and we create a MovieTransfer class which inherits from the Movie class .
We let the Customer class represents a regular customer and the Movie class as normal movie .
Because a VIC Customer should have it's own Rebate and a Transfer Movie should have it's own price , we make sure the base classes properties are virtual so we can override them in our sub classes .
public class Customer { public virtual double Rebate { get { return 0 ; } } } public class CustomerVIC : Customer { public override double Rebate { get { return 10 ; } } } public class Movie { public virtual double Price { get { return 20 ; } } } public class MovieTransfer :
Movie { public virtual double Price { get { return 30 ; } } }
If we compare a normal customer with a VIC , we can see that a VIC will have 10 in rebate .
So we make sure the CustomerVIC class Rebate property returns the price a VIC Customer should have in Rebate over a regular customer .
The price of a Transfer movie is 30 and the price of a normal movie is 20 .
Now when we have created our Customers and Movies , we can change the MovieRenter 's Calculate Price method , which in this case should take a Customer as an argument and a Movie .
public class MovieRenter { public double CalculatePrice ( Customer customer , Movie movie ) { return movie .
Price - customer .
Rebate ; } }
CustomerVIC vicCustomer = new CustomerVIC ( ) ; MovieTransfer transferMovie = new MovieTransfer ( ) ; MovieRenter movieRenter = new MovieRenter ( ) ; double price = movieRenter.CalculatePrice( vicCustomer , transferMovie ) ;
So by using polymorphism and more Object Oriented Programming over a normal functional programming , we can remove conditional statements .
If I need a new type of Customer or Movie , I just create a new class and inherits from its base class and override the Rebate and Price property .
Anyone have another suggestion of making the first code example better , and do you think it 's important to make it better even if it works ?
What do you think is most important when it comes to writing code ?
What is the most common thing you think a developers are doing wrong when they write code ?
And so Tennant ’s hanging up his TARDIS key .
He will be an ex-Timelord .
Apart from the 2013 and 2023 reunions with Messrs Baker and McCoy wheeled out in their bath - chairs of course .
It ’s most likely that he ’ll act his last on either Christmas Day or New Year ’s Eve 2009 .
Of course , for those followers of the ‘ Laverne As Doctor ’ school of ( mathematical ) thought , they know that he ’ll last until 17th April 2010 .
A ‘ last gasp ’ five minutes reprise at the start of an episode , or a full blown ‘ transition ’ episode ?
It remains to be seen .
But right now people seem more interested in just who will be taking over , rather than when .
First , a bit of maths .
Because you knew this bit was coming .
The eldest actor to step through the doors of the TARDIS for the first time was William Hartnell back in November ’ 63 .
He was 55 years and 10 months old .
Second eldest was the 50 years and 6 month old Jon Pertwee .
The youngest have been Peter Davison back when he was just 30 years 9 months and , of course , David Tennant at 34 years and 7 months .
The average age of a Timelord on his ( her ? ) first voyage has been 42 years and 2 months .
This is something that , I think , we should take into account when choosing the next regeneration , especially given Steven Moffat ’s ( admittedly ten year old ! ) comments on the subject : “ I do n’t think young , dashing Doctors are right at all .
He should be 40 - plus and weird - looking — the kind of wacky grandfather kids know on sight to be secretly one of them . ”

An exchange between then senator Fred Thompson and militiaman James Johnson on June 15 , 1995 , during a hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism , Technology & Government Information .
An excerpt from the Missouri Libertarian , Issue # 12 , July - August 1995 :
The militiamen made the excellent tactical move of bringing James Johnson , an Ohio Unorganized Militia leader and one of the founders of E Pluribus Unum , a political group , with them .
Mr. Johnson is black .
He stymies the tar - brush applied by government workers and “ liberals ” that militia groups are racist .
But Mr. Johnson is an effective political militiaman in his own right .
The closest that there came to be a true understanding between Senators and militiamen , government and citizen , was in the questions asked and answered between Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee , a conservative who questioned the need for more laws and policemen , and Mr. James Johnson , militiaman .

More than 50 soldiers killed in Russia clashes : opposition Agence France - Presse
Published : Saturday October 18 , 2008
Print This Email This MOSCOW ( AFP ) 
An opposition website in southern Russia said more than 50 soldiers were killed by militias on Saturday in clashes that officials told Russian news agencies had killed only two soldiers .
The Ingushetia.org website cited a local official from the interior ministry giving the casualty figure , which would represent one of the worst losses for Russian forces since the end of major combat operations in Chechnya .
The website also quoted hospital sources and its own correspondent .
Russian officials in Moscow and in the province of Ingushetia where the clashes took place could not be reached for comment on the report .
Ingushetia , a mainly Muslim province neighbouring war - ravaged Chechnya , has been racked by a growing number of attacks against security forces that are frequently blamed on separatist rebels and Islamist fighters .
" A source from the Sunzhensky region interior ministry said around 50 soldiers were killed " in a single attack in which armoured personnel carriers and trucks were also destroyed , the Ingushetia.org website reported .
Five more soldiers were killed in two other attacks , the website said .
Interfax news agency quoted local prosecutor Pavel Belyakov saying two interior ministry soldiers were killed and nine others were injured in an attack on a military column that was carried out by rebel fighters .
Officials earlier said two soldiers were killed and five injured .
" The situation in Ingushetia is under control , " Belyakov told Interfax , adding that Russian authorities had declared the area where the attack took place a " counter - terrorist operation zone . "
" A search of the area is currently taking place , the bandits who carried out the attack on a defence ministry military column are being tracked , " a spokesman for the armed forces in southern Russia , told Interfax .
Ingushetia.org said one attack occurred near the village of Galashki in which the 50 soldiers were killed , while another was on the road between the villages of Surkhakhi and Alkhasty where two more soldiers were killed .
There was also a third attack on a military column that had come as reinforcement to the road between Surkhakhi and Alkhasty in which at least three soldiers were killed , Ingushetia.org reported .
The website is highly critical of local authorities in Ingushetia .
Its owner , Magomed Yevloyev , a local opposition leader , was shot dead in a mysterious incident after being taken into police custody in August .
Following Saturday 's attacks , activists from the website said they were cancelling a demonstration to demand an objective inquiry into Yevloyev 's death that had been planned for Sunday in Ingushetia 's main city , Nazran .
In what appeared to be a separate incident , a car exploded in the village of Kantyshevo in Ingushetia , killing its driver in what reports quoted officials as saying could be the accidental detonation of a bomb intended for an attack .

Battered by outrage over the $ 440,000 it spent on a luxury retreat less than a week after the federal government loaned it $ 85 billion dollars , the giant AIG Insurance Company says it has called off plans to hold a second retreat next week at the exclusive Ritz - Carlton Resort in Half Moon Bay , California .
The Ritz - Carlton outing , like the earlier one , was to reward top independent insurance agents , which the company called a " standard industry practice . "
" I am somewhat relieved to hear that AIG has canceled their Ritz - Carlton conference , which was nothing less than a slap in the face of the American people , " said Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D - MD ) .
" I can not fathom how in the same day — the very same day — that AIG asked the government for another $ 37.8 billion loan , the company would even consider moving forward with plans to host another large conference at another luxury resort . "
Critics from President Bush 's spokesperson to Senator Obama have denounced AIG for holding an expensive retreat at a time of economic crisis .
The criticism has been " demoralizing " within AIG said Nicholas Ashooh , a spokesperson for AIG , " but we have to recognize that we 're in a different environment and we have to adjust to that .
AIG says it has instructed its worldwide managers to re-scrutinize how money is being spent .
" We 're certainly reviewing all our expenditures in light of financial circumstances and the fact that taxpayer dollars are helping to support AIG as we get through this difficult credit crisis , " said Ashooh .
Despite calling off the Half Moon Bay event , AIG says it will still have to pay for cancellation fees .
While the company would not specify how much money would be lost , a standard room at the Ritz Carlton , Half Moon Bay costs over $ 400 a night .
" We 'll certainly lose some money in cancellation fees , but it 's just beyond the point of trying to conduct these meetings given the uncertainty that 's taking place , " said Ashooh .

After 20 years living in a remote and derelict stone cottage without electricity , the famed tattooed ' leopard man of Skye ' has moved into a flat .
He tells Neil Stephen why , at 73 , life in the wild finally lost its charm
The leopard man has been domesticated .
After 20 years of living in the wilds on a remote part of Skye , the man made famous for his leopard tattoos has changed his spot for a one - bedroom apartment .
At 73 , Tom Leppard was starting to feel his age , and the weekly kayak trip across the fast - flowing Kyles of Lochalsh for supplies was taking its toll .
He was " one big wave away from disaster " , and when a friend offered him the chance to leave the shore of Loch na Bèiste for the comfort of four walls in the village of Broadford , he leapt at the chance .
When I meet him at his new sheltered housing , he does n't stand out among his neighbours - until you notice his tattoos .
His eyelids are an electric blue , his nose marked like a cat's , and his bald head an elaborate pattern of spots .
The 99.2 % of his body that has been covered made him , until recently , the most tattooed man in the world .
He welcomes me into his new home - one of two dozen units in a terrace - and offers a cup of tea .
His hands , tattooed palm and knuckle , are huge - a legacy of the hard life of outdoor graft he 's endured .
He 's wearing a pastel blue jumper and slip - on boots , and watching him shuffling about the kitchen , it 's hard to imagine how he coped with the Hebridean elements .
To describe the ruined cottage which he had made his home as primitive would be an understatement .
It had an earthen floor and no windows .
The thatch was gone , and the metal sheet roofing that spanned the drystone walls would not allow an adult to stand upright .
He slept on a bed fashioned from polystyrene board , and cooked on a primus stove .
His new accommodation has a proper bed and electricity , but little else in the way of mod cons .
He has a sofa and chair in the living room and a small table in the kitchen area , but the walls are bare .
" I have no interest in a TV , or a radio .
Nor do I want a telephone . "
In fact , he has very few possessions .
" My life has n't changed much - I never bothered people when I lived in the bothy [ hut ] , and they did n't bother me , and I 'm not really that interested in what else is going on outside . "
Tom put all he owned in a couple of bin bags when he moved .
He shows me his collection of books .
There are about 20 , mostly historical fiction about the Indian colonial wars .
He has read them all several times , but with his memory now failing , he enjoys rereading them .
There are no photographs - he has three brothers and several nephews and nieces , but he is not in touch with any of them , apart from a letter perhaps once a year .
" I 've not really got anything in common with my family - we'd have nothing to talk about , so there 's no point meeting them . "
He says he does not suffer from loneliness .
" I was in the armed forces for 28 years , and I enjoyed the solitary activities , such as parachute jumping , sailing and canoeing .
I made the decision 20 years ago that I wanted to escape the city , which I hated , and to live alone in the highlands of Scotland .
I have never been lonely since . "
Tom had n't collected a single tattoo in all his years in military service , including the navy , but he became " Mr Leppard " - his real name is Woodbridge - as a way of making cash .
He chose the spots not because of any particular interest in cats , but because they were easy for a tattoo artist to do .
The money he earned from his appearance helped fund his isolated existence .
" I would get an income from being the most tattooed man in the world , and would be photographed for the Guinness Book of Records , or featured on TV .
I had a spare set of dentures , shaped like fangs , that I 'd put in for the publicity shots .
But it was a necessary evil to supplement my income support , or latterly my pension .
It 's not something I enjoyed . "
It certainly made him famous among the people of Kyle , who would bump into Tom during his weekly shopping trip .
Queuing at the chemist , a wag might ask if he was after something " to clear up his spots " .
But according to Tom , he has never suffered any abuse , and people who come in contact with him , including children , are usually friendly .
" I do n't interfere in others people 's lives , and they do n't interfere in mine , but I probably go out more than some of my neighbours , who do n't venture beyond their back door .
Someone who looks in on me every couple of weeks , and there 's always someone who will say hello . "
He says he has no regrets about the life he chose , and is content with his move in to sheltered accommodation - he's at an age where he 's comfortable in his own skin , but also happy to accept help .
Standing out amid the neat orderliness of of his new home is a cat litter tray by the door .
I ask if he now has a cat to keep him company .
But it turns out he 's only looking after one for a couple of weeks .
" I would never have one .
They 're the most selfish creatures out , and they only care about themselves . "
And the leopard man of Skye smiles , without a fang in sight .
This is a very revealing bit of news from CNN Chief National Correspondent John King ( we ’ve heard repeatedly that John King is a big fan of John McCain , which heightens our interest in this news ) .
According to King , inside the McCain campaign , they ’re pretty much writing off the chances of winning not only New Mexico and Iowa , but Colorado with its nine electoral votes .
Without Colorado , McCain ’s path to victory is becoming non-existent .
Team McCain is basing all hope on the delusional idea McCain can win Pennsylvania :
The McCain campaign is looking at an Electoral College strategy heading into the final two weeks that has virtually no room for error and depends heavily on a dramatic comeback in Pennsylvania , which has n’t backed a Republican for president in 20 years .
While Iowa , New Mexico and Colorado are still officially listed as McCain target states , two top strategists and advisers tell CNN that the situation in those states looks increasingly bleak .
Iowa and New Mexico always have been viewed as difficult races , but the similar assessment of Colorado reflects a dramatic shift for a campaign that had long counted on the state .
“ Gone , ” was the word one top McCain insider used to describe those three states .
This source said while the polls in Colorado remain close , he and most others in the operation were of the opinion that the Obama campaign and its allies have a far superior ground / turnout operation and “ most of us have a hard time counting on Colorado . ”
This begs the question of whether Chuck Todd will finally tilt Colorado to Obama .
NBC ’s map has had Obama at 264 electoral votes for the past couple weeks .
Colorado would put him over 270 electoral votes in NBC ’s projections .

Tuesday , July 29 , 2008 WASHINGTON — Iraq has increased crude oil exports by more than 10 - fold since 2007 .
The report , saying exports reached 12 million barrels per month for much of 2008 , cited a project to protect the 95 - kilometer pipeline from Kirkuk to the refinery at Baji , Middle East Newsline reported .
Also In This Edition Amazon.com Widgets " From July 2007 to May 2008 , northern crude oil exports have increased by approximately 91.3 million barrels or more approximately $ 8.215 billion , " said the report , basing its revenue estimates on $ 90 per barrel of oil .

If you wonder why so many children have ADD , it 's because aspartame destroys the brain - especially in the area of learning .
This is a study from Norway in 2001 .
Abstract : Introduction : Aspartame ( ASM ) is a product that was originally made for diabetics , but today ASM is widely used by healthy people as artificial sweetener in many food products .
Purpose :
The main goal with this research was to see whether ASM was harmful to brain cells ( cerebellar granule cells ) .
We wanted to check if the damage to the neurons are connected to the N - methyl - D- aspartate ( NMDA ) - receptors on these cells .
Procedure : Brain cells from 7 day old mice were used .
They were cultured in 24 well dishes and different quantities of ASM were added .
After 7 days the cultures were analysed by two different tests : Lactate dehydrogenases ( LDH ) test , which gives a picture of cell death ( LDH leakage to the medium in which the cells were cultured ) .
3­[4,5-dimethylthiazol -2yl ] -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromid ( MIT ) test , which can be used to analyse mitochondrial activity in living cells .
To test whether the NMDA­receptor was involved in the damage done by ASM , the receptor was blocked by ( ± ) ­2- amino -5 phosphonopentanocid ( AP5 ) .
Results :
Our results showed damage / cell death from an added quantity of 0,06 mg / ml ASM each day for 4 days .
As a comparison there is 0,24 mg /rnl ASM in Cola light MTT - and LDH - tests showed damage to the neurons at an added quantity of 1.5 and 3.00 mg /ml ASM after 22 hours of incubation .
The results also show that ASM is in part acting through the NMDA - receptor because AP5 reduced or blocked the damage to the granule cells .
Conclusion :
In light of these results our conclusion is that in order to be on the safe side it should be warned against use of ASM as a food additive , maybe especially in products consumed by children , because NMDA - receptors and the synapses involved also are connected to learning .

American Free Press
The fact that a Spanish skyscraper is still standing after an intense
fire consumed the steel and concrete tower for 24 hours provides real
world evidence that fire alone does not cause high - rise towers to
collapse .
As an intense fire consumed the 32 - story Windsor Building in Madrid's
business district , the press reports all began with the words " fear
of collapse . "
After 24 hours , however , the tower , which was a similar
construction to the twin towers of the World Trade Center , remained
standing .
The fact that an extremely severe fire did not cause the Spanish
steel and concrete tower to collapse raises serious questions about
the events of 9/11 and how they have been explained .
Why did the
Windsor Building remain standing when similar towers in New York City
collapsed completely after being affected by much less intense fires
burning for considerably shorter periods of time ?
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) sponsored engineers to
conduct the World Trade Center Building Performance Study ( BPS ) to
examine how the buildings of the WTC responded to the airplane
crashes and fires that allegedly caused the collapses of the twin
towers and WTC 7 , a 47 - story office building on the next block .
" Prior to September 11 , 2001 , there was little , if any , record of
fire - induced collapse of large fire - protected steel buildings , " the
BPS says in the chapter about the mysterious collapse of WTC 7 , the
third tower to collapse on 9/11 .
WTC 7 was not hit by aircraft or
large pieces of debris and had only sporadic fires .
At about 5:25
p.m. , WTC 7 , owned by Larry Silverstein , collapsed in what appeared
to be a controlled demolition .
It would be more accurate to say that no steel framed high - rise , like
WTC 7 , has ever collapsed due to fire .
The fact that the Windsor
Building is still standing is proof that fire alone does not cause
properly constructed steel and concrete towers to collapse .
Dr. W. Gene Corley , Senior Vice President of Construction Technology
Laboratories ( CTL ) of Skokie , Ill. , was team leader of the engineers
who wrote the BPS .
CTL is a subsidiary of the Portland Cement Association and " provides
structural and architectural engineering , testing , and materials
technology services throughout the U.S. and internationally . "
According to its website , " CTL ’s expertise extends beyond cement and
concrete , encompassing virtually all structural systems and
construction materials . "
WACO , OKLAHOMA CITY , AND WTC
Corley served as expert adviser during the government 's investigation
of the 1993 fatal fire at the Branch Davidian complex in Waco , Texas .
In 1995 , Corley led a Building Performance Assessment Team ( BPAT )
investigation of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City .
In September 2001 , once again , Corley was selected to
head the team to study building performance after the attack on New
York ’s World Trade Center .
In the executive summary of the WTC study , Corley wrote that
secondary fires caused the twin towers to collapse :
" The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear
to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses .
However , as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the
buildings , it ignited much of the buildings ' contents , causing
simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings , " Corley
wrote .
" Over a period of many minutes , this heat induced additional
stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously
softening and weakening these frames .
This additional loading and the
resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both
structures . "
In the section that deals with the collapse of the twin towers , the
BPS says : " Because the aircraft impacts into the two buildings are
not believed to have been sufficient to cause collapse without the
ensuing fires , the obvious question is whether the fires alone ,
without the damage from the aircraft impact , would have been
sufficient to cause such a collapse … it is impossible , without
extensive modeling and other analysis , to make a credible prediction
of how the buildings would have responded to an extremely severe fire
in a situation where there was no prior structural damage . "
The Windsor Building fire in Madrid provides an excellent real - world
model to show how the twin towers should have responded to " an
extremely severe fire " alone .
The Windsor Building has central
support columns in its core section , which is similar to the
construction of the twin towers .
This central core is what supported
the gravity load of the towers .
In the Windsor Building fire , the fire is thought to have started on
the 21st floor late on Saturday night , Feb. 12 .
The upper floors were
consumed by intense fire for at least 18 hours .
The fire moved down
the building and burned the entire structure .
The fire is reported to
have burned temperatures of at 800 degrees Celsius , or nearly 1,500
degrees Fahrenheit .
There was a partial collapse of parts of the top 10 floors as the
trusses , which went from the core columns to the outside walls ,
appear to have failed .
It is important to note , however , that the
lower floors did not collapse and the core section is still standing
with a construction crane on the roof .
The complete failure of the 47 - central support columns in the twin
towers of the WTC is one of the key outstanding questions about what
caused their collapses .
It would be expected that they should have
remained standing even if some of the floor trusses failed .
There is
no explanation for what caused the huge box columns to fail .
Two of the contractors who removed the rubble told AFP that they had
found molten steel in the 7th basement level when they reached the
bedrock where the columns were based .
There is no explanation for
what caused such intense residual heat to be found at the base of the
twin towers , although some experts have pointed to powerful
explosives .
By press time , Dr. Corley had not responded to questions about the
BPS findings and the questions raised by the Windsor Building fire .
Corley 's assistant told AFP that he had just gone to the airport and
would not be returning to the office until Feb. 28 .
The Windsor Building was built from 1973 - 1979 in an area of Madrid
where commercial property was developed on land owned by Rio Tinto ,
the international mining giant .
This is thought to be the reason why
the Windsor Building carries the name of the British royal family .
The WTC towers were completed in the early 1970's .
The Windsor Building housed the offices of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu ,
a multinational financial services company , which occupied 20 floors
of the tower .
The area where the Windsor Building stands is a mixed residential and
commercial area known as the AZCA zone .
Dubbed ' Madrid 's Manhattan ' ,
AZCA contains a cluster of modern skyscrapers .
The tallest one is the
Torre Picasso , a 516 - foot tower built in 1989 .
The Picasso Tower was
designed by Minoru Yamasaki , who also designed the twin towers of the
WTC .
Unión de Explosivos Río Tinto , S.A. , owns the land where the
tower stands .
Finis
The Windsor Building ( Edificio Windsor ) in Madrid , Spain burned " like
a torch " for more than 18 hours from Saturday night , Feb. 12 .
After
burning in an uncontrolled inferno the tower 's core columns remain
standing with a huge construction crane on top of the roof .
This
evidence supports the fact that prior to 9/11 NO steel - framed high -
rise had ever collapsed due to fire .
On 9/11 the 47 - story WTC 7 ,
owned by Larry Silverstein , collapsed at 5:25 p.m .
There is no
explanation for why the WTC 7 collapsed except for the fact that
Silverstein told PBS that the decision was made to " pull it " and " we
watched it come down . "
Plans to build support for identity cards by introducing them among ' guinea pig ' groups , such as airport staff and students , are in crisis after 10,000 airline pilots vowed to take legal action to block them and opposition swept through Britain 's universities and councils .
In a move that could wreck the government 's strategy for a phased introduction beginning next year , the British Airline Pilots Association ( Balpa ) said it would seek a judicial review rather than see its members forced to adopt ID cards at a time when pilots are already exhaustively vetted .
Balpa 's vehement opposition is a hammer blow for the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , who had hoped to win the wider public over to ID cards by demonstrating that they were crucial to anti-terrorism policies .
She intends to introduce them among groups ' who operate in positions of trust in our society ' .
In a speech in March , Smith said : ' The first cards will be issued , from 2009 , to groups where there is a compelling need for reassurance that someone is who they say they are . '
But Balpa , which represents more than 10,000 pilots working on 28 airlines , backed by the Trades Union Congress , insists that ID cards will ' do nothing ' to enhance airport or flight security , and it fears that information about its members stored on a National Identity Register could be abused .
Jim McAuslan , general secretary of Balpa , told The Observer : ' Our members are incensed by the way they have been targeted as guinea pigs in a project which will not improve security .
We will leave no stone unturned in our attempts to prevent this , including legal action to force a judicial review if necessary . '
From late 2010 ministers intend to start issuing ID cards to ' young people ' , particularly students , on a voluntary basis in a further attempt to win the population round .
Then around 2012 everyone applying for a passport will have to be on the National Identity Register .
However , the anti-ID card campaign group , NO2ID , is mobilising what it says is ' a wave of student opposition ' to ID cards on campuses across the country .
More than 40 local authorities , as well as the Scottish parliament and the Welsh and London assemblies , have passed motions opposing ID cards .
Without the co-operation of councils , which would use ID cards to verify benefit claimants and those wanting to use public services , the entire project would fail to get off the ground .
Home Office officials insist that the plans remain on track .
Ministers say ID cards , expected to cost around £ 100 a head , cannot be introduced on a compulsory basis without a further vote in parliament .

CSS Template Layout Module W3C Working Group Note 26 March 2015

Abstract
CSS is a simple , declarative language for creating style sheets that specify the rendering of HTML and other structured documents .
This Note contains experimental ideas for layout templates and alternative layout models in CSS .
At the moment , it defines a typographic grid for CSS .
It has features to set up a grid - based template , to style the slots of the template and to flow content into them .
A grid template can be seen as a cross between table layout ( align blocks of text automatically in two - dimensions ) and absolute positioning ( position elements in arbitrary order ) , but it also has unique features of its own .
Grid templates can also be associated with pages in paged media ( via ‘ @page ’ ) , to create page templates .
Slots can form chains , to create non-rectangular regions .
A chain of slots is like a series of small pages : content is broken at possible page breaks and distributed over the slots .
Region - based styling allows content to be styled not only based on its position in the document tree , but also based on the slot it finds itself in .
This is achieved by allowing slot names to appear in selectors .

This draft combines ideas from earlier drafts on Template Layout , Grid Positioning [ CSS3GRID ] and Grid Layout [ CSS - GRID - 1 ] .
Issues on this draft are mentioned in the text itself and / or in the on-line Tracker under “ Details on Product CSS3 Template Layout . ”
This document currently serves as a repository for ideas around using templates for laying out elements , regions or pages ; and for various alternative layout models .
It is expected to be updated , but it is not expected to become a W3C Recommendation in this form .
Instead , ideas may migrate to other modules of CSS .
Table of contents
1. Introduction
( This section is not normative . )
1.1 . Summary and use cases
The styling of a Web page , a form or a graphical user interface can roughly be divided into two parts : ( 1 ) defining the overall “ grid ” of the page or window and ( 2 ) specifying the fonts , indents , colors , etc. , of the text and other objects .
The two are not completely separate , of course , because indenting or coloring a text influences the perceived grid as well .
Nevertheless , when one separates the parts of a style that should change when the window gets bigger from the parts that stay the same , one often finds that the grid changes ( different number of columns and rows , different order for the blocks of content , less or more open space between those blocks , etc. ) , while fonts , colors , indents , numbering styles , and many other things do n't have to change , until the size of the window becomes extreme .
The properties in this specification associate a layout grid with an element ( or with a page , see below ) .
Rather than rendering all descendants of an element in a single flow , they give an element multiple flows , called slots , placed on an invisible grid by means of a grid template .
The descendants are given a ‘ flow ’ property to designate the slot into which they flow .
Because layouts on the Web have to adapt to different window and paper sizes , the rows and columns of the grid can be made fixed or flexible in size .
In some typographical traditions , the slots are called “ fields ” or “ spatial zones . ”
Traditionally , also , all columns have the same width , called the “ module ” or “ unit . ”
The horizontal lines of a grid that define the rows are sometimes called “ flow lines . ”
Some traditions make the space between pieces of content an explicit part of the grid , some consider the space part of the content :
Both styles are possible in CSS , the latter by using the ‘ margin ’ property , the former by using the ‘ . ’ symbol in a grid template .
The typical use cases for these properties include :
Complex
Web pages , with multiple navigation bars in fixed positions , areas for advertisements , etc .
Complex forms , where the alignment of labels and form fields may be easier with the properties of this module than with the properties for tables , floats and margins .
GUIs , where buttons , toolbars , labels , icons , etc. , are aligned in complex ways and have to stay aligned ( and not wrap , for example ) when the window is resized .
Paged displays ( e.g. , printed media ) where each page is divided into fixed areas for different kinds of content .
Complex pages with multiple regions , where the style of the text does not only depend on the type of element it comes from , but also on the region it is displayed in ( region - based styling ) .
Paged displays with complex running headers and footers , e.g. , running headers that are in between parts of the page content , rather than at the edge of the page .
Once a grid template has been defined , it can also be used to position elements without adding them to a flow .
Setting ‘ display : grid ’ on a grid element makes all children into separate flows and automatically distributes them over the grid .
This is explained in CSS Grid Layout [ CSS - GRID - 1 ] .
Template - based positioning makes many traditional uses of absolute positioning unnecessary .
Like absolute positioning , grid templates are especially useful for aligning elements that do n't have simple relationships in the source ( parent - child , ancestor - descendant , immediate sibling ) .
But in contrast to absolute positioning , the elements are not positioned with the help of horizontal and vertical coordinates , but by flowing them into a template that is very much like a table :
The size and alignment of elements are governed implicitly by the rows and columns of the template , and can automatically adapt to the overall size of the element and to the content in each row and column .
In this example , the four children of an element are assigned to four slots ( called a , b , c and d ) in a 2×2 template .
( All mark - up examples in this specification are HTML fragments , unless otherwise stated . ) < style type =" text /css " > dl { grid : " a b " " c d " } # sym1 { flow : a } # lab1 { flow : b } #sym2 { flow : c } # lab2 { flow : d } </style > < dl > < dt id=sym1 > A < dd id=lab1 > A is een aapje < dt id=sym2 > B < dd id=lab2 > B is de bakker </ dl >
Try it out !
( Uses a JavaScript emulation in browsers that do not implement grid templates natively . )
Templates can also help with device - independence .
This example uses Media Queries [ MEDIAQ ] to change the overall layout of a page from 3 - column layout for a wide screen to a 1 - column layout for a narrow screen .
It assumes the page has been marked - up with logical sections with IDs .
@media all { body { grid : " a a a " " b c d " } #head { flow : a } #nav { flow : b } #adv { flow : c } #body { flow : d } } @media all and ( max - width : 500 px ) { body { grid : " a " " b " " c " } #head { flow : a } #nav { flow : b } #adv { display : none } #body { flow : c } }
The slots in a grid do not overlap , unless with negative margins .
Here is how the “ zunflower ” design of the CSS Zen Garden could be done : # container {grid : " A B C" } # container : : slot ( A ) {box - shadow : 0.5 em 0.5 em 0.5 em ; z-index : 1} # container : : slot ( B ) {box - shadow : 0.5 em 0.5 em 0.5 em ; margin - left : - 2em} # intro {flow :
A} #supportingText {flow :
B} #linkList {flow : C}
Template - based positioning borrows some concepts from table layout , in particular the idea of aligning elements in rows and columns , so that they constrain one another 's size .
But there are also differences .
This example shows some of them .
Assume this document fragment : < div class=group > < div > aa aa aa aa aa aa< /div > < div>bbb</div > < div class=menu>ccccc</div> </div>
We can lay it out as three columns , as the following illustrations show .
The style sheet would contain the following .
. group {display : table} .group > div {display : table - cell}
We can also use a template , in which case the style sheet would contain this : . group {grid : " a b c" } .group > div {flow : a} .group > div + div {flow : b} .group > div + div + div {flow : c} By default , the table is as wide as needed to fit its contents .
To make sure it is as wide as its containing block , we need to add .group {display : table ; width : 100%}
That is not needed for the grid template , but , on the other hand , if we want the template to fit its contents , we would need to say so : . group {grid : " a b c " ; width : fit - content} ( See [ CSS3BOX ] for the definition of the ‘ width ’ property . )
The columns of the template are by default all the same size .
The columns of the table satisfy certain constraints , but their sizes may differ .
We can make them all the same by adding a rule ( see [ CSS3TBL ] ) : . group {display : table ; width : 100 % ; table - layout : fixed}
In both styles , we can set a column to a certain size : div:nth - child ( 3 ) { width : 3em} resp. , .group {grid : * * 3em " a b c "}
If there is an unknown number of columns ( children of the div.group element ) , the style sheet for the table model will automatically take them into account .
The style sheet for the template model , however , creates a template of exactly three columns and can't handle tables with an unknown number of columns .
The extra elements will be added into the default slot ( in this case the ‘ a ’ slot ) .
( However , setting ‘ display ’ to ‘ grid ’ on the grid element creates a different kind of grid , that does grow , see “ Comparison with ‘ display : grid ’ and ‘ display : inline - grid ’ ” below . )
In both models , elements can have borders , but only in the table model can borders be collapsed , which makes setting borders easier in the table model : . group {display : table ; border - collapse : collapse} .group > div {border : solid} resp. , . group > div {border : solid ; border - left : none} .group > div:first - child {border - left : solid}
In the template model , the order of the elements is explicit , and thus it is possible to reverse the order of the columns : . group > div {flow : c} .group > div + div {flow : b} .group > div + div + div {flow : a}
In the table model , the order of the rows and columns is given by the document source and thus can not be changed .
[ Editorial note : Remove this example if the ‘ content ’ property will not be allowed on elements , as it is currently expected to be . ]
This example shows a way to move notes to the end of a section .
“ Notes ” in this example refers to elements in HTML with a class of “ note ” .
A fragment of HTML such as < div class=section > < p> The balubious coster of the fifth secter < span class=note >
The sixth secter coster is a difter manon .</ span > of The Rollow Carpug mentizes a costernica . < p >… </ div > with this style sheet div.section { grid : " * " " F " } .note { flow : F ; content : counter ( note ) " .\ A0 " contents ; counter - increment : note ; font - size : smaller} .note : : before { content : counter ( note ) ; vertical - align : super ; font - size : larger} results in a rendering similar to this :
The “ Generated content for paged media ” module [ CSS3GCPM ] is expected to define specific features for footnotes that are both easier and more powerful than this example .
This example shows the use of chained regions : text from region 1 continues in region 2 , 3 and 4 .
And it shows how to use pseudo - elements to style text in a particular region : text in region 1 is bigger than in other regions .
We assume a document fragment similar to this : < div id=article > < h1 > Introduction </h1 > < p > < img src=" sunset " alt= " " >
< p > This is an example …
< h1 > More Details </h1 > < p > This illustrates … < p > Then , the example … < p > Finally , this …
</ div >
The style sheet makes the DIV into a grid element with five regions , called A , * , b , c and d .
The regions are grouped into two chains : region A on its own , and the chain consisting of * , b , c and d. #article { grid : " A A c " " A A c " " * * c " " a b c " ; chains : * a b c } The ‘ * ’ is a special name .
It indicates the default slot , the slot where content goes if it does n't have an explicit ‘ flow ’ property .
We could have used a normal letter and added an explicit ‘ flow ’ property to the children of the DIV , but by using * we do n't have to .
All children thus go into region * ( and continue in a , b and c as needed ) .
The IMG element goes into region A .
We assume for simplicity that there is only one IMG element : #article img { flow : A } The text in region * is bolder , larger and a different color than in the other regions .
Also , an H1 that falls into this region is rendered differently from other H1s : @region ::slot ( * ) { * { font - weight : bold ; color : # 0C3D5 F ; font - size : larger } h1 { color : crimson ; display : run -in } } ( For brevity , the example does n't show the style rules to set the color and background , to make the text justified , add the left border to the second H1 , etc . )
As the image shows , the text of the last paragraph is n't complete and presumably continues somewhere else , but that part is outside the scope of this example .
In paged media , we could attach the grid template to a page instead of an element and let the text continue on the next page ; we could also make slot c into a multi-column element so that the text forms additional columns to the right of current image ( see [ CSS3GCPM ] for some ideas ) , or there could be a scrollbar on slot c .
This example shows three ways to align the contents of a fixed - height paragraph to the bottom of the box : Method 1 P {height : 20 em ; grid : " . " " * " fit-content} Method 2
P {height : 20 em ; grid : " * " } P:: slot ( * ) {vertical - align : bottom} Method 3 [ Editorial note : Remove method 3 if vertical - align will not be generalized to apply to all blocks . ]
P {height : 20 em ; vertical - align : bottom}
However , the styles differ in case the content is taller than 20 em and overflows : the first style has a baseline - aligned content which will thus overflow below the element 's box ; the second example has bottom - aligned content , which will thus overflow above the element 's box .
This example ( based on a challenge by Andrew Fedoniouk ) shows how a grid template can be used to display six items in two rows of three .
Assume the following document : < p > < span >...</ span > < span >...</ span > < span >...</ span > < span >...</ span > < span >...</ span > < span >...</ span > </p>
The simplest way to break this into two lines ( or more ) is to add a hard line break after the third SPAN : ‘ span :nth - child ( 3 ) :: after {content : " \A " ; white - space : pre} ’.
That works fine , unless the SPANs are inline blocks (‘ span {display : inline - block} ’ ) .
Another way is to float all SPANs and add a ‘ clear ’ property on the fourth : ‘ span { float : left} span :nth - child ( 4 ) {clear : left} ’.
But if the SPANs have different heights or baselines , their vertical alignment will be different than if they were on the same line .
With a grid template , we can say that the P has not one , but two flows , a and b , the second one positioned below the first ; and then we assign the fourth and subsequent SPANs to the “ b ” flow .
( The others automatically go into the default , first flow . ) p {grid : " a " " b" } span : nth - child ( n +4 ) { flow : b} This almost works .
There is just a subtle issue with the spaces between the SPANs .
We moved the last three SPANs to flow b , but we have no way to move the spaces between them .
They remain in the default ( first ) slot .
( They collapse , as there is nothing left between them , so we do n't actually see them anymore . )
To get spaces between the SPANs in slot b , we need to generate new spaces : span:nth - child ( n+4 ) : : after {content : " " }
This space handling is not very intuitive .
One might expect there to be a way to say “ select everything from this element onward ” or maybe a pseudo - element selector for the text between elements .
Or a new property to specify different ways to handle the anonymous text inside a grid element .
For the moment , there is no such thing .
Suggestions are welcome .
If , on the other hand , we do n't want spaces between the SPANs , then the question becomes how to get rid of the spaces between the SPANs in the first row .
There are several ways of doing that .
One way is to explicitly flow the three first SPANs to slot “ a ” : span {flow : a} The SPANs are thus taken out of the P , causing the P's spaces to end up next to each other at the start of flow “ a ” and collapse away .
Another , maybe more intuitive way is to set the spaces to zero width in the P , and then back to normal in the SPANs ( see ‘ word - spacing ’ in [ CSS - TEXT - 3 ] ) : p {word - spacing : - 100 % } span {word - spacing : normal} [ Editorial note : Remove this last method if percentage values on ‘ word - spacing ’ will not be allowed .
They currently ( March 2015 ) have Working Draft status . ]
This example uses a page - based template to create a running header that is not at the top of the page , but exactly in the middle .
We need to define our own page template for this , because the predefined page template of [ CSS3PAGE ] only has margin boxes along the edge of the page .
@page { grid : " top - half " " running - header " 3em " bottom - half " ; chains : top - half bottom - half } ::slot ( running - header ) { content : " My Magazine - page " counter ( page ) " - February 2013 " ; text - align : center ; vertical - align : middle ; border : solid ; margin : 1em 0 ; }

1.4 . A note about accessibility
( This section is not normative . )
The facilities in this specification allow elements from a document to be displayed in a visual order that is to a large extent independent of the order in the document .
That may have both positive and negative effects on accessibility .
The positive aspect is that it allows the content in the document to be kept in logical order , so that the document is as functional as possible without the style sheet and on media where the style sheet does n't apply .
A negative aspect is that a document that has a defined tab order ( the order in which elements get the focus when the tab - key is pressed ) will show on the screen with a tab order unrelated to the visual order .
It may be necessary to use the keyboard control features of the CSS Basic User Interface module [ CSS3UI ] to ensure that the tab navigation follows the visual order , or to refrain from positioning semantically related elements in different parts of a template .
The following two requirements from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( WCAG ) 2.0 [ WCAG20 ] are particularly relevant .
See that specification for more information .
2.4.3 Focus Order : If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect meaning or operation , focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability .
( Level A )
2. Stack of cards layout
This is a placeholder .
A stack is a layout model based on the metaphor of a stack of index cards : sibling elements are formatted as boxes ( “ cards ” ) of the same size at the same position with a tab sticking out at one side that contains a title for that card .
All tabs are visible ( and automatically positioned so they overlap as little as possible ) , but only one box is visible at a time .
In an interactive UA , the user can activate a card ( e.g. , by clicking on a tab , or by pressing page - down ) , which displays that card and hides all the others in the stack .
E.g. , a rule ‘ display : stack ’ could make an element into a stack of cards ( all children become cards , sized to the largest among them ) and ‘ display : tab ’ could make their descendants into titles for the cards .
Maybe other properties determine the style of the tabs and on which side they display ( top , bottom , left or right ) .
3 . Declaring templates
Grid templates are declared with the ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , ‘ grid - template - rows ’ , ‘ grid - template - columns ’ and ‘ grid ’ properties , defined below .
An element that has a grid template is called a grid element .
More precisely : an element is a grid element if ( 1 ) it generates a block container box [ CSS21 ] and ( 2 ) at least one of ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , ‘ grid - template - rows ’ or ‘ grid - template - columns ’ has a value other than the initial value .
Block containers are , informally , elements that can have block elements as children , such as blocks , inline blocks or table cells , but not inline elements or replaced elements .
An element 's grid ancestor is the nearest ancestor that is a grid element .
Note that not all elements have a grid ancestor .
E.g. , the root element has none .
The number of columns of a grid element is the number of < col - width > values in ‘ grid- template - columns ’ or the number of columns in ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , whichever is larger .
The number of rows is the number of < row - height > values in ‘ grid - template - rows ’ or the number of rows in ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , whichever is larger .
Note that a grid element always has at least one row and one column .
Those may , however , have zero size .
3.1 . Declaring a template : ‘ grid-template - areas ’
The ‘ grid - template - areas ’ property implicitly assigns a grid to an element and defines named slots in the grid .
It can also designate a slot as the default slot for content without an explicit flow .
Name : grid-template - areas Value : none | < string > +
Initial : none Applies to : block container elements [ CSS21 ] and grid container elements [ CSS - GRID - 1 ]
Inherited : no Animatable : no Percentages : N/ A Media : visual Computed value : specified value Canonical order : per grammar
Each string consist of one or more asterisks ( “ * ” ) , identifiers , periods ( “. ” ) , spaces and tabs .
Each string represents one row in the template , each symbol other than a space or tab represents one column in that row .
Spaces and tabs have no meaning .
They separate identifiers and may also be added for readability .
The symbols in the template have the following meaning
< identifier >
Named slot for content .
* ( Asterisk . )
Default slot for content ( explained below ) . . ( Period . )
Blank space .
Multiple identical identifiers in adjacent rows or columns form a single slot that spans those rows and columns .
Ditto for multiple “ * ” s .
Slot names are case - sensitive , so uppercase and lowercase letters are considered to be different letters .
Case - sensitivity should instead be defined by reference to the definition of identifiers , probably in css3-values .
Non-rectangular slots and multiple slots with the same name are illegal .
A template without any slot name or “ * ” is illegal .
A template with more than one “ * ” slot is illegal .
Strings with different numbers of columns ( before padding with “. ” , see the next paragraph ) are illegal .
These errors cause the declaration to be ignored .
Note : non-rectangular and disconnected regions may be permitted in a future update of CSS .
If there are fewer symbols in a string than the number of columns in the element , the string is implicitly padded with “ . ” ( period ) symbols .
Likewise , if there are fewer strings than the number of rows in the element , additional strings consisting of “ . ” ( period ) symbols are implicitly added .
Each slot ( identifier or “ * ” ) acts as a block element for its contents .
If the value is ‘ none ’ , then no explicit slots are defined .
If the element is a grid element , then the element instead has an implicit template consisting of a single ‘ * ’ slot .
Note that an element is a grid element in this case if ‘ grid- template - columns ’ and ‘ grid - template - rows ’ are not both ‘ auto ’.
For example , the following two sets of style rules are equivalent : DIV { grid - template - areas : none ; grid- template - rows : 10 em 10 em 10 em ; grid- template - columns : * * * * } and DIV { grid - template - areas : " ****" " ****" "**** " ; grid -template - rows : 10 em 10 em 10 em ; grid=columns : * * * * }
Authors should be aware that naming slots with Hebrew or Arabic letters may cause some text editors to display the CSS rule with the slot name of the string on the right .
However , the first symbol in each string corresponds to the first value in ‘ grid- template - columns ’ and thus represents the leftmost column in the rendering of the document .
Only a block container element can be a grid element .
E.g. , in the following document , the elements with ID “ one , ” “ three ” and “ five ” are grid elements , but the ‘ grid ’ property on “ two ” and “ four ” has no effect .
< html > < style > # one {grid : " a b c" } # two {grid : " a " " b" } # three {display : inline - block ; grid : " a b " " c d" } # four {grid : " a @ " } # five {grid : " a b"} </ style > < table > < tr id=four > < td >... < td id=five >... </ table > < ol > < li id=one > ... < span id=three >... </ span >... < li > ... < em id =two >... </em >... </ol >
3.2 . Specifying the widths of columns : ‘ grid-template - columns ’
Name : grid-template - columns Value : auto | < col - width > +
Initial : auto Applies to : block container elements and grid container elements Inherited : no Animatable : yes , between grids with the same number of tracks Percentages : N/ A Media : visual Computed value : specified value Canonical order : per grammar
The ‘ grid - template - columns ’ property specifies the sizes of the columns of a grid .
Where
The definition of minmax is n't correct , it should only accepts certain values .
Each < col - width > sets the width of a column , the first value for the leftmost column , the second for the second column , etc .
If there are fewer < col - width > values than the number of columns in the element , or if the value is ‘ auto ’ , the missing columns widths are all ‘ * ’.
Each < col - width > can be one of the following :
< length >
An explicit width for that column .
Negative values are illegal .
< fraction > ( A non-negative number followed by ‘ fr ’. )
A fraction of the remaining space .
‘ 1 fr ’ means the same as ‘ * ’ * ( Asterisk . )
All columns with a width of ‘ * ’ have the same width .
< percentage >
Expresses a size as a percentage of the element 's a - priori content width .
When the width of the grid element is dependent on content , the result is undefined .
max - content min-content
The column 's width is determined by its contents .
See the algorithm below .
minmax ( p , q )
The column 's width is constrained to be greater than or equal to p and less than or equal to q .
p and q stand for [ < length > | max - content | min-content | * ] .
There may be white space around the p and q .
If q < p , then q is ignored and ‘ minmax ( p , q ) ’ is treated as ‘ minmax ( p , p ) ’. fit-content Equivalent to ‘ minmax ( min - content , max - content ) ’.
3.3 . Specifying the height of rows : ‘ grid-template - rows ’
Name : grid -template - rows Value : auto | < row - height > +
Initial : auto Applies to : block container elements and grid container elements Inherited : no Animatable : yes , between grids with the same number of tracks Percentages : N/ A Media : visual Computed value : specified value Canonical order : per grammar
The ‘ grid - template - rows ’ property specifies the heights of the rows of a grid .
The definition of minmax is n't correct , it should only accepts certain values .
Note that the syntax is the same syntax as for ‘ grid- template - columns ’
Each < row - height > sets the height of a row , the first value for the topmost row , the second for the second row , etc .
If there are fewer < row - height > values than the number of rows in the element , or if the value is ‘ auto ’ , the missing row heights are all ‘ fit- content ’.
Each < row - height > can be one of the following :
< length >
An explicit height for that row .
Negative values are illegal .
< fraction > ( A non-negative number followed by ‘ fr ’. )
A fraction of the remaining space .
‘ 1 fr ’ means the same as ‘ * ’ * ( asterisk )
All rows with a height of ‘ * ’ have the same height .
< percentage >
Expresses a size as a percentage of the element 's a - priori content height .
When the height of the grid element is dependent on content , the result is undefined .
max - content min-content
The row 's height is determined by its contents .
See the algorithm below .
minmax ( p , q )
The row 's height is constrained to be greater than or equal to p and less than or equal to q .
p and q stand for [ < length > | max - content | min-content | * ] .
There may be white space around the p and q .
If q < p , then q is ignored and ‘ minmax ( p , q ) ’ is treated as ‘ minmax ( p , p ) ’. fit-content Equivalent to ‘ minmax ( min - content , max - content ) ’.
3.4 . The ‘ grid ’ and ‘ grid-template ’ shorthand properties
Name : grid -template Value : none | < col - width > * [ [ < string > < row - height > ? ]+ | ‘ / ’ < row - height > + ]
Initial : none Applies to : block container elements and grid container elements Inherited : no Animatable : see individual properties Percentages : see individual properties Media : visual Computed value : see individual properties Canonical order : N / A
Name : grid Value : <‘ grid-template ’> | <‘ grid-auto - flow ’> [ <‘ grid-auto - columns ’> [ / <‘ grid-auto - rows ’> ]? ]
Initial : See individual properties Applies to : block container elements and grid container elements Inherited : no Animatable : see individual properties Percentages : see individual properties Media : visual Computed value : see individual properties Canonical order : N / A
The ‘ grid - template ’ property is a shorthand for ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , ‘ grid - template - columns ’ and ‘ grid - template - rows ’ and is equivalent to setting those properties as follows :
‘ grid-template - areas ’ is set to the list of < string > values .
If the value contains a slash ( “ / ” ) instead of strings , ‘ grid - template - areas ’ is set to n strings of m asterisks ( “ * ” ) each , where n is the number of < row - height > values and m the number of < col - width > values .
’ is set to the list of values .
If the value contains a slash ( “ / ” ) instead of strings , ‘ ’ is set to strings of asterisks ( “ * ” ) each , where is the number of values and the number of values .
‘ grid-template - rows ’ is set to the list of < row - height > values , with any omitted ones set to ‘ fit-content ’.
’ is set to the list of values , with any omitted ones set to ‘ ’. ‘ grid-template - columns ’ is set to the list of < col - width > values , or to ‘ auto ’ if there are none .
The ‘ grid ’ property is a shorthand for setting ‘ grid - template - areas ’ , ‘ grid - template - rows ’ , ‘ grid- template ’ columns ' , ‘ grid - auto - rows ’ , ‘ grid-auto - columns ’ , and ‘ grid - auto - flow ’ in a single declaration .
See [ CSS - GRID - 1 ] .
Note that ‘ grid - auto - rows ’ , ‘ grid-auto - columns ’ , and ‘ grid - auto - flow ’ only apply if ‘ display ’ is ‘ grid ’ or ‘ inline - grid ’.
For example , the rule grid : * 10em " a b c " " a b d " 4em is the same as grid - template - columns : * 10 em ; grid - template - areas : " a b c " " a b d " ; grid - template - rows : auto 4em ; … and the values for ‘ grid - auto - rows ’ , ‘ grid-auto - columns ’ , and ‘ grid - auto - flow ’ are set to their default values .
( Omitted for clarity . )
Note the ‘ auto ’ keyword that was implied in the shorthand , but must be made explicit in the ‘ grid - template - rows ’ property .
Also note that the width of the third column is specified neither in the shorthand nor in ‘ grid- template - columns ’ , which means it is implicitly set to ‘ * ’.
For example , the rule grid : * 10em / 4em 5 em is the same as grid - template - columns : * 10 em ; grid-template - areas : " * * " " * * " ; grid - template - rows : 4em 5 em ; ( And ‘ grid - auto - rows ’ , ‘ grid- auto - columns ’ , and ‘ grid - auto - flow ’ are set to their default values . )
3.5 . Default slots
Every grid element has a default slot .
If there is an asterisk ( “ * ” ) in the template , then that slot is the default .
If there is no asterisk , then the first name in the template defines the default slot .
Note that a grid always has at least one slot , see ‘ grid- template - areas ’.
For example , if the template is defined by ‘ grid - template - areas : " ... " " .. c " " a b b " " a b b " ’ , then “ c ” is the default slot .
If the grid has an implicit template ( i.e. , ‘ grid - template - areas ’ is ‘ none ’ ) , then its single slot is the default slot .
All content of a grid element that is not inside another flow ( i.e. , not inside a float , not absolutely positioned , etc. ) is flowed into the default slot .
In particular , any text content of the grid element itself is in that default flow .
For example , in this document fragment < DIV STYLE = " grid : 'a b *' " >
< IMG STYLE =" flow : a " SRC= " image.png " ALT = " Foo " >
This is an < EM STYLE = " flow : *" > emphasized </ EM > < EM STYLE =" flow : b " >( note well ! ) </ EM > sentence .
< </DIV >
The three slots of the grid contain : Slot a The image Slot b
The text “ ( note well ! ) ”
Default slot
The text “ This is an emphasized sentence . ”
( The ‘ flow ’ property is defined below . )
3.6 . Interaction of ‘ grid ’ and ‘ columns ’
The ‘ columns ’ property of a grid element applies to the default slot of the template .
For example , with this style : BODY {grid : " a @ b " " c c c " ; columns : 2} The @ - slot will have two columns .
Note that this is the same as setting columns on the default slot : ‘ BODY :: slot (*) {columns : 2} ’ apart from differences in the specificity of the selector .
3.7 . Calculating the size of the grid
For the purpose of the calculations below , each slot ( identifier or “ * ” ) in a grid has four dimensions associated with it , called MINW ( “ minimum width ” ) , PREFW ( “ preferred width ” ) , MINH ( “ minimum height ” ) and PREFH ( “ preferred height ” ) .
We can think of them as the minimum and preferred dimensions of the slot in isolation , i.e. , if it was n't constrained by other slots in the same row or column .
They are defined as follows :
MINW
If the slot spans only columns whose width does not depend on the contents of the column ( i.e. , the column widths are specified with only < length > values , ‘ * ’ , < fraction > values , or any combination of those ) , then MINW is is the sum of the slot 's left and right margin , border and paddding ( i.e. , any ‘ margin - left ’ , ‘ margin - right ’ , ‘ padding - left ’ etc. , that is set on it by means of the ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element ) .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
calc( ) ’ as well , see [ CSS3VALUES ] ] . )
( Note that < length > values can be specified with ‘’ as well , see [ CSS3VALUES ] ] . )
values , ‘ ’ , values , or any combination of those ) , then is is the sum of the slot 's left and right margin , border and paddding ( i.e. , any ‘ ’ , ‘ ’ , ‘ ’ etc. , that is set on it by means of the ) .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot is vertical , then MINW is the width that the slot would have if its height were set to its intrinsic preferred height [ CSS3BOX ] , plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
is the width that the slot would have if its height were set to its intrinsic preferred height [ CSS3BOX ] , plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot spans at least one column whose width is specified as ‘ max - content ’ ( or ‘ minmax ( ) ’ with a first argument of ‘ max - content ’ ) , then MINW is the intrinsic preferred width of the slot plus its left and right margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
’ ( or ‘ ’ with a first argument of ‘ ’ ) , then is the intrinsic preferred width of the slot plus its left and right margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise ( i.e. , the slot spans at least one column whose width is specified as ‘ min-content ’ or ‘ minmax ( ) ’ with a first argument of ‘ min-content ’ , but no ‘ max - content ’) MINW is the intrinsic minimum width of the slot , plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
PREFW
If the slot spans only columns whose width does not depend on the contents of the column ( i.e. , the column widths are specified with only < length > values , ‘ * ’ , < fraction > values , or any combination of those ) , then PREFW is infinite .
values , ‘ ’ , values , or any combination of those ) , then is infinite .
Otherwise , if the slot is vertical , then PREFW is the width that the slot would have if its height were set to its intrinsic preferred height , plus the plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
is the width that the slot would have if its height were set to its intrinsic preferred height , plus the plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot spans at least one column whose width is specified as ‘ max - content ’ ( or ‘ minmax ( ) ’ with a first argument of ‘ max - content ’ ) , then PREFW is the intrinsic preferred width of the slot plus its left and right margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
’ ( or ‘ ’ with a first argument of ‘ ’ ) , then is the intrinsic preferred width of the slot plus its left and right margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise PREFW is the intrinsic minimum width of the slot , plus its left and right padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
MINH
If the slot spans only rows whose height does not depend on the contents of the column ( i.e. , the row heights are specified with only < length > values , ‘ * ’ , < fraction > values , or any combination of those ) , then MINH is the sum of the slot 's top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
values , ‘ ’ , values , or any combination of those ) , then is the sum of the slot 's top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot is horizontal , then MINH is the height the slot would have if its width were set to its intrinsic preferred width , plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
is the height the slot would have if its width were set to its intrinsic preferred width , plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot spans at least one row whose height is specified as ‘ max - content ’ ( or ‘ minmax ( ) ’ with a first argument of ‘ max - content ’ ) , then MINH is the intrinsic preferred height of the slot plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
’ ( or ‘ ’ with a first argument of ‘ ’ ) , then is the intrinsic preferred height of the slot plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise MINH is the intrinsic minimum height of the slot , plus its top and bottom padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
PREFH
If the slot spans only rows whose height does not depend on the contents of the column ( i.e. , the row heights are specified with only < length > values , ‘ * ’ , < fraction > values , or any combination of those ) , then PREFH is infinite .
values , ‘ ’ , values , or any combination of those ) , then is infinite .
Otherwise , if the slot is horizontal , then PREFH is the height the slot would have if its width were set to its preferred minimum width , plus its top and bottom padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
is the height the slot would have if its width were set to its preferred minimum width , plus its top and bottom padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise , if the slot spans at least one row whose height is specified as ‘ max - content ’ ( or ‘ minmax ( ) ’ with a first argument of ‘ max - content ’ ) , then PREFH is the intrinsic preferred height of the slot plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
’ ( or ‘ ’ with a first argument of ‘ ’ ) , then is the intrinsic preferred height of the slot plus its top and bottom margin , border and padding .
Any ‘ ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
Otherwise PREFH is the intrinsic preferred height of the slot , plus its top and bottom padding , border and margin .
Any ‘ auto ’ margins are counted as 0 for this purpose .
For example , the MINW values of the slots in this grid grid : auto * 10em " a a . " " b . c " are as follows : a ‘ min-content ’ ( because the slot spans at least one column with a width specified as ‘ min-content ’ or ‘ auto ’ ) . b ‘ min-content ’ ( ditto ) .
c 0 ( because the slot spans only columns with a width that is independent of the content ) .
The UA must choose the widths and heights of all columns and rows such that the following constraints are satisfied .
If the element has an a - priori known content height , then the sum of the heights of all rows must be equal to the element 's height .
For example , the two rows in this grid must be 8em each so that the total height matches the height of the element : div { height : 16em ; grid : " a . b " * " a c . " *
If the grid element has an a - priori known content width , then the sum of the widths of all columns must be equal to the element 's width .
For example , the three columns in this grid must be 20em each : div {width : 60 em ; grid : " a b c " } Each row with a height specified as a < length > must have exactly that height .
Each column with a width specified as a < length > must have exactly that width .
All rows with a height specified as ‘ * ’ must have the same height .
If we have both ‘ * ’ and ‘ fr ’ , then ‘ * ’ will be defined as ‘ 1 fr ’ and we can drop this rule and the next .
Otherwise either these two rules or the next two must be removed .
All columns with a width specified as ‘ * ’ must have the same width .
For any pair ( i , j ) of rows whose < row - height > values h i and h j are both specified in ‘ fr ’ , the computed heights H i and H j must be such that H i * h j = H j * h i .
( I.e. , their heights are proportional to their number of ‘ fr ’ units . )
For any pair ( i , j ) of columns whose < col - width > values w i and w j are both specified in ‘ fr ’ , the computed width W i and W j must be such that W i * w j = W j * W i .
( I.e. , their widths are proportional to their number of ‘ fr ’ units . )
Each row that contains slots that span only one row and no slots that span more than one row , must not be higher than the largest PREFH of all slots in the row plus the amount needed to vertically align the horizontal slots that have a ‘ vertical - align ’ of ‘ baseline ’.
For example , the second row in this grid grid : " a . c . . " 5 em " . . . . b " auto must not be taller than the height ( block dimension ) of slot b .
The first row contains a slot that spans two rows ( slot a ) , so this rule does not apply to that row .
Each column that contains slots that span only one column and no slots that span more than one column , must not be wider than the largest PREFW of all slots in the column plus the amount needed to align the vertical slots that have a ‘ vertical - align ’ of ‘ baseline ’.
For example , in this grid grid : " a c " " a b " auto * the first column must not be wider than the PREFW of slot a .
Both slots in the second column have an infinite PREFW , so this rule effectively puts no constraint on that column .
Each slot must be at least as wide as its MINW .
Each slot must be at least as high as its MINH .
If it is impossible to choose such widths and heights , then try without constraint 1 .
If it is still impossible , try without constraint 2 instead .
And , finally , try with both 1 and 2 dropped .
For example , the sum of the row heights in this example can never be the same as the height of the element : div { height : 20 em ; grid : " a b c " 7em " a . c " 7em }
The first constraint is therefore ignored , the rows are 7em each and 6em of space below the grid remains empty .
If there are multiple solutions , and constraint 1 was dropped or did not apply , then the sizes must additionally be chosen such that the sum of the heights of the rows is minimized .
If there are still multiple solutions , and constraint 2 was dropped or did not apply , then the sizes must additionally be chosen such that the sum of the widths of the columns is minimized .
The calculation is intended to be symmetric in width and height ( except for the case when both width and height are fixed and the grid is over - constrained , when a solution that ignores the height is tried before trying one that ignores the width ) .
For example , there would be multiple solutions for this grid : < DIV STYLE = " float : left ; grid : 'a . b ' " >
<P STYLE =" flow : a " > Two words <P STYLE = " flow : b " > Only three words </ DIV >
The columns must have equal width , but there is no other constraint on the width .
They could be narrow : Two
words
Only
three
words or wider : Two words
Only three words or even wider still , e.g. : Two words
Only three words
The rule to minimize height excludes the first , narrow solution .
The rule to minimize width excludes the third and all wider solutions .
So the second layout , the narrowest that has all words on one line , is the correct one .
( This example assumes the width of the floating DIV 's containing block is large enough .
The default width of a float is actually ‘ fit - content ’ , and thus if the containing block is too narrow , the result will be narrower , too , because the calculation will have to be redone using that width as the a - priori width for the DIV . )
The width is n't known a - priori , if , e.g. , ‘ width ’ is ‘ auto ’ and the element is floating , absolutely positioned , inline - block or a child of a block with vertical writing mode .
An extra step may be necessary in paged media if a page break occurs inside a template ( only in the case of an element - based template see below ) .
If the template , after computing the width and height , is too big to fit on the current page , and if a suitable break point exists , the part of the template after that break point is put on the next page .
The width of the containing block on that page may be different if that page has different margins from the current page ( see [ CSS3PAGE ] ) and thus the width and height of that part of the template must be recalculated in the new context .
Note that the widths of the columns can be completely determined before laying out any of the contents as long as there are no columns with a < col - width > of ‘ min-content ’ or ‘ max - content ’.
Do we define restrictions or approximations for slots that are part of a chain to avoid complicated optimization algorithms ?
Note :
In a future update of CSS , rows might get a property to specify how the height of that row is adjusted in case the above calculation yields a template that is less tall than the element itself .
The height of a slot is measured as if the slot had one anonymous block as a child that contains all the slot 's contents and the anonymous block is a flow root ( see [ CSS3BOX ] ) .
This example divides the window in three rows and three columns , separated by 1em of white space .
The middle row and the middle column are flexible , the others are fixed at a specific size .
The first column is 5 em wide , the last one 10 em . < style type =" text /css " > body { height : 100 % ; grid : 5 em 1em * 1em 10 em " a . b . c " 2em " . . . . . " 1 em " d . e . f " " . . . . . " 1em " g . h . i " 2em} #logo {flow : a} # motto {flow : b} #date {flow : c} #main {flow : e} #adv {flow : f} #copy {flow : g} #about {flow : h} </style > < p id=logo > < img src= ... < p id=motto > Making
Web pages since 1862 < p id=date > August 2 , 2004 ...
[ Add example with three columns , first two as narrow as possible , third one taking up all remaining space . ]
4 . Flowing content into slots : ‘ flow ’
The ‘ flow ’ property adds an element to a slot .
Name : flow Value : auto | < identifier > | < string > | ‘ * ’ | same Initial : auto Applies to : elements that have a grid ancestor and whose ‘ position ’ is ‘ static ’ or ‘ relative ’ Inherited : no Animatable : no Percentages : N/ A Media : visual Computed value : specified value Canonical order : per grammar
If the value is not ‘ auto ’ , the element is added to the flow of the given slot , instead of to the flow of its parent .
Note that the content of a slot depends on its ‘ content ’ property .
Content flowed into the slot is thus not necessarily rendered .
See “ Slots and the ‘ content ’ property . ”
The name of the slot may be quoted ( < string > ) or unquoted ( < identifier > ) , but if the name is equal to one of the following , it must be quoted : ‘ initial ’ , ‘ inherit ’ , ‘ default ’ or ‘ same ’.
This is to avoid ambiguity with the keywords of the same name .
For example , the following two style sheets are the same : div {grid : " p1 p2 " } h2 {flow : p1} and div {grid : " p1 p2 " } h2 {flow : " p1 " }
But the following two are not : div {grid : " initial final " } h2 {flow : " initial " } and div {grid : " initial final " } h2 {flow : initial}
The last ‘ initial ’ is interpreted as a reserved keyword and not as the name of the first slot in the grid .
If the element has no grid ancestor , or that grid ancestor has no slot of the given name , the property is treated as if it were ‘ auto ’.
A value of ‘ same ’ means the element is put into the same slot as the nearest preceding element in document order that ( 1 ) has the same grid ancestor , ( 2 ) to which the ‘ flow ’ property applies and ( 3 ) whose ‘ flow ’ property is not ‘ auto ’.
If the name refers to a slot that does n't exist in the element 's grid ancestor ( or there is no grid ancestor ) there are several possibilities :
The element is not positioned ( i.e. , it is positioned in the current flow ) .
The letter is looked for in the grid ancestor 's own grid ancestor , etc. , recursively .
If no slot of that name is found in any of them , then the element is not positioned .
The element is positioned in the default slot ( i.e. , as if ‘ flow : * ’ had been specified ) ; or not positioned at all , in case there is no grid ancestor .
The name is looked for in the grid ancestor 's own grid ancestor , etc. , recursively .
If no slot of that name is found in any of them , then the element is positioned in the default slot .
All content flowed into the same slot , whether explicitly with ‘ flow ’ or implicitly by flowing into the default slot , forms a single flow , with content in document order .
The slot establishes a block formatting context and becomes the containing block of the resulting content flow .
The boxes of elements flowed into the same slot explicitly ( by means of ‘ flow ’) are each other 's siblings in the slot .
For example , the style sheet BODY {grid : " a . " " . b" } . paris {flow : a} .london {flow : b} with this document < DIV CLASS=london > < P> The ... < DIV CLASS=paris > < P> The ... < DIV CLASS=london > < P> The ... </ DIV > </ DIV > </ DIV > causes the second and third DIVs to be taken out of their parents .
The second DIV becomes the first child of slot a ( i.e. , of the pseudo - element called ‘ :: slot ( a ) ’) .
The third DIV becomes the sibling of the first DIV , because both are added to slot b independently .
Here is another example .
In this document <P STYLE = " grid : ' a b' " >
< SPAN STYLE =" flow : a " > First text < SPAN STYLE = " flow : a " > Second text </ SPAN >
Third text </ SPAN > < SPAN STYLE =" flow : b " > Fourth text < SPAN STYLE = " flow : auto " >
Fifth text </ SPAN > Sixth text </ SPAN > </P> the second SPAN has a non -auto ‘ flow ’ and is thus taken out of its parent 's flow and added at the end of slot ‘ a ’ .
As a result , slot ‘ a ’ contains text in this order : “ First text Third Text Second text . ”
This is in contrast to the fourth SPAN , which has ‘ flow : auto ’ and thus remains inside its parent 's flow .
Slot ‘ b ’ has this text : “ Fourth text Fifth text Sixth text . ”
The content flowed into a slot does not inherit properties from the slot .
Note that ‘ flow ’ applies to floating elements : they are floated relative to their containing block , and if their ‘ flow ’ property indicates a slot in a grid , that slot is their containing block .
See also “ Floating elements inside templates ” below .
A common markup in HTML for illustrations with captions is as follows : < div class=figure > < p >< img src=" paul.jpg " alt= " ... " > < p class=caption >A pond in a playground in Amsterdam </ div >
The caption can be put above the image by using a template as follows : div.figure {grid : * min-content * " a a a " " . b ." } div. figure p {flow : b} div. figure p.caption { flow : a ; text - align : center}
The caption can be wider than the image and the image will be centered .
When the figure is floating , it is probably better to not let the caption become wider than the image ( unless the caption cannot be made narrow enough ) : div.figure {float : right ; grid : " a " " b " min-content} div. figure p {flow : b} div. figure p.caption { flow : a ; text - align : center}
In this example , a form is laid out on a grid , with two labels and two input boxes and a submit and a reset button : form { border : thin solid ; grid : " a a a a . b b b b " " . . . . . . . . . " 1em " c c c c . d d d d " " . . . . . . . . . " 1em " . . . e e . . f f " } label [ for=minv ] { flow : a } input#minv { flow : b ; display : block } label [ for=maxv ] { flow : c } input #maxv { flow : d ; display : block } input[ type=submit ] { flow : e ; display : block } input[ type=reset ] { flow : f ; display : block }
Here is the fragment of HTML that the style is applied to : < form action= " . / " >
< label for=minv >
Enter minimum value :</ label > < input id=minv name=minv > < label for=maxv>
Enter maximum value :</ label > < input id=maxv name=maxv > < input type=submit value= " OK " > < input type=reset value= " Reset " > </ form >
The addition of ‘ display : block ’ causes the form controls to use the width computation of blocks , in other words : they will be as wide as their containing block , which in this case means that they will be as wide as the slot they are assigned to .
Without it , they would be inline elements and just be left - aligned in their slots .
This example shows that templates can be nested .
The body has two columns .
The #content element that goes into the second column has itself another template , into which the various “ modules ” are placed .
For clarity , the inner template uses different letters for the slots than the outer template .
This is not required .
< style type =" text /css " > body { grid : 10em * " a b " ; } #nav { flow : a ; } #content { flow : b ; grid : * 1em * 1em * " c . d . e " " . . . . . " 1em " . . f . . " ; } .module.news { flow : c ; } .module.sports { flow : d ; } .module.personal { flow : e ; } # foot { flow : f ; } </style > < body > < ul id =" nav " >
< li>navigation </ li > </ul > < div id =" content " > < div class = " module news " > < h3 > Weather </h3 > < p > There will be weather </ p> </div> < div class=" module sports " >
< h3 > Football </h3 > < p > People like football .
</ p> </div> < div class=" module sports " > < h3 > Chess</h3 > < p
> There was a brawl at the chess tournament </ p> </div> < div class=" module personal " > < h3 > Your Horoscope </h3 > < p > You 're going to die ( eventually ) .
</ p> </div > < p id =" foot " > Copyright some folks </ p> </div > </ body >
This example shows the use of ‘ same ’ to put DD elements in the same slot as the preceding DT .
... DL {grid : * 2em * 2em * " a . b . c"} DT. mineral { flow : a} DT.animal { flow : b} DT. plant {flow : c} DD {flow : same ; margin - left : 1em} ... < DL > < DT class=animal > falcon < DD
> This bird of prey ...
< DT class=animal>rabbit < DD> Local restaurants ... < DT class=mineral > granite < DD>
This rock occurs ...
< DT class=plant > olive < DD> The fruit of ...
< DT class=mineral > limestone < DD>
A rock composed of ... < DT class=plant > pine < DD> The western half ... </DL >
An alternative to ‘ same ’ may be to create selectors with regular - expression - like capabilities : ‘ DT. plant + DD * + DD {flow : c} ’ selects a DD that follows zero or more DDs that follow DT. plant .
Does a percentage ‘ height ’ work on an element that is flowed into a slot ?
If the grid template assigns a fixed height to the slot , it is obvious what a percentage means , but if the slot 's height is ‘ max - content ’ and an element in the slot has ‘ height : 110 % ’ , there is a conflict …
Allowing multiple values on ‘ flow ’ could be an easy way to duplicate elements .
E.g. , this style BODY {grid : " a . b . c . " } H1 {flow : a , b , c} #art1 {flow : a} #ar t2 {flow : b} #art3 {flow : c} with a document like ... < H1> Local news </ H1 > < DIV ID=art1 >...</ DIV > < DIV ID=art2 >...</ DIV > < DIV ID=art3 >...</ DIV > would repeat the H1 at the top of all three columns .
With region - based styling , the three instances could even be styled differently , e.g. , with generated content : ‘ @region :: slot ( b ) { H1 :: before {content : " cont 'd " } } ’
ISSUE - 201 : Terra Informatica 's HTMLayout program proposes an interesting shortcut : if a slot 's name is a number ( instead of an identifier ) , it refers directly to the child with that number .
That child is positioned in that slot and does n't need ‘ flow ’ to be set .
See the documentation by Andrew Fedoniouk and Ivan Goroun .
E.g. , < ul style = " grid : ' 2 1 ' " >< li> one < li > two </ ul > puts “ two ” on the left and “ one ” on the right .
It is thus also a shortcut for some applications Flexbox 's of ‘ order ’ property .
5. Comparison with ‘ display : grid ’ and ‘ display : inline - grid ’
This section is not normative
The ‘ grid ’ and ‘ inline - grid ’ values of the ‘ display ’ property make an element into a grid container , ( see [ CSS - GRID - 1 ] ) , which is an element that uses the ‘ grid ’ properties to define a grid , just like a grid element , but its chidren ignore the ‘ flow ’ property and are instead automatically made into separate flows and positioned in subsequent slots of the grid .
( Although there are also properties to set their positions explicitly . )
‘ Grid ’ and ‘ inline - grid ’ also cause the template to grow automatically with either extra rows or extra columns , if there are more children than predefined slots .
Note that the template of a grid container is also mirrored and / or rotated depending on the ‘ writing - mode ’ and ‘ direction ’ of the grid container , unlike the template of a grid element .
6. Styling slots
Slots have certain properties of their own , as defined below .
If those properties are inherited , they inherit from the grid element .
To set properties on the slots , two kinds of selectors are available : ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ and ‘ :: blank ( ) ’.
6.1 . The ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element
The slots of a grid element can be individually addressed with the ‘ slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element .
For example , the following sets the background and vertical alignment of some of the slots in a template : body { grid : " a a a " " b c d " } body : : slot ( b ) { background : # FF0 } body : : slot ( c ) , body : : slot (d ) { vertical - align : bottom }
Only the following properties apply to the ‘ slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element .
The following properties also apply to ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ pseudo elements , but only affect content inserted with the ‘ content ’ property other than what corresponds to the ‘ contents ’ keyword .
( I.e. , not to the content that is flowed into the slot via the ‘ flow ’ property or because the slot is the default slot .
See “ Styling the contents of slots ” for how to style that part of the content . )
‘ color ’
’ font properties
‘ text - decoration ’
’ ‘ text - transform ’
’ counter properties not needed ?
‘ image - orientation ’
’ ‘ image - resolution ’
’ ‘ letter - spacing ’
’ ‘ object - fit ’
’ ‘ object - position ’
’ ‘ text - align ’
’ ‘ text - align - last ’
’ ‘ text - indent ’
’ ‘ visibility ’
’ ‘ white - space ’
’ ‘ word - spacing ’
ISSUE - 37 : Can a slot have a border and if so , where is it drawn ?
The background of a slot is drawn immediately on top of the background of the element itself .
E.g. , the background set on ‘ P:: slot ( a ) ’ is immediately in front of the background set on ‘ P ’.
Margins on slots do not collapse , neither with other slots , nor with elements inside the slot .
6.2 . The ‘ :: blank ( ) ’ pseudo - element
The naming / syntax is an issue , because there is a ‘ : blank ’ pseudo - class in [ CSS3PAGE ] and a ‘ : empty ’ pseudo - class in [ SELECT ] .
But ‘ :: slot(a ) : empty ’ and ‘ : slot ( a ) : blank ' are invalid syntax …
The ' blank ( ) ' pseudo - element selects named slots that have no content flowed into them . ’: : slot (a ) ‘ and ’ :: blank (a ) ‘ select the same slot , but the latter matches only if the slot has no content flowed into it .
Whether ’:: blank ( ) ‘ matches is independent of the slot 's ' content ' property .
( In other words : a “ blank ” slot is not necessarily empty and a slot that looks empty is not necessarily “ blank , ” although that is usually the case , given the initial value of ' content ' . )
For example , slots a , b and c in the following document are blank , but slot * is not , even though slots b and c do not look empty , ( because they have generated content ) and slot d does look empty ( because its ' content ' property does n't include the keyword ’ contents ' ‘ ) : < style > body { grid : " a b " " c * " } body : : slot ( b ) { content : " This is slot b " } body : : slot ( c ) { content : " Page " counter ( page ) } body : : slot ( * ) { content : " No content " } </ style > < h1 > The heading </h1 > < p > The first paragraph .
All content in this document is flowed into the default slot ( * ) , so all other slots are blank .
This example shows how to put a border only on slots that have content : div {grid : " a . " " . d"} div::slot ( a ) , div::slot (d ) { border : solid} div:: blank ( a ) , div: : blank(d ) {border : none}
An element that has no content , no background , no border , no padding , no margin and no fixed positive width or height has no influence on whether the slot it flows into is blank or not .
In this case , the content of the element is the content that results from applying the ’ content ' property and also includes generated content of its ‘ :: before ’ and ‘ : after ’ pseudo - elements .
For example , even though there is an address element flowed into slot a , slot a is still blank , because the address element happens to have no printable content : < style > body { grid : " a . " " . * " } body : : blank ( a ) { content : " No address defined " } address { flow : a } </ style > < h1 > The heading </h1 > < p >
The first paragraph .
< address ></address >
A slot that is part of a chain ( see ‘ chains ’) is blank if all content flowed into that chain fits into slots earlier in the chain .
For example , this document has very little content that easily fits into the first slot .
Slot b , which is part of the same chain , thus remains blank .
< style > body { grid : " a . b " ; chains : a b ; width : 60em } body : : blank ( b ) { background : silver } </ style > < p >
Very little content .
6.3 . Slots and the ‘ content ’ property
The ‘ content ’ property applies to slot pseudo elements in a similar way as it applies to normal elements and other pseudo - elements .
When applied to slots , values have the following meaning :
‘ normal ’ Same as ‘ contents ’
( Note that ‘ contents ’ is also the computed value in this case . ) ‘ none ’
The content that is flowed into the slot ( with the ‘ flow ’ property , or because the slot is the default slot ) is not rendered .
‘ inhibit ’ Same as ‘ none ’. ‘ contents ’ Renders as the content that is flowed into the slot ( with the ‘ flow ’ property , or because the slot is the default slot ) .
Other values are as defined in [ CSS3GENCON ] and in [ CSS3PAGE ] .
See “ Page - based grid templates ” for an example of the use of ‘ string ( ) ’ in the value of ‘ content ’.
[ This should be moved to [ CSS3GENCON ] . ]
Even if the value of ‘ content ’ does not include ‘ contents ’ and the content that is flowed into a slot is thus not rendered , any counters associated with that content are incremented normally .
Note : as defined in [ CSS3GENCON ] , the keyword ‘ contents ’ may appear multiple times in the value of ‘ content ’ , but the second and subsequent occurrences are ignored .
( Those occurrences are still part of the computed value . )
7 . Styling the contents of slots
Region - based styling refers to style rules that are attached to parts of a document that do not correspond to an element , but to an area of the canvas .
In level 2 , there were only two such regions , the pseudo - elements ‘ first - line ’ and ‘ first - letter . ’
This module adds slots .
A slot may contain parts of multiple elements and the style rules for those elements and for the slot are cascaded together in a specific way , defined below .
For example , with a style sheet like this BODY { grid : " a . " 10 em " . b " ; chains : a b } P { flow : a ; color : blue } BODY :: slot ( b )
P { color : orange } and a document fragment like this : < BODY > < P> The text of the first paragraph ... < P> The text of the second paragraph ... < P> The text of the third paragraph ...
</ BODY >
The three paragraphs will be rendered inside slot a and , if there is more content than fits in that slot , the rest will be rendered in slot b.
Ps are blue by the second line in the style sheet , but the third line says that any part of a P that is inside slot b will be orange .
In CSS level 2 , pseudo - elements could only occur at the end of a selector .
Thus an attempt to select ‘ P:: first - line EM ’ fails .
That restriction does not apply to the ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element , as shown in the example above .
To resolve which style rules apply to an element or part of an element that is inside a slot …
Fix .
Can we use a fictional tag sequence as in level 2 ?
Only for inherited properties , maybe .
Or only for a restricted set of properties , e.g. , only those that apply to first - letter .
See “ Style the contents of slots ( region - based styling ) ” below for a discussion of alternatives to ‘ @region ’.
8. Rendering of grid elements
Grid elements influence the stacking order , page breaks , the position of floats , etc. of the content inside them .
8.1 . Vertical alignment of the contents of slots
‘ Vertical - align ’ applies to slots in a similar way as it applies to table cells [ CSS3TBL ] and margin boxes [ CSS3PAGE ] .
‘ Align - content ’ in [ CSS3 - FLEXBOX ] has ‘ flex - start ’ , ‘ flex - end ’ and ‘ center ’ , which are a bit similar to ‘ top ’ , ‘ bottom ’ and ‘ middle ’.
But it also has ‘ space - between ’ and ‘ stretch ’ , which make little sense in a flow , and it lacks ‘ baseline ’.
The similarity of slots to table cells and margin boxes argues for sticking with ‘ vertical - align ’.
For the purpose of this section we define the A edge and C edge of a box as a writing - mode - dependent edge as follows :
Value of ‘ writing - mode ’ Meaning of “ A ” Meaning of “ C ” ‘ horizontal - tb ’ top bottom ‘ vertical - rl ’ right left ‘ vertical - lr ’ left right
E.g. , if a box is horizontal , the “ A edge ” is the top edge .
The ‘ vertical - align ’ property of a ‘ :: slot ( ) ’ pseudo - element can be used to align elements vertically in a slot ( or horizontally , if the slot is vertical ) .
The effect is as if the hypothetical anonymous block that contains the slot 's contents is positioned as defined below .
bottom
The content of the slot is aligned to the C edge of the slot : the C margin edge of the anonymous block coincides with the C margin edge of the slot .
middle
The content of the slot is centered in the slot : the distance between the A margin edge of the anonymous block and the A margin edge of the slot is equal to the distance between the C margin edge of the anonymous block and the C margin edge of the slot .
( Note that if the content overflows the slot , it will overflow at both edges . ) baseline
The anonymous block that encloses the content is placed as far as possible in the direction against the block flow direction under two constraints :
The A margin edge of the anonymous block may not be beyond the A margin edge of the slot .
If the content has a relevant first line ( see below ) , then the baseline of that line must align with the baselines of the relevant first lines in all other slots with the same ‘ writing - mode ’ and the same ‘ vertical - align ’ in the same row ( if the slot is horizontal ) or the same column ( if the slot is vertical ) .
A slot has a relevant first line , if the content has a first line ( ignoring any lines inside floats ) and that first line has the same ‘ writing - mode ’ as the slot itself .
For example , for a horizontal slot , this means that the first baseline must be aligned with the first baselines of all other horizontal slots in the row that also have ‘ vertical - align : baseline ’. < percentage > ‘ 0 % ’ means the same as ‘ bottom ’ , ‘ 100 % ’ means the same as ‘ top ’ , other values are linear interpolations of these .
Negative values and values over 100 % are interpreted as 0 % and 100 % respectively .
Note that 100 % minus the percentage corresponds to the initial position of the scrolling mechanism ( if any ) in case the content overflows .
For all other values , the content is aligned as for ‘ baseline ’.
Note that baseline alignment may cause a slot to overflow ( if the slot is the last in a ‘ chain ’) or to remain empty ( because the first line box is put in the next chained slot instead ) .
Example : Given a document like this < BODY > < P >...</P> < FIGURE >...</ FIGURE > < P>...</P> < FIGURE >...</ FIGURE > < P>...</P> < FIGURE >...</ FIGURE > < P>...</P> < FIGURE >...</ FIGURE > </ BODY > and a style like this : BODY { grid : " a b " } P { flow : a } FIGURE { flow : b } the paragraphs will be in the first slot ( a ) and the figures in the second ( b ) .
There are two ways to align the contents of the two slots to the bottom .
One is with ‘ vertical - align ’: BODY :: slot(a ) , BODY :: slot ( b ) { vertical - align : bottom }
The other is with flexible margins : P : first - of - type , FIGURE : first - of - type { margin - top : fill }
Example :
There is no value for ‘ vertical - align ’ to distribute elements vertically over the available space ( similar to how ‘ text - align : justify ’ distributes words over the available space ) .
But the effect can be achieved with stretchable margins .
Assume the same document as in the previous example and this style sheet : BODY { grid : " a b " } P { flow : a ; margin - top : fill ; margin - bottom : fill } FIGURE { flow : b } Because there are stretchable margins between the Ps , the Ps will be equally distributed over the height of the slot ( assuming the slot is taller than its contents , i.e. , assuming the contents of slot b is taller than the contents of slot a ) .
Note that , if there are one or more margins in the contents of the slot with a ‘ fill ’ value ( see [ CSS3BOX ] ) , the height of the content fits the height of the slot and thus the ‘ top ’ , ‘ middle ’ and ‘ bottom ’ values are indistinguishable .
8.2 . Breaking grid elements across pages or columns
Grid elements may be broken across pages , columns or similar regions ( including chained slots of another grid element ) , subject to the ‘ break - before ’ , ‘ break - after ’ and ‘ break - inside ’ properties .
In addition to the break points listed in the Fragmentation module [ CSS3 - BREAK ] , a page break may occur between two rows in a template , if there is a possible break point at the same height or higher in all slots that span those two rows ; and a page break may occur inside a row if there is a possible break point in all slots in that row .
Try to be more precise ?
In the terminology of [ CSS3 - BREAK ] , a slot is a fragmenter of type ‘ region ’.
A forced break on an element in a slot causes the rest of the flow of that slot to continue in another page , column or slot ( depending on the type of break ) .
The following cases are special :
A forced page break causes all elements after the break ( in document order ) to be on a new page .
On which subsequent page they fall depends on any page templates : there may not be a slot with the right name on the next page .
A forced column break only has effect if the element 's multicol ancestor is a descendant ( is “ inside ” ) the element 's grid ancestor .
For example , this document fragment has a column element inside a grid element .
Column breaks affect the content of a single slot , but do not affect the other slots of the grid element : < DIV STYLE =" grid : ' a b' 'c d ' " >
< DIV STYLE =" flow : a " > I 'm in slot a .
</ DIV > < DIV STYLE =" flow : b ; columns : 20em " > < P> This text is in columns .
< H2 STYLE =" break - before : column " >
Heading at top of column </ H2 > < P >... </ DIV </DIV >
For example , this document fragment has a grid element inside a column element and thus the column break on the H2 is ignored : < DIV STYLE = " columns : 20em " >
< DIV STYLE =" grid : ' a b' 'c d ' " >
< P>I 'm inside slot a inside some columns .
< H2 STYLE =" break - before : column " > No break </ H2 > < P >... </ DIV > </DIV >
A slide presentation can be made with a template for each page ( i.e. , slide ) and forced page break between the slides : @page { grid : " a " 5 em " @ " * " b " auto } h1 { page - break - before : always ; flow : a } p.note { flow : b } With a document similar to this : ( fragment ) < h1 > Slide 1 title </h1 > < ul > < li>Topic one </ul > < h1 > Slide 2 title</h1 > < ul > < li>More topics </ul > < p class=note >
Note the note
The document in the example above does n't have an element that corresponds to a slide ; a slide simply starts at an H1 and ends before the next H1 .
But if there is a DIV around each slide ( as is the case in many slide formats in practice ) , the same effect can also be achieved without page - based templates , by using the ‘ vh ’ unit [ CSS3VAL ] : div.slide {height : 100 vh ; grid : " a " 5 em " * " " b " intrinsic ; page - break - before : always} h1 {flow : a} p.note {flow : b} With a document similar to this : ( fragment ) < div class=slide > < h1 > Slide 1 title </h1 > < ul > < li>Topic one </ul > </div > < div class=slide > < h1 > Slide 2 title</h1 > < ul > < li>More topics </ul > < p class=note >
Note the note </div >
8.3 . Stacking order
Each slot generates a separate stacking context .
The stacking order of these stacking contexts is given by their ‘ z - index ’ property , with ‘ auto ’ treated as ‘ 0 ’.
Slots with the same ‘ z - index ’ are stacked in the order in which they are defined in the ‘ grid - template - areas ’ property , looking only at the first occurrence of the slot 's name ( i.e. , the top left corner if the slot spans several rows or columns ) .
A slot thus has a very similar behavior in the stacking order as an element with ‘ position : relative ’ and ‘ z - index : 0 ’ ( or another value of ‘ z - index ’ other than ‘ auto ’ ) .
For example , the stacking order of the slots in the following template is , from back to front , a , x , c , d , e , p , g. grid : " a x x c " " d x x e " " p p g g " The stacking order can be made visible , e.g. , by giving slots opaque backgrounds and negative margins , so that they overlap .
See the next example .
This example uses ‘ z - index ’ and negative margins to make the middle slot partly overlap the other slots : body { grid : " a . b " " . c . " " d . e " ; height : 240 px ; width : 240 px } :: slot ( a ) { background : # 0C0 } :: slot ( b ) { background : # C00 } ::slot ( c ) { background : # FD0 ; margin : - 20 px ; z - index : 1 } ::slot (d ) { background : # 00C } ::slot(e ) { background : # A0A }
This example has a heading ( H1 ) that is wider than its slot and overlaps the image in the slot next to it : body {grid : " a b" } :: slot ( a ) {z - index : 1} h1 {flow : a ; width : 200%} p {flow : a} img {flow : b} The ‘ z - index ’ is necessary , because the ‘ a ’ slot comes before the ‘ b ’ slot in the template and all its content would thus be rendered behind the ‘ b ’ slot with default ‘ z - index ’ values .
8.4 . Floating elements inside templates
An element may be flowed into a slot and be a floating element at the same time .
The following cases must be distinguished :
Page - based floats –
In paged media ( see [ CSS3PAGE ] ) , if the value of ‘ float ’ specifies that the element floats to the top or bottom of the page ( in a horizontal writing mode ) or the left or right of the page ( in a vertical writing mode ) , the slot act as the page .
( I.e. , the element floats to the top , bottom , etc. of the slot , not of the page .
’ specifies that the element floats to the top or bottom of the page ( in a horizontal writing mode ) or the left or right of the page ( in a vertical writing mode ) , the slot act as the page .
( I.e. , the element floats to the top , bottom , etc. of the slot , not of the page .
Footnotes – Likewise , the footnote area for elements with ‘ float : footnote ’ is at the bottom of the slot , not of the page .
The @footnote at - rule can position the footnote area at other places , such as the top , but always inside the slot .
’ is at the bottom of the slot , not of the page .
The @footnote at - rule can position the footnote area at other places , such as the top , but always inside the slot .
Normal floats –
In other cases , the element floats normally within its containing block , which in this case is its slot in the template .
The ‘ @footnote ’ at - rule from [ CSS3GCPM ] needs to be extended to apply to slots : ‘ @footnote : first : : slot ( a ) ’ is the footnote area of slot a on the first page .
9 . Page - based grid templates
A template can also be attached to a page , rather than an element .
Such a template is called a page - based template as opposed to an element - based template .
Here is an example of a template used to position two centered running headers with different styles .
( This would be impossible to do with the predefined page template of [ CSS3GCPM ] , because it has only one centered margin box at the top . ) @page { grid : " t1 " 1.2 em /* space for 1st running header */ " t2 " 1.2 em /* space for 2nd running header */ " . " 2em " * " /* page body */ } :: slot ( t1 ) { content : string ( chapter ) ; color : red ; text - align : center } ::slot ( t2 ) { content : string ( section ) ; color : green ; text - align : center } h1 { string - set : chapter contents } h2 { string - set : section contents } See “ Slots and the ‘ content ’ property ” for the definition of the ‘ content ’ property on slots .
The syntax of a page - based template is the same as that of an element - based one , but the declaration appears in an ‘ @page ’ rule .
In a page - based template , the height and width are typically known ( defined by the output media and the margin boxes , see [ CSS3PAGE ] ) .
And content that overflows a slot typically is not clipped ( or hidden behind a scrolling mechanism ) , but is continued on a subsequent page .
Because the grid template is not attached to an element but to a page , the slot names have global scope .
But they can be hidden to elements that have a grid ancestor that uses the same slot names .
This modifies the rules for ‘ flow ’ : if the property refers to a slot that is not found in a grid ancestor , it refers instead to a slot in a page template ( if there is one and it has a slot of that name ) .
Should we simplify page - based templates to only allow < length > and * as row heights and column widths ?
( And treat illegal sizes as ‘ * ’? )
@page : first {grid : " a b c " " d e f" } @page {grid : " d e f" } body {flow : e} h1 {flow : b}
A page that has a grid template does not have a footnote area [ CSS3GCPM ] .
Instead each slot in the grid template has its own footnote area .
If a slot of a page - based template on non-interactive media has an ‘ overflow ’ property of ‘ visible ’ , then content that overflows that slot in the block progression direction ( i.e. , below the slot in the case of horizontal text ) causes a page break and is continued on the next page .
What happens in non-interactive media with an ‘ overflow ’ of ‘ scroll ’ or ‘ auto ’?
For page breaking purposes , each slot is considered as a page and the page break properties on the elements in that slot determine where the content for that slot is broken [ CSS3 - BREAK ] .
Content after the page break is put in the slot of the same name on the next page that has such a slot .
If there is no such page , the UA should display the content on a separate page .
Or : the content after the page break is not displayed ?
displayed in the default slot ?
Note that this may happen if the template for the first page (‘ @page : first ’) uses a slot name that occurs in no other @page rule .
Possibly also if a page template is bound to a “ named page ” [ CSS3GCPM ] and that named page is not allowed to repeat .
( At the time of writing , this is only a proposal in the GCPM Module . )
Note that an element A that appears later in the document than an element B may thus be displayed on an earlier page than element B , because their respective slots are broken across pages in different ways .
Because of limitations of a device ( e.g. , limited memory ) , it may be that a UA has to print a page ( force page breaks ) even though some slots are n't filled yet .
This example shows a document with text in two languages , which are to be shown side by side : @page {grid : " a b"} : lang ( en ) { flow : a} : lang ( fr ) { flow : b} This works with a document where the languages are separated like this : < BODY > < DIV LANG=en > < H1 > The blue house </ H1 > ... </ DIV > < DIV LANG=fr > < H1 > La maison bleue </ H1 > ... </ DIV > </ BODY >
But also with a document where the languages are interleaved : < BODY > < H1 LANG=en > < H1 LANG=fr > < P LANG=en >... <P LANG=fr >... ... </ BODY >
This example shows how the first page may have a different layout from the other pages .
The slot ‘ a ’ only occurs on the first page .
If the content for that slot ( in this case : all H1 elements ) is too long , the remaining content of that slot will not be displayed .
The slot ‘ @ ’ occurs on normal pages and all its content can thus be displayed by adding additional pages .
@page : first {grid : " a " " *" } @page {grid : " * " } h1 {flow : a}
Note that “ page masters ” ( sequences of different templates for sequences of pages ) can be made with the selectors defined in [ not yet decided ] .
Both page - based and element - based templates can be used in the same document .
@page {grid : " a*" } : lang ( fr} {flow : a} div.special {grid : " a b c " " a b d "}
Here is a page as one might find in a newspaper .
It combines a layout template with multicolumn layout .
@page : first { grid : * 3em * 3em * 3em * 3em * " A A A A A A A A A " 5 cm " . . . . . . . . . " 0.25 cm " B . C C C C C C C " * " B . C C C C C C C " * " B . C C C C C C C " * " B . C C C C C C C " * " B . C C C C C C C " * " B . D D D D D D D " * " B . D D D D D D D " * " B . E E E . F F F " * " B . E E E . F F F " * " B . E E E . F F F " * } h1 {flow : a ; border - bottom : thick ; margin - bottom : 1.5 em} #toc { flow : b ; margin - right : - 1.5 em ; border - right : thin ; padding - right : 1.5 em} #leader {flow : c ; columns : 4 ; column - gap : 3em} #art1 { flow : d ; columns : 4 ; column - gap : 3em ; border - top : thin} #art2 {flow : e ; columns : 2 ; column - gap : 3em} #art3 {flow : f ; columns : 2 ; column - gap : 3em}
If a slot on a page is full and the content continues on the next page , it may be useful to insert something like “ continued on page X . ”
This is useful at any page break , but more important if there are multiple “ flows ” of content on each page .
Maybe a break - content property ?
‘ break - content : " ▶ continued on p. " targetcounter ( ??? , page ) ’ or extend text - overflow from [ CSS - TEXT - 3 ] ?
How do you style the slots of page - based template ?
E.g. , with @page : first { grid : " a b " " c d " } @page { grid : " a a a " " b c d " } ::slot ( a ) { background : silver} the background could be set on all “ a ” slots on all pages .
But how do you set a background only on the “ a ” slot of the first page ?
Maybe we need to extend the page selectors and allow something like this : @page : first : : slot ( a ) { background : silver} A space between the pseudo - class and the pseudo - element could be optional .
10 . Chaining slots : the ‘ chains ’ property
Slots must be rectangular , but the appearance of non-rectangular slots can be achieved to some extent by chaining slots together .
Content that is positioned in the first slot of a chain is automatically continued in the second slot if the first slot is full , and then the third , etc .
Name : chains Value : none | < identifier > + [ , < identifier > + ]* Initial : none Applies to : grid elements Inherited : no Animatable : no Percentages : N/ A Media : visual Computed value : specified value Canonical order : per grammar
A value of ‘ none ’ means the element 's template has no chains .
Otherwise the value consists of one or more comma-separated lists of identifiers .
No identifier may appear more than once in the value .
Identifiers that do not occur in the template are ignored , but do not make the value invalid .
A list with only ignored identifiers is itself ignored .
All the non -ignored identifiers in a list , except for the last one , must refer to slots whose size does not depend on their contents , otherwise the list is ignored .
The size of a slot does not depend on its content if all the columns and all the rows that the slot spans have a width , respectively height , that is a < length > or ‘ * ’.
Each non -ignored list defines one chain .
Each chain is filled with content in an analogous way to the pages in paged media : all the content that is positioned to the first slot in the chain is flowed , in document order , into the first slot in the chain until the slot is full , the rest is flowed into the second slot until it is full , etc .
Content must only be split between slots at an allowed page break [ CSS3PAGE ] .
As for page breaks , if a break occurs in the margin between blocks , all adjoining margins are set to zero .
CSS3 does not define what is the best break point to split content over slots .
However , it is recommended to use the last possible break point that does not cause overflow .
( If such a break point exists . )
Note :
It is the author 's responsibility to make the height of relevant slots an integral number of lines if he wants to ensure that the lines in chained slots are aligned .
The height does not automatically “ snap ” to a multiple of the line height .
The following template creates a double - staircase layout .
In case the content is too long for the staircase , a slot of flexible height is added at the bottom .
div { grid : " @ @ . . f f . . . . " 3.6em " . a a . . g g . . . " 3.6em " . . b b . . h h . . " 3.6em " . . . c c . . i i . " 3.6em " . . . . d d . . j j " 3.6em " . . . . . . . . . . " 0.6em " e e e e . . k k k k " auto ; chains : @ a b c d e , f g h i j k} # first { position : @ } #second { position : f } This could be applied to a document fragment such as < DIV > <P ID=first >... <P ID=second >... </ DIV >
Here is a paragraph shaped as a circle : p { width : 12 em ; grid : " . . . . * * . . . . " 1.2em " . . a a a a a a . . " 1.2em " . b b b b b b b b . " 1.2em " . b b b b b b b b . " 1.2em " c c c c c c c c c c " 1.2em " c c c c c c c c c c " 1.2em " . d d d d d d d d . " 1.2em " . d d d d d d d d . " 1.2em " . . e e e e e e . . " 1.2em " . . . . f f . . . . "
1.2em " g g g g g g g g g g " auto ; chains : * a b c d e f g }
Here is a page - based template that creates a two - column layout with a “ hole ” in the center : @page : first { grid : " a a a a a a a .
d d d d d d d " " a a a a a a a .
d d d d d d d " " a a a a a a a .
d d d d d d d " " a a a a a a a .
d d d d d d d " " b b b b . . . . . . . e e e e " " b b b b .
g g g g g . e e e e " " b b b b .
g g g g g . e e e e " " b b b b .
g g g g g . e e e e " " b b b b . . . . . . . e e e e " " c c c c c c c .
f f f f f f f " " c c c c c c c . f f f f f f f " " c c c c c c c . f f f f f f f " " c c c c c c c . f f f f f f f " ; chains : a b c d e f } @page : : slot ( g ) { vertical - align : middle } body { flow : a } h1 { flow : g }
Note :
For more anaylysis of the possibilities and limits of non-rectangular slots , see the PhD thesis of César Acebal [ ACEBAL2010 ] .
Chaining of rectangular slots is not enough to create layouts with holes , e.g. , an image in the middle of a text .
Allowing non-rectangular , connected regions ( in addition to chaining ) would allow an example such as this : grid : " A A A . . . "
" A . A . . . " " A A A . . . " " . . . B B B " " . . . B . B " " . . . B B B " ; chains : a b ; Such cutouts in the middle of text usually create text that is difficult to read , and that is why there is no ‘ float : center ’ , e.g .
But the CSS WG is considering a new property ‘ wrap - flow ’ for absolutely positioned elements that would allow , e.g. : ‘ p {position : absolute ; top : 1 fr ; left : 1 fr ; width : 1 fr ; height : 1 fr ; wrap - flow : both} ’ to absolutely position a P element on top of a grid element and cause the content of the element under it to wrap around it as if it were a float [ CSS3 - EXCLUSIONS ] .
Note that a slot can have overflowing content even if it is part of a chain : it can have content that is too wide but can not be broken .
The ‘ break - before ’ , ‘ break - after ’ and ‘ break - inside ’ properties have values that control breaking of content between slots in a chain ( in particular ‘ region ’ and ‘ avoid - region ’ , see [ CSS3 - BREAK ] ) .
Note that , as defined in “ Breaking grid elements across pages or columns ” above , a slot is a fragmenter of type region in the terminology of [ CSS3 - BREAK ] .

This includes grid layouts , frame layouts and table - like subdivision of a rectangular area .
A layout structure with “ flex ” ing information .
The flexing is represented by constraints that specify how the cells are to relate to one another : which cells are to be allowed to grow or shrink and how much .
There may also be a priority ordering , which determines , based on the size of the allowed display window , which cells shrink , which grow and under which conditions .
Layout structures with absolutely positioned ( fixed - size ) elements ; for example a block of text into which several illustrations intrude at fixed positions within the block .
This is like a float with respect to tightly wrapping the text around the intrusion , but the position of the intrusion is determined by the layout structure , not the content flowed into that structure .
An example of this is a multicolumn layout with one or more “ absolutely positioned floats ” that intrude on the columns ( see figure ) .
Multiple , disconnected , fixed - size areas on a page that are chained together , each one receiving the content that does n't fit in the previous slot .
In combination with page breaks , this may give a layout as often seen in newspapers : the first few lines of each story on the first page , the rest of the story in other areas on subsequent pages .
( It will probably need a way to conditionally insert “ continued on page 7 ” or similar text . )
For comparing proposals for template - based layouts , the working group identified four important aspects of each proposal :
the physical layout structures – the way of structuring the “ cells ” ( slots ) into which content is flowed .
This includes a way to identify the various layout containers .
the binding mechanism – the way to specify that a given element ( and its descendants ) are to be placed in a given layout cell .
the property distribution mechanism – the way to put properties onto the layout structure and the cells within it .
the flexing mechanism – the way to describe how the layout structure should adapt itself to the higher level container ( window ) in which it is placed .
This includes statements about which cells should grow and when they should grow .
In this specification , these aspects are as follows :
A character matrix is used to show the layout structure and the cells are named by the character used to show where they are positioned .
The binding of content to cells is handled by the ‘ flow ’ property which identifies a cell to which the content is bound .
The shape , size and flexibility of the layout are specified with the character matrix .
Some properties ( background , border and vertical alignment ) are attached to individual slots .
There is limited “ flexing ” information .
The choice is between fixed size , a fraction of the available size or the content 's intrinsic size .
( The latter is further subject to min/max sizes specified on that content . )
It is not possible to say , e.g. , that some column can only become wider if all other columns are at their maximum size .
11.2 . Syntax , features and levels
( This section is not normative . )
The following is a partial list of design decisions and some arguments for and against each choice :
11.2.1 . Named vs numbered slots
Named slots are very easy to understand and use .
Experience with the draft showed that everybody who sees an example immediately understands what it means .
Moreover , there is no need to use numbers or to count .
But it is different for absolutely positioned elements that use the grid .
Those elements do not belong to a slot , they are merely placed on top of it , overlapping what is already there and each other .
Also , if grids are automatically extended with extra rows and columns ( see below ) based on content , then those extra rows and columns cannot have names and must ( probably , see below ) be referred to by number .
In this specification , named slots are used to create flows of content , while numbers are used for absolute positioning , although names can be used there too , if the author prefers .
11.2.2 . Single letter names vs identifiers
The set of single letters is finite .
And even if Unicode has many symbols , typing them may not be easy .
Letters also do not permit to give a hint as to a slot 's function ( “ heading , ” “ footer , ” “ advertisement ” … ) .
On the other hand , any Unicode character can be typed as an escape , so if you run out of letters on the keyboard , you can always make a template like this :
DIV {grid : " \1001\1002\1003\1006 " " \1001\1004\1005\1006 " } DIV H1 {flow : \ 1001}
In practice , it is also hard to come up with meaningful identifiers and so single letters require less thinking .
And if you always have single letters , you do n't need spaces between them either , which makes big templates easier to read .
This specification defines that a template consists of ( space - separated ) identifiers , but many examples use single - letter identifiers .
11.2.3 . Quote marks to delimit rows or slot names
The current syntax for ‘ grid ’ ( and ‘ grid- template - areas ’) groups the slots into rows with quote marks :
grid : " a b c " " d * e "
Or with some explicit column widths and row heights added :
grid : 10em * 10em " a b c " 7em " d * e " *
Instead of using quote marks , other means could be used to delimit the rows , e.g. , commas :
grid : 10em * 10em a b c 7em , d @ e *
Because the ‘ * ’ would then be ambiguous ( it could either be a length or a slot name ) , it has been replaced here by ‘ @ ’ ( see “ Indicating the default slot ” ) .
When quotes are not needed to delimit rows , they can be used to delimit slot names , which then no longer have to be restricted to identifiers .
Like the quotes around font family names , the quotes around slot names are optional , unless the slot names would be ambiguous without them :
div {grid : a " middle top " c , d @ " - =- " } p {flow : c} /* quotes optional */ p.intro { flow : middle top} /* quotes optional */ img.one { flow : " d " } /* quotes optional */ img.two { flow : " -=- " } /* quotes required */
11.2.4 . Extend ‘ display ’ or add a grid property
Grids can be defined on elements such as table cells , blocks , inline blocks or list items , but not on elements such as tables or , inline elements .
That can be expressed in the syntax by adding the grid to the ‘ display ’ property : ‘ display : inline - block " a b c " " a b d " ’ would be valid , but ‘ display : inline " a b c " " a b d " ’ would not be .
Or it can be expressed by an implicit dependency between properties : ‘ display : inline - block ; grid : " a b c " " a b d " ’ has a grid , but ‘ display : inline ; grid : " a b c " " a b d " ’ ignores the grid .
( In this case it is actually the computed value of ‘ display ’ that applies , so , e.g. , if the element floats , it would be a block and thus have a grid . )
The Multico
Everyone knows that NASA studies space ; fewer people know that NASA also studies Earth .
Since the agency ’s creation almost 50 years ago , NASA has been a world leader in space - based studies of our home planet .
Our mission has always been to explore , to discover , and to understand the world in which we live from the unique vantage point of space , and to share our newly gained perspectives with the public .
That spirit of sharing remains true today as NASA operates 18 of the most advanced Earth - observing satellites ever built , helping scientists make some of the most detailed observations ever made of our world .
In celebration of the deployment of its Earth Observing System , NASA is pleased to share the newest in its series of stunning Earth images , affectionately named the “ Blue Marble . ”
This new Earth imagery enhances the Blue Marble legacy by providing a detailed look at an entire year in the life of our planet .
In sharing these Blue Marble images , NASA hopes the public will join with the agency in its continuing exploration of our world from the unique perspective of space .
To learn more about the development of NASA ’s imagery of the Earth as a whole , read the History of the Blue Marble .
Enhancements Blue Marble : Next Generation offers greater spatial detail of the surface and spans a longer data collection period than the original .
The original Blue Marble was a composite of four months of MODIS observations with a spatial resolution ( level of detail ) of 1 square kilometer per pixel .
Blue Marble : Next Generation offers a year ’s worth of monthly composites at a spatial resolution of 500 meters .
These monthly images reveal seasonal changes to the land surface : the green - up and dying - back of vegetation in temperate regions such as North America and Europe , dry and wet seasons in the tropics , and advancing and retreating Northern Hemisphere snow cover .
From a computer processing standpoint , the major improvement is the development of a new technique for allowing the computer to automatically recognize and remove cloud - contaminated or otherwise bad data — a process that was previously done manually .
