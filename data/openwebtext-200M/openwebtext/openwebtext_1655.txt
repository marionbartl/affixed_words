The Man Who Wants to Northern Rock the Planet
Matt Ridley ’s irrational theories remain unchanged by his own disastrous experiment .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 1st June 2010
Brass neck does n’t begin to describe it .
Matt Ridley used to make his living partly by writing state - bashing columns in the Daily Telegraph .
The government , he complained , is “ a self - seeking flea on the backs of the more productive people of this world … governments do not run countries , they parasitise them . ” (1) Taxes , bail - outs , regulations , subsidies , intervention of any kind , he argued , are an unwarranted restraint on market freedom .
Then he became chairman of Northern Rock , where he was able to put his free market principles into practice .
Under his chairmanship , the bank pursued what the Treasury select committee later described as a “ high - risk , reckless business strategy ” ( 2 ) .
It was able to do so because the government agency which oversees the banks “ systematically failed in its regulatory duty ” ( 3 ) .
On 16th August 2007 , Dr Ridley rang an agent of the detested state to explore the possibility of a bail - out .
The self - seeking fleas agreed to his request , and in September the government opened a support facility for the floundering bank .
The taxpayer eventually bailed out Northern Rock to the tune of £ 27bn .
When news of the crisis leaked , it caused the first run on a bank in this country since 1878 .
The parasitic state had to intervene a second time : the run was halted only when the government guaranteed the depositors ’ money .
Eventually the government was obliged to nationalise the bank .
Investors , knowing that their money would now be safe as it was protected by the state , began to return .
While the crisis was made possible by a “ substantial failure of regulation ” , MPs identified the directors of Northern Rock as “ the principal authors of the difficulties that the company has faced ” .
They singled Ridley out for having failed “ to provide against the risks that [ Northern Rock ] was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members . ” ( 4 )
This , you might think , must have been a salutary experience .
You would be wrong .
Last week Dr Ridley published a new book called The Rational Optimist ( 5 ) .
He uses it as a platform to attack governments which , among other crimes , “ bail out big corporations ” ( 6 ) .
He lambasts intervention and state regulation , insisting that markets deliver the greatest possible benefits to society when left to their own devices .
Has there ever been a clearer case of the triumph of faith over experience ?
Free market fundamentalists , apparently unaware of Ridley ’s own experiment in market liberation , are currently filling cyberspace and the mainstream media with gasps of enthusiasm about his thesis .
Ridley provides what he claims is a scientific justification for unregulated business .
He maintains that rising consumption will keep enriching us for “ centuries and millennia ” to come ( 7 ) , but only if governments do n’t impede innovation .
He dismisses or denies the environmental consequences , laments our risk - aversion , and claims that the market system makes self - interest “ thoroughly virtuous ” ( 8 ) .
All will be well in the best of all possible worlds , as long as the “ parasitic bureaucracy ” keeps its nose out of our lives ( 9 ) .
His book is elegantly written and cast in the language of evolution , but it ’s the same old cornutopian nonsense we ’ve heard one hundred times before ( cornutopians are people who envisage a utopia of limitless abundance ( 10 ) ) .
In this case , however , it has already been spectacularly disproved by the author ’s experience .
The Rational Optimist is riddled with excruciating errors and distortions .
Ridley claims , for example , that “ every country that tried protectionism ” after the Second World War suffered as a result .
He cites South Korea and Taiwan as “ countries that went the other way ” , and experienced miraculous growth ( 11 ) .
In reality , the governments of both nations subsidised key industries , actively promoted exports and used tariffs and laws to shut out competing imports .
In both countries the state owned all the major commercial banks , allowing it to make decisions about investment ( 12,13,14 ) .
He maintains that “ Enron funded climate alarmism ” ( 15 ) .
The reference he gives demonstrates nothing of the sort , nor can I find evidence for this claim elsewhere ( 16 ) .
He says that “ no significant error has come to light ” in Bjorn Lomborg ’s book The Sceptical Environmentalist ( 17 ) .
In fact it contains so many significant errors that an entire book – The Lomborg Deception by Howard Friel – was required to document them ( 18 ) .
Ridley asserts that average temperature changes over “ the last three decades ” have been “ relatively slow ” ( 19 ) .
In reality the rise over this period has been the most rapid since instrumental records began ( 20 ) .
He maintains that “ eleven of thirteen populations ” of polar bears are “ growing or steady ” ( 21 ) .
There are in fact 19 populations of polar bears .
Of those whose fluctuations have been measured , one is increasing , three are stable and eight are declining ( 22 ) .
He uses blatant cherry - picking to create the impression that ecosystems are recovering : water snake numbers in Lake Erie , fish populations in the Thames , bird ’s eggs in Sweden ( 23 ) .
But as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment shows , of 65 global indicators of human impacts on biodiversity , only one – the extent of temperate forests – is improving .
Eighteen are stable , in all the other cases the impacts are increasing ( 24 ) .
Northern Rock grew rapidly by externalising its costs , pursuing money - making schemes that would eventually be paid for by other people .
Ridley encourages us to treat the planet the same way .
He either ignores or glosses over the costs of ever - expanding trade and perpetual growth .
His timing , as BP fails to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , is unfortunate .
Like the collapse of Northern Rock , the Deepwater Horizon disaster was made possible by weak regulation .
Ridley would weaken it even further , leaving public protection to the invisible hand of the market .
He might not have been chastened by experience , but it would be wrong to claim that he has learnt nothing .
On the contrary , he has developed a fine line in blame - shifting and post-rational justification .
He mentions Northern Rock only once in his book , where he blames the crisis on “ government housing and monetary policy . ” ( 25 ) It was the state wot made him do it .
He asserts that while he wants to reduce the regulation of markets in goods and services , he has “ always supported ” the careful regulation of financial markets ( 26 ) .
He provides no evidence for this and I cannot find it in anything he wrote before the crisis .
Other than that , he claims , he can say nothing , due to the terms of his former employment at the bank .
I suspect this constraint is overstated : it ’s unlikely that it forbids him from accepting his share of the blame .
It is only from the safety of the regulated economy , in which governments pick up the pieces when business screws up , that people like Dr Ridley can pursue their magical thinking .
Had the state he despises not bailed out his bank and rescued its depositors ’ money , his head would probably be on a pike by now .
Instead we see it on our television screens , instructing us to apply his irrational optimism more widely .
And no one has yet been rude enough to use the word discredited .

I hate this form letter 's worth of a column posited by so many pundits whenever the Red Wings are eliminated ...
The Red Wings expect to make the conference finals every season .
I respect their standard for success , and believe that they fell short of expectations this spring ... but that does n't mean that I do anything less than treasure every second of my time as a fan of the best team on the planet , nor does their disappointing finish diminish my gratefulness toward a team that I 've been lucky enough to watch play dominant hockey over the past 18 years .
I do n't take their success for granted , not for one second .
This last week might have marked the end of the road for Debbie ’s Cafe in Gheens , Louisiana , as seafood distributors stopped citing prices for locally caught shrimp and instead presented the owner with only one option : Imported shrimp .
( via AP )
“ The last price I got from him was for imported shrimp , and I said , ‘ No thank you , ' ” Debbie ’s owner Vicki Guillot told the AP Thursday , two days after she shut her doors for good .
Located roughly 50 miles southwest of New Orleans , Gheens is surrounded by water , located only a few dozen miles from the saltwater coast .
And yet as the oil spill in the Gulf has grown , and fishing has been barred from an increasing swath of ocean , the local fish supply has started drying up .
A way of life has hit a devastating road block – not just for fisherman and boaters , but also for people like Guillot , who have made a life out of buying from , and cooking for , the Gulf fishing community .
“ Our waters are all around here , ” she told the AP , as she broke into tears .
“ Our boys fished all the time .
To buy imported ? ”
After all the talk of relief wells and millions of barrels of lost oil , it is stories like Guillot ’s that put a face on the tragedy .
The oil has come , and Debbie ’s Cafe has gone .
It ’s likely never coming back .
The chickens - for - checkups candidate may have lost in this week ’s Nevada primary , but now the country has a potential Director of National Intelligence whose ability to garner federal money for private contractors once caused him to be compared to Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders .
When retired Air Force Lieut .
General James R. Clapper was between federal jobs in 2006 , he was appointed to the board of directors of a company that had received a $ 500 million contract from the agency he ’d previously headed .
The vice president of the firm boasted at the time to journalist Tim Shorrock , “ It ’s like hiring Colonel Sanders if you ’re selling fried chicken . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Clapper ’s nomination to serve as the Obama administration ’s next DNI has focused the spotlight on a man who is praised by his supporters for his many years of intelligence experience but who is equally well known for being part of a “ revolving door ” system in which he has shuttled between government service and working for private intelligence contractors who depend on government contracts .
Clapper has for many years been a solid although relatively undistinguished member of the old boys ’ network of intelligence professionals .
Since 2007 , he has held the post of Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence , a position to which he was appointed as part of a shake - up which followed Donald Rumsfeld ’s departure as Defense Secretary on December 18 , 2006 after the Democrats had taken back control of Congress .
But Clapper has also spent many years deeply embedded in a system where former top military officers alternate between federal jobs , in which they are responsible for handing out lucrative contracts to private contractors , and lobbying on behalf of the same private contractors to obtain those federal contracts .
According to Tim Shorrock ’s Spies for Hire : The Secret World of Intelligence Outsourcing , the 2007 shakeup that brought Clapper back into the Pentagon put an end to “ the corrosive rivalry between the Pentagon and the CIA ” but “ for the contractors , however , nothing changed . ”
“ Gates and Clapper continued to fund the expensive programs in netcentric warfare and information technology started by their predecessors , ” Shorrock explains .
“ One sign of the continuity was the Pentagon ’s record spending on secret research and development . ”

Prior to his retirement from the Air Force in 1995 , Clapper had been in the military for over 32 years , concluding his career with four years as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .
He then spent the next six years holding executive positions in three successive companies where , according to SourceWatch , “ his focus was on the intelligence community as a client . ”
In August 2001 , Clapper was appointed as director of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency , later renamed the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) .
It was while holding that position that he made the claim — for which he is now being mocked — that satellite imagery had “ led him to believe that illicit weapons material ‘ unquestionably ’ had been moved out of Iraq . ”
Clapper clashed with Rumsfeld , however , by telling him the NGA could function just as well under the Director of National Intelligence as under the Pentagon , and according to Shorrock that was why he was let go in June 2006 .
Clapper then spent several months working for yet another military contractor , DeticaDFI , before being appointed Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence in April 2007 , following Rumsfeld ’s resignation .

The potential for conflicts of interest resulting from this alternation between public and private service has earned Clapper the attention of the National Corruption Index ( NCI ) , which describes itself as dedicated to revealing the “ substructure of ingrained conflicts of interest , subtly understood quid pro quos and malfeasance / dereliction at the nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s most vital command posts . ”
Clapper ’s profile at the NCI website notes that just five months after he left DeticaDFI in 2007 , “ DeticaDFI was one of 11 contractors chosen by Clapper ’s office to share in a five - year contract worth $ 250 million . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
In addition , according to NCI , as head of the NGA , “ Clapper oversaw a program giving a single private contractor $ 500 million to design , build and launch a next - generation spy satellite .
In 2006 , he joined the winning company ’s board of directors . ”
According to Shorrock , that firm was GeoEye , the company whose vice president , Mark E. Brender , said of his decision to bring Clapper on board , “ It ’s like hiring Colonel Sanders if you ’re selling fried chicken . ”
The three firms in Virginia that Clapper had worked for between 1995 and 2001 also enjoyed profitable dealings with the federal government during his tenure .
In the late 90s , the end of the Cold War was prompting defense contractors to move their corporate headquarters to the Washington , DC suburbs and engage in active lobbying efforts , and all three of Clapper ’s employers appear to have been particularly successful at that game .
ADVERTISEMENT
The first , the Vredenburg IT group , became the beneficiary of an executive order signed by President Bill Clinton in 1995 to accelerate the declassification of National Security Agency documents .
The second , Booz Allen Hamilton , has employed so many former intelligence officers that it is sometimes described as Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ the shadow intelligence community .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Admiral Mike McConnell , who headed the National Security Agency while Clapper was running the DIA in the early 90s , joined Booz Allen at about the same time as Clapper did , in 1996 .
Booz Allen won its first multi-million dollar contract on the Total Information Awareness project the following year .
Clapper ’s longest stint was with the firm of SRA International , which he joined in 1998 .
In 1999 , SRA was awarded an estimated $ 22 million task order by the General Service Administration “ to provide systems integration services to the Army ’s Force Management Support Agency . ”
At the same time that he was with SRA , Clapper became president of the Security Affairs Support Association ( SASA ) , the trade group for intelligence contractors , which has since renamed itself the Intelligence and National Security Alliance ( INSA ) .
“ Reading through the lists of speakers at past SASA events is a voyage through the revolving door , ” Shorrock notes .
ADVERTISEMENT
In 2006 , in addition to his positions with DeticaDFI and on the board of GeoEye , Clapper held a professorship in the practice of intelligence at Georgetown University , funded by INSA .
When Clapper returned to the Pentagon in 2007 , however , he was praised as a consummate intelligence professional .
National Journal correspondent Shane Harris , for example , described the shake - up which had begun with Rumsfeld ’s resignation as “ the return of the grown - up . ”
Harris saw the turnover as something approaching a coup d’etat by the professional spymasters against Rumsfeld and the Neocons , under whose leadership the Pentagon had waged an ongoing war against the CIA .
“ After two years of turnover and uncertainty in the top ranks of the U.S. intelligence establishment , ” Harris wrote , “ which saw such outsiders as a former congressman and a career ambassador elevated to high posts , four of their own are now in control or soon will be . ”
The four high - level intelligence professionals to whom Harris referred were former CIA Director Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense , former National Security Agency director Mike McConnell as Director of National Intelligence , another former NSA director , Michael Hayden , as head of the CIA , and James Clapper , who became both an undersecretary in the Defense Department and McConnell ’s chief adviser on military intelligence .
ADVERTISEMENT
Harris described all four men as “ professionally close ” to one another and noted that “ while McConnell was leading the NSA in the early 1990s , Clapper was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency , and Gates was head of the CIA .
…
Also , when McConnell was the military official in charge of intelligence for Operation Desert Storm , Clapper was the assistant chief of staff for Air Force intelligence and played a leading role in coordinating the air war . ”
Michael Hayden and Mike McConnell both left the government after the election of Barack Obama , with McConnell returning to his former job at Booz Allen Hamilton .
It was the new administration ’s decision , however , that in order to provide continuity , “ Defense Secretary Robert Gates will be staying on in the top Pentagon job , for at least the first year of the Obama administration . ”
A year and a half later , however , Gates shows no signs of leaving , while Clapper — described by Shorrock as Gates ’ partner in bestowing “ record spending on secret research and development ” upon private contractors — is in line for a far more prominent and powerful position as DNI .
It could be the cutbacks to the city ’s transportation system , or a general decline in urban civility .
Perhaps people are just in a collective bad mood .
What else could explain why New Yorkers — notoriously hardened to the slings and arrows of everyday life here — are spitting on bus drivers ?
Of all the assaults that prompted a bus operator to take paid leave in 2009 , a third of them , 51 in total , “ involved a spat upon , ” according to statistics the Metropolitan Transportation Authority released on Monday .
No weapon was involved in these episodes .
“ Strictly spitting , ” said Charles Seaton , a New York City Transit spokesman .
The 2.3.7 release slipped out the door too hastily .
Fixing compatibility with the rails_xss plugin inadvertently forced everyone to use it .
Facepalm .
I apologize for wasting a chunk of your day on installing what ought to have been a patch - level update only to find it breaks your app .
That ’s well out of line with our stable release process and it ’s my fault for stepping out of it .
I got caught up in a sky - is - falling response to a 2.3.6 bug that affected a handful of users and responded with a fix that exposed a new flaw to nearly all users , despite testing and sanity checking .
Thanks for all your feedback today .
We hear you , and yes , a thousand times yes .
Every stable release , including point releases , deserves the same methodical drumbeat on its march from git stable to to .pre gem to final gem .
Expect no less .
Now , on to the gem-cutting : Rails 2.3.8 is available now , bringing us back to stable ground .
Many of us are familiar with Donald Rumsfeld 's famous ( and surprisingly useful ) taxonomy of knowledge :
There are known knowns .
These are things we know that we know .
There are known unknowns .
That is to say , there are things that we now know we do n’t know .
But there are also unknown unknowns .
These are things we do not know we do n’t know .
But this taxonomy ( as originally described ) omits an important fourth category : unknown knowns , the things we do n't know that we know .
This category encompasses the knowledge of many of our own personal beliefs , what I call unquestioned defaults .
For example , most modern Americans possess the unquestioned default belief that they have some moral responsibility for their own freely - chosen actions .
In the twelfth century , most Europeans possessed the unquestioned default belief that the Christian god existed .
And so on .
These unknown knowns are largely the products of a particular culture ; they require homogeneity of belief to remain unknown .
By definition , we are each completely ignorant of our own unknown knowns .
So even when our culture gives us a fairly accurate map of the territory , we 'll never notice the Mercator projection 's effect .
Unless it 's pointed out to us or we find contradictory evidence , that is .
A single observation can be all it takes , if you 're paying attention and asking questions .
The answers might not change your mind , but you 'll still come out of the process with more knowledge than you went in with .
When I was eighteen I went on a date with a girl I 'll call Emma , who conscientiously informed me that she already had two boyfriends : she was , she said , polyamorous .
I had previously had some vague awareness that there had been a free love movement in the sixties that encouraged " alternative lifestyles " , but that awareness was not a sufficient motivation for me to challenge my default belief that romantic relationships could only be conducted one at a time .
Acknowledging default settings is not easy .
The chance to date a pretty girl , though , can be sufficient motivation for a great many things ( as is also the case with pretty boys ) .
It was certainly a good enough reason to ask myself , " Self , what 's so great about this monogamy thing ? "
I could n't come up with any particularly compelling answers , so I called Emma up and we planned a second date .
Since that fateful day , I 've been involved in both polyamorous and monogamous relationships , and I 've become quite confident that I am happier , more fulfilled , and a better romantic partner when I am polyamorous .
This holds even when I 'm dating only one person ; polyamorous relationships have a kind of freedom to them that is impossible to obtain any other way , as well as a set of similarly unique responsibilities .
In this discussion I am targeting monogamy because its discovery has had an effect on my life that is orders of magnitude greater than that of any other previously - unknown known .
Others I 've spoken with have had similar experiences .
If you have n't had it before , you now have the same opportunity that I lucked into several years ago , if you choose to exploit it .
This , then , is your exercise : spend five minutes thinking about why your choice of monogamy is preferable to all of the other inhabitants of relationship - style - space , for you .
Other options that have been explored and documented include :
Non-consensual non-monogamy , the most popular alternative .
Swinging , in which couples engage in social , recreational sex , mostly with other couples .
Polyamory , the practice , desire , or acceptance of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with the knowledge and consent of everyone involved .
This category is extremely broad , but the most common variations include : Polyfidelity , in which > 2 people form a single committed relationship that does not allow outside partners .
Hierarchical polyamory , in which each individual has ( usually ) one primary partner and some number of secondary partners .
These labels typically reflect the level of commitment involved , and are not a ranking of preference .
" Intimate networks " , in which each person maintains some number of independent relationships without explicit rankings or descriptions , such that a graph ( the data structure ) is the best way to describe all the individuals and relationships involved .
These types of polyamory cover many of the available options , but there are others ; some are as yet unknown .
Some relationship styles are better than others , subject to your ethics , history , and personality .
I suspect that monogamy is genuinely the best option for many people , perhaps even most .
But it 's impossible for you to know that until you know that you have a choice .
If you have a particularly compelling argument for or against a particular relationship style , please share it .
But if romantic jealousy is your deciding factor in favor of monogamy , you may want to hold off on forming a belief that will be hard to change ; my next post will be about techniques for managing and reducing romantic jealousy .
Well , first of all , because they have a lot of sex , and that makes everyone happy .
They can also lick their own pink bits .
But male rabbits are particularly pleased and confident because if they were to get bobbited , they could regrow a new penis .
Researchers at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine have discovered that fully functioning penile tissue can be regenerated by rabbits , much in the same way a salamander can grow a new tail .
This may be good news for men with erectile dysfunction and men who may have lost their penises or use of the member due to an injury , disease or insane wife .
The team had success in using cells from rabbits to grow replacement penile erectile tissue for the rabbits in the laboratory .
After the tissue was implanted , the rabbits had completely normal sexual function and even fathered baby rabbits .
The same team of hero scientists who worked with the rabbit penises are well known for engineering human organs in the lab .
They are responsible for the engineered bladders of about 30 children and adults .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 21/4/2010 ( 3815 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
The City of Winnipeg has set aside at least $ 2.7 million to study transit and transportation since Sam Katz was elected mayor -- and may spend another $ 100,000 over the next three months .
On Wednesday , city council 's executive policy committee voted to spend up to $ 100,000 by July on a study that will compare the costs and benefits of light - rail transit versus bus rapid transit .
Jenny Gerbasi : ‘ Finish it off ’
" It 's time for Winnipeg to get out of the Dark Ages , " Katz told EPC , which also voted Wednesday to remove the second phase of the Southwest Rapid Transit Corridor from a city wish list for infrastructure funding .
The city is in the midst of building the 3.6 - kilometre first phase of the bus corridor , which runs from Queen Elizabeth Way near The Forks to Jubilee Avenue near Pembina Highway , at a cost of $ 138 million .
The Selinger government has offered the city $ 63 million toward the $ 210 - million cost of building the six - kilometre second leg of the corridor , but Katz wants to spend that money on other road and bridge projects .
The mayor said he 's turned down the provincial money because it falls short of the $ 73.3 - million figure that represents one - third of the cost of Phase 2 , noting all three levels of government must agree to pay projects financed by the Building Canada Fund .
The mayor also said Winnipeg has not received its fair share of infrastructure money from this program .
On Wednesday , Katz again called on Premier Greg Selinger to fly to Ottawa with him to lobby the federal Conservatives to fund a light - rail network in Winnipeg .
The Selinger government has been cool to the idea and wants Winnipeg to complete the bus corridor before it explores other rapid - transit options .
Appearing before EPC , Fort Rouge Coun.
Jenny Gerbasi accused Katz of repeating a manoeuvre from 2004 , when the newly elected mayor cancelled plans for a bus corridor and asked the city to study rapid transit instead .
" Finish it off , " said Gerbasi .
" Do n't kill it again . "
In 2005 , the Katz - commissioned Rapid Transit Task Force concluded Winnipeg was better suited for bus rapid transit .
But the city began dabbling with light rail again in 2009 , when consulting firm HDR was awarded a $ 53,000 contract to develop a business case for converting bus rapid transit to light - rail transit .
Katz said another $ 100,000 study is needed to verify a claim made last month by an unnamed rail - industry official who contends light - rail transit now costs no more than twice as much as bus rapid transit , as opposed to six times as much .
Light rail also does more to reduce greenhouse gases and increase both ridership and urban density , the mayor said .
Sam Katz : ‘ Time ... to get out of the Dark Ages ’
His critics are not convinced .
" This is n't time to study rapid transit .
This is the time to build rapid transit , " said Paul Hesse of the Winnipeg Rapid Transit Coalition .
Over the last two years , the city has also devoted $ 1.25 million to develop a transportation authority and another $ 1.15 million to develop a new transportation strategy .
The multitude of transportation studies seems redundant , said Colin Craig of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation .
" It 's like they 're commissioning them now for the fun of it .
Unfortunately , it 's costing taxpayers a fortune , " he said .
" I understand what the mayor wants to do with light rail , but how many times do you need to study it ? "

Flotilla humanitarian aid has not yet been transferred to Gaza
Hilary Leila Krieger and AP contributed to this report .
Israel said on Monday it would not let Iranian ships sail to Gaza after the Iranian Red Crescent announced it would send two vessels to the region in the coming week .
“ If we did n’t let an Irish ship reach Gaza , we are certainly not going to let Iranian ships pass , ” one diplomatic official said .
The official added that it was not yet clear how serious the Iranian threat was , and that there was often “ a lot of bluster ” coming out of Teheran .
“ The Iranian regime has called for Israel to be wiped off the map and has a proven track record of supplying dangerous weapons to Hamas and Hizbullah , ” the official said .
“ Obviously , any shipment from Iran to Gaza would be a major concern .
” Abdolrauf Adibzadeh , the Iranian Red Crescent director for international affairs , told a French news agency : “ One ship will carry donations made by the people and the other will carry relief workers .
The ships will be sent to Gaza by end of this week . ”
The decision to send aid ships came a day after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested that the Revolutionary Guards could be sent to protect ships trying to break the Gaza blockade .
Diplomatic officials in Jerusalem said such a move would pose a challenge not only to Israel , but also to Egypt , which could not be pleased at the prospect of the Revolutionary Guard sailing through the Suez Canal .
Defense officials said Israel would not allow the ships to reach Gaza .
“ Iran is Hamas ’s main supplier of weaponry , ” one official said .
“ We can not take a chance that there is weaponry on the ships . ”
This would not be the first time Iran sent ships to test Israel ’s blockade of Gaza .
In January 2009 , during Operation Cast Lead , an Iranian ship was dispatched with what was claimed to be humanitarian cargo .
While Israeli soldiers never boarded the vessel , the navy preventing it from reaching its destination by blocking sailing lanes into Gaza Port .
Also on Monday , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued to lambaste Israel , saying during a press conference in Istanbul with Syrian President Bashar Assad that last week ’s raid on the flotilla had been a violation of international law and human values .
He also urged Israel to accept an international probe into the raid .
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu met on Monday , for the second time in two days , with his inner cabinet , a forum known as the septet , and discussed the type of probe that would be set up to look into the raid on thelast week .
Although the Prime Minister ’s Office made no official announcement , it is widely believed that the ministers agreed to the establishment of an Israeli investigative committee – and not a wider government commission of inquiry – with the participation of two foreign observers , one American and one from an unnamed country .
It is not clear who will lead the probe , but one name being prominently mentioned is law professor Ruth Lapidot .
The panel is expected to question the political echelon and senior military officials , but not the soldiers who took part in the raid .
It is also expected to look at the legality of the naval blockade on Gaza , and the legality and manner in which Israel prevented the flotilla from reaching Gaza .
In the midst of a debate on the matter , President Shimon Peres reportedly told Netanyahu during a meeting on Monday that if he wanted to prevent further international isolation of Israel , moving forward on the peace process with the Palestinians would be more important than the establishment of a flotilla probe .
Jerusalem is also discussing the framework of the probe with Washington , to ensure the committee meets US requirements .
The State Department stressed that it expected Israel to fulfill the obligations for a credible investigation laid out last week , though officials declined to address specific configurations .
“ We expect the Israeli government to conduct a prompt , impartial , credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards that gets to all the facts surrounding this tragic incident , ” one State Department official said .
The official reiterated the US position that Washington was “ open to different ways of assuring a credible investigation , including international participation , ” without specifying which arrangement was preferred .
“ We will continue to discuss these ideas with the Israelis and our international partners in the days ahead , ” the official said .
“ This is a very difficult situation that requires careful , thoughtful responses from all concerned .
” The type of probe being formulated in Jerusalem is unlikely to suffice for Turkey ’s Erdogan , however , who on Monday said : “ If there is hatred , it is Israel ’s hatred .
If there is terror , it is Israel ’s state terrorism . ”
With Assad at his side , Erdogan said Israel should “ look in the mirror ” for the perpetrators of terrorism , and called on the United States to “ protect the honor of its own citizen . ”
This was in reference to one of the nine men killed on the boat , who was a dual US Turkish national living in Turkey .
In response to a question about the fiveactivists listed by Israel as having ties to terrorist organizations , Erdogan said : “ If there were any terrorists , then why were they set free ? ”
Israel decided not to prosecute those who had been on the ships , but rather to deport them , in an effort to limit the diplomatic fallout .
Assad said the blockade of Gaza must end .
“ This embargo , this blockade must be lifted , and at the same time Israeli must be placed in a cage of crime , ” the Syrian president said .
“ It must be placed under quarantine so that it cannot spread disease to anybody . ”
Erdogan strongly urged Hamas and Fatah to quickly reconcile their differences at a time when Palestinian unity was of utmost importance .
“ Hamas has given its consent to us to broker a dialogue , ” he said .
“ We will also talk to Fatah and see their position . ” Erdogan and Assad ’s comments came on the opening day of an Istanbul summit on Asian security .
Nine heads of state , including Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , are scheduled to attend the two - day Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia .
Israel is represented at the conference by its envoy in Ankara .
Israeli diplomatic officials , continuing a policy put into place immediately after the flotilla incident , refused to respond to Erdogan ’s comments .
“ We are not looking for a public shouting match with the Turks , ” one official said .
“ So far , the shouting has been one - sided and we have earned respect from certain quarters in the world for showing restraint in the face of comments that can only be termed as undiplomatic .
” In a related development , the Defense Ministry said on Monday it had transferred all the humanitarian aid that had been on the flotilla intercepted last week from the Ashdod Port to the military ’s Tzrifin Base near Rishon Lezion .
The equipment , which includes medicine that has expired , as well as used clothing , wheelchairs , couches and carpets , was being stored at the base after Hamas refused to allow it to be transferred to the Gaza Strip .
The coordinator of government activities in the territories , Maj. - Gen. Eitan Dangot , has instructed his team to hold talks with international organizations to find a way to get the supplies into Gaza .
BUFFALO ,
N.Y .
-- A former Staten Island resident with two drunken driving convictions on the borough pleaded guilty in Buffalo to driving with a blood - alcohol reading seven times the legal limit , according to published reports -- just two months after receiving a liver transplant .
Gurninderjit Thandi , 32 , entered the plea on Friday , according to wivb.com .
Thandi , who now lives in Cheektowaga ,
N.Y. ,
had a blood alcohol reading of .56 percent after an alleged hit - and - run incident on March 20 , when he struck a pedestrian , two parked cars and a moving vehicle in his hometown , according to the
.
A blood - alcohol reading of .35 percent , for most , would be the equivalent of being under anesthesia for surgery , the Buffalo News reported , citing information from the American Council for Drug Education .
Thandi pleaded guilty to felonious aggravated drunken driving , aggravated unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an incident without reported it , according to the News .
He is due to be sentenced Aug. 24 .
The Staten Island charges came five years ago .
An Iranian ship claiming to be carrying humanitarian aid bound for the Gaza Strip left the port city of Bandar - Abbas on Sunday .

In addition , another Gaza - bound ship is expected to sail from Lebanon .
The Israel Defense Forces regard this ship as a greater nuisance , given the short distance separating Lebanon and Gaza .
Undeterred by the government 's decision yesterday to establish an independent public committee into the raid against the Gaza - bound flotilla , United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is moving forward with plans to form an internationally sanctioned investigative forum to probe the deadly events .
According to UN sources at the world body 's headquarters in New York , Ban is holding discussions with the five permanent members of the Security Council while seeking the advice of international observers , all in an effort to formulate an " international authority " that would investigate the Israel Navy 's takeover of the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara on May 31 .

UN sources added , however , that Ban was not interested in dispatching an investigative committee similar to that headed by South African judge Richard Goldstone , who probed the Operation Cast Lead military offensive in the Gaza Strip .
After a three - hour discussion , the cabinet yesterday approved the public committee into the Gaza flotilla events in a unanimous vote .
" It is not ideal , but the other options are less good , " Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said regarding the probe .
" The flotilla to Gaza was not a one - time incident .
We are in the midst of a difficult and continuous fight against the State of Israel . "
A retired Supreme Court justice , Jacob Turkel , will head the committee , which will also include two international observers and tackle the legality of the blockade of Gaza and the legality of the navy 's actions .
Despite the government 's decision , Netanyahu stressed yesterday that Jerusalem remains wary of continued attempts by international players to establish further inquiries .
Aside from Ban 's efforts , Turkey 's outright dismissal of the Israeli panel gives Jerusalem pause .
" We believe that Israel , as a country which attacked a civil convoy in international waters , will not conduct an impartial inquiry , " Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said yesterday .
" If an international commission is not set up and Turkey 's rightful demands are ignored , Turkey has the right to review its relations with Israel , " Davutoglu said at a press conference in Ankara .
Netanyahu also remains concerned after the United States did not explicitly pledge to veto any resolution brought before the Security Council that calls for an international inquiry .
Washington has thus far made do with a statement praising the IDF for its investigative procedures .
The European Union urged Israel yesterday to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip , and called for " credible international participation " in an investigation of the flotilla raid .
In Luxembourg , Mideast mediator Tony Blair said he hopes Israel will soon ease the three - year - old blockade by allowing commercial goods and reconstruction materials to flow into the Palestinian territory .
Netanyahu raised eyebrows yesterday by nominating to the panel individuals who have long ended their public service careers .
The average age of the Israeli committee members is 84 .
The head of the panel , Turkel , is 75 years old ; Professor Shabtai Rosen , a renowned international law expert , is 93 and Maj. Gen. ( res. ) Amos Horev is 86 .
Judges in Israel retire at the age of 70 .
Legal experts were also puzzled at Israel 's decision to allow foreigners to observe the panel 's work .
" I do not know of an internal inquiry committee that has international observers , " said Professor Yoram Dinstein , an expert in international law .
" This is very strange . "
In addition to the Turkel committee , State Comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss is likely to probe two main issues related to the flotilla raid if such an inquiry is launched .
A Lindenstrauss probe would partially focus on the role of the National Security Council in the decision - making process that preceded the raid , and it would also delve into Israel 's public relations campaign in the raid 's aftermath .
With little time to spare , Capitol lawmakers gathered outside the Supreme Court Thursday to propose an antidote to the court ’s damaging decision to open elections to unlimited attack and advocacy ads financed from the shadows by special - interest money .
Senator Charles Schumer , Democrat of New York , and Representative Chris Van Hollen , Democrat of Maryland , are calling for new legislation that would let the voters know which financiers are stalking or plumping for which federal candidates .
The United States Chamber of Commerce immediately , predictably , warned that the new disclosure rules would “ silence constitutionally protected speech . ”
Actually , the measure applies sunshine , not silence , to secretive , end - run campaign spending .
Just as Frank Perdue used to proudly back his chickens , the proposed legislation requires the chief donors in corporate , union and shell organization ads to stand by their message before the cameras .
It ’s healthy and candid .
And to make informed choices , the voters certainly need to know .

Mississippi ’s governor Haley Barbour is not about to let oil washing up on the state ’s beaches ruin the tourism industry .
“ The truth is we have had virtually no oil , ” Barbour told Fox News Sunday .
“ We ’ve had a few tar balls but we have a few every year ” because of natural seepage in the Gulf of Mexico .
It ’s all the fault of the damn media , Barbour insists .
“ The biggest negative impact for us has been the news coverage , ” he grumbled .
A sign warning beach - goers on Petit Bois Island , Mississippi .
On June 1 , however , the media reported that oil from the BP gusher had indeed washed up on Mississippi ’s beaches .
“ Oil from the BP Gulf of Mexico gusher hit beaches in Alabama and Mississippi for the first time Tuesday .
It ’s definitely not the kind of news the states wanted to deliver with the start of the summer beach season newly underway , ” NPR reported last week .
Or rather it is not the sort of news Barbour wants to accept even though he admitted last week Petit Bois Island , a barrier island near the Mississippi - Alabama border , had been hit by the oil .
Barbour has compared the slick to the thin sheen of oil commonly found around ski boats .
Meanwhile , also on Sunday , the Intel Hub website reported rumors of a federal troop deployment in Louisiana .
Shepard Ambellas , who reported on a mass grave site at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Cemetery in Phoenix , Arizona , in 2009 , reports possible “ battle hardened troops ” or National Guard outfitted in full battle gear and body armor have been seen moving into Grand Isle , Louisiana .
Ambellas writes :
As of 12:00 PM CST , possible battle hardened troops or National Guard , in full battle gear and body armor with have been seen moving into the area .
Fully armored HUMVEES with 50 Cal active gun turrets are reportedly arriving on scene as well .
All troops and vehicles are in woodland patterns .
Black trucks with red letters displaying “ Disaster Relief Team ” have also arrived .
FEMA contractors and mobile facilities are present .
The Crisis Management Corp. is reportedly present as well .
Our reporters see no visible sign that the troops are National Guard at this time .
They reported the troops looked “ battle hardened ” .
Ambellas and the Intel Hub believe the deployment is the “ first step in a massive coastal evacuation that could potentially disperse 40 - 50 million people . ”
Rumors concerning a massive evacuation have persisted since the beginning of the oil leak in late April .
U.S. Army National Guard B Company 711 receiving instructions for putting Hesco containers along the beaches of Dauphin Island , Alabama , Sunday , May 2 , 2010 .
Maryann Tobin , writing for the the Albuquerque Examiner on May 9 , stated FEMA “ and other government agencies ” have prepared to evacuate the Tampa Bay area ahead of a “ controlled burn of surface oil in the Gulf of Mexico . ”
Tobin did not cite sources .
On May 4 , up to 17,500 U.S. Army National Guard troops were mobilized by the Pentagon “ to help various states with the oil spill , ” according to the Associated Press .
“ Defense Secretary Robert Gates has granted requests to send troops of up to 6,000 by Louisiana , 3,000 by Alabama , 2,500 by Florida and 6,000 by Mississippi . ”
It is interesting to note the large number of troops deployed to Mississippi .
As noted above , Mississippi ’s governor Haley Barbour states oil is not a problem in the state .

Janine Wedel has written extensively on how the “ shadow elite ” rule the world and about the “ flexians ” – the movers and shakers of the shadow elite who glide across borders , and structure overlapping ( and not fully revealed ) roles in government , business , media , and think tanks to serve their own agendas .
Wedel says that flexians wear many hats both within and outside of government , and use their networks of contacts to influence policy – are warping our democracy and the rule of law .
Peter Sutherland is the quintessential flexian .
According to his September 2009 bio :
Peter Sutherland is chairman of BP plc ( 1997 – current ) .
He is also chairman of Goldman Sachs International ( 1995 – current ) .
He was appointed chairman of the London School of Economics in 2008 … .
Before these appointments , he was the founding director - general of the World Trade Organisation .
He had previously served as director general of GATT since July 1993 ….
Sutherland resigned as BP ’s chairman in 2009 , but apparently still serves in various key capacities .
Sutherland is managing director – as well as chairman – of Goldman Sachs International ( Goldman Sachs International is the very powerful subsidiary of the Goldman Sachs Group , of which Lloyd Blankfein is CEO ) .
Sutherland is also an Advisory Director of the Goldman Sachs Group itself .
And he is European Chairman for the Trilateral Commission .
He has , at various times , attended meetings of the Bilderberg group .
As if that is not enough , Sutherland also serves in the following capacities ( click on “ Read Full Background ” ) :
Mr. Sutherland served as an Attorney General of Ireland and also served as European Commissioner from 1985 to 1989 where he was responsible for competition policy … .
He serves as the Chairman of British Petroleum , BP Amoco PLC and United Kingdom .
From 1989 to 1993 , he served as the Chairman of Allied Irish Bank . ….
He serves as a Non-Executive Director of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson .
He serves as a Director of Goldman Sachs International .
He has been Member of Supervisory Board at Allianz SE since January 2010 and serves as its Member of International Advisory Board …. Mr. Sutherland served as a Non Executive Director of BP Plc since July 1995 .
He serves as a Member of Foundation Board of World Economic Forum .
He served as an Independent Non Executive Director of National Westminster Bank PLC since January 2001 .
He served as an Independent Non Executive Director of The Royal Bank Of Scotland Plc from January 2001 to February 6 , 2009 … .
In addition , he serves on the board of Allianz , Koc Holding A.S. and is a member of the advisory board of Eli Lilly … .
He served as a Director of LM Ericsson Telephone Co since 1996 , Ericsson SPA since 1996 and Investor AB since 1995 .
He served as a Non Executive Director of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc from January 2001 to February 6 , 2009 .
Sutherland is – literally – like Lloyd Blankfein and Tony Hayward rolled into one .
But unlike Blankfein and Hayward , he has also held numerous powerful governmental and quasi - governmental positions .

Organic foods have seen an absolute explosion in popularity over the past few years .
More people are caring what goes into what they eat and where it comes from .
When it comes to distilled spirits , many of these same environmentally - conscious people drink vodka made from the same industrial neutral grain spirit manufactured by ADM .
While not every distillery has the capacity to ferment their grains themselves to make vodka , places like Organic Nation are sourcing their neutral grain base spirits from organic and environmentally - sensitive sources .
Based in Ashland , Oregon , Organic Nation is a great example of a mico - distillery doing something unique and blazing a trail for the industry .
Organic Nation produces two distilled spirits , Organic Nation Vodka and Organic Nation Gin .
Of the two , we really fell in love with the Organic Nation Gin , one of our favorite balanced mixing gins .
Here ’s how the two spirits scored with our panel :
Organic Nation Vodka ( 80 proof ) –
As with many vodkas , the nose on the Organic Nation was pretty light with a slightly soft smell , although a little more vaopry than we like .
The entry is soft that expands with a small amount of heat .
There ’s the slightest hint of grain and confectioner ’s sugar but fairly muted .
The heat increases on the finish and we noticed some burning towards the front of the mouth .
It ultimately dries out but takes a while and leaves you with a small cooling effect .
Not a bad vodka by any means but neither flavorful nor clean enough to get extremely excited about .
Organic Nation Vodka Rating :
Recommended – a solid vodka but we ’d like to see more flavor or more cooling
Organic Nation Gin ( 86 proof ) –
While we were n’t head - over - heels for Organic Nation ’s Vodka , we did absolutely fall for the Organic Nation Gin .
The nose on Organic Nation Gin is very soft with notes of pine , pepper and lemon .
The entry is very sweet with a symphony of grapefruit peel , orange rind , lemon , pine , pepper , anise , cardamom , and mint .
The taste is well balanced among all the elements with room for each to really shine .
It has a nice flavorful finish that ’s more citrus than herbal and leaves the mouth very cool .
Organic Nation ’s
Gin is simply delicious , with a perfect mix of flavors that are ideal for mixing in cocktails or to stand out well in a gin and tonic .
Organic Nation Gin Rating :
Very Highly Recommended – a great gin that ’s perfect for mixing ; definitely worth seeking out .
Organic Nation Gin has earned a permanent spot in the Drink Spirits liquor cabinet .
We ’d love to see Organic Nation take their vodka to the next level and explore in - distillery fermentation .
The skill in distilling is there and we ’d love to see them do something like Dry Fly does with their vodka .

Cool new tactics :
Ice cream music was played to crowd
Forget water cannons to cool off rioters .
The PSNI has a new tactic to deal with street disorder .
Ice cream music was played to a crowd of bottle - throwing youths on the outskirts of west Belfast — and it stopped them .
The tunes were blasted through the Tannoy of an armoured ‘ polar bear ’ Land Rover after the patrol came under attack from about 15 teenagers in the Twinbrook estate last weekend .
The police have said no further action was taken and none of the youths were “ scooped ” .
And although Constable Whippy ’s injection of humour may have worked once , the move is unlikely to be repeated after senior officers took a dim view of the tactic .
“ The crew passed a group of around 15 youths who threw bottles at their Land Rover police vehicle , ” a PSNI spokesman told the Belfast Telegraph .
“ An officer used the vehicle 's Tannoy system to play music to the youths in an effort to use humour to defuse the situation .
“ The youths stopped throwing the bottles .
However police accept that this was not an appropriate action .
“ The officer has been spoken to by a senior officer in order to establish the circumstances of the incident . ”
He added : “ Police in Lisburn are absolutely committed to tackling the issue of on - street drinking and , in response to concerns raised by our partners in the community , regularly take action against public drinking .
“ D District have the highest number of alcohol seizures in Northern Ireland , with Lisburn itself leading the way . ”
Also among those who did not see the funny side was Sinn Fein councillor Angela Nelson .
“ It was a very immature way for police to deal with a very serious problem , ” she said .
“ We have serious issues with on - street drinking and the anti-social behaviour that results from that on - street drinking .
“ There are a lot of older people and pensioners in the Glasvey Drive area .
“ I would have expected the PSNI to have a more mature outlook and not to come up and play ice cream tunes . ”
Mrs Nelson , who volunteers with the Safer Neighbourhoods Project and has first - hand experience of the impact of anti-social behaviour on the community , dismissed the PSNI ’s statement which said the music had defused a tense situation .
“ That is a very good excuse when they have been caught out .
It ’s waffle .
“ Where in the world does a police service say that their way of dealing with anti-social behaviour is through humour ?
“ Every weekend our Safer Neighbourhoods Project is out dealing with situations related with anti-social behaviour .
“ Trying to inject humour to defuse it is not suitable . ”

Singapore is seeking to extradite a British man accused of spray - painting a subway carriage last month .
A court has issued an arrest warrant for Lloyd Dane Alexander for allegedly breaking into a train depot and vandalising a subway carriage on 16 May with Oliver Fricker , a Swiss national , the Singapore police force said today .
Singapore has a reputation for meting out severe punishments for relatively minor crimes .
Vandalism carries a maximum fine of SG $ 2,000 ( £ 980 ) or up to three years in jail , in addition to three to eight strokes of a wooden cane .
Police said Alexander has fled Singapore and authorities will seek to extradite him , depending on the extradition treaty Singapore has with the country where he is eventually located .
Officers did not give details of Alexander 's age , profession or possible whereabouts .
The Straits Times reported that the Briton had left the country for Hong Kong before the incident was reported to police on 19 May .
Fricker , 33 , was charged with trespassing into a protected place and two charges of vandalism on Saturday .
He is currently on bail , with a preliminary hearing set for 21 June .
The two men are alleged to have cut through the fence of the SMRT rail depot before spray - painting graffiti on one side of a train .
Singapore caned American teenager Michael Fey for vandalism in 1994 – ignoring pleas for leniency by then US president Bill Clinton – in a case that drew international attention to the country 's harsh punishments .
Fortunately , restoring mental vitality requires nothing more than commonplace activities in everyday environments .
In fact , since everyday nature is sufficient , there may be no special advantage to time spent in spectacular environments .
For instance , the simple activity of walking in natural settings , particularly walking mindfully , may be all that is needed for restoration .
The article concludes with a series of specific prescriptions for enhancing our ability to cope with the coming transition , which can be summarized as simply to spend time walking outdoors , regularly , surrounded by and mindful of everyday nature .
Abstract Coping with the challenges of global climate disruption and the peaking of the rate of fossil fuel production will require behavioral change on a massive scale .
There are many skills that will help individuals deal with this coming transition but none more central than the abilities to problem - solve creatively , plan and restrain behavior , and manage the emotions that result from the loss of an affluent lifestyle .
These abilities require a mental state called vitality .
Even in the best of circumstances , maintaining this state can be difficult and , to make matters worse , it seems that modern culture is conspiring to wear down this aspect of mental effectiveness .
This article discusses mental vitality as being based upon the capacity to direct attention .
Functioning effectively despite the distractions and challenges of an electrifying and changing world fatigues this capacity .
Restoring one ’s ability to direct attention is explained as a likely precondition to effective problem - solving , planning , and self - regulating , thus making such restoration essential for high levels of individual performance in general and for thoughtful coping in particular .
4. Provides a prescription for maintaining this vital mental capacity .
By following the prescription offered , we can restore and better manage our mental vitality .
In a restored state we will have a greater ability both to pursue behaviors that heal nature and to learn to live well , within limits , on this one planet .
3 . Explains what directed attention is , how it differs from another form of attention , how it fatigues , and the environments that help to restore it .
This transition is crucial and overdue , but hard .
The process requires that we think and act in clever , clearheaded , and new ways .
Yet such thought and action can wear us out mentally .
Burned out people cannot help heal the planet .
Thus , we need to know specifically what mental capacity is wearing out , how it wears out , and the conditions under which it can be restored .
This article explores these issues and :
The general prescription presented here is to spend more time in natural settings regardless of what other activities we are pursuing during our day .
However , theory and research allow us to be somewhat more specific .
Because at this time most of us would benefit from doing more walking , we can use it as a prototype behavior .
Soon we may need to walk not just for contemplation and restoration , but for basic locomotion .
The prescription below is likely relevant for either circumstance .
Clearly this prescription contains many researchable issues with important theoretical and practical implications , but they are derived from a central question : what are the conditions under which walking effectively revitalizes the mind ?
More specifically , where , how , and with whom should we walk ?
What to do
The prescription is simply to walk in a natural setting .
Nothing extreme , neither grand nor distant , is required .
A walk during lunch down tree - lined streets , a restful interlude in a vest pocket park , or an evening stroll through neighborhood nature will suffice .
Certainly the choice of what walking route to take does matter .
In a study that validated aspects of attention restoration theory , a walking route through an arboretum that was tree - lined and separated from traffic significantly improved mental effectiveness when compared to a route in the same area and of the same length but more urban in character ( Berman , Jonides , & Kaplan , 2008 ) .
Walking is a deceptively simple yet apparently effective means of promoting deep contemplation ( Loehle , 1990 ) .
Regular walks , which are rare today , were used to great effect by generations of thinkers .
Darwin is known to have walked on a planned route while he worked on some of his more difficult problems .
The familiarity of the route he walked likely minimized the attentional demands of navigation .
The natural setting with its quiet fascination may have allowed him to feel quite far away from everyday concerns and distractions thus allowing for the deep reflection needed to gain his insights .
As a result , his name is now given to walks that have a deeply engrossing effect on the mind .
Who to walk with
Generally , solitary walking is preferable to an absentee partner on a cell phone , or to the hyper - vigilance necessary when walking with young children .
However , having a walking partner may provide benefits .
Choosing between solitary and social walking becomes easier once it is understood that social interaction can be intense or gentle and can have an inward or outward focus .
The first thing to note is that it is a rare walk that consumes no directed attention since basic navigation alone is demanding .
The concern here is how to keep the attentional demand from growing beyond basic information processing .
If the social interaction is riveting with a lively back - and - forth conversation , then it is likely that additional directed attention will be consumed through the process of ensuring a civil discourse ( e.g. , not interrupting , following streams of thought , keeping up your end of the conversation ) .
A more gentle conversation , perhaps one that is accepting of extended periods of silence , will make less additional demand on directed attention .
It may be that the latter situation is similar in attentional demand to a solitary walk where we carry on an internal dialog .
In contrast , if the social interaction is itself engaged in noticing nearby nature , then the conversation might help both individuals to dwell more deeply in the setting and thus gain additional restoration .
Again , the more tranquil the conversation , the less additional directed attention will be needed to ensure civility .
How to walk
Whether walking alone or with a partner , if we seek mental restoration , then we should direct our perception toward the surrounding natural features .
Having an environmental engagement plan may help keep our thoughts from taking up the work we would be advised to leave behind .
An environmental engagement plan is a strategy designed to influence how we engage in and interact with the physical environment ( Leff , 1984 ; Leff & Gordon , 1979 ; Leff , Thousand , Nevin , & Quiocho , 2002 ) .
They often draw on a variety of senses ( e.g. , listen for bird songs , sense weather changes , notice scents ) , involve making inferences ( e.g. , think how an edible landscape would alter the area ) , or employ whimsy ( e.g. , what three things would you change in the setting to ease the transition to sustainable living ) .
Such a plan can encourage greater engagement with nearby nature , enhancing the restorative effect of the walk even in a setting with only modest natural features .
The power of an engagement plan is based on the realization that the restorative potential of a setting results from the interaction of our mind with the physical attributes of that setting .
Meditation also has been suggested as an activity that may restore the capacity to direct attention ( Kaplan , 2001 ; Tang et al. , 2007 ) .
This makes the practice of walking meditation particularly useful for enhancing our coping ( see Kabat - Zinn , 2005 ) .
However , it raises for us the question of where to look while walking , inward on the body or outward on the environment , and if on the environment , then whether to be vigilant or just gently mindful .
Research exploring this issue is needed , but we can speculate that both approaches may work , albeit for different reasons .
If we allow the quiet fascination of nature to fill our mind , then the capacity to direct attention can rest and thus be restored .
It is likely that too vigilant a focus on the environment will be counter - productive as vigilance is another name for employing directed attention through visual scanning .
Gentle mindfulness might also enhance mental recovery but perhaps in an indirect and delayed fashion .
One goal of mindfulness - based modalities is the facilitation of self - awareness .
Socrates famously said that the unexamined life is not worth living .
This partly may be due to the fact that an unexamined life may be mentally fatiguing .
One can be burdened by distractions that are internal .
Having to function despite internal anguish and confusion ( e.g. , muddled set of priorities , nagging sense of helplessness or foreboding , uncertainty about next steps to take ) saps mental vitality .
Mindfully examining one ’s life will consume some directed attention , but for a worthy goal .
The self - awareness gained may help to reduce internal noise , reducing the frequency of future internal distractions and thus increasing the possibility of future mental effectiveness .
Finally , walking is unlikely to be restorative if we allow electronic gadgets to interrupt our restorative outing .
Neither should we imagine that we can multitask our restorative walk with a phone call or tweet .
When to walk
The capacity to direct attention is diminished continuously by everyday mental activity , which suggests the need for a restoration routine .
Furthermore , because we are terrible judges of when we need restoration , we should take regular restorative breaks ; since by the time we think we need a break , it is well past due .
Clearly , daily outdoor walking helps as does the ancient notion of following a weekly restorative ritual , particularly those that involve being away from our occupation .
But if we accept that year - round mental effectiveness matters , then we also must pursue outdoor revitalization year - round .
To the extent that we follow this prescription of getting a frequent dose of nature , we encounter difficulties in most parts of North America where signs of nearby nature diminish in winter .
While two small studies suggest that people do find winter walks restorative and can find signs of nature even in the dead of the season ( Metz , Boggs , King , & De Young , 2002 ; Pine , Thomas , & De Young , 2001 ) , this is clearly a difficult task .
This brings up an important subject : what quality and dose of nature is needed to restore directed attention .
More research is needed to answer this question but findings suggest that restoration may result from exposure to very limited amounts of nature .
Kuo has suggested that isolated pockets of nature may suffice ( Kuo , as cited in Clay , 2001 ) which might make possible the full restoration of directed attention in stark winter environments .
Nonetheless , it would be important to seek out the many veiled forms of winter nature and to appreciate its more ephemeral character , and for this the engagement plans mentioned earlier would help .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Whales and dolphins should get “ human rights ” to life and liberty because of mounting evidence of their intelligence , a group of conservationists and experts in philosophy , law and ethics said Sunday .

Japan , Norway and Iceland , the main whaling nations , oppose such arguments that would outlaw hunting or even keeping the mammals in marine parks .
They have long said there is no real evidence that they are smarter , for instance , than cows or pigs .
Participants at a University of Helsinki conference said ever more studies show the giant marine mammals have human - like self - awareness , an ability to communicate and organize complex societies , making them similar to some great apes .
“ We affirm that all cetaceans as persons have the right to life , liberty and wellbeing , ” they said in a declaration after a two - day meeting led by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( WDCS ) .
Thomas
White , director of the Center for Ethics and Business at Loyola Marymount University in California who was at the Helsinki talks , said dolphins can recognize themselves in a mirror , an ability rare in mammals that humans only acquire at about 18 months of age .
“ Whaling is ethically unacceptable , ” he told Reuters .
“ They have a sense of self that we used to think that only human beings have . ”
Hal Whitehead , a biology professor at Dalhousie University in Canada and an expert on deep - water whales , said there was more evidence that whales have human - like culture .
SPERM WHALES
He said that sperm whales have sonars to find fish that are so powerful that they could permanently deafen others nearby if used at full blast .
Yet the whales do not use sonars as weapons , showing what Whitehead called a human - like “ sense of morality . ”
“ It ’s like a group of human hunters armed with guns , ” he told Reuters .
“ There ’s a clear sense of how the sonar can be used . ”
Nations in the International Whaling Commission will debate a proposal to approve limited hunts for 10 years by the main whaling nations at a meeting next month , relaxing a 1986 moratorium imposed after many species came close to extinction .
“ We want a shift to putting the individual at the center of conservation , ” said Nicholas Entrup , of the WDCS .
That would mean giving minke whales , relatively plentiful and most often hunted , the same protection as endangered northern right whales .
But one expert biologist , who was not at the conference , said many researchers had wrongly concluded that whales and dolphins were smart because they have big brains .
“ There ’s nothing to separate them from other mammals -- seals , lions or tigers , ” Paul Manger of Johannesburg ’s University of Witwatersrand , told Reuters .
They had evolved big brains largely to keep warm in the chill waters .
Saying whales were not especially bright was not the same as advocating hunts , he said .
“ We protect fish stocks even though no one argues that they are intelligent , ” he said .
A month of the Hurd : DDE linux 26 , thread storms , patches , new live CD and IRC meetings .
Zheng
Da reported on the state of his ongoing work of porting DDE linux26 to the Hurd , which is meant to improve the GNU / Hurd hardware support .
The devices as emulated by QEMU and VMware already work fine , but he 's still seeking help for testing on real hardware .
Sergio López published patches as well as readily - usable packages to prevent thread storms in ext2fs when synchronizing large pagers .
This should improve system performance and stability .
Emilio Pozuelo Monfort and Sergio López developed further patches ( for example : exec , tmpfs ) to fix or improve the various internal Hurd servers , and discussed them with other Hurd developers .
Justus Winter created a live CD with an installation wizard in the spirit of the OpenBSD installer .
He needs testers to help improve it .
Ludovic Courtès informed that he has added support for cross-building packages from GNU / Linux to GNU / Hurd to the Nix package manager , as well as doing continuous cross-building of the GNU Hurd itself , and glibc .
The regular IRC meetings for Google Summer of Code students , their mentors , and any other interested parties are continuing on Mondays and Thursdays , 10:30 UTC , as Olaf Buddenhagen reported .
If you want to catch up , have a look at the #hurd channel logs .

Sorry the strip is a bit late today , work had tired me out and I was having a tough time writing .
I ’m still trying to figure out this uStream thing before I attempt to do a Live Drawing of the strip .
I ’m also still working on some t- shirt and print ideas as well as figuring out how I ’m going to run the store …
In other news , we ’re all completely doomed .
Scientists have , apparently , created a bionic goose .
I almost wrote a strip about it involving Fabio but I guess it was just too obscure .
Did you know that Fabio got hit in the face with a goose a number of years ago ?
He was on a rollercoaster , a fact which makes the already hilarious event infinitely more hilarious .
In spite of being completely ridiculous , Fabio seems like a nice guy .
I ’d have a beer with him .
Madlib & J. Rocc at the Red Bull Music Academy in Copenhagen , and meeting with Embryo – Christian Burchard , Roman Bunka , Uve Mullrich .
Photos below by Egon .
Egon :
“ We were late for our flight on Tuesday , putting us in Copenhagen a day before the gig .
Arriving fourteen hours later , J. Rocc and I went straight to an old theater for the Red Bull lecture , dropped by the hotel , then straight to the gig .
Luckily they supplied a nice selection of French wines – the Merseult , a village cuvee , was my favorite .
The show , as usual , was chaotic and fun .
I would guess that the ratio of men to women at the event was 10 to 1 .
But J and Madlib got ‘em going , per usual .
There was one moment where Madlib did some sort of extended monologue where he shouted out forthcoming records .
It got pretty ridiculous by the end : “ How many of y’all ready for the new Vanilla Ice album ? ” ( Weak applause . )
“ Ok – how many of y’all ready for the new Vanilla Ice album , produced by Madlib ? ” ( Crowd goes wild . )
By 2 am , at about forty eight hours with about two hours of sleep , I was starting to hallucinate and really could n’t wait to get to Munich to meet the Embryo folks .

An entire class of seemingly useless genetic components may actually regulate gene activity , suggests a study that – though preliminary – has potentially transformative implications for biology .
The findings involve apparently redundant copies of genes , called " pseudogenes , " and RNA molecules that would normally carry out genetic instructions , but appear to be disabled .
When it comes to altering the activity of PTEN , a cancer tumor - regulating gene , these components are neither redundant nor broken .
Instead they help turn PTEN on and off .
The same might happen for thousands of other genes .
If so , the findings have revealed an entire new class of operators in the programming language of life .
" This is a completely new way by which genes can be regulated .
It 's something that up to this point has been undiscovered , " said Leonardo Salmena , a Harvard Medical School geneticist and co-author of the study , published June 23 in Nature .
The implicit question is whether the process is unique to PTEN and its decoys , or applies to the human genome 's other 19,000 pseudogenes .
If so , the junk may actually be vitally important to development and disease .
" There 's a huge domain of non-coding RNAs .
Until now , we could n't make sense of them , " said study co-author Pier Paolo Pandolfi , also a Harvard Medical School geneticist .
" Now we have a way to understand them .
We 're not in the dark . "
Scientists have been aware of RNA since the 1960s , when they learned that genes code for what 's now known as messenger RNA , which carry instructions to protein - manufacturing cellular factories .
But the straightforward messenger model proved simplistic .
Other types of RNA , called microRNA and small interfering RNA , can bind to messenger RNA .
This prevents gene instructions from reaching their destinations , and allows for fine - tuned gene control .
Gene activity can be quickly shut off , and just as quickly allowed to proceed .
So - called RNA interference is now considered essential for coordinating the ultra - fast , ultra - complicated mixing - and - matching of proteins that takes place in every single cell , all the time .
In 2006 , the discoverers of RNA interference received a Nobel Prize .
Researchers anticipated an RNA revolution .
In the latest study , the researchers flipped the standard script of RNA interference .
Inspired by MIT geneticist Phil Sharp 's discovery that synthetic messenger RNA could be used to trap microRNA – interfering with the interferer , so to speak – they wondered if cells might not already do that .
Indeed , each human genome has many pseudogenes , or near - perfect copies of functional genes .
These pseudogenes produce RNA that does n't seem to do anything , but simply floats in cellular space .
Scientists have long assumed pseudogenes and their RNA to be so much cruft , the biological equivalent of leftover code that 's yet to be excised from a program .
But the researchers in this study , whose specialty is a tumor - suppressing gene called PTEN , noticed that RNA produced by PTEN 's pseudogenes was shaped exactly like the real thing .
They hypothesized that PTEN 's pseudogene RNA should work like a decoy , pulling in microRNA and small interfering RNA , allowing PTEN 's messenger RNA to proceed unobstructed .
Experiments showed that their guess was right .
To test their proposition , the researchers first amplified the expression of PTEN pseudogenes in laboratory cell cultures .
As predicted , this increased PTEN protein production :
The decoys did their job .
When the researchers decreased PTEN pseudogene expression , PTEN protein levels fell .
In mice , decreased PTEN expression often leads to cancer .
The researchers then studied expression levels of PTEN and its pseudogenes in samples of cancerous tissue , and found the patterns duplicated .
It was n't only PTEN that helped suppress tumors , but supposed junk .
In their absence , would - be interfering RNA was unleashed .
The researchers dubbed the decoys " competitive endogenous RNA , " or ceRNA .
They speculate that regular messenger RNA could also function as ceRNA , as could non-coding RNA that 's not produced by pseudogenes but has n't yet been functionally identified .
According to Pandolfi , if the findings truly represent a widespread new class of RNA , they will double the known number of functional genetic elements .
" This brings into play thousands of RNAs that we previously had no idea what they did , " said Salmena .
" We think we 've only hit the tip of the iceberg with this phenomena . "
In two accompanying Nature commentaries , Thomas Jefferson University geneticist Isidore Rigoutsos and University of California , San Diego geneticist Frank Furnari lauded the work 's immediate implications for cancer .
Furnari noted that altered PTEN gene expression patterns are seen in Cowden 's disease and Bannayan - Zonana syndrome , raising the possibility that ceRNA is involved in those rare diseases .
Rigoutsos agreed that the findings " could have broader implications beyond PTEN regulation . "
" They made a very exciting observation .
It raises the question of whether there 's another level of regulation of gene expression , " said Dinah Singer , a geneticist at the National Cancer Institute , which helped fund the research .
" Having made this observation , you can now look anywhere for it . "
Singer declined to speculate on whether the newly described mechanism might eventually account for the so - called missing heritability , a term used by scientists to describe genetic risk factors that clearly exist but can't be linked to standard gene mutations .
" To what extent this is going to be a general mechanism , the onus is now on the scientific community to begin looking in other systems , " said Singer .
" I presume they will . "

On May 2nd 2010 , I received an email in my inbox calling for “ solidarity ” and “ emergency donations ” to pay the bail of 11 self - identified anarchists in Asheville , North Carolina .
They were alleged to have smashed ATMs , bank windows and small shops in celebration of May 1 , International Workers ’ Day .
The price to bail out each of the 11 who were arrested ?
$ 5,000 .
As predictable as the paper - hawking of countless Communist factions at street demonstrations – anarchists locally and nationally got to work planning benefit events .
Arrestee benefits are something we are always able to pull together .
Yet our inability to create effective momentum , organization , and lasting impact , especially during economic and ecological crisis , is exacerbated by the fact that our “ movement ” allows anyone to identify as an anarchist , go on “ the attack , ” and turn months of potential movement - building efforts into benefit shows and talks about their actions .
I became an anarchist in the late 1990s .
Since then , I ’ve seen countless projects and groups fall apart due to lacking the resources and organization .
Rarely do groups continue moving forward in a productive way .
I started to ask myself how anarchists here in Chicago could use $ 55,000 to build and strengthen our movement .
The numbers I use are obviously not exact .
However , they point to the possibility of creating mass base movements instead of acting as an isolated political sect .
To strengthen our current movement , I would attempt to pay the rent of several existing anarchist and related projects for the year .
To strengthen formal organizations and social centers I would pay Biblioteca Popular $ 9,600 and Locked Out $ 12,000 ; the I.W.W and Lucy Parsons Worker ’s Center would get $ 4,300 .
That would leave $ 29,100 .
To strengthen community projects I would give Cop Watch $ 5,000 to buy new cameras , recorders , vests , and supplies for the communities that they organize in .
That would leave $ 24,100 .
I would use this money to address weaknesses in our movement , including our inability to effectively outreach and expand anarchist ideas outside of our circles .
I would buy one industrial CD - R / DVD read and write drive for $ 1,000 ; a printing press for $ 5,000 ; and a screenprinting press for $ 8,000 .
This leaves a remainder of $ 16,100 .
Opportunities that would exist outside of this budget would include buying land or buildings instead of renting .
We could afford to operate a worker - managed bus program to combat the Chicago Transit Authority ’s cuts and layoffs .
We could fund , for an entire year , direct action worker centers throughout the Midwest .
Most importantly , we could use the funds to build our capacity as organizers .
We would finally have a chance to break out of being isolated militants .
This is all hypothetical , but remember that there is still $ 16,100 left .
How would you use it to build models of anarchist resistance ?
Chicago has made international headlines as being the most violent city in the United States .
Not only are we the most violent , we also have 70,000 - 75,000 foreclosed homes in Metro Chicago .
We also have the highest rates of foreclosure amongst small apartment owners , with Englewood ranking first , followed by Austin , West Englewood and then New City .
Chicago ’s unemployment rate hit 11.6 % ( which does n’t include those who have given up looking for work ) .
For African - American youth , the unemployment rate is the same as the unemployment rate for the general populace during the Great Depression .
Do we even need to talk about the skyrocketing incarceration rate ?
It ’s increased from 1.8 million in 2000 to 2.3 million in 2008 .
Furthermore , the immigrant deportation rate has doubled over a ten year period and continues to increase .
As anarchists , members of our movement are the first to cry out to build barricades , occupy buildings or even pick up arms .
And yet , through labor organizing , I ’ve seen workers who live in fear of writing their name on a petition for a list of demands .
Clearly , we have a ways to go .
To believe that we can reach a system without bosses through isolated window - smashing and “ attacks ” against the state is foolish .
To believe that this system could defend itself against capitalists and fascists is absurd .
While street fights in Greece have been very inspirational , they mainly appeal to our American love of good action movies and prime - time TV .
But the insurrection is n’t the only part of their movement .
We should not overlook the massive successes of Greek anarchists with organizing immigrants ( particularly Afghani immigrants ) in labor and social struggles .
The common person works 20 to 50 hours a week and , with limited time , spreads the remainder between family , bill - paying and personal time .
Having the capacity to revolt against bosses , developers and landlords requires that we build our ability to organize and fight through continual work and dialogue with time - and money - stressed individuals .
Dialogue and continual work , whether formally or informally , has the capacity to build a culture of resistance .
But this method is only a revolutionary means , not an end .
Take the Republic Windows occupation .
During the struggle , Mexican - American workers stated that in Mexico , their union would occupy the factory when machinery was being moved .
Here in the U.S , when the equipment was being removed and production relocated , they stuck with methods that they knew would solve the problem .
This is important because it indicates that if you build a person ’s capacity to self - organize , even using militant methods , that individual can defend their coworkers or community members – even in a new situation .
We see from this example that it can not only happen across neighborhoods or industries , but also across borders .
We have to be critical of our movement and how it relates to the working class in which people of color face the most obvious blow from capitalists .
Anarchists who put on ninja jammies and go on the attack in the “ Berkeley ” liberal town of Asheville demonstrate how cut off they are from working - class people .
At a time when families are being evicted and lack work or healthcare , we have to ask :
Was it really advantageous for the alleged attack against small businesses in a liberal Southern city ?
Thousands of families are being evicted from their homes and our response was to break an ATM ?
VIVA !
Really ?
This is what we call a militant movement ?
What we lack is continuous organization and participation in social struggle .
This would allow us to analyze current political and economic conditions , learn from our mistakes , and build on past victories .
How does informality and disorganization limit our opportunities to grow ?
Many of us have been involved in some sort of grassroots activity as anarchists – from food programs to prisoner support ; from anti-police work to labor activity .
Yet we ’ve created no real “ pull ” or “ mass ” in society .
During the 1960s , all of these activities were necessary for the growth of the Black Panther Party .
But what we lack – and what they had — is a uniting theoretical message .
We must foster unity while working together to build a popular movement .
This unity must come with accountability to each other .
To counter the email that I received , I ’m putting a call out for “ solidarity ” with working class people and asking for “ emergency funds ” to build an anarchist movement .
This it to defend and aid those harmed most during this recession and by the state .
It ’s time to be serious about anarchism .
While I understand that one of the anarchists arrested in Asheville lived in Chicago for three years , and that many recognize him as a comrade , we have to be critical of our actions and theories .
We must strive to be reflective in our practice .
No matter how close those people are to us , their actions as individuals are not necessarily in our interests as a movement .
I hope that this article challenges anarchists to think about their approach ( or lack of it ) to movement - building , and to create productive ideas for new directions .
THOUSAND OAKS , Calif . --
A family spokesman says searchers
have contacted a 16 - year - old Southern California girl who was
feared lost at sea and she is alive and well .
William Bennett said late Thursday night that searchers aboard
an Airbus A330 spotted Abby Sunderland 's boat in an upright
position and made contact with her via radio .
Speaking outside the family 's Thousand Oaks home , Bennett said
Sunderland said she was inside the boat and doing fine with a space
heater and at least two weeks worth of food .
Bennett said the mast had broken off the disabled boat .
He said a fishing vessel was en route to pick her up .
The vessel
is expected to reach her in about 40 hours .
Sunderland had been attempting a solo sail around the world was feared in trouble Thursday thousands of miles from land in the frigid , heaving southern Indian Ocean after her emergency beacons began signaling and satellite phone communication was lost .
An international effort to rescue Sunderland began .
Qantas airlines said in a statement that an Airbus A330 tasked by the safety authority took off at 7:53 a.m. Friday Perth time .
The general election has created a hung parliament .
A hung parliament is one in which no party has an overall majority , which means no party has more than half of MPs in the House of Commons .
It means that whichever party ends up in power will not be able to win votes to pass laws without the support of members of other parties .
That support may come in the form of a formal coalition with smaller parties , or the governing party may have to negotiate with other parties to get laws passed .
In the simplest terms , to get an absolute majority , a party would have needed to win 326 seats .
In reality , an effective majority could be smaller because the speaker and his deputies , although members of parliament , do not usually vote .
Also , Sinn Fein have five MPs , who in the last parliament refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Queen and as a result were not entitled to vote .
Nonetheless , the election results mean that no party can pass laws without support from other parties .

Velvet worm 's deadly slime revealed
Scientists have discovered that the ancient velvet worm uses a glue unlike anything seen before in nature .
The glue , which is easy to replicate , could have a range of applications , such as a medical glue for open wounds and burns .
CSIRO Entomology scientist Dr Victoria Haritos , who uncovered the worm 's secret , says " it 's a case of using disorder as a weapon . "
Haritos who is looking for new types of silk , milked an Australian species of velvet worm called Euperipatoides rowelli .
She found the silk produced by the worm is n't silk at all - it 's the exact opposite .
Silk is made up of well ordered , structured proteins with the molecular shape determined by the sequence of amino acids in the proteins .
According to Haritos the sticky slime produced by the velvet worm is neither structured nor well ordered .
Getting slimed
The worm rapidly spits out slime from tubes on either side of its head .
This quickly covers it prey and immediately begins to set hard , going very stringy and rope - like .
" It gets harder and harder and very sticky , immobilising the victim , " says Haritos .
She says the key ingredient in the slime is water .
" In fact the slime consists of 90 % water and just 3 % to 5 % protein . "
" As long as the proteins are covered in a film of water , they remain inert , the watery sheaths keeping the structure open and random .
This prevents the protein molecules from interacting with one another .
" But once it hits the victim , this thin film of water quickly evaporates letting the proteins get tangled together to form tight chemical bonds and making them go sticky and hard . "
The evaporation process is helped by the prey 's waxy , water - repellent shell .
Ancient life
Velvet worms look like caterpillars , but are much more ancient , being among the first invertebrate animals to appear on Earth .
They first appeared about half a billion years to a time when most life was still confined to the oceans .
They 're found in rain forest pockets worldwide , but mostly in the southern hemisphere .
Haritos is now looking for a way to use the glue they produce commercially .
" It 's very strong , not super glue , but getting towards that level . "

Partners in Health , the Boston - based health charity , which runs two rural hospitals and a network of smaller clinics in Rwanda , said its own costs ran $ 28 per person per year in areas it serves .
It estimated that the government ’s no -frills care costs $ 10 to $ 20 .
According to a study recently published in Tropical Medicine & International Health , total health expenditures in Rwanda come to about $ 307 million a year , and about 53 percent of that comes from foreign donors , the largest of which is the United States .
One big donor is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , which is experimenting with ways to support whole health systems instead of just treating the three diseases in its name .
It pays the premiums for 800,000 Rwandans officially rated as “ poorest of the poor . ”
In a nation of poor farmers , who is officially poorest is decided by village councils .
They weigh assets like land , goats , bicycles and radios and determine whether a hut has a costly tin roof or just straw .
“ People know their neighbors here , ” said Felicien Rwagasore , a patient coordinator at the Mayange clinic .
“ They do not make mistakes . ”
Making every Rwandan pay something is part of President Kagame ’s ambitious plan to push his people toward more self - reliance and , with luck , eventually into prosperity .
The country has been called “ Africa ’s Singapore . ”
It has clean streets and little crime , and each month everyone does one day of community service , like planting trees .
Private enterprise is championed , and Mr. Kagame has been relentless about punishing corrupt officials .
In the name of suppressing remarks that might revive the hatreds that spawned the 1994 genocide , his critics say , he suppresses normal political dissent , too .
A more practical obstacle to creating a health insurance system , however , is that most of the world ’s poor , including Rwanda ’s , resist what they see as the unthinkable idea of paying in advance for something they may never get .
“ If people pay the $ 2 and then do n’t get sick all year , they sometimes want their money back , ” said Anja Fischer , an adviser to the Health Ministry from GTZ , the German government ’s semi-independent aid agency .
The Obama administration said Tuesday that it " firmly opposes " the legalization of any illicit drugs as California voters head to the polls to consider legalizing marijuana this fall .
The president and his drug czar re-emphasized their opposition to legalizing drugs in the first release of its National Drug Control Strategy this morning .
" Keeping drugs illegal reduces their availability and lessens willingness to use them , " the document , prepared by Drug Czar Gil Kerlikowske , says .
" That is why this Administration firmly opposes the legalization of marijuana or any other illicit drug . "
President Barack Obama has repeatedly expressed opposition to legalizing illicit drugs , though California voters could buck the federal government when it comes to legalize pot .
Voters in the state are set to take up a ballot initiative this fall that would legalize the drug under state law for recreational use .
The measure has being sold as a way to close the state 's massive budget gap , since the drug would be taxed and regulated for Californians over the age of 21 .
A SurveyUSA poll released late last month showed that 56 percent of Californians favor legalization , while 42 percent are opposed , and three percent are unsure .
( The poll , confuted April 20th , has a 4.4 percent margin of error . )
A Field Poll released April 30th showed similar margins of support .
Kerlikowske has refused to speculate on how the administration would respond if marijuana were legalized in the state , putting it in conflict with federal prohibitions on the drug .
Other parts of the administration 's drug control policy include emphasizing prevention and treating substance abuse as more of a healthcare issue than a criminal matter .
The plan also calls for more activities to disrupt the production and trafficking of illicit drugs .
The plan also sets some key , five - year goals , among them : reducing the rate of youth drug use by 15 percent , and reducing the rate of drug use among young adults by 10 percent .
" By boosting community - based prevention , expanding treatment , strengthening law enforcement , and working collaboratively with our global partners , we will reduce drug use and the great damage it causes in our communities , " Obama said in a statement announcing the release of the strategy .
" I am confident that when we take the steps outlined in this Strategy , we will make our country stronger and our people healthier and safer . ”
Stephen Fienberg , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University , described the programme as a " sham " .
By 2008 , around 160,000 people had been selected to be interviewed or given further pat downs based on the behaviour detection technique but less than one per cent of those were arrested .
Image caption Facial hair can cause psychological misery
Each morning Emma gets up early to shave her face before her partner wakes up .
She shaves every night before she goes to bed and carries a razor in her bag , just in case her stubble starts to show .
For 24 - year - old Emma , her unwanted facial hair on her chin , jaw and neck is a real problem .
Not only does she feel it unsightly , she also feels it is destroying her confidence and leaving her feeling unfeminine .
" I have had this problem since I was 19 , " she said .
" I feel there is a lot of hair .
It has lowered my self - esteem .
I do n't think very highly of myself and my confidence is shot to pieces Emma
" I thought it was something just old women got and I thought ' why would someone my age get it ?'
" It makes me feel like a man .
" I shave it , but it comes back more and grows coarser . "
Destroying confidence
Emma , from Derbyshire knows now that the reason for her excess facial hair is her polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) - she was diagnosed last year .
With PCOS , excessive body hair ( hirsutism ) may develop as a result of increased testosterone levels
But Emma says her unsightly problem is blighting her life .
" It has lowered my self - esteem , " she said .
" I do n't think very highly of myself and my confidence is shot to pieces .
" I do n't really go out because I know I need to have a razor in my bag .
If you go to a club and they search your bag how do you explain that you have a razor in it ? "
Getting help
Gloucestershire - based GP
Dr Dawn Harper is one of the experts leading a campaign called ' We Can Face it ' , which aims to raise awareness of the condition which affects around 40 % of women .
And she urged women like Emma to seek help and ask about treatment options , which range from laser treatments , creams and pills to shaving and plucking .
Image caption Emma shaves several times a day
" We are all guilty of underestimating the impact , myself included , " she said .
" We all realise the physical impact , but when we dig a bit deeper it is quite heart wrenching to hear the stories .
" There is a hidden cost in terms of the emotional cost to women of unwanted facial hair . "
' We can Face it ' surveyed 1,000 women with excess hair problems and found most were isolated , with more than half saying that they felt uncomfortable even talking to their family .
And the majority said they are not seeking professional help from their doctor , saying that they do no want to waste the GP 's time ; that they feel embarrassed or are concerned they will not be taken seriously .
Dr Alexandra Mizara , a counselling psychologist and specialist in psychodermatology at the Royal Free Hospital London , said the women were suffering " appalling psychological damage " .
Unwanted facial hair ( UFH ) Excess coarse hair in females affect about 40 % of women
It often has no known cause , but women from some Asian and Mediterranean ethnicities can be being particularly susceptible
Known causes include Polycystic Ovary Syndrome ( PCOS ) , hormonal changes during the menopause and some drug therapies
" There is a lot of impact on these women .
" They have low social confidence and this impacts on their work and social situations .
" They might also have social anxiety and negative views about themselves and how desirable and loveable they are .
" They do n't often speak about their problem and feel quite isolated .
" Whatever deviates from the norm is seen as abnormal and very different and therefore unacceptable . "
Charlotte Footman , electrologist advisor at St Mary 's Hospital London , said women like Emma were too often overlooked .
" Working so closely with patients who suffer the embarrassment and misery associated with excessive facial hair growth , I have long been frustrated that there is so little information , medical help or support for these women .
" So many women suffer loss of confidence and self - esteem and are left alone to cope with the physical and psychological effects of living with excess and unwanted facial hair growth .
' I needed help '
Emma said when she went for help she felt her GP was less than sympathetic .
" He made me feel like a bit of a freak , " she said .
She is so embarrassed about the problem that , apart from her GP , she has only ever confided in her boyfriend and mother .
She said she had felt totally alone .
" Nobody has ever offered me help . "
Clay Shirky and Daniel Pink have led eerily parallel lives .
Both grew up in Midwest university towns in the 1970s , where they spent their formative years watching television after school and at night .
Both later went to Yale ( a BA in painting for Shirky , a law degree for Pink ) .
And both eventually abandoned their chosen fields to write about technology , business , and society .
Now their paths are intersecting .
In December , Pink , a Wired contributing editor , came out with Drive : The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us .
The book digs through more than five decades of behavioral science to challenge the orthodoxy that carrots and sticks are the most effective ways to motivate workers in the 21st century .
Instead , he argues , the most enduring motivations are n't external but internal — things we do for our own satisfaction .
And in June , Shirky is publishing Cognitive Surplus : Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age , which mines adjacent territory .
He argues that the time Americans once spent watching television has been redirected toward activities that are less about consuming and more about engaging — from Flickr and Facebook to powerful forms of online political action .
( For an alternate perspective on the influence of the Internet , see Nicholas Carr 's essay )
And these efforts are n't fueled by external rewards but by intrinsic motivation — the joy of doing something for its own sake .

Wired had the two sit down for a conversation about motivation and media , social networking , sitcoms , and why the hell people spend their free time editing Wikipedia .
Pink :
A few days ago , I was talking with someone about Wikipedia .
And the guy shook his head dismissively and said about the people who contribute to it : " Where do they get the time ? "
We both think that 's a silly question .
Shirky :
It is .
People have had lots of free time for as long as there 's been the industrialized world .
But that free time has mainly been something to be used up rather than used , especially in postwar America , with the rise of suburbanization and long commutes .
Suddenly we no longer lived in tight - knit communities and therefore we spent less time interacting face - to - face .
As a result , we ended up spending the bulk of our free time watching television .
Pink :
The numbers on that are astonishing .
Shirky : Staggering .
Someone born in 1960 has watched something like 50,000 hours of television already .
Fifty thousand hours — more than five and a half solid years .
Pink :
You 've just described our boyhoods .
Shirky :
Yes , sitting in front of the television .
Pink : Passively watching Gilligan 's Island and The Partridge Family .
Shirky :
Oh , that walk down memory lane is painful .
Somehow , watching television became a part - time job for every citizen in the developed world .
But once we stop thinking of all that time as individual minutes to be whiled away and start thinking of it as a social asset that can be harnessed , it all looks very different .
The buildup of this free time among the world 's educated population — maybe a trillion hours per year — is a new resource .
It 's what I refer to as the cognitive surplus .
Pink : A surplus that post - TV media — blogs , wikis , and Twitter — can tap for other , often more valuable , uses .
Shirky :
That 's what 's happening .
Television was a solitary activity that crowded out other forms of social connection .
But the very nature of these new technologies fosters social connection — creating , contributing , sharing .
When someone buys a TV , the number of consumers goes up by one , but the number of producers stays the same .
When someone buys a computer or mobile phone , the number of consumers and producers both increase by one .
This lets ordinary citizens , who 've previously been locked out , pool their free time for activities they like and care about .
So instead of that free time seeping away in front of the television set , the cognitive surplus is going to be poured into everything from goofy enterprises like lolcats , where people stick captions on cat photos , to serious political activities like Ushahidi.com , where people report human rights abuses .
Pink :
Any sense of how much of that giant block of free time is being redirected ?
Shirky :
We 're still in the very early days .
So far , it 's largely young people who are exploring the alternatives , but already they are having a huge impact .
We can do a back - of - the - envelope calculation , for example , using Wikipedia , to see how far we still have to go .
All the articles , edits , and arguments about articles and edits represent around 100 million hours of human labor .
That 's a lot of time .
But remember : Americans watch about 200 billion hours of TV every year .
Pink : Amazing .
All the time that people devote to Wikipedia — which that guy considered weird and wasteful — is really a tiny portion of our worldwide cognitive surplus .
It 's less than one - tenth of 1 percent of the total .
Shirky :
And it represents a very different and very powerful type of motivation .
Pink : Exactly .
Too many people hold a very narrow view of what motivates us .
They believe that the only way to get us moving is with the jab of a stick or the promise of a carrot .
But if you look at over 50 years of research on motivation , or simply scrutinize your own behavior , it 's pretty clear human beings are more complicated than that .
Shirky :
That 's for sure .
Pink :
We have a biological drive .
We eat when we 're hungry , drink when we 're thirsty , have sex to satisfy our carnal urges .
We also have a second drive — we respond to rewards and punishments in our environment .
But what we 've forgotten — and what the science shows — is that we also have a third drive .
We do things because they 're interesting , because they 're engaging , because they 're the right things to do , because they contribute to the world .
The problem is that , especially in our organizations , we stop at that second drive .
We think the only reason people do productive things is to snag a carrot or avoid a stick .
But that 's just not true .
Our third drive — our intrinsic motivation — can be even more powerful .
Shirky :
That 's what 's behind people who are writing fan fiction or organizing ride - sharing online or using mobile phones to report on natural disasters or political upheaval .
They 're motivated by something other than money .
Pink :
But when the most powerful medium in the world was geared around consumption and passivity rather than creation and sharing , that kind of motivation often remained latent .
Shirky : Right — because television crowded out other forms of social engagement .
Look , behavior is motivation filtered through opportunity .
So if you see people behaving in new ways , like with Wikipedia and whatnot , it 's very unlikely that their motivations have changed , because human nature does n't change that quickly .
It 's quite likely that the opportunities have changed .
Pink :
Think about open source software in general — whether it 's Linux or Apache .
Suppose I 'd gone to an economist or management consultant 25 years ago and said , " I 've got a cool new business model for making software .
Here 's how it works :
A bunch of intrinsically motivated people around the world get together to do technically sophisticated stuff for no pay .
And then after working really hard , they give away their product for free .
Trust me :
It 's going to be huge . "
Shirky :
He would have thought you were insane .
When we lacked the ability to efficiently connect and collaborate with each other , that intrinsic motivation often did n't surface .
So we assumed that productive , public activities revolved around extrinsic motivation and external rewards .
And we assumed that all rewards were substitutable for all other rewards .
So I can pay you more or I can praise you or I can put a Lucite brick on your desk and it all works the same way .
Pink :
Which is nonsense .
Both of us cite research from University of Rochester psychologist Edward Deci showing that if you give people a contingent reward — as in " if you do this , then you 'll get that " — for something they find interesting , they can become less interested in the task .
When Deci took people who enjoyed solving complicated puzzles for fun and began paying them if they did the puzzles , they no longer wanted to play with those puzzles during their free time .
And the science is overwhelming that for creative , conceptual tasks , those if - then rewards rarely work and often do harm .
Shirky :
You talk about the laws of behavioral physics working differently in practice from what we believe in theory .
Pink :
Yes , often these outside motivators can give us less of what we want and more of what we do n't want .
Think about that study of Israeli day care centers , which we both write about .
When day care centers fined parents for being late to pick up their kids , the result was that more parents ended up coming late .
People no longer felt a social obligation to behave well .
Shirky :
If you assume bad faith from the average participant , you 'll probably get it .
In social media , the design principle that has worked remarkably well is to treat good faith as the normal case and to regard defections from that as essentially a special case to be solved .
Pink : Same goes with organizations .
We do n't realize how much our unexamined assumptions take us to radically different places .
If I 'm running an organization and my starting premise about human beings is that people are fundamentally passive and inert , that they wo n't do a damn thing unless I threaten them with a stick or entice them with a carrot , that takes me down one road .
But I think that 's the wrong premise , the wrong theory of human nature .
Shirky :
The power of the default setting .
Pink : I think our nature is to be active and engaged .
I 've never seen a 2 - year - old or a 4 - year - old who 's not active and engaged .
That 's how we are out of the box .
And if you begin with this presumption , you create much more open , flexible arrangements that almost inevitably lead to greater satisfaction for individuals and great innovation for organizations .
Shirky : I agree .
Pink :
You say something else about organizations that I found especially compelling — about their instinct for self - perpetuation .
Shirky :
Well , organizations that are founded to solve problems end up committed to the preservation of the problems .
So Trentway - Wagar , an Ontario - based bus company , sues PickupPal , an online ride - sharing service , because T - W is n't committed to solving transportation problems .
It 's committed to solving transportation problems with buses .
In the media world , Britannica is now committed to making reference works that can't easily be referred to , and the music industry is now distributing music that can't easily be shared because new ways of distributing music undermine the old business model .
Pink : Let 's go back to the cognitive surplus for a moment .
What are the stakes for businesses , and what , if anything , can they do about it ?
Shirky : Businesses need to recognize that this is n't going away , that there 's a tremendous resource — the cognitive surplus of millions — being coordinated using networks .
One of the things that my book is trying to do , and your book as well , is to show that there are forces at work that we often do n't see and that if organizations can tap into these forces , those organizations can actually benefit .
Pink :
You have n't had television since you were 17 .
How have you deployed your own cognitive surplus ?
Shirky : I read .
Back in the 1990s , when I was a kid with a bachelor 's degree in painting and a career in theater , I came across the Internet , which blew my mind on contact .
I had 100 hours a month to surf through engineering documents , histories of the Internet , Perl manuals , mailing lists , and so on .
By substituting my browser for 3rd Rock From the Sun , I was able to figure out the stuff I 've made my living on since .
Pink :
One final question , which I have to ask :
What 's your favorite Gilligan 's Island episode ?
Shirky :
The one where they nearly get off the island and then Gilligan messes up and they do n't .
Pink : [ Laughs ]
Mine too !
Panama ’s ex-dictator Manuel Noriega on Tuesday dismissed charges of laundering drug money as an “ imaginary banking scheme ” concocted by the United States as he took the stand in a French court .
The 76 - year - old general denied taking payments from Colombian drug lords in the 1980s and told a Paris courtroom that cash deposits transferred to French banks came from his legitimate businesses and the CIA .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I say with much humility and respect that this is an imaginary banking scheme , ” Noriega told the court in Spanish through his interpreter on the second day of his trial .
“ I will have the opportunity to produce documents that show that I was a victim of a conspiracy mounted by the United States against me , ” he said .
Noriega , who ruled Panama from 1983 to 1989 , spent 20 years in a Miami cell for drug trafficking and money laundering and now faces the prospect of another decade in a French prison if convicted .
His lawyers argue that the charges against Noriega , who was extradited to France two months ago , hinge on dodgy testimony from ex-drug traffickers who were paid and given protection by US authorities .
Once a close US ally , Noriega testified that Washington turned against him in the 1980s when he refused to allow Panama to become a staging ground for operations against leftists across Central America .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ That ’s when the propaganda started against me after so many years of cooperation with the United States , ” he told the court as his three daughters sat nearby , listening attentively .
Presenting himself as a “ professional soldier , ” the ex-leader strongly denied dealings with Colombian drug cartels and said that on the contrary , he had fought narco - traffickers while in power in Panama in the 1980s .
“ I energetically fought against the drug trade and for this I received praise from the United States , Interpol and many other countries , ” he said , wearing a dark suit and white shirt .
ADVERTISEMENT
Waving his hands at times to underscore his arguments , Noriega recounted that he had ordered a raid against a cocaine laboratory and waged other drug - fighting campaigns .
“ Based on these actions , I could not be friends with these gangs , ” he said , referring to the Colombian drug cartels .
ADVERTISEMENT
The pock - marked general known as “ Pineapple Face ” was arrested by US troops that invaded Panama in December on a mission to arrest him and bring him to trial in the United States .
The ex-leader was extradited to France on April 26 to answer charges of laundering the equivalent of 2.3 million euros ( 2.8 million dollars ) from the Medellin cartel through French banks in the late 1980s .
A French court in 1999 sentenced Noriega in absentia to 10 years in prison and a fine of some 13.5 million euros , but for years he fought extradition from his prison cell in Miami .
ADVERTISEMENT
French prosecutors say that drug money funnelled in the late 1980s was used by Noriega ’s wife and a shell company to buy three luxury apartments in Paris .
Much of the hearing on Tuesday was devoted to questions about Noriega ’s bank accounts and his ties to the now - defunct BCCI bank , that allegedly handled his financial affairs .
Asked about the source of millions in cash deposits at the bank , Noriega explained that the funds came from successful business ventures including duty - free sales at Panama airport and life insurance policies .
After some three hours of testimony , Noriega ’s lawyer Olivier Metzner asked him point blank if the funds in French bank accounts were drug money .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ These funds were acquired in a transparent way .
They come from my personal earnings , ” he said .
“ And from the CIA ? ” added Metzner , to which Noriega responded by nodding .
The one - time strongman who was a key asset for the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1980s fell out with Washington after turning his strategically important Central American country into a hub for narco - trafficking .
Convicted in the United States on charges of drug - trafficking and money - laundering , Noriega was sentenced to 40 years in prison in a Florida court .
His time was reduced to 17 years for good behaviour .
The trial wraps up on Wednesday and a verdict could come as early as next month .
It ’s tough to imagine the end of the world from Steve Kramer ’s peaceful hilltop home in San Pedro , with its views of lush palm trees and red - tile roofs above a turquoise sea .
The 55 - year - old respiratory therapist does it anyway .
Terror attacks , civil unrest , dirty bombs , earthquakes , 2012 — Kramer believes he must be ready to face them all .
That ’s why he ’s plunked down $ 12,500 to reserve spots for himself and his family in an underground concrete shelter near Barstow .
“ I would hate to give all this up and live in a bunker , ” said Kramer , glancing at sailboats out on the Pacific with his feet roosted on a glass coffee table .
“ I ’m not trying to perpetuate doom and gloom , but you have to be prepared . ”
Legions of Americans dug backyard fallout shelters to ride out atomic Armageddon during the Cold War .
Now , with heightened concerns about terrorist attacks in the post - 9/11 world , a new generation is looking underground .
“ In some ways , our political climate is similar , ” said Jeffrey Knopf , associate professor of national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , Calif .
“ There ’s a lot of free - floating anxiety out there about the dangers that terrorists will get nuclear weapons … and it multiplies . ”
Cue the entrepreneurs .
Come - ons for doomsday products , from survival classes to earthquake kits , abound on the Internet .
Demand is fueled by natural disasters , terrorist activity and websites dedicated to exploring such topics as what will happen Dec. 21 , 2012 , the last day of the ancient Maya calendar and the date that , some people believe , the world will end .
Larry
Hall is recruiting rich clients for what he calls an underground survival condo — in Kansas .
He envisions a building that goes 15 floors beneath the ground , with units selling for $ 1.75 million .
“ After the earthquakes and volcanic explosions , they ’re calling up , saying everything they said was going to start happening is happening , ” said Hall , an engineer who lives in Florida .
“ It ’s making people nervous . ”
Michael Wagner is peddling a personal “ survival pod ” for people to take refuge from tidal waves .
The Oregon man says he ’s been getting a lot more nibbles since the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile .
And in the desert near Barstow , Robert Vicino is selling berths in the 13,000 - square - foot bunker where Kramer plans to hunker down , should it come to that .
Vicino ’s company Vivos , based in Del Mar , charges $ 5,000 to reserve a space .
Kids are half price .
Pets are free .
“ I ’m careful not to promote fear , ” said Vicino , who also sells more conventional real estate and stands 6 feet , 8 inches tall .
“ But sooner or later , I believe you ’re going to need to seek shelter . ”
Property records show the site is owned by TSG Investments of Portland , Ore. , which bought it from AT&T .
Vicino said Vivos has an arrangement with the owner to develop and sell space in the property , which was originally built as an emergency government communications center during the Cold War .
When renovations are complete , Vicino said , the bunker will house 132 people in comfort for up to a year .
The plan is to sell spaces , which include a bunk in a four - person room , for $ 50,000 .
He says he ’s collected deposits on half the spaces but has not raised enough to start renovating .
Experts caution that buying any kind of undeveloped real estate carries risk .
If the builder goes belly - up , buyers could have trouble getting back their investment .
That ’s especially true for unfinished bunker space where there are few “ comps ” — sale prices for similar properties in the area — to help assess the value .
“ I definitely tell consumers — unless it ’s built , I would n’t be putting any money down , ” said Lisa Ann Schreier , founder of Timeshare Insights , a Florida - based advocacy group .
“ Contracts are made to be broken , and there are so many unscrupulous people out there when it comes to taking people ’s hard - earned money . ”
Vicino , who used to sell fractional real estate — better known as timeshares — insists there is little risk .
He says that the down payments are held in an escrow account for safekeeping until the project is finished , and that clients can take their money out at any time .
The 56 - year - old salesman agreed to take a reporter to the site on the condition that the location would not be revealed ; if the End Times come , he says , he does n’t want freeloaders clamoring to gain entry .
He arranged for a meeting at a sleepy gas station off the highway , then led the way down a crumbling concrete road and through a fence to an unassuming structure framed by dry rolling hills .
Most of the facility is out of sight .
Vicino clambered down two flights of reinforced concrete stairs and heaved open a 3,000 - pound door — revealing a large open area with walls painted an anemic blue .
An old - fashioned pencil sharpener was still attached to the wall under fluorescent lights , near a sign reminding people that “ Safety begins with me . ”
But there was no sign of the comfy chairs and well - appointed living areas featured in the company ’s promotional material .
Vicino described how the area would eventually be divided into dozens of bedrooms , complemented by an atrium , a workout center and even a jail .
He said the bunker would be equipped with air filtration systems and was already protected from electromagnetic pulses , which , he says , could destroy all electrical equipment .
Sample menus describe a typical bunker meal .
One features sloppy joes , broccoli cheese soup and something called “ potato pearls . ”
“ This will be the most comfortable nuclear - blast - proof shelter on the planet , ” he said .
Vicino started his career in advertising , gaining some notoriety by mounting a giant inflatable King Kong on the Empire State Building in 1983 as a promotional stunt .
The license plate on his white SUV reads “ ROYLTYS , ” a nod to the chunk of money he ’s made on ad products and toys he has developed .
Vivos , his company , says it plans to build several bunkers around the country .
A red digital clock on its website counts down the hours , minutes and seconds until Dec. 21 , 2012 ( only 948 days left ! ) .
It also details real and theoretical threats facing the planet , including nuclear wars , solar flares , pole shifts , global tsunamis , killer comets and super volcanoes .
In a down economy , spending money on a bunker berth may seem an extravagance .
But Debby Leite of San Diego thinks it ’s prudent , and she ’s scraped together $ 7,500 for a spot in the bunker for herself and her 6 - year - old daughter .
“ If you look at Noah ’s ark , everybody thought he was crazy , and then the floods came , ” she said .
“ At least this way I know I ’ll be taken care of . ”
Of course , fallout shelters were never a bargain .
The typical cost of building a backyard bunker in the early 1960s , at $ 2,500 , was half the annual income for most families at the time , says Kenneth Rose , author of “ One Nation Underground : The Fallout Shelter in American Culture . ”
Then , as now , the cost put post - apocalyptic digs out of reach for most Americans , which Rose deems a good thing .
Fallout - shelter culture “ creates a society of fear , a society obsessed with its own survival , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think that ’s any way to live a life . ”
Indeed , many believe , to borrow from Sartre , that hell is other people — especially when you ’re stuck with them underground in a concrete bunker with no escape .
Some , including Steve Kramer ’s father , would rather sit on their porches with a cold drink and watch the end come .
Steve Kramer has other plans .
He can foresee days of anarchy and desperation , when roving bands of have - nots assault the homes of the haves .
His hilltop abode , with its stately columns , might be a target .
“ We ’re not crazy people , but these are fearful times , ” Kramer said .
He ’s plotting out routes to the bunker on a topographic map , stocking up on dried food and teaching his 12 - year - old son to ride a dirt bike in case they have to travel off - road to get there .
Kramer thinks others will start to feel the same way as 2012 approaches .
And if he has the money to ensure that his family will be safe when something happens , Kramer said , why not use it ?
“ It ’s a matter of priority , ” he said .
“ My family wants to survive . ”

THE party to end all parties has ended a fizzer .
Despite 72,000 RSVPs only a handful of bored teens turned up .
Unveiled as a hoax , " Kate 's Birthday Party " was concocted by Adelaide internet prankster David Thorne , who has come under fire for risking the arrival of a riot - sized crowd in a quiet Adelaide street .
But the small group of teens and the three police officers who turned up failed to create the feared melee .
The officers were on standby at North St , Adelaide , from about 9 pm , but left an hour later when the street became deserted .
Mr Thornecreated the hoax event last weekend on Facebook but it was later taken down .
However the demise of the original event has only spurred on its fans , who have created more than 500 extra pages in the spirit of " Kate 's Party " .
They included : " Is going to try to get with Kate at Kate 's Party " , " We met at Kate 's Party " , " Kate 's party would have gone off " and " Where did all these Kate 's party groups come from ! ? "
One teenager claimed he had created one of the Facebook groups and that he and his friends were hoping for a big attendance .
" We 're just seeing how many people will come , " he said .
The group left a few minutes before the police .

La Granja De San Ildefonso
La Granja de San lldefonso is a Baroque style palace often referred to as the “ Versailles of Spain ” .
It was built during the 18th century as a summer retreat for King Phillip V. King Phillip was actually French , the first Bourbon king of Spain , who had been born at the original Versailles in France , spending most of his childhood days there .
Phillip V only began learning Spanish when he took the throne at age seventeen , in 1700 .
Source
The land in which La Granja de San Ildefonso is built had been a hunting lodge erected by Henry IV of Castile during the 15th century , along with a small shrine dedicated to San Ildefonso .
Henry IV later gave the site to the church , and a monastery dedicated to San Jeronimos was built on it .
The site was purchased from the monks in 1719 by Philip V , after his summer palace nearby at Valsain burned to a shell .
The name La Granja comes from the word “ farm ” because of the self - sufficient monks that used to farm on the site .
A church is still present on the grounds , even though as it stands a grand Baroque edifice obviously built for royalty .
The mausoleum contains the tombs of Phillip V and his second wife , Queen Isabella .

The gardens of La Granja de San Ildefonso are a spectacular array of woodlands , formal landscaped gardens with elegant fountains , statues , and a large ornamental lake that lies secluded at the highest point of the park .
Amazingly , the pipes in the fountains are still fully functional , however only a few fountains operate on a daily basis .
Only on holidays such as San Fernando and San Luis , do all twenty - six fountains operate .

Like a painting of perfection , La Granja sits against the backdrop of the stunning Guadarrama Mountains .
The interior design is an array of Baroque style antiques chosen by an army of the finest artisans .
The furnishings are flawless along with the décor that includes crystal chandeliers , tapestries , frescoes , Italian Carrara marble , and Japanese lacquer work .
The grounds and architecture may have been perfect , but they hardly thrilled Phillip V for more than a few minutes .
He was quoted as saying “ The Baths of Diana fountain has cost me three millions and amused me for three minutes ” .
In 1918 , La Granja was severely burned .
Fortunately , the local glass factory appropriately named “ La Granja ” , supplied replacement fittings including some replica chandelier pieces to restore what had been damaged .
La Granja glass works still produces Spain ’s most exquisite glasswork .
Today , La Granja de San Ildefonso serves as one of the region ’s most popular tourist destinations .
Although nowhere near the splendor of Versailles in France , La Granja is not without its charms .
In the month since the second beta the KDE community has fixed hundreds of bugs .
Development of features has been frozen for a while now and the Software Compilation is at the point where it needs a good testing to shake out the last issues .
So if you can spare some time and can help us identify problems or ( in ) validate other bug reports we'd be more than happy .
Moreover , if you want to check out what 's coming in terms of features and improvements to our workspaces , applications and development platform , this RC is a good choice for a test run .

Patients with LLS have a different cognitive profile than patients with AD or DEP .
Particularly , memory impairment in LLS seems to be more pronounced in learning than recall .
These findings suggest that cognitive and psychosocial interventions designed to compensate for learning deficits may be beneficial in LLS .
The four groups did not differ in demographic data except that patients with AD were about 12 years older than those with LLS .
However , they differed on cognitive tests even after controlling for age .
Patients with LLS were impaired on most cognitive tests in comparison with patients with NC but not on recalling newly learned verbal information at a short delay .
They experienced equivalent performance on learning new verbal information in comparison with patients with AD , but better performance on all other tests of memory , including the ability to recall newly learned verbal information .
Finally , they were more impaired than patients with DEP in overall memory .
Demographic , clinical , and cognitive data of all patients referred to the memory clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health between April 1 , 2006 and August 15 , 2008 were reviewed .
We then identified four groups of older patients with : ( 1 ) late - life schizophrenia ( LLS ) and no dementia or depression ( DEP ) ; ( 2 ) Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ; ( 3 ) DEP and no dementia or LLS ; ( 4 ) normal cognition ( NC ) and no DEP or LLS .
Cognitive deficits are common in patients with schizophrenia or depression ( DEP ) including in late life [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] .
In patients with schizophrenia , specific deficits , such as memory impairment , are reliable predictors of function [ 3 ] , and are considered critical targets for the development of novel pharmacological or psychosocial therapies [ 4 ] .
Thus , the identification of the cognitive deficits that are specific to late - life schizophrenia ( LLS ) in contrast to late - life DEP or other neuropsychiatric disorders ( e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ) is critical to facilitate diagnosis and support the development of specific treatment interventions ( “ personalized treatment ” ) .
For example , an effective cognitive intervention can be tailored to a specific cognitive function that is more impaired in LLS than in DEP .
A similar selective approach could be applied to combinations of disorders ( e.g. , LLS and DEP or LLS and AD ) .
To our knowledge , only a few published studies compared patients with LLS to those with AD [ 2 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , and none to those with DEP .
Furthermore , and except for Heaton et al [ 2 ] , these studies reported on a global cognitive test ( e.g. , Mini- Mental State Examination or Dementia Rating Scale total score ) or a brief cognitive battery ( e.g. , 3 tests from the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer 's Disease ) which limited their ability to distinguish specific cognitive deficits in different cognitive domains .
Thus , we took advantage of the comprehensive cognitive assessment that is administered to patients referred to hospital - based memory clinic and we compared the cognitive profiles of patients with LLS to those of patients with AD , DEP , or “ normal cognition ” ( NC ) .
After completing the clinical and cognitive assessments , a consultation report was generated for each referred patient .
The report included a neuropsychiatric diagnostic formulation that was based on the application of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition , Text Revision criteria to the data obtained during these assessments .
We used this diagnostic formulation to identify ( 1 ) a group of patients with LLS and without a diagnosis of dementia ; from the rest of the patients , we created three comparison groups : ( 2 ) a group of patients with AD and without another mental disorder ; ( 3 ) a group of patients with DEP and no dementia ; and ( 4 ) a group of patients without a neuropsychiatric disorder and with NC .
The latter group ( NC ) consisted of individuals who were referred to the clinic for memory concerns or complaints and who were ascertained to be cognitively intact based on their clinical and cognitive assessments .
First , we characterized descripitively the four groups of patients .
Then , we compared the demographic , clinical , and cognitive characteristics of the four groups using one - way analyses of variance ( ANOVA ) .
When differences were found , we used post - hoc comparisons with Bonferroni 's corrections to correct for multiple comparisons .
Cohen 's effect sizes ( d's ) were calculated for differences between LLS and the other three groups on all cognitive tests .
Data analyses were conducted using SPSS 15.0 for Windows .
Charts were reviewed and data abstracted by two investigators ( C.T. , and T.K.R. ) using a standardized form .
The following tests were recorded and analyzed : age , sex , education , neuropsychiatric diagnoses , residential type , and cognitive data .
The cognitive battery used at the memory clinic includes the following tests : Animal Fluency [ 9 ] , Boston Naming Test [ 10 ] , Clock drawing test – Freedman scale ( Clock ) [ 11 ] , California Verbal Learning Test II - Short Form ( CVLT ) [ 12 ] , Dementia Rating Scale - 2 ( DRS ) [ 13 ] , FAS Letter Fluency ( FAS ) [ 9 ] , Luria Alternating Diagrams [ 14 ] , Mini-Mental Status Examination ( MMSE ) [ 15 ] , Trail Making Test A and B ( TMA , TMB ) [ 16 ] , and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test – 64 ( WCST ) [ 17 ] .
Following McBride et al [ 7 ] , we calculated two CVLT Saving Scores : one for Short Delay Free Recall and another for Long Delay Free Recall .
We generated these scores by dividing the number of correct responses at Short Delay Free Recall ( or Long Delay Free Recall ) by the number of correct responses at the last trial of acquisition of CVLT , and multiplying the answer by 100 .
The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health ( CAMH ) in Toronto , Canada is a unique and large academic specialty hospital that provides psychiatric care ( including care to patients with dementia ) to an urban catchment area and serves as a referral center for a large suburban and rural population .
This analysis was based on a review of the health records of all patients referred for a consultation to the memory clinic at CAMH between April 1 , 2006 and August 15 , 2008 .
These patients had undergone a comprehensive assessment including a neurological evaluation ( by D.F.T - W. ) , a psychiatric examination ( by Z.I. ) , and cognitive testing ( by N.A. ) .
Diagnoses were ascertained using a consensus process that was mainly guided by the neurological and psychiatric assessments .
However , patients with schizophrenia had this diagnosis established by the referring source and then confirmed by the psychiatrist ( Z.I. ) at the memory clinic .
Since this study was based on the review of health records of patients who were already assessed at the memory clinic , no informed consent from the patients was obtained and the data were analyzed anonymously .
The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Research Ethics Board waived the need for consent and approved the study .
We also performed the same analyses excluding subjects above the age of 50 ( 2 subjects with LLS and 1 subject with NC ) .
The only significant change is that the difference between patients with LLS and those with DEP on FAS became significant ( p = 0.042 ) .
Cohen 's effect sizes have been calculated and plotted for the different cognitive tests comparing performances of patients with AD , DEP , or NC to those with LLS ( who constitute the reference group ) .
Positive effect sizes indicate that patients with AD , DEP , or NC perform numerically better than patients with LLS .
Negative effect sizes indicate that the opposite .
* indicates that the difference is statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) after correcting for multiple comparisons .
** indicates that the difference is statistically significant ( p<0.01 ) after correcting for multiple comparisons .
*** indicates that the difference is statistically significant ( p<0.001 ) after correcting for multiple comparisons .
AD : Alzheimer 's disease ; Clock : Clock drawing test – Freedman scale ; CVLT : California Verbal Learning Test II - Short Form ; DEP : depressive disorder ; DRS : Dementia Rating Scale - 2 ; FAS : FAS Letter Fluency ; MMSE : LLS : late - life schizophrenia ; Mini-Mental Status Examination ; NC : normal cognition ; TMA and TMB : Trail Making Test A and B , respectively ; WCST : Wisconsin Card Sorting Test – 64 .
The cognitive characteristics of the four groups are presented in Table S1 and Figure 1 .
After Bonferroni's correction , the patients with LLS performed significantly better than those with AD on DRS Memory , CLOCK , CVLT Short Delay Free Recall Saving Score and Long Delay Free Recall Saving Score , and Luria Alternating Diagrams ; performed significantly worse than those with DEP on DRS Memory , Animal Fluency , CVLT Short Delay Free Recall , and Long Delay Free Recall , and WCST Categories ; and worse than those with NC on MMSE , DRS Total and Memory , Animal Fluency , Boston Naming Test , CVLT 1 - 4 , Short Delay Free Recall , Long Delay Free Recall and Long Delay Free Recall Saving Score , FAS , Luria Alternating Diagrams , TMA Time , and WCST Categories .
The subjects ' characteristics data are summarized in Table S1 .
Patients with LLS were not different from the other groups with respect to sex distribution , education , race , community living status , or number of active medical problems .
However , on average , they were 12 years younger than those with AD .
One hundred twenty four individual patients were assessed at the memory clinic during the study period .
Five patients were excluded due to language barriers preventing the completion of significant portions of the comprehensive assessment .
Of the remaining 119 patients , 52 patients were excluded for the following diagnoses : cognitive disorder not - otherwise specified : N = 10 ; alcohol - related disorder : N = 5 ; schizophrenia and dementia N = 5 ; bipolar disorder : N = 4 ; depression and dementia : N = 4 ; frontal lobe degeneration / syndrome or semantic dementia : N = 4 ; mental retardation : N = 4 ; dementia with Lewy bodies : N = 3 ; corticobasal degeneration syndrome : N = 2 ; dementia not - otherwise specified : N = 2 ; dementia with multiple etiologies : N = 2 ; mild cognitive impairment with parkinsonism : N = 2 ; ; Alzheimer 's disease with primary progressive aphasia : N = 1 ; asymmetrical cortical degeneration : N = 1 ; depression and dementia with Lewy bodies : N = 1 ; depression and possible neurodegenerative disorder : N = 1 ; . vascular dementia : N = 1 .
The remaining 67 patients were classified among the groups of interest as follows : ( 1 ) LLS without dementia : N = 25 ; ( 2 ) AD : N = 15 ; ( 3 ) DEP : N = 15 ; ( 4 ) NC : N = 12 .
Discussion
Using a comprehensive cognitive assessment , we compared the cognitive profiles of patients seen at a hospital - based memory clinic with LLS , AD , DEP , or NC .
Three main findings emerge from this analysis : ( 1 ) patients with LLS were impaired on most cognitive tests in comparison with patients with normal cognition ( NC ) ; ( 2 ) patients with LLS experienced impairment on learning new verbal information that was equivalent to that experienced by patients with AD , but a significantly smaller impairment in their ability to retrieve this newly learned verbal information ; ( 3 ) patients with LLS were more impaired than patients with DEP on all tests of memory except the ability to retrieve newly learned verbal information .
These findings need to be considered in the context of the strengths and the limitations of this study .
First , because this memory clinic is based in a large psychiatric hospital , more than half of the patients had primary psychiatric diagnoses ( e.g. , alcohol - related disorder , LLS , Bipolar disorder , DEP ) usually not represented in a community - based memory clinic .
Due to this heterogeneity in diagnosis , some patients had to be excluded from the analysis and the four groups that were included were small .
This reduced the power to detect statistically significant differences on specific tests , especially those of executive function ( e.g. , DRS Initiation / Perseveration subscales , and WCST ) .
Still , large and highly significant differences on most tests were detected between patients with LLS and those without a psychiatric diagnosis who were referred by their primary care physicians due to memory or cognitive complaints and found to have normal cognition .
Second , the deficits identified in these patients with LLS who were referred to the clinic because of “ memory complaints ” may not generalize to the larger population of older persons with LLS .
This applies in particular to the differences in the domain of memory .
Nevertheless , such a bias towards memory impairment should not have affected the differences observed between the four studied groups since all the patients seen in the clinic were referred because of “ memory complaints . ”
Third , patients with AD were about 12 years older than patients with LLS .
Thus , age may have contributed to the more severe memory impairment seen in patients with AD .
However , our findings in memory did not change significantly when we limited our analysis to patients age 50 or above .
Further , a lesser memory impairment in LLS compared to AD has also been reported in age - matched patients [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] .
Also , such a confound would not explain the equivalent impairments in learning new verbal information but smaller impairment in LLS compared to AD in the ability to retrieve newly learned information .
Finally , more than 80 % of our patients with LLS were community - dwellers and the current literature on such patients suggests cognitive stability rather than decline with age [ 18 ] .
Notwithstanding the above limitations , our findings confirm and extend our current understanding of cognition in LLS .
The ranking of the groups in terms of overall memory impairment ( AD < LLS < DEP ) and the large effect sizes observed when patients with LLS were compared with those with DEP and AD has significant therapeutic and functional implications : interventions to enhance cognition in LLS should have a special focus on memory .
Furthermore , memory correlates significantly with everyday function such as hygiene , safety , cooking , and community utilization in the geriatric population [ 19 ] .
This suggests that interventions enhancing memory could have a significant functional impact , but that the impact may be different in patients with different neuropsychiatric disorders .
In contrast to comparable deficits in learning new verbal information ( CVLT 1 - 4 ) , patients with LLS experienced significantly smaller deficits than those with AD in retrieving the newly learned information ( CVLT Short and Long Delay Free Recall Saving Scores ) .
In fact , they experienced comparable performance to those with NC in recalling newly learned verbal information at a short delay .
These findings in LLS are consistent with previous reports among mid to late life patients with schizophrenia , suggesting that the memory impairment associated with LLS is secondary to poor registration or organization of new information and not impaired retrieval of learned information as in AD [ 2 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] .
This is relevant to the understanding of the cognitive pathology in LLS compared to AD , and to the design of cognitive interventions .
Facilitating the encoding of new information is likely to have a more meaningful and clinically significant impact in LLS than in AD ( because the chance of retrieving encoded information is higher in LLS than AD ) .
Other than memory , patients with LLS performed better than patients with AD on the CLOCK , a test of visuospatial ability ( amongst other abilities ) .
Thus , like recall , visuospatial ability appears to be another cognitive function that can be used in differentiating cognitively impaired patients with LLS from those with AD .
Furthermore , visuospatial ability has also been associated with function and has been reported to decline in a longitudinal study of subjects with LLS who were older than our patients [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] .
Thus , it can also be a target for interventions to enhance their cognition .
Finally , as expected patients with LLS were impaired in executive function compared to patients with DEP or NC on one test ( WCST Categories ) .
However , no such impairment was observed in other tests ( e.g. , TMB ) .
Small sample sizes are likely contributing to such inconsistency .
Quantum dot solar cells - is this the breakthrough ?
By Eco Guy
Quantum Dot Photovoltaics look to be able to double solar electricity collection efficiency .
Is this enough to improve the viability of solar power to be practical to more of the community and make it sustainable green ?
According to this article and the original paper it looks like we are on the verge of having a solar cell technology that could double the effective efficiency of solar cells whilst keeping the costs the same .
So what will this mean in practice ?
# 1 Double the power in the same space
# 2 Increased reliability
# 3 A lot more solar , a lot less grants ..
What about existing installations ?
Conclusion
This is the biggest win - for the same square meter area you get back double the power .
Often the limiting factor in solar cell placement is the available mounting space facing in the right direction and at the right angle to the Sun .
If the effect energy density is doubled at the same price point - it becomes possible to install solar systems in places previously not viable .
Having less area doing the same work ( or the same area doing more ) means there is less physical components involved , so the likelihood of mechanical failure goes down .
Also the fact more energy is being captured and converted into electrical energy means less heat energy is absorbed into the panel itself - this will reduce the ' heat stress ' the panel experiences during the daily solar cycle - again improving reliability .
The ability to derive power from solar at a suitable rate of return is something which has plagued solar power uptake .
In order for consumers to consider going solar , often governments have had to step in with grants or feed - in - tariffs to make the exercise have cost benefits better than just sticking to the old mains supply .
Now if solar can indeed get twice the efficiency at the same cost point , this will remove the need for the government to get involved , as simple cost benefit analysis will clearly show going solar is the way to go .. People should be able to upgrade to have the new panels , trouble is they should only really do this if they have got to a point where the existing installation has become cost benefit positive in favor of the solar system .
The other option is to just add more of the newer panels to an existing system and uprate inverter and cabling to match .
This assumes that you have the space available to do this .
Although we would recommend you do n't wait around for this technology to become available when considering solar , we would certainly suggest if a solar installation is looking doubtful to provide meaningful returns for the investment to wait for this .
There are also technologies in the works to produce existing efficiency solar cells at cheap cost points , so if you have the space and time , wait for things to improve a little while .

How To Compile rTorrent From SVN In Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx / Debian 5 Lenny With Coloured Interface
Author : Stephan Jau
Revision : v1.0
Last Change : August 28 , 2010
Introduction
rTorrent is a popular command line based bittorrent client .
It provides very powerful features yet it is very light on the system - contrary to other bittorrent clients like Vuze .
There are a couple of webinterfaces for it but they are not truly need .
SSH access combined with the " screen " program provide you all the tools you need .
In the previous howto patches for magnet link support were provided .
With the current revision 1169 magnet link support has already been integrated .
However some of the inner workings were changed and the colour patch was modified to work in the current revision .
This howto works for Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx and for Debian 5 Lenny .
The difference is that commands that contain sudo must be executed as root .
In this howto I assume you download and compile the sources from your ~/rtorrent resp .
~/rtorrent / trunk folder .
Notice for Debian Lenny
If you run Debian Lenny , it 's recommended that you also update c-ares and curl .
This means you 'll compile that also .
In order to do that , see the very bottom of this howto and then continue at step 4 .
1. Remove current rtorrent installation
sudo apt - get remove rtorrent libtorrent *
2. Install necessary packages
sudo apt - get install subversion build - essential libtool automake openssl libsigc ++- 2.0 - dev libncurses5 - dev libncursesw5 - dev libcurl4 - openssl - dev libcppunit- dev
3. Create rtorrent folder
mkdir ~/rtorrent
4 . Go into the rtorrent folder
cd ~/rtorrent
Current location : /home / USER/rtorrent
5 . Get the rtorrent sources by svn
svn co svn://rakshasa.no/libtorrent/trunk
Current rtorrent version is : rev. 1169 .
AdvertisementAdvertisement
6 . Get into the trunk folder
cd trunk
Current location : /home / USER/rtorrent / trunk
7. Download the patches
Colour support for rtorrent :
wget http://www.simplylinux.ch/rtorrent/canvas-color_1169.patch
Advertisement
This patch enables you to colorize the rtorrent cli interfaces .
It differentiaties between completed / uncompleted torrents and active / inactive ones .
I first had to get used to it also but meanwhile I think it 's really a good enhancement .
The patch was originally supplied here : http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ticket/1382.
However that patch does not work with the current rev. 1105 .
Because of that I fixed it and supply it also from my server .
Torrent Tracker Stats :
wget http://www.simplylinux.ch/rtorrent/trackerinfo.patch
This patch shows the number of seeders / leechers / completed as supplied by the tracker in the tracker view .
Often it 's not accurate however it 's usefull for me to check if a tracker has any peers at all listed for a given torrent .
8 . Apply the patches
Colour support for rtorrent :
patch - p0 < canvas-color_1169.patch
Torrent Tracker Stats :
patch - p0 < trackerinfo.patch
Advertisement
9 . Get into the libtorrent folder
cd libtorrent
Current location : /home/ USER/rtorrent/trunk/libtorrent
10 .
Run the autogen.sh script
./autogen.sh
11 . Configure libtorrent
./ configure
12 . Compile libtorrent
make
13 . Install libtorrent
sudo make install
14 . Extend /etc/ld.so.conf
echo " include /usr/local / lib " | sudo tee -a /etc/ld.so.conf
sudo ldconfig
16 . Get into the rtorrent folder
cd ../ rtorrent
Current location : /home/ USER/rtorrent/trunk/rtorrent
17 . Run the autogen.sh script
./autogen.sh
18 . Configure rtorrent
./ configure
Advertisement
19 . Compile rtorrent
make
20 . Install rtorrent
sudo make install
21 . Extend rtorrent configuration
Magnet Link support as provided by this howto requires a session folder .
If there is no session folder defined yet in the ~/.rtorrent.rc config file or if that config file does not exist yet , then it has to be added .
An example for an ~/.rtorrent.rc file can be found here : http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/browser/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc#latest.
In addition I would also set the DHT option to " on " .
You can also just copy the .rtorrent.rc config file from the trunk and then edit it :
cp ~/rtorrent/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc
~/.rtorrent.rc
To make use of the colour patch , also the colour options need to be added to the ~/.rtorrent.rc config .
I use this example below :
# Color / Canvas patch done_fg_color = 2 #done_bg_color = 2 active_fg_color = 1 #active_bg_color = 4
With these options inactive completed torrents will be displayed as dark green , active ones as bright green , inactive incompleted torrents are displayed in dark red , active ones in bright red .
To customize this further you can use those colours : 0 = black ; 1 = red ; 2 = green ; 3 = yellow ; 4 = blue ; 5 = magenta ; 6 = cyan ; 7 = white
r Torrent also allows custom views or modify existing views .
The rTorrent Common
Tasks page has one very useful entry :
schedule = filter_active , 30,30 , " view_filter = active , \" or={d.get_up_rate=,d.get_down_rate=}\ " "
Add this also to your .rtorrent.rc config file .
Maybe change the value of 30 to 10 or so .
Basically this customization allows you to modify that " active view " ( view 9 ) to only show torrents that are currently sending or receiving data from peers .
If you do n't have a .rtorrent.rc config file in your home dir then you can get one with the command below .
However it needs a lot of work ( especially enabling a download and session dir )
wget http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/export/1169/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc
- O ~/.rtorrent.rc
22 . Run rtorrent
rtorrent
Enjoy
The following steps apply if you want to compile c-ares and curl yourself .
This is recommended for Debian Lenny - because of that I will not use " sudo " below .
If you 're on Ubuntu , just add sudo accordingly .
B1 . Remove current rtorrent installation
apt - get remove rtorrent libtorrent * libcurl4 - openssl-dev
B2 . Install necessary packages
apt - get install subversion build - essential libtool automake openssl libsigc ++- 2.0 - dev libncurses5 - dev libncursesw5 - dev libcppunit - dev libssl - dev
B3 . Create rtorrent folder
mkdir ~/rtorrent
B4 .
Go into the rtorrent folder
cd ~/rtorrent
Current location : /home / USER/rtorrent
B5 . Download c-ares and curl
wget http://c-ares.haxx.se/c-ares-1.7.3.tar.gz
wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.21.1.tar.gz
B6 . Extract c-ares and curl
tar xvfz c-ares - 1.7.3.tar.gz
tar xvfz curl - 7.21.1.tar.gz
B7 .
Enter c-ares folder , configure , make and install
cd ~/rtorrent/c-ares -1.7.3
./ configure
make
make install
B8 . Enter curl folder , configure with c-ares , make and install
cd ~/rtorrent/ curl-7.21.1
./configure -- with-ares
make
make install
B9 .
Continue with step 4 of the normal howto by entering the rtorrent folder
cd ~/rtorrent
The real thing
THOSE who buy counterfeit designer goods project a fashionable image at a fraction of the price of the real thing .
You might think that would make them feel rather smug about themselves .
But an intriguing piece of research published in Psychological Science by Francesca Gino of the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , suggests the opposite : wearing fake goods makes you feel a fake yourself , and causes you to be more dishonest in other matters than you would otherwise be .
Dr Gino and her colleagues provided a group of female volunteers with Chloé sunglasses that cost about $ 300 a pair , supposedly as part of a marketing study .
They told some of the volunteers that the sunglasses were real , and others that they were counterfeit .
They then asked the volunteers to perform pencil - and - paper mathematical quizzes for which they could earn up to $ 10 , depending on how many questions they got right .
The participants were spun a yarn about how doing these quizzes would allow them to judge the comfort and quality of the glasses .
Crucially , the quizzes were presented as “ honour tests ” that participants would mark themselves , reporting their own scores to the study 's organisers .
The quiz papers were unnumbered and thus appeared to be untraceable , and were thrown away at the end of the study .
In fact , though , each had one unique question on it , meaning that it could be identified — and the papers were recovered and marked again by the researchers after they had been discarded .
Of participants told that they were wearing authentic designer sunglasses , 30 % were found to have cheated , reporting that they had solved more problems than was actually the case .
Of those who thought they were wearing fake sunglasses , by contrast , about 70 % cheated .
The results were similar when the women completed a computer - based task that involved counting dots on a screen .
In this case , the location of the dots determined the financial reward .
The women who thought they were wearing counterfeits lied about those locations more often than those who did not .
In a third part of the study , the participants were asked questions about the honesty and ethics of people they knew and people in general .
Those who thought they had knock - offs were more likely to say that people were dishonest and unethical .
It looked , then , as if believing they were wearing fakes made people feel like fakes .
To test that hypothesis , Dr Gino and her colleagues ran the experiment again , this time including a test meant to detect self - alienation .
They asked the participants if they agreed with statements like , “ right now , I feel as if I do n't know myself very well ” .
Those who thought they were wearing fakes did indeed feel more alienated from themselves than those who knew they were wearing the real things .
It remained possible , however , that it was the sense of self - alienation which was normal , and that believing you were wearing designer glasses made you more at ease with yourself .
To test that , the team ran one final set of experiments , in which some people were given sunglasses to wear without any indication of their provenance .
Volunteers in this control group behaved like those who believed the glasses were authentic .
The moral , then , is that people 's sense of right and wrong influences the way they feel and behave .
Even when it is someone else who has made them behave badly , it can affect their subsequent behaviour .
Next time you are offered fake accessories , beware : wearing them can make you feel like a bad person , not a better one .

The Beale Papers Cover of
The Beale ciphers ( or Beale Papers ) are a set of three ciphertexts , one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold , silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US $ 43 million as of January 2018 .
Comprising three ciphertexts , the first ( unsolved ) text describes the location , the second ( solved ) ciphertext the content of the treasure , and the third ( unsolved ) lists the names of the treasure 's owners and their next of kin .
The story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County , Virginia , in the 1820s .
Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared , never to be seen again .
According to the story , the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later , and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died .
The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages , and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure .
The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s .
Since the publication of the pamphlet , a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure , but all efforts have resulted in failure . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
There are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax , including the 1980 article " A Dissenting Opinion " by cryptographer Jim Gillogly , and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the Beale Papers and their related story by Joe Nickell , using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale .
Nickell also presents linguistic evidence demonstrating that the documents could not have been written at the time alleged ( words such as " stampeding " , for instance , are of later vintage ) .
His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward , whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light .
Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction ; specifically , a " secret vault " allegory of the Freemasons ; James B. Ward was a Mason himself . [ 1 ]
Background [ edit ]
A single pamphlet published in 1885 , entitled The Beale Papers , is the only source of this story .
The treasure was said to have been obtained by an American named Thomas J. Beale in the early 1800s , from a mine to the north of Nuevo México ( New Mexico ) , at that time in the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México ( an area that today would most likely be part of Colorado ) .
According to the pamphlet , Beale was the leader of a group of 30 gentlemen adventurers from Virginia who stumbled upon the rich mine of gold and silver while hunting buffalo .
They spent 18 months mining thousands of pounds of precious metals , which they then charged Beale with transporting to Virginia and burying in a secure location .
After Beale made multiple trips to stock the hiding place , he then encrypted three messages : the location , a description of the treasure , and the names of its owners and their relatives .
The treasure location is traditionally linked to Montvale in Bedford County , Virginia .
Beale placed the ciphertexts and some other papers in an iron box .
In 1822 he entrusted the box to a Lynchburg innkeeper named Robert Morriss .
Beale told Morriss not to open the box unless he or one of his men failed to return from their journey within 10 years .
Sending a letter from St. Louis a few months later , Beale promised Morriss that a friend in St. Louis would mail the key to the cryptograms , however , it never arrived .
It was not until 1845 that Morriss opened the box .
Inside he found two plaintext letters from Beale , and several pages of ciphertext separated into Papers " 1 " , " 2 " , and " 3 " .
Morriss had no luck in solving the ciphers , and decades later left the box and its contents to an unnamed friend .
The friend , then using an edition of the United States Declaration of Independence as the key for a modified book cipher , successfully deciphered the second ciphertext which gave a description of the buried treasure .
Unable to solve the other two ciphertexts , the friend ultimately made the letters and ciphertexts public in a pamphlet entitled The Beale Papers , which was published by yet another friend , James B. Ward , in 1885 .
Ward is thus not " the friend " .
Ward himself is almost untraceable in local records except that a man with that name owned the home in which a Sarah Morriss , identified as the spouse of Robert Morriss , died at age 77 , in 1863 .
[5 ]
He also is recorded as becoming a Master Mason in 1863 . [ 1 ]

Deciphered message [ edit ]
The plaintext of Paper # 2 reads :
I have deposited in the county of Bedford , about four miles from Buford 's , in an excavation or vault , six feet below the surface of the ground , the following articles , belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number three , herewith :
The first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold , and thirty - eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver , deposited Nov. eighteen nineteen .
The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty - one , and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold , and twelve hundred and eighty - eight of silver ; also jewels , obtained in St. Louis in exchange to save transportation , and valued at thirteen thousand dollars .
The above is securely packed in iron pots , with iron covers .
The vault is roughly lined with stone , and the vessels rest on solid stone , and are covered with others .
Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault , so that no difficulty will be had in finding it .
The second cipher can be decrypted fairly easily using any copy of the United States Declaration of Independence , but some editing for spelling is necessary .
To decrypt it , one finds the word corresponding to the number ( e.g. , the first number is 115 , and the 115th word in the Declaration of Independence is " instituted " ) , and takes the first letter of that word ( in the case of the example , " I " ) .
Beale used a version of United States Declaration of Independence different from the original .
To extract the hidden message , the following 5 modifications must be applied to the original text :
after word 154 ( " institute " ) and before word 157 ( " laying " ) one word must be added ( probably " a " )
after word 240 ( " invariably " ) and before word 246 ( " design " ) one word must be removed
after word 467 ( " houses " ) and before word 495 ( " be " ) ten words must be removed
after word 630 ( " eat " ) and before word 654 ( " to " ) one word must be removed
after word 677 ( " foreign " ) and before word 819 ( " valuable " ) one word must be removed
Furthermore :
The first letter of the 811th word of the modified text ( " fundamentally " ) is always used by Beale as a " y "
The first letter of the 1005th word of the modified text ( " have " ) is always used by Beale as an " x "
Finally , in the decoded text there are 4 errors , probably due to wrong transcription of the original paper :
84 ( should be 85 ) 63 43 131 29 ... consistcd ( " consisted " )
( " consisted " ) 53 ( should be 54 ) 20 125 371 38 ... rhousand ( " thousand " )
( " thousand " ) ... 84 ( should be 85 ) 575 1005 150 200 ... thc ( " the " )
( " the " ) ... 96 ( should be 95 ) 405 41 600 136 ... varlt ( " vault " )
Value [ edit ]
The treasure 's total weight is about 3 tons as described in inventory of the second cryptogram .
This includes approximately 35,052 troy oz gold , 61,200 troy oz silver ( worth about US $ 42 m and US$ 1 m , respectively , in January 2017 [ 6 ] ) and jewels worth around US $ 220,000 in 2017 .
Authenticity [ edit ]
There has been considerable debate over whether the remaining two ciphertexts are real or hoaxes .
An early researcher , Carl Hammer of Sperry UNIVAC , [ 7 ] used supercomputers of the late 1960s to analyze the ciphers and found that while the ciphers were poorly encoded , the two undeciphered ones did not show the patterns one would expect of randomly chosen numbers and probably encoded an intelligible text .
[ 8 ]
Other questions remain about the authenticity of the pamphlet 's account .
In the words of one researcher " To me , the pamphlet story has all the earmarks of a fake . . .
[ There was ] no evidence save the word of the unknown author of the pamphlet that he ever had the papers . " [ 9 ]
The pamphlet 's background story has several implausibilities , and is based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence and hearsay .
Later cryptographers have claimed that the two remaining ciphertexts have statistical characteristics which suggest that they are not actually encryptions of an English plaintext . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
Alphabetical sequences such as abfdefghiijklmmnohpp are both non-random , as indicated by Carl Hammer , [ 8 ] and not words in English .
Alphabetical sequences such as are both non-random , as indicated by Carl Hammer , and not words in English .
Others have also questioned why Beale would have bothered writing three different ciphertexts ( with at least two keys , if not ciphers ) for what is essentially a single message in the first place , [ 12 ] particularly if he wanted to ensure that the next of kin received their share ( as it is , with the treasure described , there is no incentive to decode the third cipher ) . [ 8 ]

Analysis of the language used by the author of the pamphlet ( the uses of punctuation , relative clauses , infinitives , conjunctives , and so on ) has detected significant correlations between it and the writing style of Beale 's letters , including the plaintext of the second cipher , suggesting that they may have been written by the same person . [ 1 ]
The letters also contain several English words , such as " improvise " , not otherwise recorded before the 1820s in English , ; [ 13 ] but used from French from 1786 in the New Orleans area [ 14 ] and stampede ( Spanish ) " an uproar " . [ 15 ]
Beale's " stampeding " apparently first appears in print in the English Language in 1832 [ 16 ] but was used from 1786 - 1823 in New Orleans in French and Spanish . [ 1 ]

Beale's " stampeding " apparently first appears in print in the English Language in 1832 but was used from 1786 - 1823 in New Orleans in French and Spanish .
The second message , describing the treasure , has been deciphered , but the others have not , suggesting a deliberate ploy to encourage interest in deciphering the other two texts , only to discover that they are hoaxes .
In addition , the original sale price of the pamphlet , 50 cents , was a high price for the time ( adjusted for inflation , it is equivalent to $ 14.23 today [ 17 ] ) , and the author writes that he expects " a wide circulation " .
) , and the author writes that he expects " a wide circulation " .
The third cipher appears to be too short to list thirty individuals ' next of kin . [ 8 ]
If the Declaration of Independence is used as a key for the first cipher , it yields alphabetical sequences such as abfdefghiijklmmnohpp [ 18 ] and others .
According to the American Cryptogram Association , the chances of such sequences appearing multiple times in the one ciphertext by chance are less than one in a hundred million million . [ 18 ]
Although it is conceivable that the first cipher was intended as a proof of concept letting decoders know that they were " on the right track " for one or more of the subsequent ciphers , such a proof would be redundant , as the success of the key with respect to the second document would provide the same evidence on its own .

Robert Morriss , as represented in the pamphlet , says he was running the Washington Hotel in 1820 .
Yet contemporary records show he did not start in that position until at least 1823 . [ 19 ]
There have been many attempts to break the remaining cipher (s ) .
Most attempts have tried other historical texts as keys ( e.g. , Magna Carta , various books of the Bible , the U.S. Constitution , and the Virginia Royal Charter ) , assuming the ciphertexts were produced with some book cipher , but none have been recognized as successful to date .
Breaking the cipher (s ) may depend on random chance ( as , for instance , stumbling upon a book key if the two remaining ciphertexts are actually book ciphers ) ; so far , even the most skilled cryptanalysts who have attempted them have been defeated .
Of course , Beale could have used a document that he had written himself for either or both of the remaining keys or either a document of his own or randomly selected characters for the third source , in either case rendering any further attempts to crack the codes useless .
Existence of Thomas J. Beale [ edit ]
A survey of U.S. Census records in 1810 shows two persons named Thomas Beale , in Connecticut and New Hampshire .
However , the population schedules from the 1810 U.S. Census are completely missing for seven states , one territory , the District of Columbia , and 18 of the counties of Virginia . [ 20 ]
The 1820 U.S. Census has two persons named Thomas Beale , Captain Thomas Beale of the battle of New Orleans 1815 in Louisiana originally from Virginia Botetourt County – Fincastle area 12 miles from Bedford County and one in Tennessee , and a Thomas K. Beale in Virginia , but the population schedules are completely missing for three states and one territory .
Before 1850 the U.S. Census recorded the names of only the heads of households ; others in the household were only counted .
Beale , if he existed , may have been living in someone else 's household . [ 21 ]
In addition , a man named " Thomas Beall " appears in the customer lists of St. Louis Post Department in 1820 .
According to the pamphlet , Beale sent a letter from St. Louis in 1822 . [ 18 ]
Additionally , a Cheyenne legend exists about gold and silver being taken from the West and buried in mountains in the East , dating from roughly 1820 . [ 18 ]
Poe 's alleged authorship [ edit ]
Edgar Allan
Poe has been suggested as the pamphlet 's real author because he had an interest in cryptography .
It was well known he placed notices of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper Alexander 's Weekly ( Express ) Messenger , inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve . [ 22 ]
In 1843 he used a cryptogram as plot device in his short story " The Gold - Bug " .
From 1820 , he was also living in Richmond , Virginia at the time of Beale 's alleged encounters with Morriss .
In February 1826 Poe enrolled as a student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville . [ 23 ]
But with mounting debts ,
Poe left for Boston in April 1827 . [ 24 ]
However , research and facts debunk Poe 's authorship .
He died in 1849 well before The Beale Papers were first published in 1885 .
The pamphlet also mentions the American Civil War that started in 1861 .
William Poundstone , an American author and skeptic , had stylometric analysis performed on the pamphlet for his 1983 book Biggest Secrets , and found that Poe 's prose is significantly different from the grammatical structure used by the author who wrote The Beale Papers . [ 25 ]
Search attempts [ edit ]
Despite the Beale Papers ' unproven veracity , treasure hunters have not been deterred from trying to find the vault .
The " information " that there is buried treasure in Bedford County has stimulated many expeditions with shovels , and other implements of discovery , looking for likely spots .
For more than a hundred years , people have been arrested for trespassing and unauthorized digging ; some of them in groups as in the case of people from Pennsylvania in the 1990s . [ 18 ]
Several digs were completed at the top of Porter 's Mountain , one in late 1980s with the land owner 's permission as long as any treasure found was split 50/50 .
However , the treasure hunters only found Civil War artifacts .
As the value of these artifacts paid for time and equipment rental , the expedition broke even . [ 18 ]
Media attention [ edit ]
The story has been the subject of multiple television documentaries , such as the UK's Mysteries series , a segment in the seventh special of Unsolved Mysteries ; and the 2011 Declaration of Independence episode of the History Channel TV show Brad Meltzer 's Decoded .
There are also several books , and considerable Internet activity .
In 2014 , the National Geographic TV show The Numbers Game referred to the Beale ciphers as one of the strongest passwords ever created .
In 2015 the UKTV series Myth Hunters ( also known as Raiders of the Lost Past ) devoted one of its season 3 episodes to the topic . [ 26 ]
Also in 2015 , the Josh Gates series Expedition Unknown visited Bedford to investigate the Beale Ciphers and search for the treasure .
Simon Singh 's 1999 book The Code Book explains the Beale cipher mystery in one of its chapters . [ 18 ]
In 2010 , an award - winning animated short film was made concerning the ciphers called The Thomas Beale Cipher . [ 27 ]
Various information related to the incident has been described on social media as well .

The never - ending saga of Sarah Palin ’s infringement upon our national discourse took a turn for the worse ( as if that were possible ) last night .
Palin appeared on “ The O’Rielly Factor ” , during which she doubled down on her theocratic vision of America by claiming that the Founders intended for our laws to be based on the bible and the ten commandments .
So , in this chapter of fact - checking Sarah Palin , we debunk Palin ’s Secessionist Theocracy ( aka : Real America ) theory .
A few weeks ago Sarah Palin wrongly claimed America was a Christian Nation .
Ostensibly poking at the President of the United States , she said , “ For any leader to declare that America is n’t a Christian nation and poking an ally like Israel in the eye , it ’s mind - boggling for — to see some of our nation ’s actions recently . ”
Leave it to Palin to not only get the facts wrong about the founding fathers , but also about the current controversy regarding National Prayer Day as well as Obama ’s position .
The founding fathers did not intend this to be a Christian nation .
National Prayer Day controversy was about Franklin Graham ’s civilian group working in concert with the Pentagon while making volunteers sign a pledge to Christ , which any reasonable person can interpret as a violation of separation of church and state further compounded by Graham ’s beliefs that Muslims are “ evil ” .

Palin doubled down on American as a theocracy last night on Fox News ’ “ The O’Reilly Factor ” .

Fox Transcript :
O’REILLY : All right .
The governor joins us now .
So why do you think America is a Christian nation ?
As you may have guessed , this story involves fact - checking , since both Fox and Palin are involved .
Fox , who sued for the right to lie on air and call it news and Palin , PolitiFact ’s Liar of the Year winner , are a lethal combination of misinformation and white rage .
So , let the fact - checking continue : Palin is no longer the governor of Alaska and although she claimed in her quitting speech to not care about titles , Palin ’s speaking contracts demand that she be addressed as “ Governor Palin ” .
Palin quit as governor midway through her first term with no explanation other than a vague reference to opposition researchers trying to destroy her ; aka , constituents who filed ethics complaints against her .
Many of these complaints were found to be valid ( even by the counsel who served at the pleasure of the Governor ) .
One of them resulted in Palin ’s Alaska Fund Trust being frozen .
SARAH PALIN : I have said all along that America is based on Judeo - Christian beliefs and , you know , nobody has to believe me though .
You can just go to our Founding Fathers ’ early documents and see how they crafted a Declaration of Independence and a Constitution that allows that Judeo - Christian belief to be the foundation of our lives .
And our Constitution , of course , essentially acknowledging that our unalienable rights do n’t come from man ; they come from God .
So this document is set up to protect us from a government that would ever infringe upon our rights to have freedom of religion and to be able to express our faith freely .
And on we go with our fact - checking mission through the tangled webs of Palinese .
It turns out Palin was wrong about the Declaration of Independence ( I can hear the collective gasp of shock around the nation from my kitchen window ) :
One Nation explains :
“ There are no specific reference to Christianity or Jesus in the Declaration of independence .
There are a few references to a ‘ Nature ’s God ’ who is the creator of life , giver of rights and ‘ supreme Judge of the world ’ but that is rather vague . ”
Phrases used include :
“ ... that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights ” —
This does describes God as a creator of life and giver of rights but goes no further .
and
“ … appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions ” — Here God is the ‘ Supreme Judge ’ .
“ There was plenty of doubt about Christianity among the framers .
In order to justify their defiance of the King they had to invoke a higher authority and make the case that they were endowed with the higher power ’s blessing .
This higher power was not necessarily a Christian power . ”
Oh , boy .
I do n’t understand what documents Palin is reading .
Any and all of them that are put in front of her ?
We must remember that Palin could not name a single paper she read and she also thought the song “ America the Beautiful ” was part of the Constitution , so it would have been fair for O’Reilly to question Palin about her sources , but of course , his job does n’t involve confronting Republican leaders .
He left that job to us .
So we take a brief gander at the document within which the Right cloaks their recent racism , bigotry and hate :
“ The 1787 constitution is a nearly godless document .
It mentions neither God , nor Christianity outside of a reference to the date using the Christian calendar .
It does however have a provision against requiring specific religious ideas as a qualification for office .
Article VI , Section 3 , US Constitution : “ … no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States . ”
Article .
VII , US Constitution : “ Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven ”
It certainly can be argued that this sentence sets up The United States under ‘ our Lord ’ Jesus Christ , but when viewed in context it takes on a much lesser importance .
The sentence is in the last section of the fourth and final page of the Constitution and was a common way of referencing the Christian calendar .
‘ In the year of our Lord ’ translated to Latin is ‘ Anno Domini ’ which is commonly abbreviated ‘ A.D. ’ and is still used to this day by most of the western world when stating the year .
It is merely a tradition and holds no religious significance . ”
So , the use of the calendar term “ In the Year of Our Lord ” is proof that the framers wanted Judeo - Christian beliefs to be the foundation of our lives ?
And as for her last mention of the Constitution , it seems as if Palin confused the Declaration of Independence ’s use of “ inalienable rights ” with the Constitution .
Ah , well .
What can you expect from the Republican front runner for 2012 ?
The first amendment says , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press … ” Clearly the founders did not intended for our laws to be based on the bible .
Furthermore , Article 11 of the Treaty of Tripoli signed by President John Adams : “ As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion , - as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws , religion or tranquility of Musselmen … ”
All of this hooplah about National Prayer Day demonstrates that the persecution complex of the Right is in good order , folks .
No one told Christians they could not worship on National Prayer Day .
“ U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb wrote , “ In fact , it is because the nature of prayer is so personal and can have such a powerful effect on a community that the government may not use its authority to try to influence an individual ’s decision whether and when to pray . ”
Furthermore , Palin ’s failure to acknowledge Graham ’s assault of other citizen ’s rights to worship whatever religion they chose is not only disingenuous but deeply , profoundly troubling .
The founders understood the perils of mixing religion with government , which is why they went to such great pains to separate the two .
It should be noted that Fox News holds Palin up as a leader of the Republican party and patriot extraordinaire , and yet she has a close affiliation with the Alaska Secessionist Movement , which has close ties to both southern secessionist movements and white nationalists / KKK groups .
Somehow , I do n’t see Jefferson applauding Palin ’s arrival on our political scene .
We ’ll close the saga of fact - checking Sarah Palin by quoting Jefferson , whom Palin tried to co-opt at the Times Gala earlier this week :
“ I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature . ” ~~ Thomas Jefferson 3rd president , Drafted Declaration of Independence , Signer of Constitution , influential on 1st Amendment
Updated : to clarify Article 11 came from Treaty of Tripoli .

( CNN ) -- Conservative videographer James O'Keefe and three co-defendants pleaded guilty Wednesday to entering federal property under false pretenses for a January incident in which they tried to tamper with the phone system in the New Orleans office of Sen.
Mary Landrieu .
O'Keefe , 25 , and co-defendants Joseph Basel , 24 , Robert Flanagan , 24 , and Stan Dai , 25 , were each fined $ 1,500 , placed on probation and ordered to do community service , according to a Department of Justice statement .
The four were arrested in January after Basel and Flanagan posed as telephone repair workers to get into Landrieu 's office .
O'Keefe also was in the office and secretly videotaped the incident , while Dai was outside , according to the Justice Department statement .
Landrieu , a Democrat , had voted in favor of the Democratic health care reform bill the previous month .
Calling himself an " investigative journalist , " O'Keefe claimed he was trying to test the credibility of a claim by Landrieu that her office had been unable to field calls from constituents opposed to her stance on the Senate health care bill because her phone lines had been " jammed for weeks . "
Basel and Flanagan told a staffer in Landrieu 's office that they were telephone repairmen and were granted access to the reception desk 's phone system .
All four were arrested shortly after leaving the office .
O'Keefe is the same conservative activist who dressed as a pimp last summer and visited the offices of ACORN , which bills itself as an advocacy group for low - and middle - income families , to solicit advice on setting up a brothel , among other scenarios , law enforcement officials confirmed .
He secretly recorded the visits on videotapes that were posted on the Internet , leading to a media firestorm .
ACORN announced in March it was shutting down due to a loss of funding .
In 1968 , out of his basement , he began publishing the Friday Morning Quarterback , which became perhaps the most influential musical industry trade magazine and on which he eventually made his fortune .
He said in an interview with the Inquirer in 1994 that he was the first to spot Judy Collins " Send in the Clowns , " Hall and Oates ' " She 's Gone " and Kenny Rogers ' " Lucille . "
Organizers of a massive mobile health clinic returning to Los Angeles this week said they had distributed about 2,500 wristbands by 10:30 a.m. Sunday .
The non-transferable wristbands are being handed out at the Los Angeles Sports Arena near downtown .
Pre-registration is required for anyone seeking health services during the seven - day free clinic that begins Tuesday and runs through Monday , May 3 .
Clinic organizers hope to serve about 1,200 people daily .
" I would like to think everybody will get in , " Stan Brock , founder of Tennessee - based Remote Area Medical , the nonprofit group that is staging its second Los Angeles clinic , said Sunday as he surveyed the line .
" The reality is we can't see everybody -- the need is so great .
We just see as many as we can . "
Phyllis Vincent , 59 , of Pasadena was turned away from the clinic held in August at the Forum in Inglewood , but got a wristband Sunday morning to secure treatment on Tuesday .
Vincent said she needs new glasses , a tooth pulled and teeth cleaning .
Although she works as a background actor in a military training program near Twentynine Palms , she does not have health insurance .
" They learned a lot from last year .
I think it will be a little better organized -- it 's just that the need is so great , " Vincent said after making her appointment .
Ladies and gentlemen , the wait is over .
This is a developing story and we will have more as it becomes available .
Steve Yzerman , Detroit Red Wings legend , will become the Tampa Bay Lightning 's sixth general manager this afternoon , replacing dismissed GM Brian Lawton and following in the footsteps of former GM's Jay Feaster , Rick Dudley , Jacques Demers and Phil Esposito .
We 've been waiting , waiting , waiting ...
And early this morning a news release from the Lightning announced the scheduling of a press conference for this morning .
Various reports have also come out , and Jeff Vinik 's wish of silence can no longer be kept in check .
Of course , at this point , this silence has turned into a hell of a marketing tool , as the hriing is not only a huge name -- but there is huge hype around someone finally filling the position .
Steve Yzerman 's name had been tied to the Lightning GM role since a report surfaced weeks ago from TSN .
Other names that had come out of the woodwork had been Pierre McGuire , Ron Hextall , Doug Risebrough and dark - horse candidate Claude Loiselle .
But the one truth that prevailed since rumors first sprung up about Yzerman , was the truth of silence .
Jeffrey Vinik did not want negotiations playing out in the media , or names leaked to the media .

A paper in Nature Methods this week establishes a scale that can estimate how much pain mice are feeling based on facial expressions .
The system , called the " mouse grimace scale , " codes movements like squeezing the eyes shut or bulging the nose as indications of pain , similar to those displayed in humans .
It 's intended to allow us to study feelings of pain in mice when testing drugs or veterinary procedures .
Scientists often use facial expressions in humans as an indication of how much pain they are feeling from electrical shocks , topical acids , and so on ; even newborn babies express pain this way .
While there are established scales for measuring pain based on grimacing facial expressions in humans , there is n't one for the rodents that are so often used in experiments as human analogues .
To create their mouse grimace scale , a group of researchers exposed some mice to painful situations while recording their reactions with video cameras .
They established cues like cheek bulge , nose bulge , ear position , whisker change , and eye squeeze as expressions of pain , and categorized them in levels of no pain , moderate pain , and severe pain .
When a mouse 's facial expressions were recorded in high definition , researchers found that people presented with screen captures of the mice correctly identified mice in pain about 97 percent of the time .
The system 's developers plan to offer a training manual on the mouse grimace scale , and predict that it will be helpful for developments in veterinary care and drug testing .

Native Americans killed in service for the United States and killed defending their Indian country is listed below in rough estimated numbers .
A likely total of 100,000 - 500,000 Native Americans in the U.S. have died since 1776 .
The high end would be around a million .
Native Americans are the have the highest mortality rate of any U.S. minority because of U.S. action and policy .

[ Original answer truncated as it contained no useful data ]
Estimates :
Two studies have been conducted that attempt to number the natives killed by the United States .
The first of these was sponsored by the United States government , and while official does not stand up to scrutiny and is therefore discounted ( generally ) ; this estimate shows between 1 million to 4 millionkilled .
The second study was not sponsored by the US Government but was done from independent researchers .
This study estimated populations and population reductions using later census data .
Two figures are given , both low and high , at : between 10 millionand 114 million Indians as a direct result of US actions .
Please note that Nazi Holocaust estimates are between 6 and 11 million ; thereby making the Nazi Holocaust the 2nd largest mass murder of a class of people in history .
REF :
American Holocaust : D. Stannard ( Oxford Press , 1992 ) - " over 100 million killed " " [ Christopher ]

Thousands even as me being half native they mostly killed us because they owed us land and did't want to give it to us so they gave us beer even though they owe us millions in land .
My great grand parents had to hide out from the government they had to move place to place they never got an education and they were on warfare because the government used them .
Thanks to the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , it was illegal for Indians to live in Georgia .
They could travel through Georgia , with proper papers .
This law was not repealed until March , 1980 .
Officially not ' many ' in Indian Wars , but murdering Red Indians was daily practice for white Colonists .
And this genocide was happily tolerated by American Government and US Army
almost 20 million Red Indians died , say 10 per day , which should be general American knowledge .
By far the biggest killers though were smallpox , measles , influenza , whooping cough , diphtheria , typhus , Bubonic Plague , cholera , and scarlet fever .

Via : Financial Times :
The bond vigilantes are finally flexing their muscles .
A long period of stability for the US government bond market showed signs of cracking this week as a lack of investor appetite for new debt sent the benchmark 10 - year yield to its highest level since last June .
For more than a year , analysts have been warning that record sized debt sales by the US Treasury were at odds with a 10 - year yield sitting comfortably below 4 per cent .
This week , the yield on 10 - year notes jumped from 3.65 per cent to a peak of 3.92 per cent on Thursday .
On Friday it was 3.87 per cent .
Chart : Treasuries Falling inflation , rising unemployment , the housing market slump , the Federal Reserve ’s policies of a near zero overnight borrowing rate and its purchase of up to $ 1,700bn in bonds have all helped keep Treasury yields near historic lows .
But this week the mood shifted as yields for $ 118bn of new US debt were much higher than forecast , sparking overall selling of Treasuries .
Sentiment also deteriorated in the UK bond market after the government ’s budget ahead of a general election expected in May failed to resolve doubts over future spending and debt reduction .
The term “ bond vigilantes ” was coined in the 1980s when bond investors pushed up long - term yields to force central banks into taking action to curb inflation .
This time , bond investors are less worried about inflation : they are fretting about huge fiscal deficits and the looming bond supply needed to finance them .
“ Everyone thought we would see rising rates due to higher inflation , but it appears the bond vigilantes are demanding a higher real rate due to concerns about Treasury issuance , ” says George Goncalves , head of fixed income strategy at Nomura Securities .
Worries about the debt loads of developed economies have come into focus this year amid the crisis threatening Greece and other members of the eurozone periphery .
The fact that German Bunds have outperformed both Treasuries and gilts in recent months highlights this increasing worry over public debt .
Germany ’s budget deficit is much lower than the US and UK and inflation there is also expected to remain low .

PARIS , March 23 , 2010  --
For centuries , picturesque Pont - Saint - Esprit was a charming little village in the south of France where not much would happen .
Perched on the banks of the Rhone River , its villagers would go about their daily routine .
The farmers would work in the fields while housewives would stroll around the traditional village market looking for local produce .
To some Americans , Pont - Saint - Esprit may be known as the birthplace of Michel Bouvier , a cabinetmaker , who was the great - grandfather of John Vernou Bouvier III , father of former U.S. first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis .
But on the morning of Aug. 16 , 1951 , the tranquility of Pont Saint Esprit was dramatically disturbed .
Madness invaded the town streets , as some of the inhabitants were struck by a mystery illness .
Scenes of mass insanity and hallucinations followed for days .
" People were starting to hit each other , people were insulting one another , people were screaming .
It was very serious , " Paul Pages , who was 26 years old at the time , told ABC News .
" There was a young guy who jumped out of a hospital window after screaming ' Look , I 'm a dragonfly ' .
He broke both of his legs , " Pages remembered .
" The postman was also seen zigzagging on his bike .
He eventually fell .
He had lost his reason . "
Seven people died and several dozen were sent to psychiatric hospitals .
Hundreds of others were also affected to varying degrees by this mystery illness .
All the victims had one thing in common : they had eaten bread sold in the boulangerie of Roch Briand who was considered the best baker in the village .
Briand was blamed for using contaminated rye flour .
According to investigators , the flour had been contaminated by a fungus that was almost identical to the synthetic version of the hallucinogenic drug LSD .
This theory was later disproved .
Investigators also ruled out mercury as a possible cause of the insanity that hit the town .
After many inquiries and court cases , the obscure case was never fully explained .
Roch Briand was cleared of any wrongdoing , but the baker ended his life penniless and disgraced .
Claims of a CIA Experiment With LSD Still Haunts French Village
Today , 59 years after the event , an American journalist thinks he can shed some light on this strange episode in the life of this charming little village .
In his book " A Terrible Mistake , " Hank Albarelli claims it was the CIA which plunged Pont - Saint - Esprit into madness as the American agency secretly tested the effects of a hallucinogenic drug , possibly LSD , on its population .
The book , which came out in the U.S. three months ago , is a 12 - year - long research by the author on the murder in 1953 of Frank Olson , an Army biochemist working on the CIA 's secret Cold War mind - control experiments .
" When researching my book , I came across numerous references to Pont - Saint - Esprit .
There were references in CIA documents and even White House documents .
And after thorough research , I discovered that the village was the target of a CIA experiment and that it was also part of the motive as to why Frank Olson was murdered , " Albarelli told ABC News .
" Olson wanted out , he wanted to sever his employment with the army and the CIA .
And he started to open his mouth a bit too much .
One of the experiments he talked about was Pont - Saint - Esprit and the fact that he had participated in the experiment , " he said .
" The CIA was trying to use hallucinogenic drugs and LSD as an offensive weapon at that time .
There had been reports written by the Army in 1949 specifically recommending the use of LSD and recommending that field experiments be engaged as quickly as possible , " he said .
The Rockefeller Commission investigating the activities of the CIA and other intelligence agencies within the U.S. issued in June 1975 a report stating , " In the late 1940 's , the CIA began to study the properties of certain behavior - influencing drugs ( such as LSD ) and how such drugs might be put to intelligence use .
This interest was prompted by reports that the Soviet Union was experimenting with such drugs and by speculation that the confessions introduced during trials in the Soviet Union and other Soviet Bloc countries during the late 1940 's might have been elicited by the use of drugs or hypnosis .
Great concern over Soviet and North Korean techniques in ' brainwashing ' continued to be manifested into the early 1950's . "
According to Albarelli , the operation in Pont - Saint - Esprit was called Operation Span , " a vague allusion to ' bridge , " he said .
Pont in the French word for bridge .
The " Pain Maudit , " or Cursed Bread Incident
One of the declassified documents obtained by Albarelli mentioned a dinner conversation in New York between an agent of the CIA and a scientist of the Swiss Sandoz lab .
Sandoz was where Albert Hoffman , a chemist who discovered the effect of LSD in the 1940s , worked .
" The two page document said that after dinner , the scientist started talking about Pont - Saint - Esprit .
He knew it was not the ergot ( that was the cause of the illness ) .
He knew the real secret of Pont - Saint - Esprit and that it was an experiment , " Albarelli said .
" More troubling , immediately after the events in Pont - Saint - Esprit took place , the scientists that came to investigate the incident came from the Sandoz chemical company .
They studied the situation for three or four weeks and they came up with the explanation that it was ergot poisoning , which would be later disproved .
But what they did not tell anybody in 1951 was that the Sandoz chemical company was selling and providing the U.S. army and the CIA with LSD for its research purposes , " Albarelli said .
Today , Pont - Saint - Esprit continues to be haunted by the apocalyptic scenes of that August 1951 .
Despite the latest revelations , the absolute truth about the " pain maudit , " or cursed bread incident as it was called , may never be known for sure .
" The village elders like myself all agree to say that we will never know exactly what happened in August 1951 in Pont - Saint - Esprit .
But it is disturbing if the CIA is involved , " Paul Pages concluded .

" It 's a pretty catchy song , but if you hear it too many times it can get annoying .
I can understand that for sure . "
-- Blackhawks forward Troy Brouwer
--
It does n't take long after a Blackhawks goal for the frenzy to begin .
A lamp flashes behind the net inside United Center .
A horn loud enough to rattle your teeth blares from the hanging scoreboard .
An infectious drum beat begins .
Then feet start moving , hands clap , thousands of red towels wave and there 's enough rear - end shaking to make Shakira jealous .
Soon , a crowd of more than 20,000 delirious
Hawks fans become engrossed in the " Do , do , do ... do , do , do ... " chorus of a song called " Chelsea Dagger .
"
It 's sung by the Fratellis , a relatively obscure Scottish band whose popular song also gained fame for being used in a beer commercial .
It 's now become synonymous with the Blackhawks -- to the point where people in Chicago subconsciously hum the tune , players know the lyrics and even the city 's piano bars are getting requests for it .
It may also be the most polarizing ditty in professional sports -- fraying the nerves of opposing players and fans while making Chicagoans absolutely giddy .
" It 's always a good feeling to hear it , because that means we 're scoring goals , " said Hawks forward Troy Brouwer , who was personally the cause of " Do , do , doing , " twice in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final against the Philadelphia Flyers .
" It 's a pretty catchy song , but if you hear it too many times it can get annoying .
I can understand that for sure .
" The Vancouver Canucks can , too .
The Hawks ' bitter rival in the Western Conference heard the goal song played seven times in a series - deciding loss to Chicago in the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs , and were in no mood to hear it much more during this postseason .
Before the series , which the Hawks won 4 - 2 , television station BC Global even went to the length of taking an iPod into the Canucks ' dressing room to record player reactions to hearing " Chelsea Dagger .
"
The video clip has become popular on YouTube , after eliciting comical responses such as defenseman Kevin Bieksa's .
" Worst song in hockey , " he says , upon recognizing the tune .
" I do n't even want to listen to it anymore .
I was in the press box last game in Chicago , and I heard it six times -- and I was cringing every time .
So we all know about that song in this room -- and we all hate it .
" They 're not alone .
Many are watching the Cup Final on national television and just now getting exposed to a subdued - sounding version .
In turn , Internet message boards are filling up with those who ardently dislike the Hawks ' celebration jingle .
The bad news for them is that it 's going to stick around for a while .
" That song has become the goal song for the Chicago Blackhawks , " said Dave Knickerbocker , the Blackhawks ' senior executive director of marketing and business development .
" Our fans really enjoy it and there are no plans to change it anytime soon . " Knickerbocker , who came to the Hawks from the Chicago Cubs in February 2009 , said the team was using " Chelsea Dagger " occasionally before he joined the organization -- but they were also using select songs for individual players .
When Jonathan Toews scored , they played " Johnny B Goode . "
When Patrick Kane scored , it was " Rock me like a Hurricane . "
Patrick Sharp goals led to ZZ Top 's " Sharp Dressed Man .
" Then the 2009 playoffs started -- and the sound of the Fratellis took over full - time .
" It was a collaboration between a lot of people in the marketing department , " Knickerbocker said , when asked whose idea it was to use it .
" There had been a whole lot of trial and error trying to find a signature song , and then we noticed the crowd really enjoyed celebrating whenever we played ( ‘ Chelsea Dagger ' ) after goals .
" The rest is " do , do , doing " history .
"
We 're all very pleased with the results , " Knickerbocker said .
" Anytime somebody in the front office hears it , they usually start humming it under their breath .
It reminds you of something great that has happened for the Blackhawks .
I find myself doing the same thing .
" Occasionally ,
Hawks players on the bench do , too .
" I think it 's just stuck in our heads , " center Dave Bolland said after Game 1 , when he lit the lamp and found himself singing along .
" I know the whole song by heart by now .
" Teammate Adam Burish does , too , but is n't quite as apt to " do , do , do , " along with the Fratellis .
At least , not when it 's getting as much play time as it did in the Hawks ' 6 - 5 Game 1 win .
" That 's too many goals , " Burish said .
" I was even sick of that song .
I was tired of it .
That was a lot to take .
" The Flyers would probably agree after hearing it more than they 'd care to remember on this trip to the Windy City .
If the Hawks ultimately win the Cup , the Flyers will probably understand how Vancouver star center Henrik Sedin feels .
On the aforementioned YouTube clip , Sedin hears the music , then the , " Do , do , do ... do , do , do , " and just shakes his head .
He pulls the headphones off , and his response says it all about the power of " Chelsea Dagger . " " Bad memories , " he says , backing away from the camera crew .
" Bad memories ... bad memories . "
Dear Home Secretary Resignation from Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs [ ACMD ]
With regret and sadness , I am tendering my resignation as a member of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
I was honoured to be appointed to this position and I had hoped that my substantial experience of managing drug prevention and treatment services might help influence the committee , and thereby the government , to think about drugs as more of a public health issue rather than focussing narrowly on the criminal justice aspects .
This has not been the case .
My main interest and competence is in the field of prevention and early intervention with young people .
I have grown increasingly disillusioned not only with the lack of attention paid to this by politicians and the media but also by the ACMD 's apparent lack of interest in the subject ( with a few individual exceptions ) .
At our meeting earlier this week , the update report on Pathways to Problems , published on the same day , received scant attention .
Indeed , there was no time for questions on the report due to the haste with which we were being pushed to make a decision about classifying Mephedrone ; this so that the chair could come to meet with you later in the day and you could do a round of press announcements .
Re : Mephedrone ; we had little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people 's behaviour .
Our decision was unduly based on media and political pressure .
The report was tabled to the whole council for the first time on Monday ; the chair came to brief you before the whole council had even discussed all of the report .
In fact , I still have n't seen the final version .
When , as home secretary , [ Charles Clarke ] announced that the entire classification system would be reviewed , I welcomed it and was disappointed when the idea was shelved .
This needs urgently to be revisited .
We need to review our entire approach to drugs , dumping the idea that legally sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country 's drug problems .
We need to stop harming people who need help and support .
At the end of last year , I decided not to resign over the sacking of David Nutt , preferring instead to see how things panned out and to hope that the ACMD could develop a work programme which would help prevent and reduce harm , particularly to young people .
I have no confidence that this will now happen , largely though not totally due to the lack of logic of the context within which the council is constrained to operate by the Misuse of Drugs Act .
As well as being extremely unhappy with how the ACMD operates , I am not prepared to continue to be part of a body which , as its main activity , works to facilitate the potential criminalisation of increasing numbers of young people .
Yours sincerely , Eric Carlin

Italian police reportedly unearthed hidden dossiers on ' enemies ' during a raid on Church of Scientology offices in Turin .
The files , apparently discovered behind locked doors in a basement office , allegedly contained personal information on judges , police officers and journalists identified as hostile to the Church .
Details on former Church members who have turned against Scientology were also reportedly recovered from handwritten files and computer records seized following a nine - hour search of the premises .
No arrests took place , UPI adds .
The bust was reportedly authorised by local magistrates over concerns the local chapter of Scientology was holding sensitive personal data ( including information on health and sexual orientation ) in violation of Italy 's privacy laws , the Daily Telegraph reports .
Elsewhere the Church has denied claims in Australia that senior members covered up the alleged sexual abuse of an 11 - year - old girl .
Former Scientologist Carmen Rainer told ABC's Lateline programme that church officials persuaded her and her mum to lie to the authorities about alleged sexual abuse by her stepfather , Robert Kerr .
Church of Scientology officials deny this and say it was only through their involvement in the case that Kerr eventually turned himself in and admitted his crimes . ®

I like to watch the sea ice graphs as much as anyone , and have wondered how much value they have in forecasting the summer minimum .
So I researched it a bit and discovered that their predictive power this early in the melt season is very poor .
The DMI graph below highlights the problem :
http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icecover.uk.php
Note that 2006 had the highest summer minimum , yet was lowest most of the winter and through part of the spring .
The graph below shows the rsquared correlation between relative monthly ranking and September ranking , and indicates poor correlation prior to August 1 .
Conclusion : Prior to August 1 , the graphs tell us just about nothing about how the summer minimum is likely to turn out .
The fact that April , 2010 had the highest extent in the DMI record tells us little or nothing about the summer minimum .
There are too many dependencies on ice thickness and summer weather to make a meaningful prediction based solely on the extent graphs .
NSIDC has used other methods of prediction , and done poorly – such as this forecast of a record low made in May , 2008 .
http://nsidc.org/images/arcticseaicenews/200805_Figure4.png
The Barrow Ice Observatory has studied the relationships between cloud cover and ice breakup date , and found some correlation , seen below .
They believe breakup occurs after the ice has received 700 MJ / m² of solar energy .
A sunny summer means an earlier breakup date .
A cloudy summer means the ice will break up later .
The three earliest breakup years occurred in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 .
The last two years were among the latest .
It is also interesting to note how dirty the snow and ice is around Barrow .
No doubt this is a contributing factor .

Although he does n't know it , a green turtle named " Bond " is bringing scientists along on his hidden travels in the Gulf of Mexico .
Last August , Bond was tagged with a satellite transmitter and other tracking devices .
Now that he 's back in the waters around Dry Tortugas National Park , 70 miles ( 113 kilometers ) west of Key West , Fla. , he 's updating scientists by the day on his whereabouts .
Marine biologists are following Bond and 27 other tagged sea turtles to learn how to protect these threatened and endangered species .
The sea turtles — green turtles , loggerheads and hawksbills — may spend the majority of their lives away from the federally - protected beaches of Dry Tortugas and away from the eyes of scientists .
Tracking the turtles will reveal where they spend their days so that habitat managers can protect these areas .

" When they 're on land we only get such a brief period with them , and then we do n't get to see them for the rest of their lives , " said research ecologist Kristen Hart of the U.S. Geological Survey .
Hart said she and her colleagues are watching the sea turtles as if they were following their own children .
Rodeo - tagging
Following the turtles requires tagging them with monitors , but attaching a tag to a sea turtle is harder than it sounds .
One page from the researchers ' playbook is called the " rodeo - capture . "
Aboard the 22 - foot - ( 7 - meter - ) long whaler boat Caretta caretta ( the loggerhead 's Latin name ) , researchers lean over the ship 's edge , holding only a post for balance , and scout for turtles .
" You have to have your eyes on the water at all times , " Hart said .
The ship will coast alongside the left side of a turtle , which may be swimming at 5 mph ( 8 kph ) .
When the turtle comes up for air , two divers decked out in snorkels and gloves plunge into the water .
They grab the turtle and point the head skyward .
Two of the stronger scientists on the boat then lift the turtle , which can weigh up to 400 pounds ( 181 kilograms ) , onto a foam pad on the boat 's deck .
The research team then takes measurements and blood samples , affixes tags and sends the creatures back on their way .
[ See how the scientists tag the turtles . ]
To track it , a $ 1,350 - dollar satellite transmitter is glued to the turtle 's shell .
The tags are no more than 5 percent of a turtle 's body weight , so they do n't know they are there .
How long the tags last varies depending on where the turtles go and what they do .
Rubbing against reefs and rocks can dislodge a tag .
Barnacles can grow on the antenna and disrupt data transmission .
However , one turtle named Bertha — the first turtle that Hart tagged on this project — has been transmitting data for 760 days thanks to new battery - saving technology .
Typically the tags would fall off after a year as the battery dies .
Travel tracking
Researchers have mapped the turtles ' movements to see where they spend their days between nesting seasons .
Sea turtles may lollygag on land , but they are quite adventurous underwater .
The rambling sea turtle Bertha left East Key beach in the Dry Tortugas in May of 2008 and traveled all the way to the Bahamas , where she was last spotted in late June 2010 .
Hart tracked one turtle to Cuba , and saw evidence that it was harvested by fishermen , which often happens when sea turtles get snared in fishing lines .
If the research team can find an area that sea turtles hang out in , and also nest , then this place might be a real hot spot where human activity should be limited , Hart said .
" We 're not trying to exclude fishermen but there are restrictions that make sense to afford them additional protection , " Hart said .

The word , Dianetics , apparently translates to " through mind . "
Hubbard wrote : " mental and psychometric physical problems are caused by traumatic recordings that are stored in the reactive mind . "
The goal of Dianetics is to eradicate these traumatic recordings and reach a state of " Clear . "
Reaching " Clear " also allows the individual to realize their full potential and , in effect , control MEST ( Matter , Energy , Space and Time ) .
Unsurprisingly , Dianetics , its thoughts and practices have come under much scrutiny from the scientific community and has been dubbed " pseudoscience . "
Pseudoscience lacks plausibility and does not adhere to scientific method .

He then continues to state that it [ Scientology ] " uses Dianetics to lure raw meat ( non-Scientologists ) into its thought control machine . "
Kaufman has a certain amount of clout when discussing the religion , being that he was once a member .
When speaking out against Scientology , he has ( like so many others ) encountered the full wrath of Scientology 's power .
His live shows were canceled at a moment 's notice , and his publisher was destroyed by a hate campaign of theft , forgery and pen letters .
The most extreme action against a critic involved an eight - month lawsuit and various attempts to see the lady put in a mental institution .
Scientologists claimed that the alleged made bomb threats against the Church of Scientology , a claim which resulted in her having to pay out 19,000 USD .
CARACAS , Venezuela —
When giving birth to her daughter , Carolina Vazquez remembers tiptoeing down the corridors of her clinic as she tried to avoid doctors .
Vazquez was determined to give birth naturally and feared she would be coerced into a cesarean .
“ My obstetrician was telling me to hurry up so they would n’t see me , ” she recalled .
“ She was arranging for this or that doctor not to come in that day — I always call my daughter ’s arrival a clandestine birth . ”
Giving birth naturally ( or vaginally ) in Venezuela is becoming increasingly difficult as doctors and women opt for the perceived safety of a c-section .
Cesarean rates in some private clinics are as high as 90 percent , while even in public hospitals almost three in 10 women go under the knife , according to several doctors .
It ’s a worldwide trend that has alarmed some doctors .
A recent World Health Organization report said c-sections have reached “ epidemic proportions ” in many countries .
For Vazquez , the experience inspired her to set up Aquamater , one of just two clinics in Caracas dedicated to offering women the option of a natural labor .
The clinic provides all the equipment and expertise for a woman to give birth exactly as she wants , including a birthing bath and facilitators to assist during labor .
But there is also an operating room available in case an emergency cesarean is required , she stressed .
Vazquez is determined to fight the prevailing culture for cesareans in Venezuela .
Yet since she set up the clinic more than a decade ago , the cesarean rate in Venezuela has climbed .
Dr. Saul Kizer , an obstetrician at La Arboleda clinic in central Caracas , said the rate had increased by 22 percent between 2000 and 2009 in two private clinics he surveyed ( the clinics requested anonymity ) .
Even at Aquamater , the cesarean rate rose to 45 percent since the clinic began offering a service that provides cheap rates to teenage mothers , many of whom go because of the lower cost not because they want to give birth naturally .
Vazquez , a psychologist by training , believes the cesarean rate in Venezuela may be party driven by profit margins .
After all , surgery is quicker than labor ( an hour against 10 to 12 hours ) , pays up to 50 percent more and doctors can schedule deliveries into regular working hours .
That has prompted a kind of strong - arming by doctors who coerce worried mothers into surgery , said Vazquez .
“ Ignorance makes women easy prisoners of medical manipulation , ” she said .
“ There ’s a deification of medicine here — doctors behave and are treated by patients as demi-gods who know everything . ”
But Kizer says much of the pressure often comes from women and their families .
“ In the last two decades a new term has emerged known as the elective cesarean , ” he said .
“ The woman has no indication of medical , obstetric or fetal problem but she still wants to have a cesarean . ”
As head of obstetrics during the 1980s at the Concepcion Palacios , Caracas ’ largest maternity hospital , Kizer remembers a cesarean delivery rate of about 10 percent of all births .
Public opinion , at least in Venezuela , holds that cesareans are safer and a fear of giving birth vaginally persists .
But a 2005 World Health Organization report carried out in 14 countries in Africa and Latin America found the opposite was true .
A higher cesarean rate was associated with an increase in infant mortality , the report said .
“ These findings demonstrate that high rates of caesarean delivery do not necessarily indicate better perinatal care , and — conversely — may represent harmful practices leading to poor maternal and newborn health outcomes , ” the report concluded .
But even some doctors who advocate natural birth warn about too strong a backlash against cesareans .
“ In reality the cesarean has saved many lives — it ’s not evil , ” said Dr. Rodolfo Gomez , executive director of the International MotherBaby Childbirth Organization .
“ But the cesarean should be reserved for those cases in which the life of the mother or the life of the baby is in danger . ”
The WHO has set a cap on what it believes the healthy worldwide cesarean rate should be , establishing lower and upper limits of 5 and 15 percent .
Yet a trend toward more cesareans is difficult to reverse .
But it ’s a culture that some women are determined to combat .
Xiomara Barreto , a social worker from Macuto , a seaside town near Caracas ’ airport , persuaded the local mayor ’s office to fund a center for natural birth above a state - run clinic .
The center boasts nine bedrooms , a birthing room equipped with a large bath for water births , birthing balls and twelve “ facilitators ” who counsel women through labor much like midwives .
Yet despite the facility 's inauguration in December last year , only two women have given birth there so far because of a dispute over pay between the medical staff and the local mayor ’s office .
Barreto said they were able to give the local women antenatal classes and that some were threatening to give birth on the street if the mayor did not hire staff to man the clinic .
“ The mayor said the doctors would not come because they preferred the pay at private clinics , ” she said .
“ Of course they are going to go somewhere else if you do n’t pay them a decent salary . ”
Part of the center ’s aim is to “ humanize ” labor , she said .
Women in state hospitals are often mistreated , their demands ignored because of staff shortages and a lack of education .
In spite of staffing problems , the center had managed to give women the confidence to demand their rights when they went to give birth at the local hospitals .
“ When women from here go to the hospital the doctors know , ” she said .
" They have realized that our pregnant women have a different attitude . ”
What ’s this about ?
I ’ve been thinking about ways to lay firm , logical foundations for a model of FRP .
Rather than trying to cook up the “ next best thing ” , we should perhaps review what we really want and try to infer what we need .
Unfortunately I ’ve very little time to think about this and I ’ve hardly discussed this .
Hopefully this blog post will give my effort another small push .
Goal
The idea is to define a set of building blocks that allow one to express only systems that satisfy a few basic properties .
Specifically we want systems that do n’t satisfy these properties , to be inexpressible within our model .
It makes sense to start by defining the properties we want to satisfy , and then to try and deduce the most general model that satisfies them and only them .
The basic concept is that of a “ system ” , which we define as a function :
f :: ( T -> A ) -> ( T -> B )
Where T is an ordered , measurable set , usually denoting time .
This is what Conal Elliott called an “ interactive behavior “ , and what is known in Yampa as a “ signal function ” .
I use the term “ system ” because that ’s how this is called in engineering , and I see no reason to invent new names .
Desired properties of systems
Edit : the properties as defined below are not exactly what we want .
See comments for discussion .
So , here are the requirements I ’d like to propose .
Every expressible system must satisfy the following :
Insensitivity :
If two inputs are almost the same ( differ at most at a set of measure zero ) , the output will be ( almost ? ) the same .
Causality : For all t in T , output ( t ) can only depend on input ( t - s ) where s ≥ 0 .
Meaning , for every two inputs x1 , x2 that have the same past , the output for the present is the same .
And to be more precise , for every t , if x1 ( t - s ) = x2 ( t -s ) for almost all s ≥ 0 , the output at t will be the same .
Markovity : Same as ( 2 ) , but with the condition that |s| < ∞ .
In words , the output does not depend on inputs from the infinitely remote past or future .
Finite memory : given the current input ( a single value ) , the current output depends additionally at most on a finite - length binary string ( that may have been computed from past inputs ) .
Time invariance ( optional ) : If x( t ) produces output y( t ) , then x(t – s ) produces output y( t – s ) .
Discussion
The first property means that the system is not overly sensitive .
Integration is one example of a system that satisfies this property : changing the value of a function at finite number of points does not affect the value of its integral .
I do n’t know how to call this – if anyone knows a name for this property , please tell me .
For now I ’ll call it insensitivity .
The second property is causality .
It stems from the physical intuition that we ca n’t know the future , and every value that we ( or our systems , or any other natural thing ) compute at the present , should depend only on inputs from the past ( or at most , the present ) .
Otherwise , we ’d have to wait until the future “ arrives ” to complete the computation .
Causality is one of the properties that are easily violated if we consider a model that allows us to arbitrarily sample our input , one that allows us to actually treat the input as a function of time .
Mathematically , a function is just a mapping and has no rules regarding which part of the domain can be evaluated and when .
So , the first realization from our requirements is that we can’t have signals ( inputs , outputs , etc. ) as directly accessible values in our model , or that they should n’t be modeled as functions .
Yampa ( or in it ’s other name , AFRP ) imposes the no-access rule and does n’t have signals as values that can be passed around .
Instead , they are indirectly manipulated by constructing systems that transform them – a sort of “ wiring up ” .
There ’s a big debate on the pros and cons of an Arrow - based FRP , but I ’ve yet to understand the full consequences .
As for a non-functional description of signals , I have n’t though about it enough to know if there ’s any obviously useful alternative that solves the causality problem .
So in my case , I choose to go the Yampa way – I wo n’t provide any means to access signals directly .
Besides causality , we also want to make sure the system does not depend on the infinitely remote past .
Physical intuition says that we ’ll never be able to know what happened that far back .
This is the defining property of Markov processes ( of any order ) , so I ’ll call this Markovity .
Note that the requirement is defined as going both ways , but our previous demand for causality means that it only has meaning regarding past inputs .
Perhaps the more general formulation ( that includes both past and future ) is redundant , but to me it seems nicer to have it symmetric even though only one direction ( past ) matters in our case .
The fourth property is finite memory , which is physically intuitive .
Especially in the context of computers , we do n’t want our systems to endlessly accumulate information until we run out of memory .
Mathematically , this requirement needs elaboration to be made precise .
The formulation I ’ve given above ( depending on a finite - length binary string ) is simple and describes what I want , but it will require extra work to figure out what implications it has on our systems .
Finally , time invariance can be interpreted as not being able to tell the absolute “ wall clock ” time .
Physically this is true : we do n’t know about any absolute time .
Although in reality engineered systems do in fact evolve over time ( wear and tear , for one ) it is not some intrinsic property of the system that causes this change – rather it is that the entire observable universe serves as inputs to our systems , which can never be fully isolated .
Thus the only thing that should matter for our system ’s output is how the input evolves over time , not the exact position in global time of the input .
We forbid sensitivity to input time shifts .
I noted this requirement as optional because I ’m not sure we really want it as a limitation .
I do have a gut feeling that we do n’t miss out any desirable systems by adding this limitation – please correct me if you have any ideas against this .
What ’s next ?
In this blog post I ’ve identified the five basic properties that we desire in a system .
The next step should be to define a set of operations that can serve as universal building blocks for any system that satisfies the requirements .
Perhaps more importantly , our building blocks should prevent us from accidentally expressing systems that violate the requirements .
I ’ll even say that it ’s ok if a few valid systems are inexpressible ( our “ systems filter ” has false positives ) as long as no violating system is expressible ( no false negatives ) .
I ’m waiting for your comments .
Another high volume campaign spoofing Amazon email receipts that arrive :
Subject : Your Amazon.com Order ( D17-3394363-2558346 )
From : “ Amazon.com ” < digital-no-reply@amazon.com >
Notice that these email arrive from hijacked zombie PC ’s from across the globe and the “ Order ” number in the subject is randomized in an attempt to evade spam filtering .
The message itself is well designed , using actual Amazon graphics , and the Order numbers and purported sales amounts are both randomized as well :
The idea with this spam is to motivate the recipient into following the link in order to investigate ( and presumably cancel ) the order they are sure they did not initiate .
And , they ’re right , they did not place this order from Amazon .
More importantly , the email is not actually from Amazon and the hyperlinks within the email will not take you to Amazon either .
Instead , you ’ll be directed to infected malware sites such as :
townknow.com
idigsolutions.com
holcombewaller.com
delicatesa.com
Some of the links will not specify a document , others use :
doc.html
xxx.html
Note that other domains and link extensions exist , these are just a few examples .
Regardless of the site or the document specified , the site will attempt to install malware onto your personal computer , so we strongly advise against following any such links and instead discarding these emails outright .
Based on the number of our users that are resending these emails to themselves ( even after we block them as spam ) the campaign appears to be very convincing .
If you DO receive a correspondence from Amazon and are not sure if it is part of this campaign or not , the safe action is to delete the email and visit your Amazon.com account directly ( not though links provided in any email ) .
If there really is an open order that you wish to review and / or cancel , you ’ll find it within your Amazon account .

Search crews have not found any sign of a man who jumped from Cincinnati's Brent Spence Bridge to avoid police on Monday night .
The chase and the jump were caught on a video camera mounted in a police cruiser .
Cincinnati police said the man attempted to carjack two cars before fighting with a man at a Speedway station and taking his car , losing his shirt and shoes in the process .
Hold off on the megadoses of antioxidant vitamins like C and E .
A study by researchers at Cedars - Sinai Heart Institute shows that you can overdose on these health aids , and the result could be mutated stem cells that cause cancer .

There 's no cause for alarm if you 're staying within suggested doses of your vitamins or nutritional supplements .
This study looked only at what happens when people take much more than the standard amounts of antioxidants .
Researcher Eduardo Marbán and his colleagues ' stumbled on the antioxidant problem while they were researching tissue engineering for human hearts .
Using stem cells , Marbán and his team are working on a way to grow heart tissue to repair damage caused by heart attacks .
Patients who suffer from damaged hearts undergo two quick procedures : First , the researchers collect a few cells from the patients ' hearts that will be used to grow the replacement tissue ;
Second , the new tissue is injected , with no dangers of rejection since it's grown from the patients ' own body .

According to a release about their project :
Marbán and his team accidentally discovered the danger of excessive antioxidant doses while seeking a way to reduce the genetic abnormalities that occurred naturally when the scientists sought to multiply human cardiac stem cells . . .
In laboratories , stem cells are often grown in a Petri dish culture than is composed of 20 percent oxygen , whereas cells growing inside human tissue are exposed to just 3 to 5 percent oxygen .
But Marbán 's team of researchers became frustrated because the higher concentration of oxygen in lab - grown stem cells resulted in 9 percent of the cells being rejected because of genetic abnormalities .
" We sought to counter that oxidation problem by adding high doses of antioxidants directly to the cells , " Marbán said .
" That 's when we made the serendipitous discovery that there is a danger zone for the cells exposed to antioxidants to develop genetic abnormalities that predispose to cancer . "

This is good to know , but when will we find out the really cool stuff , like whether this project to repair damaged hearts will work ?
Clinical trial results on the heart procedure are expected in early 2011 , so you might have a heart repaired with stem cells as early as 2012 .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. lawmakers warned Turkey on Wednesday that its ties with Washington would suffer if it continued on what they considered an anti-Israel path .
“ There will be a cost if Turkey stays on its present heading of growing closer to Iran and more antagonistic to the state of Israel , ” Representative Mike Pence , the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives , said .
At a news conference , Republicans and Democrats denounced NATO ally Turkey for supporting an aid convoy of ships that recently tried to run the Israeli blockade of Gaza .
The lawmakers also criticized Turkey ’s opposition to a recent U.N. Security Council resolution extending punitive sanctions on Iran for its secretive nuclear program .
The U.N. resolution was strongly backed by Washington , which suspects Iran of trying to develop atomic bombs .
Democratic Representative Eliot Engel called Turkey ’s actions “ disgraceful , ” adding that although Ankara was a member of NATO , it had stopped looking westward .
As for the cost Turkey might pay for its stance , Pence said he was ready to reevaluate his past reluctance to support a congressional resolution denouncing as genocide the World War I -era killings of Armenians by Ottoman forces .
The largely symbolic resolution passed a House committee in March , but amid protests from Ankara , the House Democratic leadership never brought it to the chamber ’s floor for a vote .
The lawmakers said on Wednesday that 126 members of the House of Representatives had signed a letter urging President Obama to oppose international condemnation of Israel over its role in seizing the aid ships last month and forcing them to dock in Israeli ports .
Nine people were killed aboard one vessel , the Turkish - registered Mavi Mara , provoking an international outcry .
Israel says its commandos acted in self - defense .
One pro-Israel lobby group in Washington , J Street , took a different view , suggesting some lawmakers ’ statements about the Gaza flotilla were “ drafted primarily for domestic political consumption ” instead of advancing Middle East peace .
The group ’s president Jeremy Ben - Ami urged U.S. lawmakers to express “ more nuanced views of the situation that might emphasize the urgency of American leadership to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict through two states . ”
07 Juni Der Quatsch mit dem Rentenversicherungsbeitrag : Den Hartz - IV - Empfängern soll jetzt also der bisher nur gekürzte Rentenversicherungsbeitrag ganz gestrichen werden , der aktuell noch bei 40 Euro liegt ( zuvor 70 Euro ) .
Selbst wenn ein 20 - jähriger eine ' Hartz - IV - Karriere ' begönne , hätte er hiermit dann im Alter von 67 Jahren eine garantierte Rente von nicht einmal 50 Euro im Monat mit staatlicher Hilfe erworben ( wer 's genauer als ich berechnen kann , möge dies tun ) .
Der Rest wird ihm durch die ' Stütze ' aufgestockt ( heißt im Alter dann ' Grundsicherung ' ) .
Zur Zeit liegt diese ' Grundsicherung ' bei 347 Euro plus angemessener Miete plus Heizkosten etc. , auf dem Hartz - IV - Satz also .
Mit der Abschaffung des Rentenversicherungsbeitrags würde also bloß ein bisher schon absolut unzureichender Rentenanspruch von geschätzten 50 Euro auf null Euro abgesenkt , die Grundsicherung im Alter aber muss dem Betroffenen auf der anderen Seite entsprechend aufgestockt werden .
Wenn jetzt die Bundesregierung behauptet , mit der Abschaffung des Rentenversicherungsbeitrags würde sie in irgendeiner Form ' Geld sparen ' , dann hat sie , volkswirtschaftlich gesehen , nicht mehr alle Tassen im Schrank .
Es ist ein Linke - Tasche - Rechte - Tasche - Spiel zu Lasten der Kommunen , denn die gesamte Grundsicherung zahlt dann die Gemeinde - und nicht mehr zu einem kleinen Teil auch die Rentenversicherung .
Das ist der ganze Unterschied .
Mein zunehmender Eindruck , wenn ich mir die durchgesickerten Maßnahmen betrachte : Die Regierung spart nicht , sie trickst .
Blökt aber dabei vom " größten Sparpaket aller Zeiten " .

To defend the Euro , the ECB now is committed to throw up to $ 1 trillion at interventions in public and private debt .
What 's next ?
Direct intervention in the stock market ?
Bear in mind when this fails ( which I guarantee you it will but I cannot state the timeframe ) , these clowns will think the reason was they did not throw enough firepower at it .
Step back for a second .
The problems are too much debt , too much government spending , and a massively unbalanced global economy .
None of these actions address any of the fundamental issues .
Short Squeeze Coming
Judging from the action in futures this evening , shorts are going to be forcibly ejected Monday , perhaps for several days .
This will create a huge air pocket underneath .
We saw this action once before , in Fannie Mae and financials .
Flashback Wednesday , July 16 , 2008 : SEC Restricts Shorting 19 Financial Stocks
Big brother has now decided to step in and force the price of all financial stocks up with this SEC short sale order .
So now the SEC is issuing short sale restrictions on financials because Bernanke says it 's important for them to rise .
I have news for Bernanke and the SEC .
This wo n't work .
China had short sale restrictions on and it did not stop the Shanghai index from falling over 50 % .
Insolvency cannot be cured by short sale restrictions and many of those companies are insolvent .
All these short sale restrictions are going to do is create a vacuum .
Once the shorts are driven out these shares will plunge .
And who wants to buy a bond or provide capital knowing or even thinking share prices were artificially inflated .
Flashback Friday , July 18 , 2008 : Short Squeeze In Financials Continues
Fannie Mae is up another 25 % today to $ 13.66 in the wake of Selective Enforcement of Regulation SHO and Bernanke 's statement : " It 's important for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds and stocks to rise so they can keep raising capital and aid the mortgage market . "
This move in financials is going to fail spectacularly once the panic buying ends , but for now the bulls are having a bit of fun .
That short squeeze was the beginning of a violent end .
It is a serious mistake to drive shorts from the market .
Oh , it can work for a while .
In the case of Fannie Mae for a week .
Then what ?
The hubris this weekend by central bankers is nothing short of amazing .
While the timeframe is unknown , these attempts to " defend the Euro " are highly likely to hasten its demise .

Scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology have found that by applying chemicals to manipulate genes in a developing embryo , they 've been able to change the brain of one type of cichlid fish to resemble that of another .
The researchers also discovered differences in the general patterning of the brain very early in development before functional neurons form in a process known as neurogenesis .
This finding is at odds with a well - held theory known as " late equals large . "
The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
In the mid 1990s , the hypothesis called " late equals large " was put forth to explain the way brains evolve across species .
The brain begins as a blank slate .
In early development , the anterior , or front , part of the brain is specified from the posterior , or back , part .
After that , neurogenesis occurs as precursor cells mature to become neurons .
These precursors can replicate endlessly , but once they become functional neurons , replication ends .
The later the switch from precursors to mature neurons , the larger the brain , or brain region , becomes .
The " late equals large " model holds that the brains of different species , for example humans vs. mice , are similar early in development and differ because of the later process of neurogenesis .
" We found differences in the general patterning of the brain as early as 48 hours after fertilization , before neurogenesis begins , " said J. Todd Streelman , associate professor in Georgia Tech 's School of Biology .
Streelman , Ph.D. student Jonathan Sylvester , and their colleagues studied brain development in six species of cichlid from Lake Malawi stock , three species from the rock - dwelling lineage and three species of their sand - dwelling cousins .
" We repeated our tests from two to four days after fertilization and found that sand - dwelling cichlids exhibited a larger expression domain of the gene wnt1 , known to be an important factor in the development of the posterior brain .
This correlates with a larger thalamus , a posterior forebrain structure used in the processing of vision , " said Sylvester .

The sand - dwelling cichlids use their vision to detect plankton prey , so their brains are heavily devoted to integrating visual signals .
However , the rock - dwelling species feed by scraping algae from rocks and possess larger cerebra , or telencephala , perhaps to aid in navigating their complex 3D environments .
" The genomes of these species are very similar , " said Streelman , " almost as similar as those of any two humans , and yet their brains vary as much as some mammal groups , one from each other . "
Most of the data supporting the " late equals large " hypothesis has n't been drawn from species that are as closely related as these cichlids , added Streelman .
" Among primates , for example , most of the links between species have been severed long ago .
So , it is difficult to study developmental patterning because subtle differences are often confounded by large differences in brain size , " said Streelman .
In another part of the study , the team wanted to see if they could use chemicals to change the patterns of gene expression and hence the brain development of the embryos .
Could they , in fact , alter the brain of a rock - dwelling embryo to that of a sand - dwelling embryo ?
Turns out they could .
Sylvester treated the embryos with lithium chloride for three to five hours during an early stage of anterior - posterior patterning .
After treatment , he returned the embryos to fish water and then took samples for study at different developmental stages .
He found that each time he checked , treatment with lithium chloride up - regulated Wnt signaling , which led to a reallocation of brain precursors to the posterior thalamus .
" Neurogenesis is still a very important process in brain development and evolution , " said Streelman .
" We 've just shown that there are differences in the developmental process much earlier than previously suspected and that these changes are also relevant for brain diversity . "
" We 're interested in what these early differences have to say about early behavior , " said Streelman .
" Because if we think in terms of the ' late equals large ' model , it means that early in development , brains do n't differ that much .
But now that we know species possess divergent brains early on , we can begin to assess how early behaviors may differ as well . "
Other members of the team include former Georgia Tech undergradate Constance Rich , current Biology PhD candidate Eddie Loh , former post - doc toral fellow in Streelman 's lab Gareth Fraser and Moira van Staaden from Bowling Green University .
The research was supported by funding from the National Science Foundation , National Institutes of Health and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation .
An extraordinary literary " whodunnit " over the identity of a mystery reviewer who savaged works by some of Britain 's leading academics on the Amazon website has culminated in a top historian admitting that the culprit was , in fact , his wife .
Prof Orlando Figes , 50 , an expert on Russia and professor of history at Birkbeck College , London , made the startling revelation in a statement through lawyers following a week of intrigue , suspicion , legal threats and angry email exchanges over postings on the website 's UK book review pages .
The spat began last week when the Cambridge - based academic , Dr Rachel Polonsky , noticed among the many favourable reviews of her book on Russian culture , Molotov 's Magic Lantern , one condemning her efforts as " dense " , " pretentious " and " the sort of book that makes you wonder why it was ever published " .
It ended on late on Friday evening with the surprise unveiling of Figes 's wife , Dr Stephanie Palmer , a senior law lecturer at Cambridge University , barrister , and member of the top human rights specialists , Blackstone Chambers , as the reviewer calling herself " Historian " , and responsible for several anonymous online attacks on the works of her husband 's rivals .
Indeed , " Historian " , who it transpired also generated a profile on the Amazon website under the username " Orlando - Birkbeck " , had not only rubbished Polonsky 's book , but also other works going back years and including books by Oxford University 's Robert Service , biographer of Lenin , Trotsky and Stalin .
The book on Trotsky was a " dull read " , that on Stalin " disappointing " and his history of communism derided as " rubbish " and " an awful book " .
By contrast , Figes 's 2008 work , The Whisperer , was , according to Historian , a " beautiful and necessary " account of the Soviet system , penned by a man possessed of " superb story - telling skills " with this eulogy ending with the fervent wish : " I hope he writes for ever . "
Nor were Russian experts the only ones targeted .
In 2008 Figes , the Cambridge double - starred first and award - winning son of the feminist writer Eva Figes , lost out on the prestigious and lucrative £ 30,000 Samuel Johnson prize to Kate Summerscale 's book The Suspicions of Mr Whicher .
" Oh dear , what on earth were the judges thinking , " wrote Historian .
" The book is not nearly as good as its many plaudits in the press and book prize judges think . "
Tracing back " Historian 's " entries , Polonsky 's suspicions were raised .
Memories of an earlier spat with Figes , following her own highly critical review in the Times Literary Supplement of his 2002 book Natasha 's Dance , came to mind .
She drew the anonymous " Historian " reviews to the attention of Service , who in turn alerted more than 30 leading historians in Britain and abroad in a furious email .
In it , Service condemned the online reviews as " unpleasant personal attacks in the old Soviet fashion " , adding : " Gorbachev banned anonimki from being used in the USSR as a way of tearing up someone 's reputation .
Now the grubby practice has sprouted up here . "
Though , having been alerted to the problem , Amazon had by now removed the offending reviews , Service continued : " How to expunge the practice and expose the practitioners of malign electronic denunication in countries of free expression is , I think , a matter for debate . "
He attached scanned pages from the Amazon site .
Though not named , Service 's email was also sent to Figes , who went on the offensive on Thursday , responding to all the email 's recipients to protest he was not responsible for the unflattering reviews , which could have been written " by virtually anyone " .
On Friday , he forwarded further emails from Amazon which appeared to show he had no connection with the Orlando - Birkbeck profile .
" Clearly , " he wrote , " that would have been the very last nickname I would have chosen . "
Meanwhile , his lawyer , David Price , was stressing the mystery reviewer could , in fact , be a way of discrediting Figes himself .
But Polonsky , still not satisfied , was by now talking to her own lawyers at the firm Carter Ruck .
Then , suddenly , on Friday evening , everything changed .
" My client 's wife wrote the reviews , " said Price in a statement issued on behalf of Figes .
" My client has only just found out about this , this evening .
Both he and his wife are taking steps to make the position clear . "
Last night , there was no further comment from Figes , and calls to the other figures involved in this unprecedented and remarkable row were not returned .
Steve McKean , from the KwaZulu - Natal Wildlife group , who has been studying the impact of muti , said : “ Our research suggests that killing of vultures for so - called traditional use could render the Cape vulture extinct in some parts of South Africa within half a century .
In the worst case , the Cape vulture could be suffering population collapse within 12 years . ”
The Israel Defense Forces and Civil Administration uprooted 500 Palestinian trees in the village of Nahlin in the Gush Etzion region .
The Palestinians sarcastically said this must be part of the easements the IDF announced hours earlier , but the Civil Administration said an evacuation order was issued to the Palestinians over two months ago for illegally trespassing on the land .
Residents of Nahlin told
Ynet that dozens of soldiers in jeeps and bulldozers raided the village on Monday .
In total , 500 plants , including olive trees , fig trees , prickly pear cactus plants , almond trees and grape vines , some hundreds of years old , were uprooted .
Large plots of land on which sage and za'atar had been planted were also cleared .
The Civil Administration officers used manual and electric saws , as well as bulldozers .
" On the same day the Israelis speak of easements , they carry out a brutal tree massacre , " said Nahlin council head Osama Shkarna , who also serves on the village 's committee for land protection .
" They destroyed 40 dunams ( roughly 10 acres ) , and the land they are talking about is about 2,000 dunams ( 494 acres ) .
We are afraid that they are planning to uproot thousands of trees . "
According to Shkarna , the true purpose behind the uprooting is to connect the settlements of Givot and Beitar Illit in eastern Gush Etzion .
" This is strategic land , and the purpose of the uprooting is to clear the land in order to connect between the two settlements . "
' Land not privately owned '
The Civil Administration said in response , " The land in question is not privately owned by the residents , and therefore , an evacuation order was issued against the site on March 3 , 2010 .
In the past two months , the residents did not submit an objection to the Civil Administration , and the order was therefore executed .
" Claims that the residents of the village and its representatives did not receive the order are baseless , and are an attempt to mislead the public .
Proof of this is that on the same day the order was executed , a lawyer appointed by the residents arrived at the Civil Administration 's offices to file an objection with a copy of the order in his possession .
" The Civil Administration will continue to apply the necessary sensitivity in order to enforce the law on the entire population of Judea and Samaria . "
Shkarna firmly rejected the Civil Administration 's claims that the land in question belongs to the State : " All the residents , including myself , have documents and kushans ( ownership certificates from the Ottoman period ) that attest to our ownership of this land , and to the fact that it is registered under our name at the Tabo ( land registry ) .

An unsmoked Havana cigar owned by Churchill fetched more than £ 2,000
One of the largest collections of Sir Winston Churchill memorabilia , including an unsmoked cigar , has sold for nearly £ 600,000 at auction .
The items were sold by US publishing magnate , Steve Forbes , who amassed them over three decades .
The collection also featured a candid letter from the wartime leader , and a set of his free trade speeches .
Auctioneer Christie 's says the items , being sold in three parts , provided an exceptional insight into the man .
The first sale , of about 150 lots , will be followed by a second in New York in December and a third in London next summer .
Described as " the most important and comprehensive private collection of letters and books related to Winston Churchill ever assembled " , the items realised £ 577,063 in total .
I 'm ashamed of you for writing such a letter .
I return it to you to burn and forget Sir Winston Churchill , Extract of letter , June 1940
Christie 's director of books and manuscripts , Thomas Venning , says one letter from June 1940 dealing with the darkest days of the war gives an unmistakable insight into his character .
He says : " One of his [ Churchill's ] ... former private secretaries has just written to him a letter of pure defeatism , saying , ' We 've done our best .
Now is the moment to make peace terms '...
" It 's just a purely craven letter .
Churchill 's response is magnificent and simple .
He just says , ' I 'm ashamed of you for writing such a letter .
I return it to you to burn and forget . ' "
The letters sold for more than four times their estimate - going to a private UK buyer for £ 34,850 .
In the 1940 letter , Eliot Crawshaw - Williams wrote to Churchill : " I 'm all for winning this war if it can be done ...
" But it does seem to me , and , I know to others , that ' if and when ' an informed view of the situation shows that we 've really not got a practical chance of actual ultimate victory , no questions of prestige should stand in the way of our using our nuisance value while we have one to get the best peace terms possible .
" Otherwise , after losing many lives and much money , we shall merely find ourselves in the position of France - or much worse .
" I hope this does n't sound defeatist ; I 'm not that .
Only realist . "
An unsmoked Havana cigar offered in a box beat its estimate of £ 1,000 - £ 1,500 to fetch £ 2,125 .
The top lot was a collection of Churchill 's free trade speeches , delivered in Manchester or in the House of Commons .
Estimated to fetch £ 20,000 to £ 30,000 , they were bought by a private US collector for £ 39,650 .
The former prime minister 's engagement diary on 30 cards , giving details of his daily activities from September 1939 to June 1945 , were expected to fetch up to £ 120,000 , but it was withdrawn from auction before the sale took place .
Steve Forbes who gathered the collection , is chief executive of Forbes Inc and the grandson of Forbes magazine founder BC Forbes .
He said he was parting with the collection because his family did not share his passion for it .
The boy , dressed in white and thought to be no older than 13 , appeared amid the din of a wedding party in a small southern Afghan village and walked up to within 15 feet of a cluster of tables where everyone was eating .
As he prepared to detonate his suicide bomb vest , the gathering flew into a panic .
“ Everyone immediately tried to escape , ” said Abdullah Jan , a guest at the wedding .
But there was no time .
The boy ’s suicide vest packed with explosives detonated , killing more than 40 people and wounding at least 80 , said Zemarai Khan , a local police chief who was at the wedding and witnessed the attack .
Carried out late Wednesday in a small village in Kandahar province , the attack underscored the vulnerability of Afghan society even as President Hamid Karzai pursues negotiations with Taliban insurgents who have waged war with his government and Western forces for nearly nine years .
The Taliban has scoffed at Karzai ’s peace offer and has carried out a wave of deadly attacks since the Afghan leader convened a national peace conference in Kabul , the capital , last week aimed at establishing a framework for talks with the insurgency .
The bombing of the wedding in the village of Nagahan in the Arghandab district was the deadliest of those attacks .
The bomber , who witnesses said was 12 or 13 , targeted a housing compound where men and young boys were celebrating the wedding , authorities said .
Female guests were in a different area .
The groom was injured but survived , Jan said .
His brother was killed .
Though authorities have not determined why the wedding was targeted , witnesses said the groom and several members of his family were Afghan police officers .
Also , residents of Nagahan have formed a tribal militia to help keep Taliban militants from infiltrating their area .
The Afghan Interior Ministry sent a team of investigators to Nagahan .
Zalmay Ayubi , a spokesman for Kandahar Gov. Tooryalai Wesa , said villagers were supportive of the Afghan government .
The blast drew condemnations from Western officials as well as Karzai , who called it an act by “ merciless people , who target innocent people at social gatherings and simply want to kill as many as they can . ”
Staffan de Mistura , the United Nations ’ special representative for Afghanistan , called the attack an “ outrageous act . ”
“ To specifically target people who were gathering at a moment of happiness to celebrate a wedding shows a total disregard for civilian life , ” he said .
U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization commanders hope to turn the tide against the insurgency by defeating it in Kandahar , the Taliban ’s former headquarters and birthplace .
With thousands of additional U.S. troops in southern Afghanistan or on their way , the United States and its Western allies will try to secure Kandahar while ramping up civilian projects in a bid to strengthen the Afghan government ’s presence in the region and ultimately turn its residents against the rebels .
U.S. commanders have moved away from using the term “ offensive ” to describe their strategy in Kandahar , and are now trying to characterize their efforts in the crucial province as a gradual process that might take longer than initially expected .
Speaking Thursday in Brussels , the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan , U.S. Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , said the campaign to secure Kandahar , originally expected to conclude by August , probably would stretch into the fall .
“ I do think it will happen more slowly than we had originally anticipated , ” McChrystal said .
“ It will take a number of months for this to play out , but I do n’t think that ’s necessarily a bad thing ....
I think it ’s more important that we get it right than we get it fast . ”
The Taliban has been fighting back in the south with a wave of attacks that have included assassinations of Afghan officials and the shooting down of a NATO helicopter this week that killed four U.S. soldiers .
Daud Ahmadi , a spokesman for the Helmand province governor ’s office , said that on Tuesday insurgents in the Sangin district hanged a 7 - year - old boy they had accused of spying for U.S. forces .
Ahmadi said insurgents kidnapped the boy from his home and hanged him from a tree in his village .
Taliban leaders denied that they executed the boy .
The Taliban also denied any involvement in the attack on the wedding .
However , Wesa , the Kandahar governor , said he was convinced that the Taliban was responsible .
“ The Taliban are doing two things at once , ” Wesa said .
“ On one side , they target people who are in favor of the government .
Then , at the same time , they do n’t want people to know their real face . ”

This week the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed the existence of a secret prison facility within the larger Bagram prison complex in Afghanistan .
This followed in - depth reports by the BBC and The New York Times detailing specific allegations of abuse at the facility that some prisoners referred to as the " Black Jail . "
There has been speculation and reporting indicating that the prison was run by the Joint Special Operations Command , the elite of the elite of US special forces .

Today Marc Ambinder has a big scoop over at The Atlantic .
According to defense and administration sources , Ambinder reports , the " classified interrogation facility for high - value detainees " is actually run by the Defense Intelligence Agency ’s Defense Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Center ( DCHC ) .
" They perform interrogations for a sub-unit of Task Force 714 , an elite counter - terrorism brigade , " Ambinder writes .
" Intelligence gleaned from these interrogations has often led to some of the military ’s highest profile captures .
Usually , captives are first detained at one of at least six classified Field Interrogation Sites in Afghanistan , and then dropped off at the DIA facility — and , when the interrogators are finished , transferred to the main prison population at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility . "
The DCHC , according to Ambinder , " has absorbed staff from the the now largely disbanded Strategic Support Branch , which provided CIA - like intelligence services to ground combat units .
The DCHC also performs some of the work that the Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) , which was accused of spying on American political groups , used to do .
Many of the staff , civilian and military , as well as many contractors , previously worked with CIFA . "
Edward L. Glaeser is an economics professor at Harvard .
Jane Jacobs is one of history ’s greatest urban thinkers .
In most areas , Jacobs was a peerless analyst of urban life .
She understood the virtues of busy neighborhoods , the economic opportunity that comes from urban innovation and the value of small firms and industrial diversity .
She even presciently grasped the fact that cities are good for the environment , a point that I have re-emphasized in a past post .
But she was n’t always right .
Her view of city life , expounded most eloquently in her 1961 classic “ The Death and Life of Great American Cities , ” drew heavily on her own experience living in Greenwich Village .
She saw so clearly the very real virtues of moderate densities and older buildings , like those found in the Village , that she became too friendly toward historic preservation and too hostile towards high density levels .
I ’ll address historic preservation next week and focus here on Jacobs ’s unfortunate fear of heights .
Here are some of her own words :
“ It follows , however , that densities can get too high if they reach a point at which , for any reason , they begin to repress diversity instead of to stimulate it .
Precisely this can happen , and it is the main point in considering how high is too high . ”
“ For most districts ….
The ultimate danger mark imposing standardization must be considerably lower ; I should guess , roughly , that it is apt to have at about 200 dwellings to the net acre . ”
Her preferred density level seems to have been about 150 housing units per net acre , which means six - story buildings if units average 1,600 square feet .
Six stories also seems to be the maximum height that people are willing to walk up regularly , which may explain why it is the norm in many older pre-elevator areas .
Now I do n’t have anything against Greenwich Village or six - story buildings , but the perspective of the economist pushes strongly against any attempt to postulate or , far worse , regulate a single perfect density .
Indeed , to anyone who respects consumer sovereignty , there is something a little jarring about Jacobs ’s question : “ What is the proper density for city dwellings ? ”
Why in the world should there be a “ proper density ” ?
A good case can be made that cities succeed by offering a diverse menu of neighborhoods that cater to a wide range of tastes .
Some people love Greenwich Village , and that ’s great , but I was perfectly happy growing up in a 25 - story tower , and I do n’t see anything wrong with that , either .
Jacobs was reacting to the Le Corbusier - inspired public housing passions of the 1950s , when tall structures reflected the passions of planners more than consumer demand .
Jacobs was right to emphasize that shorter neighborhoods also have tremendous virtues .
I ’ve actually tested Jacobs ’s hypothesis that city streets are safer when buildings are shorter and found some evidence , admittedly debatable , supporting her view .
But Manhattan ’s crime levels have fallen dramatically in recent decades , proving that with sufficient policing , safe streets can be perfectly compatible with tall buildings .
Jacobs feared high densities because she thought that they would lead to too little diversity , but there are good reasons to think that she get things backward .
Restricting new construction and keeping buildings artificially low means that housing supply cannot satisfy demand .
The result is high prices and cities that are increasingly affordable only to the prosperous .
The laws of supply and demand are not subject to legislative appeal .
When demand for a place is strong , as it has been in New York since the 1970s , then that place must either build substantially or experience rapidly rising prices .
Yet despite skyrocketing prices , building dramatically slowed in Manhattan between the 1960s and the 1990s .
Even more remarkably , the height of new residential buildings seems to have substantially declined .
This decline in heights does n’t reflect a lack of demand for tall buildings ; the high prices paid for units in Manhattan ’s aeries belie that interpretation .
Market forces pushed for taller structures , but structures got shorter , at least until the Bloomberg years , because of a regulatory environment that made construction increasingly more difficult .
My work with Joseph Gyourko and Raven Saks suggests that perhaps one - half of the cost of a Manhattan condominium can be understood as the price of land - use regulation .
Restricting supply led to higher prices and a city with space only for the rich .
In the 1950s and 1960s , middle - income people , like Jane Jacobs and my parents , could afford Manhattan .
Equivalent families today can’t afford the city , and that ’s a pity .
By contrast , Chicago , with its longstanding pro-construction ethos , remains far more affordable even in prime locations .
If you love cities , then you should want more people to be able to enjoy them , and that means embracing , not eschewing , densities over 200 units per acre .
Certainly I experienced plenty of diversity and street life in the tall , rental building where I grew up .
MongoDB at Etsy
Posted by Dan McKinley on May 19 , 2010
Hi ! Dan McKinley and Wil Stuckey from the Etsy Curation team here .
We ’ll be your hosts for a three - part series about the use of MongoDB here at Etsy .
The Curation Team .
Well , half of it .
( Photo credit : Elizabeth Weinberg . )
In this , the first entry , we ’ll give some background on how and why we use MongoDB , and explain our initial impressions as developers .
In the second post , John Allspaw will talk about how well MongoDB is working out operationally .
And not to build this up excessively or give too much away , but the third post will be a harrowing look inside web operations gone horribly awry , chock full of fear , loathing , and remediation checklists .
The Application
The first project using MongoDB is the new Treasury .
For the unfamiliar , the Treasury is a member - curated browsing tool , originally built as a flash application .
Our team has rewritten it as a modern ajax application in order to solve the scaling issues inherent in the original FMS design .
Etsy homepages are most frequently chosen from the treasuries , and there are quite a few other existing or proposed features that are at least vaguely similar .
So we wanted our backend to be flexible and to make something like a polymorphic , generalized “ list ” object as easy as possible .
It was thinking along those lines that first made us consider using a schemaless database , although we would not currently consider that to be the primary benefit .
Why not use a relational database ?
For us , building a read - heavy social application , this question should really be rephrased as “ why not use MySQL ? ”
This was actually a pretty difficult decision .
MySQL is very well - understood operationally ( especially by the people on our team ) .
Replication in MySQL is pretty easy , and we love replication .
There is absolutely no part of this project that is technically impossible with MySQL or , for that matter , any relational database .
For us , this just came down to development speed .
Ignoring everything else , the following two solutions are roughly equivalent in terms of performance .
Relational Solution Document Store Solution
Use a relational database , with a normalized or semi-normalized schema .
When rendering a response , run a handful of queries and then aggregate the data for the object .
Cache the resultant aggregate object either on a TTL or do invalidation .
Return the cached copy of the aggregate object .
Use a document datastore , and embed sub - objects or child lists within their parents .
When rendering a response , retrieve the document by key and return it .
In our case , the development time saved using a document database is worth the risks .
Caching at many levels is of course still a part of our application , but so far we ’ve not found any reason to cache a single MongoDB document retrieved by primary key in an external cache like memcached , a practice that is currently common for us when we use relational databases .
Why MongoDB ?
The number of databases that could be used for this kind of project have , um , proliferated somewhat recently .
Why would we choose MongoDB over all of the others ?
Well , there were a few characteristics that we knew that we wanted :
The database should be safe to use as the system of record .
In other words , it will not be storing data that is essentially replicated from other locations .
We need the data on disk , backed up , and to have reasonable operational guarantees when there are hardware failures or the process is killed .
This requirement also imposes certain constraints on the database ’s maturity –we had to rule out CouchDB because of the possibility that the storage format would change before it came out of alpha .
The database performance should degrade gracefully when the data volume exceeds available RAM ( this rules out some contenders , such as Tokyo Cabinet ) .
Our tests found MongoDB to be a sweet spot between reliability , speed , and maturity .
But to be clear , this was the picture six months ago when we started prototyping .
The world of document datastores since then has changed significantly even in that time frame .
Today , the choice would probably be more difficult .
And to be perfectly honest , the proximity of 10gen to Etsy ’s Brooklyn headquarters as well as the responsiveness of Eliot and his team to questions was also a factor in our decision .
( In the interest of full disclosure : 10 gen shares investors with Etsy . )
Stay Tuned
In upcoming posts , we ’ll dive deeper into our production experience with MongoDB .
In short , things are going well , but we have learned some lessons the hard way .
Hopefully , we can help you avoid making the same mistakes .
Next time , John Allspaw will talk about MongoDB from the perspective of an operations professional .
See you then !
IE ’s big leap forward ; CSS3 selectors fully supported
In the past few days I ’ve been revising the CSS compatibility table with information about the latest crop of browsers .
There ’s no doubt about it : this is IE9 ’s show .
It just supports nearly everything .
No hassle , no buts .
Besides , CSS3 selectors are now fully supported by all browsers but one .
And that one browser is not IE .
It ’s , curiously , Opera .
IE improvements
Microsoft has finally taken the big leap forward we ’ve been waiting for ever since they announced their decision to restart IE development back in 2005 .
IE9 promises to be an excellent browser .
Its CSS support is now at par with that of the other browsers — although each browser still has its specific areas where it performs less .
But we cannot in good faith say that IE is behind the others any more .
There are only a very few declarations in my test that IE9 does not support .
CSS columns , gradients , text - shadow , resize , and text - stroke are the only ones , and the latter two are WebKit - only .
Even better news : Microsoft ’s filters seem to have just disappeared from IE9 .
It supports normal opacity ; no more filters required .
Also , the gradient filter is gone , leaving IE ( temporarily ? ) not supporting it .
Another golden oldie that got dropped is cursor : hand , the MS proprietary alternative to cursor : pointer .
That ’s not really important in practice ( IE6 already supported both syntaxes ) , but it ’s a powerful symbol of the changes that the IE team has wrought .
With so much excellence around I was almost glad when I found one single bug : IE9 does n’t handle white - space : pre-line right .
This bug will be fixed , though .
It ’s typically a minor point that crops up in a beta and is removed from the final product .
Kangax studied the JavaScript and DOM changes and finds significant improvements .
He also lists quite a few things that still have to be addressed , but those items strike me as fairly minor points , most of which are probably honest oversights .
Test it !
By the way , if you want IE9 to be an excellent browser , do what Kangax and I did and test it .
Then write up the results , and point out bugs or possible improvements .
The IE team needs this feedback , and I know from experience that they do read this kind of posts and try to improve their product .
If you know of another series of tests that somebody has put IE9 through , pleae leave a comment .
CSS3 selectors and Opera
CSS3 selectors are now fully supported by all browsers but Opera .
Not that Opera ’s sins are manifold : there are two bugs the Opera team will have to solve in order to join the fully - compliant browsers :
The mess the browser makes with dynamic nth - child and nth - of - type declarations .
Statically it works fine , but as soon as you add elements with JavaScript Opera goes completely haywire .
This is all the more odd since Opera supports dynamic nth - last - child and nth - last - of - type declarations absolutely fine .
I do n’t understand the difference .
This is all the more odd since Opera supports dynamic nth - last - child and nth - last - of - type declarations absolutely fine .
I do n’t understand the difference .
The : target pseudo - class does not react properly to use of the Back or Forward functionality .
Both are relatively minor issues , although both have been plaguing Opera for ages now .
All other browsers have had similar nth - child problems , but they have been solved fully .
New tests
I already talked about the support for the background module .
There ’s no question here : IE9 has the best support ; Firefox the worst .
I added : nth- last - child ( ) and : nth - last - of - type ( ) and : first - of - type , : last - of - type , and : only - of - type tests , this being the only CSS3 selectors I did not test yet .
All browsers support them fine .
We can also welcome a whole new slew of values for list - style - type .
Binary , lower - and upper - hexadecimal , lower - and upper - norwegian , and octal are now supported by Safari 5 and Chrome 5 .
I ’m not sure if these values are terribly important , but binary lists will look cool on any nerd - type of site .
I also added test pages for border - radius , box - shadow , gradient , text - shadow , and text - stroke .
These properties are more of a mixed bag ; the first two are universally supported ; the last three are not supported by IE9 , while Firefox lacks text - stroke .
All in all this was time well spent .
CSS3 is really coming on strong , and there ’s no more excuse not to try your hand at it .

Washington ( CNN ) -- Sen. Robert Byrd , the 92 - year - old Democrat from West Virginia who is the longest - serving Congress member in history , has been hospitalized in serious condition , his office said Sunday .
Byrd was admitted to a Washington area hospital last week and his condition is " seriously ill , " according to the statement by his office .
Initially thought to be suffering from heat exhaustion and severe dehydration , Byrd was expected to remain in hospital for " not more than a few days , " the statement said .
" However , upon further examination by his doctors , other conditions have developed which has resulted in his condition being described as ' serious , ' " the statement concluded .
West Virginia Gov.
Joe Manchin said in a statement Sunday that he and his wife " are thinking about and praying for Sen .
Byrd and his family . "
" We are truly hopeful that he gets well soon because West Virginians need his leadership in Washington , " the statement said .
" Sen .
Byrd is a true champion for our state . "
Slowed by illness in recent years , Byrd spent six weeks in the hospital in 2009 due to a staph infection .
Last November , he became the longest - serving member of Congress at more than 57 years , surpassing the old record set by Arizona Democrat Carl T. Hayden .
Byrd also is the only person elected to nine full terms in the Senate .
He served six years in the U.S.
House before becoming a senator , and has never lost an election .
Editor 's note : Joshua Rozenberg launched Law in Action , Radio 4's magazine programme about the law , over a quarter of a century ago and now , after 23 years away , he 's back to present the programme again .
In his first programme he covers the changing law about photography in public places - SB .
" You ca n't take pictures of my building , " I was told by the rather insistent woman who identified herself as the building manager .
My producer and I had been following an architectural photographer around the City of London .
The man with the camera had told us what might happen .
First , the private security guards would order us to stop taking photographs from the public footpath - even though they were taking pictures of us on CCTV .
If we refused to stop , they would call the police .
We could then expect to be searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 .
Officers could inspect the pictures recorded on our camera .
Then - unless we really were terrorists - we could carry on taking pictures for as long as we liked .
All this went through my mind as the building manger and a burly security guard tried to shoo us away .
What should we do ?
To begin with , we stood our ground .
The photographer carried on snapping .
I continued holding a large and very visible microphone .
And my loyal producer , wearing headphones , continued recording .
Eventually , the building manager lost patience .
" Call the police , " she ordered the guard standing behind her .
Two thoughts went through my mind .
An audio recording of me being searched under anti-terrorism powers would be a great way to start the new series of Law in Action .
On the other hand , it might just persuade the BBC that I should never present the programme again .
For one thing , we were shortly to interview the Assistant Commissioner of the City Police .
He might be slightly less generous with his time if we had wasted the time of his constables .
And , for another , I have managed to reach the age of 60 without troubling the police over any more than a couple of minor motoring matters .
Did I really want my name linked to anti-terrorist searches on a police computer somewhere ?
I made an excuse and left .
We began Law in Action with the building manager instead .
And the police later assured me that I had n't been breaking the law .

25 - year - old Chen Jinmiao of rural China dreamt of one day owning his own Lamborghini .
But the truth is , it was highly unlikely he would ever be able to afford one .
The lorry driver then undertook an impossibly difficult project - figuring out how to build a replica for considerably less cash .
A year and approximately $ 3,000 later , he achieved his goal .
Via Daily Mail :
" Chen is more than happy with his replica of the famous Italian sports marque - even if its 60 mph top speed is some 150 mph behind the real thing .
Chen , of Binzhou in Hunan province , said : ' I downloaded the drawings from the internet , then bought the materials from the market . '
His bright yellow car even has the original 's signature scissor doors .
But Chen , who has no formal engineering training , has yet to hear whether he will be allowed to drive his ' baby Lambo ' on public roads . "

Last week , GQ magazine released a bucket list of fifty beers to drink before you die .
It was a decent compilation , but a little short on Colorado offerings .
So we decided to come up with our own list of fifty Colorado - made beers to drink before you die .
We have tried every one of these beers ( arranged alphabetically ) -- or trust someone who has .
Now drink in our list -- and then start arguing about how we screwed up !

BP is free to resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after a Louisiana judge overturned Barack Obama 's ban imposed in the wake of the worst environmental disaster in US history .
The company operates at least one of the 33 rigs which have been idle since the moratorium last month , according to industry data .
BP declined to confirm the location of its rigs or whether it intended to resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf .
The ruling could also lead to further legal challenges by the oil industry against the White House 's handling of the crisis .
The government has imposed a nationwide ban on issuing offshore drilling permits which could also come under attack in the courts .
Yesterday , Louisiana - based judge Martin Feldman ruled that the federal government 's six - month blanket moratorium in the Gulf was unjustified because it assumed that all deepwater drilling was as dangerous as BP's .
" An invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in depths of over 500 feet simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs , the local economy , the Gulf region , and the critical present - day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country , " Feldman said in his ruling , according to the Associated Press news agency .
The ruling represents a victory for the oil industry and for state politicians .
Both groups had argued the ban would result in tens of thousands of job losses across Louisiana if it stayed in place .
Lawyers representing the oil services companies , who brought the lawsuit against the US federal government in New Orleans , warned a whole " ecosystem of businesses " was at risk .
The White House said last night it would seek an immediate injunction against the ruling .
" Continuing drilling at these depths without knowing what happened does not make sense , " said spokesman Robert Gibbs .
But Camilo K Salas III , a New Orleans - based attorney , said Obama may privately welcome the decision .
" Now they can say : ' We did what we had to do but the judge overruled us . '
That way they look good for trying to stop the drilling but the economy is not damaged . "
Obama has faced intense domestic criticism for not taking control of the crisis earlier and putting too much trust in BP 's ineffective attempts to tackle the spill .
BP has made recently huge discoveries of oil and gas in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico which require further drilling and development .
In September last year , it announced that the Tiber well , drilled to a depth of more than 3,050 metres ( 10,000 feet ) in the Gulf , making it the world 's deepest exploration well to date , could hold as much as 3bn barrels of oil and gas .
It dwarfs the Macondo prospect , where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling , at 1,500 metres and containing about 50 m barrels .
Oil companies are likely to wait until the outcome of any appeal is known before resuming deepwater drilling .
Asked about whether BP would resume deepwater drilling in the Gulf , a spokesman said : " We have no comment on this case or decision , as we are not a party to the case .
" Most of the fleet of rigs we have under contract are responding to the spill .
We do n't discuss publicly our drilling plans and the disposition of those assets . "
According to the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association , last month BP had in place one operational rig affected by the moratorium .
Officials from the much maligned and now defunct regulator , the MMS , were reported as saying that BP had two in the Gulf .
Shell had the most , at seven , according to the association , while Texas - based Anadarko Petroleum , BP 's partner on the stricken Macondo well , operated three of the 33 affected .
Environmental groups vowed to appeal against yesterday 's ruling .
The Sierra Club , one of the groups which gave testimony in Monday 's hearings , said in a statement : " We have n't even stopped the massive flow of oil yet , let alone begun to respond to the damage it has wrought .
It 's like there 's been a car accident and we 're talking about how to get the vehicle on the road again while the victim is still bleeding . "
Interior secretary Ken Salazar imposed the ban on 27 May , more than a month after the accident took place .
He said that the ban was necessary to allow new safety procedures to be implemented and a thorough investigation of what caused the accident to be carried out .
But Salazar was forced to apologise after officials said that the seven independent experts brought in to peer review their report into safety practices in the Gulf endorsed the moratorium .
The scientists and engineers argue that shutting down drilling – an operation which led to the explosion on BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig – is actually more dangerous than allowing it to continue .

The report , Rural Biomass Energy 2020 in the People 's Republic of China , was prepared by the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) .
If livestock manure and crop stalks were converted into clean fuel , it could provide electricity to 30 million rural people in the PRC who are still dependent on kerosene lamps for lighting , and to millions who rely on firewood and other agricultural wastes to heat their homes and cook their meals .
“ Biomass energy is a sensible renewable energy option for rural areas and it can be cost - effective at community and industrial scales if governments support and effectively guide its development , ” explains Klaus Gerhaeusser of ADB .
Biomass also has “ great potential to make a significant impact on two of the country 's most pressing development challenges : rural poverty and environmental damage . ”
Most biomass support would go to rural households
Of the US $ 60 bn needed , 76 % will be used to help rural household beneficiaries , 4 % for centralised gas plant projects and 20 % for power generation and liquid fuel production .
An additional CNY1.5bn is needed for research , development , demonstration and piloting .
Government and project financing are the two main sources of funding .
While government investment is necessary for projects directly related to farmers , private financing is critical for securing self - sustaining financing cycles and developing the biomass industry , it notes .
A broad partnership is needed to develop the biomass sector to become more sustainable and competitive .
International financial institutions , including ADB , can become a catalyst in helping raise the necessary project financing .
Only 0.4 % of PRC biomass used in renewable energy
Currently , most rural biomass energy comes from small - scale conversion projects .
In 2005 , 12 % of animal waste from household farms was used for energy and only 0.5 % of animal waste from industrial livestock farms , with 0.4 % of the total amount of straw biomass used in renewable energy systems .
The PRC has set a goal for 2020 to produce energy from various waste - based sources , including biogas from animal farms , crop residues , agro- processing , municipal waste and sewage sludge .
It has set a target of 15 % of the country 's energy consumption to come from renewable energy by 2020 .
“ The potential of biomass energy in the PRC is huge , but the barriers to realising this potential are likewise significant and complex , ” adds Gerhaeusser .
Biomass energy is the least developed form of renewable energy in the country due to cost and technological constraints .
“ The PRC Government is giving more attention to renewable energy sources in general - mainly wind , solar and hydro - but the value of biomass resources as an additional renewable energy source has been largely underestimated , ” the report states .
“ Government initiatives to address the urban - rural energy gap with biomass energy projects have been modestly successful at the household level . ”
“ Biomass energy is a sensible renewable energy option and it can be cost - effective if guided effectively by the government , ” it explains .
“ The key barriers preventing the full utilisation of rural biomass resources are comprehensive , ranging from financing , to operational factors , to environmental regulation . ”
“ Technologies that provide commercial biomass energy will only be successful if they are developed according to the proper industry scales , supply chains , and research and development needs , ” it adds .
“ Through this process , new enabling policies , coordinated institutional capacity , and effective investments made today mean PRC ’s rural communities would enjoy cleaner energy , better environment , and higher rural income by 2020 . ”

Albert Einstein : God , Religion & Theology
Explaining Einstein 's understanding of God as the Universe / Reality
A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate , of the manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty - it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude ; in this sense , and in this alone , I am a deeply religious man .
( Albert Einstein )
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it .
( Albert Einstein , 1954 )
I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings .
( Albert Einstein )
Introduction : Pantheist Religion of Albert Einstein
Over ten years I have read many hundreds of great philosophers , but of them all I have special affection for Albert Einstein .
Having now read Albert Einstein's ' Special and General Relativity ' , and ' Ideas and Opinions ' many times , I thought it would be nice to put up a web page that presented his religious ideas in as simple and ordered way as possible .
Albert Einstein was a beautiful man , wise and moral , who lived in difficult times .
I think all people will enjoy the great clarity and wisdom of his ideas , and they will find them very relevant and useful in our modern ( and very disturbed ) world .
As he writes on humanity and true religiousness ;
A human being is part of the whole called by us universe , a part limited in time and space .
We experience ourselves , our thoughts and feelings as something separate from the rest .
A kind of optical delusion of consciousness .
This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty .
The true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self .
We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if humanity is to survive .
( Albert Einstein , 1954 )
The most beautiful and most profound experience is the sensation of the mystical .
It is the sower of all true science .
He to whom this emotion is a stranger , who can no longer wonder and stand rapt in awe , is as good as dead .
To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists , manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their primitive forms - this knowledge , this feeling is at the center of true religiousness .
( Albert Einstein - The Merging of Spirit and Science )
I share the pantheist religion / philosophy of Albert Einstein that All is One and Interconnected ( Nature , God ) , of which we humans are an inseparable part .
Perhaps I am a romantic , but it is my hope that in the future Humanity will live by the truth , with greater harmony between different people , their religions and cultures , and to life in all its complex beauty .
Albert Einstein's ideas on Physics and Reality are also significant .
It was from reading Einstein that I first realised that matter was not made of tiny ' particles ' .
And having also read Lorentz ( whose work is founded on Absolute Space ) I realised that a slight modification of Einstein 's relativity solved many of the problems of modern physics .
Einstein represented Matter as continuous fields in space - time , which never explained the discrete phenomena of quantum theory .
The solution is simple , to work from real waves in a continuously connected space .
The articles on the side of the page show how the Wave Structure of Matter - by explaining matter 's necessarily interconnected motion in space - solves numerous problems of knowledge found in postmodern Metaphysics , Physics and Philosophy .
Importantly and profoundly , we can now understand our true ' spirituality ' , our connection to ' god ' , by realising that we are really structures of the universe ( as Einstein knew ) , that our discrete and separate ' body ' is a naive real illusion of the senses .
( Go and look at the stars at night and really think about how you exist in the universe , that amazing universe you can see is really what you are - that is why you can see it !
It is a very cool spiritual experience - and it is true ! )
We hope you enjoy the Kindness , Beauty and Truth of Albert Einstein - a most wonderful and wise philosopher / scientist .

Albert Einstein Quotes on Philosophy of Religion , Theology , God
The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion .
It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology .
Covering both the natural and the spiritual , it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity .
Buddhism answers this description .
If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism .
( Albert Einstein )
It was , of course , a lie what you read about my religious convictions , a lie which is being systematically repeated .
I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly .
If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it .
( Albert Einstein , 1954 , The Human Side , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , Princeton University Press )
Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of Nature , and therefore this holds for the action of people .
For this reason , a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer , i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being .
( Albert Einstein , 1936 , The Human Side .
Responding to a child who wrote and asked if scientists pray . )
A man 's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death .
( Albert Einstein , " Religion and Science " , New York Times Magazine , 9 November 1930 )
I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures , or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves .
Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death ; let feeble souls , from fear or absurd egoism , cherish such thoughts .
I am satisfied with the mystery of the eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world , together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion , be it ever so tiny , of the Reason that manifests itself in nature .
( Albert Einstein , The World as I See It )
I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation , whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God , in short , who is but a reflection of human frailty .
Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body , although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms .
( Albert Einstein , Obituary in New York Times , 19 April 1955 )
I believe in Spinoza 's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists , not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings .
( Albert Einstein , responding to Rabbi Herbert Goldstein who had sent Einstein a cablegram bluntly demanding " Do you believe in God ? " Quoted from Victor J. Stenger , Has Science Found God ?
2001 , chapter 3 . )
One strength of the Communist system ... is that it has some of the characteristics of a religion and inspires the emotions of a religion .
( Albert Einstein , Out Of My Later Years , 1950 )
I cannot conceive of a personal God who would directly influence the actions of individuals , or would directly sit in judgment on creatures of his own creation .
I cannot do this in spite of the fact that mechanistic causality has , to a certain extent , been placed in doubt by modern science .
[ He was speaking of Quantum Mechanics and the breaking down of determinism . ]
My religiosity consists in a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit that reveals itself in the little that we , with our weak and transitory understanding , can comprehend of reality .
Morality is of the highest importance -- but for us , not for God .
( Albert Einstein , The Human Side , edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman , Princeton University Press )
If people are good only because they fear punishment , and hope for reward , then we are a sorry lot indeed .
( Albert Einstein )
The idea of a personal God is an anthropological concept which I am unable to take seriously .
( Albert Einstein , Letter to Hoffman and Dukas , 1946 )
The foundation of morality should not be made dependent on myth nor tied to any authority lest doubt about the myth or about the legitimacy of the authority imperil the foundation of sound judgment and action .
( Albert Einstein )
I do not believe in immortality of the individual , and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it .
( Albert Einstein , The Human Side )
I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal God is a childlike one , but I do not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist whose fervor is mostly due to a painful act of liberation from the fetters of religious indoctrination received in youth .
I prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being .
( Albert Einstein )
What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly , and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of " humility . "
This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism .
( Albert Einstein )
The mystical trend of our time , which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so - called Theosophy and Spiritualism , is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion .
Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions , and combinations of sensory impressions , the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning .
( Albert Einstein )
I want to know how God created this world .
I am not interested in this or that phenomenon , in the spectrum of this or that element .
I want to know his thoughts .
The rest are details .
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , 2000 p.202 )
It is very difficult to elucidate this [ cosmic religious ] feeling to anyone who is entirely without it .
. .
The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling , which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man 's image ; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it ...
In my view , it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it .
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , p. 207 )
I see a pattern , but my imagination cannot picture the maker of that pattern .
I see a clock , but I cannot envision the clockmaker .
The human mind is unable to conceive of the four dimensions , so how can it conceive of a God , before whom a thousand years and a thousand dimensions are as one ?
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , 2000 p. 208 )
We know nothing about [ God , the world ] at all .
All our knowledge is but the knowledge of schoolchildren .
Possibly we shall know a little more than we do now .
but the real nature of things , that we shall never know , never .
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , Page 208 )
Geoff -
I think Einstein is referring to the limitations of mathematical physics and his failed attempt of a continuous field theory of matter ( i.e. mathematics does not describe reality , only its quantities ) .
However , with a wave structure of matter in space we have further knowledge that Space is a substance with properties of a wave medium .
But we are still imagining space based upon our own limited minds and imagination , so in a sense the solution is always incomplete .
Then there are the fanatical atheists whose intolerance is the same as that of the religious fanatics , and it springs from the same source . . .
They are creatures who can't hear the music of the spheres .
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , 2000 p. 214 )
Geoff -
It is interesting that Einstein refers to the ' music of the spheres ' , a perfect description of the the spherical standing wave structure of matter in Space !
In the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I , with my limited human mind , am able to recognise , there are yet people who say there is no God .
But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support for such views .
( The Expanded Quotable Einstein , Princeton University Press , p. 214 )
What separates me from most so - called atheists is a feeling of utter humility toward the unattainable secrets of the harmony of the cosmos .
( Albert Einstein to Joseph Lewis , Apr. 18 , 1953 )
When the answer is simple , God is speaking .
( Albert Einstein )
Albert Einstein on Science vs Religion
Einstein observed that specialization is invariably damaging to Science as a whole ;
The area of scientific knowledge has been enormously extended , and theoretical knowledge has become vastly more profound in every department of science .
But the assimilative power of the human intellect is and remains strictly limited .
Hence it was inevitable that the activity of the individual investigator should be confined to a smaller and smaller section of human knowledge .
Worse still , this specialization makes it increasingly difficult to keep even our general understanding of science as a whole , without which the true spirit of research is inevitably handicapped , in step with scientific progress .
Every serious scientific worker is painfully conscious of this involuntary relegation to an ever - narrowing sphere of knowledge , which threatens to deprive the investigator of his broad horizon and degrades him to the level of a mechanic ...
It is just as important to make knowledge live and to keep it alive as to solve specific problems .
( Albert Einstein , 1954 )
The individual feels the futility of human desires and aims and the sublimity and marvelous order which reveal themselves both in nature and in the world of thought .
Individual existence impresses him as a sort of prison and he wants to experience the universe as a single significant whole .
The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development , e.g. , in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets .
Buddhism , as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer , contains a much stronger element of this .
( Albert Einstein , 1930 )
The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion .
It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology .
Covering both the natural and the spiritual , it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity .
Buddhism answers this description ..
If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism .
( Albert Einstein )
In my view , it is the most important function of art and science to awaken this religious feeling and keep it alive in those who are receptive to it .
( Albert Einstein , 1930 )
Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality , but the charge is unjust .
A man 's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy , education , and social ties and needs ; no religious basis is necessary .
Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death .
( Albert Einstein , 1930 )
There is nothing divine about morality ; it is a purely human affair .
( Albert Einstein , 1934 )
For the scientific method can teach us nothing else beyond how facts are related to , and conditioned by , each other .
The aspiration toward such objective knowledge belongs to the highest of which man is capable , and you will certainly not suspect me of wishing to belittle the achievements and the heroic efforts of man in this sphere .
Yet is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be .
One can have the clearest and most complete knowledge of what is , and yet not be able to deduct from that what should be the goal of our human aspirations .
Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievements of certain ends , but the ultimate goal itself and the longing to reach it must come from another source .
And it is hardly necessary to argue for the view that our existence and our activity acquire meaning only by the setting up of such a goal and of corresponding values .
( Albert Einstein , 1939 )
To make clear these fundamental ends and valuations , and to set them fast in the emotional life of the individual , seems to me precisely the most important function which religion has to perform in the social life of man .
And if one asks whence derives the authority of such fundamental ends , since they cannot be stated and justified merely by reason , one can only answer : they exist in a healthy society as powerful traditions , which act upon the conduct and aspirations and judgments of the individuals ; they are there , that is , as something living , without its being necessary to find justification for their existence .
( Albert Einstein , 1939 )
.. free and responsible development of the individual , so that he may place his powers freely and gladly in the service of all mankind .
There is no room in this for the divinization of a nation , of a class , let alone of an individual .
Are we not all children of one father , as it is said in religious language ?
( Albert Einstein , 1939 )
If one holds these high principles clearly before one 's eyes , and compares them with the life and spirit of our times , then it appears glaringly that civilized mankind finds itself at present in grave danger .
In the totalitarian states it is the rulers themselves who strive actually to destroy that spirit of humanity .
In less threatened parts it is nationalism and intolerance , as well as the oppression of the individuals by economic means , which threaten to choke these most precious traditions .
( Einstein , 1954 . p43 -4 )
But if the longing for the achievement of the goal is powerfully alive within us , then shall we not lack the strength to find the means for reaching the goal and for translating it into deeds .
( Albert Einstein , 1939 )
For science can only ascertain what is , but not what should be , and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary .
Religion , on the other hand , deals only with evaluations of human thought and action : it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts .
According to this interpretation the well - known conflicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described .
For example , a conflict arises when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible .
This means an intervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science ; this is where the struggle of the Church against doctrines of Galileo and Darwin belongs .
On the other hand , representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientific method , and in this way have set themselves in opposition to religion .
These conflicts have all sprung from fatal errors .
( Albert Einstein , 1941 )
But science can only be created by those who are thoroughly imbued with the aspiration toward truth and understanding .
This source of feeling , however , springs from the sphere of religion .
To this there also belongs the faith in the possibility that the regulations valid for the world of existence are rational , that is , comprehensible to reason .
I cannot conceive of a genuine scientist without that profound faith .
The situation may be expressed by an image : science without religion is lame , religion without science is blind .
( Albert Einstein , 1941 )
Though I have asserted above that in truth a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist , I must nevertheless qualify this assertion once again on an essential point , with reference to the actual content of historical religions .
This qualification has to do with the concept of God .
During the youthful period of mankind 's spiritual evolution human fantasy created gods in man 's own image , who , by the operations of their will were supposed to determine , or at any rate to influence , the phenomenal world .
Man sought to alter the disposition of these gods in his own favour by means of magic and prayer .
The idea of God in the religions taught at present is a sublimation of that old concept of the gods .
Its anthropomorphic character is shown , for instance , by the fact that men appeal to the Divine Being in prayers and plead for the fulfillment of their wishes .
Nobody , certainly , will deny that the idea of the existence of an omnipotent , just , and omni beneficent personal God is able to accord man solace , help , and guidance ; also , by virtue of its simplicity it is accessible to the most undeveloped mind .
But , on the other hand , there are decisive weaknesses attached to this idea in itself , which have been painfully felt since the beginning of history .
( Albert Einstein , 1941 )
For a doctrine which is able to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark , will of necessity lose its effect on mankind , with incalculable harm to human progress .
In their struggle for the ethical good , teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God , that is , give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests .
In their labours they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good , the True , and the Beautiful in humanity itself .
This is , to be sure , a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task .
After religious teachers accomplish the refining process indicated they well surely recognise with joy that true religion has been ennobled and made more profound by scientific knowledge .
If it is one of the goals of religion to liberate mankind as far as possible from the bondage of egocentric cravings , desires and fears , scientific reasoning can aid religion in yet another sense .
Although it is true that it is the goal of science to discover rules which permit the association and foretelling of facts , this is not its only aim .
It also seeks to reduce the connections discovered to the smallest possible number of mutually independent conceptual elements .
( Albert Einstein , 1941 )
By way of the understanding he achieves a far - reaching emancipation from the shackles of personal hopes and desires , and thereby attains that humble attitude of mind toward the grandeur of reason incarnate in existence , and which , in its profoundest depths , is inaccessible to man .
This attitude , however , appears to me to be religious , in the highest sense of the word .
And so it seems to me that science not only purifies the religious impulse of the dross of its anthropomorphism but also contributes to a religious spiritualization of our understanding of life .
The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances , the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life , and the fear of death , and blind faith , but through striving after rational knowledge .
( Albert Einstein , 1941 )
Religion and Science : Irreconcilable ?
As to science , we may well define it for our purpose as " methodical thinking directed toward finding regulative connections between our sensual experiences " .
( Albert Einstein , 1948 )
While it is true that science , to the extent of its grasp of causative connections , may reach important conclusions as to the compatibility and incompatibility of goals and evaluations , the independent and fundamental definitions regarding goals and values remain beyond science 's reach .
( Albert Einstein , 1948 )
Religion is concerned with man 's attitude towards nature at large , with the establishing of ideals for the individual and communal life , and with human mutual relationship .
These ideals religion attempts to attain by exerting an educational influence on tradition and through the development and promulgation of certain easily accessible thoughts and narratives ( epics and myths ) which are apt to influence evaluation and action along the lines of accepted ideals .
It is this mythical , or rather symbolic , content of the religious traditions which is likely to come into conflict with science .
This occurs whenever this religious stock of ideas contains dogmatically fixed statements on subjects which belong in the domain of science .
( Albert Einstein , 1948 )
For the moral attitudes of a people that is supported by religion need always aim at preserving and promoting the sanity and vitality of the community and its individuals , since otherwise this community is bound to perish .
A people that were to honour falsehood , defamation , fraud , and murder would be unable , indeed , to subsist for very long .
( Albert Einstein , 1948 )
When considering the actual living conditions of present day civilised humanity from the standpoint of even the most elementary religious commands , one is bound to experience a feeling of deep and painful disappointment at what one sees .
For while religion prescribes brotherly love in the relations among the individuals and groups , the actual spectacle more resembles a battlefield than an orchestra .
Everywhere , in economic as well as in political life , the guiding principle is one of ruthless striving for success at the expense of one 's fellow men .
This competitive spirit prevails even in the school and , destroying all feelings of human fraternity and cooperation , conceives of achievement not as derived from the love for productive and thoughtful work , but as springing from personal ambition and fear of rejection .
There are pessimists who hold that such a state of affairs is necessarily inherent in human nature ; it is those who propound such views that are the enemies of true religion , for they imply thereby that the religious teachings are utopian ideals and are unsuited to afford guidance in human affairs .
( Albert Einstein , 1948 )
Albert Einstein on Jewish Religion
Anti-Semitism and Academic Youth
It is clear also that " serving God " was equated with " serving the living " .
The best of the Jewish people , especially the Prophets and Jesus , contended tirelessly for this .
Judaism is thus no transcendental religion ; it is concerned with life as we live it and as we can , to a certain extent , grasp it , and nothing else .
It seems to me , therefore , doubtful whether it can be called a religion in the accepted sense of the word , particularly as no " faith " but the sanctification of life in a supra-personal sense is demanded of the Jew .
But the Jewish tradition also contains something else , something which finds splendid expression in many of the Psalms , namely , a sort of intoxicated joy and amazement at the beauty and grandeur of this world , of which man can form just a faint notion .
This joy is the feeling from which true scientific research draws its spiritual sustenance , but which also seems to find expression in the song of birds .
To tack this feeling to the idea of God seems mere childish absurdity .
( Albert Einstein , 1934 )
In this case , as in many mental disorders , the cure lies in a clear knowledge of one 's condition and its causes .
We must be conscious of our alien race and draw the logical conclusions from it .
It is no use trying to convince the others of our spiritual and intellectual equality by arguments addressed to the reason , when the attitude of these others does not originate in their intellects at all .
( Albert Einstein , 1934 )

Explaining Einstein 's understanding of God as the Universe / Reality
Help Humanity
" You must be the change you wish to see in the world . "
( Mohandas Gandhi )
" When forced to summarize the general theory of relativity in one sentence : Time and space and gravitation have no separate existence from matter .
...
Physical objects are not in space , but these objects are spatially extended .
In this way the concept ' empty space ' loses its meaning .
...
The particle can only appear as a limited region in space in which the field strength or the energy density are particularly high .
...
The free , unhampered exchange of ideas and scientific conclusions is necessary for the sound development of science , as it is in all spheres of cultural life .
...
We must not conceal from ourselves that no improvement in the present depressing situation is possible without a severe struggle ; for the handful of those who are really determined to do something is minute in comparison with the mass of the lukewarm and the misguided .
...
Humanity is going to need a substantially new way of thinking if it is to survive ! " ( Albert Einstein )
Our world is in great trouble due to human behaviour founded on myths and customs that are causing the destruction of Nature and climate change .
We can now deduce the most simple science theory of reality - the wave structure of matter in space .
By understanding how we and everything around us are interconnected in Space we can then deduce solutions to the fundamental problems of human knowledge in physics , philosophy , metaphysics , theology , education , health , evolution and ecology , politics and society .
This is the profound new way of thinking that Einstein realised , that we exist as spatially extended structures of the universe - the discrete and separate body an illusion .
This simply confirms the intuitions of the ancient philosophers and mystics .
Given the current censorship in physics / philosophy of science journals ( based on the standard model of particle physics / big bang cosmology ) the internet is the best hope for getting new knowledge known to the world .
But that depends on you , the people who care about science and society , realise the importance of truth and reality .
It is Easy to Help !

The AP 's story on Joseph Ratzinger 's direct involvement in delaying for six years the defrocking of a priest who had confessed to tying up and raping minors ends any doubt that the future Pope is as implicated in the sex abuse crisis as much as any other official in the church .
The facts are as clear as they are damning .
From the documents , the priest fits exactly the model of arrested development I sketched out here .
He seems to have been pressured by a bossy mother to become a priest , and was interested only in hanging out with children around the ages of 11 to 13 ( the age of the boys he raped ) .
He had no genuine impulse to ordination , but the church was so desperate for priests he was acceptable .
When confronted with the charges , the priest pleaded no contest to tying up and raping two pre-teen boys in 1978 in the rectory of Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Union City .
There were , apparently , several more victims .
There was no dispute as to his guilt .
The priest , Stephen Kiesle , personally requested he be defrocked .
His legacy is horrifying :
Kiesle , now 63 and recently released from prison , lives in the Rossmoor senior community in Walnut Creek and wears a Global Positioning System anklet .
He is on parole for a different sex crime against a child .
Numerous accusers have said he abused them as children at Our Lady of the Rosary , Santa Paula ( now Our Lady of Guadalupe ) in Fremont and Saint Joseph in Pinole , where he served in the mid-1970s , then returned in 1985 to volunteer as a youth minister .
Yes , this rapist was subsequently allowed back into the parish where he tied up and raped children seven years later as a volunteer youth minister .
Even after his eventual defrocking , in 1987 , he continued to work with children at the parish for another year .
Whose fault was this ?
In this case , it is absolutely clear that his remaining a priest was entirely the fault of the Vatican , and the person directly responsible for the delay in defrocking him was Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict XVI .
Kiesle himself requested he be defrocked .
The local bishop desperately wanted him to be defrocked and petitioned Raztinger first in 1981 that it happen expeditiously .
The bishop , knowing that what the hierarchy cared about was bad press , not the protection and welfare of children , argued that there would be more " scandal " if the priest were kept in ministry than if he were fired :
" It is my conviction that there would be no scandal if this petition were granted and that as a matter of fact , given the nature of the case , there might be greater scandal to the community if Father Kiesle were allowed to return to the active ministry , " Cummins wrote in 1982 .
Despite several appeals from Cummins , Ratzinger 's office delayed any resolution for three years and then proposed more time to process the case because of two things :
This court , although it regards the arguments presented in favor of removal in this case to be of grave significance , nevertheless deems it necessary to consider the good of the Universal Church together with that of the petitioner , and it is also unable to make light of the detriment that granting the dispensation can provoke with the community of Christ 's faithful , particularly regarding the young age of the petitioner .
It is necessary for this Congregation to submit incidents of this sort to very careful consideration , which necessitates a longer period of time .
In the meantime your Excellency must not fail to provide the petitioner with as much paternal care as possible and in addition to explain to same the rationale of this court , which is accustomed to proceed keeping the common good especially before its eyes .
This is signed by Ratzinger himself .
It reveals several key things .
The space agencies for the United States , Russia , Canada , Europe , and Japan are eager to use the International Space Station for expanded scientific experiments , possibly through the year 2028 .
The leaders of these five space agencies met on March 11 , 2010 , in Tokyo , Japan , to discuss their future cooperation and participation on the orbiting science laboratory , the International Space Station .
The March 11 , 2010 NASA media brief ' Heads of agency International Space Station joint statement , ' states , [ the heads of these five space agencies ]
The leaders also stated that , And , The five space agencies participating in these talks are the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) for the United States , The Russian Federal Space Agency ( Roscosmos ) for Russia , the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA ) for Canada , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) for the European Union , and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) for Japan .
Page two continues with the reason why the International Space Station can easily continue operations through 2028 .
During their meeting , the leaders of these five space agencies reiterated that importance of the space station 's potential in the areas of science , engineering , utilization , and education .
With the completion of the ISS almost accomplished ( hopefully in 2010 , or possibly in 2011 ) , the future of the Space Station looks bright .
And , the ability of the structure to remain orbiting the Earth , along with all of its systems operating efficiently and safety , can continue for many years into the future .
The leaders made this statement : ''¦ [ T ] here are no identified technical constraints to continuing ISS operations beyond the current planning horizon of 2015 to at least 2020 , and that the partnership is currently working to certify on - orbit elements through 2028 .'
Although the United States is committed to support the operations onboard the International Space Station through at least 2020 , the five leaders of these space agencies are looking to extend that date for another eight years '” out to 2028 .
Thus , NASA , Roscosmos , CSA , ESA , and JAXA are all looking to enhance the ISS programs in order to assure the ''¦ most effective use of essential capabilities , such as space transportation for crew and cargo , for the life of the program . '
The package came in the mail yesterday .
I was out for the night last night and worked all day today .
It was n't a very good day .
I come home from work , go into my room and see a package sitting on my bed .
I thought to myself , " Finally I 've been waiting for this ! "
I open the package and pull out a book .
" Unitary Representations Of Reductive Lie Groups " I begin to examine the book .
All I can make out is that this is some sort of math book .
I open the cover and start skimming pages , reading bits and pieces .
I run into a twenty dollar bill .
" Oh this is cool " I think to myself and I began to smile a bit .
I skim the book a bit more and find another twenty .
Then another .
And another .
My face at this point is completely blank .
I then realize I am holding in my hands two hundred and sixty dollars .
I begin grinning from ear to ear yelling " Mom ! HOLY SHIT ! HOLY SHIT MOM ! "
I could n't even begin to believe that I had just received that much money from a person I have never even spoken to in my life .
I am still in shock .
There are no clues as to who you are .
The only thing I found was a name in the cover and the city you are from .
Who knows if that name in the cover is even you .
All I can say is thank you and hope you read this .
You turned a horrible day into a fantastic one , and I will never forget this .
Thank you mysterious redditor .
Please , message me if you see this .
KDevelop4 Release Candidate 1
April 8 , 2010 at 7:51 am | Posted in KDevelop | 4 Comments
Finally getting around to blog about this .
We ’ve released RC1 of KDevelop4 today .
We ’ve fixed a couple of bugs and got some good performance improvements , but even more will be in RC2 .
RC2 will also ship with translations , for RC1 we ’ve discovered a severe problem that we could n’t fix anymore in time related to translations .
On behalf of Milian and Niko we ’re also releasing the first release candidate of the PHP plugins , bringing great web development to kdevelop .
The tarballs can be found on all KDE mirrors .
Note that I had to update the php tarballs yesterday .
I forgot to increase the kdevelop plugin version in their desktop files before uploading and hence they would n’t have been loaded with kdev4 rc1 .
To make sure you ’ve got the right ones the md5sums for those two are :

Giant Snake Found in China Scares Man to Death
A photo purporting to show a dead 55 - foot snake has been making the rounds online , accompanied by a story that almost too outrageous to believe .
The photo and story originally appeared in the People ’s Daily , which serves as the official newspaper for the Communist Party in China .
It stated that the snake was one of two that were awakened by local workers digging up huge mounds of earth in preparation for a new road that was to cut through the forest that lay just outside of Gupiing city in the Chinese province of Jiangxi .
While one snake , which was reported to be 55 - feet long and weigh approximately 300 kg , became a casualty of the bulldozers digging , another one , described as a gold boa , appeared supposedly bearing its fangs , causing the workers to flee in terror .
The driver of the bulldozer , however , is said to have been paralyzed with fear .
When the workers returned , he was so sick he could barely move , and eventually died at the hospital , presumably of a heart attack .
Despite the story and the accompanying photo , the local government has deemed it all a hoax , due in part to the distinct lack of native boas in that area .
It was also thought the coelacanth was extinct until one was discovered in 1938 , so to completely dismiss the story as a hoax is to laugh in the face of just how darned scary and unpredictable nature can be .
We ’ve all seen the movie Anaconda .

Why do some men and women cheat on their partners while others resist the temptation ?
To find the answer , a growing body of research is focusing on the science of commitment .
Scientists are studying everything from the biological factors that seem to influence marital stability to a person ’s psychological response after flirting with a stranger .
Their findings suggest that while some people may be naturally more resistant to temptation , men and women can also train themselves to protect their relationships and raise their feelings of commitment .
Recent studies have raised questions about whether genetic factors may influence commitment and marital stability .
Hasse Walum , a biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , studied 552 sets of twins to learn more about a gene related to the body ’s regulation of the brain chemical vasopressin , a bonding hormone .
Over all , men who carried a variation in the gene were less likely to be married , and those who had wed were more likely to have had serious marital problems and unhappy wives .
Among men who carried two copies of the gene variant , about a third had experienced a serious relationship crisis in the past year , double the number seen in the men who did not carry the variant .
Although the trait is often called the “ fidelity gene , ” Mr. Walum called that a misnomer : his research focused on marital stability , not faithfulness .
“ It ’s difficult to use this information to predict any future behavior in men , ” he told me .
Now he and his colleagues are working to replicate the findings and conducting similar research in women .
While there may be genetic differences that influence commitment , other studies suggest that the brain can be trained to resist temptation .
A series of unusual studies led by John Lydon , a psychologist at McGill University in Montreal , have looked at how people in a committed relationship react in the face of temptation .
In one study , highly committed married men and women were asked to rate the attractiveness of people of the opposite sex in a series of photos .
Not surprisingly , they gave the highest ratings to people who would typically be viewed as attractive .
Later , they were shown similar pictures and told that the person was interested in meeting them .
In that situation , participants consistently gave those pictures lower scores than they had the first time around .
When they were attracted to someone who might threaten the relationship , they seemed to instinctively tell themselves , “ He ’s not so great . ”
“ The more committed you are , ” Dr. Lydon said , “ the less attractive you find other people who threaten your relationship . ”
But some of the McGill research has shown gender differences in how we respond to a cheating threat .
In a study of 300 heterosexual men and women , half the participants were primed for cheating by imagining a flirtatious conversation with someone they found attractive .
The other half just imagined a routine encounter .
Afterward , the study subjects were asked to complete fill - in - the - blank puzzles like LO_AL and THR__T .
Unbeknownst to the participants , the word fragments were a psychological test to reveal subconscious feelings about commitment .
( Similar word puzzles are used to study subconscious feelings about prejudice and stereotyping . )
No pattern emerged among the study participants who imagined a routine encounter .
But there were differences among men and women who had entertained the flirtatious fantasy .
In that group , the men were more likely to complete the puzzles with the neutral words LOCAL and THROAT .
But the women who had imagined flirting were far more likely to choose LOYAL and THREAT , suggesting that the exercise had touched off subconscious concerns about commitment .
Of course , this does not necessarily predict behavior in the real world .
But the pronounced difference in responses led the researchers to think women might have developed a kind of early warning system to alert them to relationship threats .
Other McGill studies confirmed differences in how men and women react to such threats .
In one , attractive actors or actresses were brought in to flirt with study participants in a waiting room .
Later , the participants were asked questions about their relationships , particularly how they would respond to a partner ’s bad behavior , like being late and forgetting to call .
Men who had just been flirting were less forgiving of the hypothetical bad behavior , suggesting that the attractive actress had momentarily chipped away at their commitment .
But women who had been flirting were more likely to be forgiving and to make excuses for the man , suggesting that their earlier flirting had triggered a protective response when discussing their relationship .
“ We think the men in these studies may have had commitment , but the women had the contingency plan — the attractive alternative sets off the alarm bell , ” Dr. Lydon said .
“ Women implicitly code that as a threat .
Men do n’t . ”
The question is whether a person can be trained to resist temptation .
In another study , the team prompted male students who were in committed dating relationships to imagine running into an attractive woman on a weekend when their girlfriends were away .
Some of the men were then asked to develop a contingency plan by filling in the sentence “ When she approaches me , I will __________ to protect my relationship . ”
Because the researchers could not bring in a real woman to act as a temptation , they created a virtual - reality game in which two out of four rooms included subliminal images of an attractive woman .
The men who had practiced resisting temptation gravitated toward those rooms 25 percent of the time ; for the others , the figure was 62 percent .
But it may not be feelings of love or loyalty that keep couples together .
Instead , scientists speculate that your level of commitment may depend on how much a partner enhances your life and broadens your horizons — a concept that Arthur Aron , a psychologist and relationship researcher at Stony Brook University , calls “ self - expansion . ”
To measure this quality , couples are asked a series of questions :
How much does your partner provide a source of exciting experiences ?
How much has knowing your partner made you a better person ?
How much do you see your partner as a way to expand your own capabilities ?
The Stony Brook researchers conducted experiments using activities that stimulated self - expansion .
Some couples were given mundane tasks , while others took part in a silly exercise in which they were tied together and asked to crawl on mats , pushing a foam cylinder with their heads .
The study was rigged so the couples failed the time limit on the first two tries , but just barely made it on the third , resulting in much celebration .
Couples were given relationship tests before and after the experiment .
Those who had taken part in the challenging activity posted greater increases in love and relationship satisfaction than those who had not experienced victory together .
Now the researchers are embarking on a series of studies to measure how self - expansion influences a relationship .
They theorize that couples who explore new places and try new things will tap into feelings of self - expansion , lifting their level of commitment .
“ We enter relationships because the other person becomes part of ourselves , and that expands us , ” Dr. Aron said .
“ That ’s why people who fall in love stay up all night talking and it feels really exciting .
We think couples can get some of that back by doing challenging and exciting things together . ”

WASHINGTON —
At a time of heavy international pressure on Iran , the State Department said on Thursday that the human rights situation there had “ degenerated ” since the disputed presidential election last year .
In a toughly worded analysis , the department cited killings of election protesters and acts of politically motivated torture , beatings and rape .
“ An already poor human rights situation rapidly deteriorated after the June elections , ” said Michael Posner , assistant secretary for democracy , human rights , and labor , as the department released its overview of human rights around the world in 2009 .
“ At least 45 people were killed in clashes , ” he said .
The voluminous report , an annual assessment called for by law , also broadly criticized practices in China .
Mr. Posner called them “ poor and worsening . ”
The report cites increased repression of ethnic and religious minorities , increased detention and harassment of activists and public - interest lawyers , and continuing repression in Tibet .
I just thought everyone knew .
I found out by surprise , but I did n't think too much about it until I checked with Square Enix myself .
I was at a little shindig last night , and Secret of Mana came up in casual conversation .
Of course , I mentioned that the classic SNES RPG is coming to iPhone , and everyone threw their hands up and yelled " WHAT ! ? " or something similar .
So yeah , Squaresoft classic Secret of Mana will be an iPhone game , coming out very soon .
I was previewing another game at Square Enix 's booth , and I heard Secret of Mana music coming out of nowhere somewhere around me .
My head whipped around and I saw a screen playing a trailer for the game .
Checking with Square Enix , they confirmed that the game would be coming out this year .
Excite .
In that same conversation I learned that Final Fantasy Tactics is also coming to the iPhone .
Square Enix says that this is based on the PSP version , which I know is going to have mixed reactions .
Still , it 'll be great to have both of these games on my phone so I can never finish them again .
Leftist and rightist demonstrators clashed Saturday night in Tel Aviv as more than 6,000 Israelis gathered to protest the Israeli raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship earlier this week , in which nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed .

The protest was originally planned by to mark the anniversary of the Six Day War which broke out 43 years ago today .
Among the organizers were left wing parties Meretz , Hadash and Peace Now organization .
The demonstrators carried banners saying " The government is drowning us all , " " We must stride for peace , " and " A right wing government = clear and immediate danger to state security . "
As the demonstrators marched from the Rabin Square near the city 's municipal building toward the Tel Aviv museum several hundred rightist demonstrators followed the procession .
Upon their arrival at their final destination the spirits heated up between the two opposing groups , during which they two sides cursed and shouted at each other .
A smoke grenade was also hurled at the left wing demonstrators from an unknown source .
Police were deployed to keep the two sides apart .
Clashes were also reported on the central Ibn Gevirol Street .
Among the leftist demonstrators , hundreds carried Israeli flags to establish that they were not demonstrating against Israel nor questioning the country 's existence , but rather protesting the actions executed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's right - wing government .
On Monday , a US Border Patrol agent on a bike shot and killed a 15 - year - old Mexican boy for allegedly throwing rocks at him .
When FBI agents arrived , Mexican authorities drew their weapons .
Updated : Univision has video of the shooting .
The incident started when kids threw rocks at US Border Patrol agents who were riding bicycles on a bridge between El Paso , Texas , and Ciudad Juarez .
Apparently rock throwing is a crime punishable by death on the spot , so one agent shot and killed 15 - year - old Sergio Adrián Hernández Huereka .
Mexican authorities say Hernández was shot inside Mexico .
Border Patrol says he was trying to illegally cross into the US ( and he was throwing rocks ) .
Hernández 's father told AFP , " There were lots of kids and the border patrol cop ... started firing off shots and hit my son , my baby twice in the head . "
As FBI agents arrived on the scene , Mexican police officers aimed rifles at them .
FBI spokeswoman Andrea Simmons told The Dallas Morning News , " It pretty quickly got very intense over on the Mexican side . "
Obviously the Mexicans escalated this whole thing !
Now US and Mexican officials are throwing accusations back and forth .
From The Dallas Morning News :
Hernández was found 20 feet inside Mexico , and an autopsy revealed that the fatal shot was fired at a relatively close range , according to Arturo Sandoval , a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general 's office .
Mexican authorities said a .40 - caliber shell casing was found near the body , suggesting that the Border Patrol agent might have crossed into Mexico to shoot the boy .
That would violate the rules for Border Patrol agents , who are supposed to stay on the U.S. side –- and could open the agent to a Mexican homicide prosecution .
Update : Via commenter Poop Cooper , we have exclusive video from Univision of the shooting .
I do n't speak Spanish so I can't provide context , but the actual shooting is pretty clear .

Five hundred websites - many of them with an Arab or Muslim connection - crashed last Wednesday when an anti-terrorism taskforce raided InfoCom Corporation in Texas .
The 80 - strong taskforce that descended upon the IT company included FBI agents , Secret Service agents , Diplomatic Security agents , tax inspectors , immigration officials , customs officials , department of commerce officials and computer experts .
Three days later , they were still busy inside the building , reportedly copying every hard disc they could find .
InfoCom hosts websites for numerous clients in the Middle East , including al - Jazeera ( the satellite TV station ) , al - Sharq ( a daily newspaper in Qatar ) , and Birzeit ( the Palestinian university on the West Bank ) .
It also hosts sites for several Muslim organisations in the United States , among them the Islamic Society of North America , the Muslim Students Association , the Islamic Association for Palestine , and the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development .
In addition , InfoCom is the registered owner of " .iq " - the internet country code for Iraq .
A coalition of American Muslim groups immediately denounced the raid as part of an " anti-Muslim witch - hunt " promoted by the Israeli lobby in the United States .
Mahdi Bray , political adviser to the Muslim Public Affairs Council , said : " We have deep concerns that this once again is an attempt to rush to judgment and to marginalise the American Muslim community .
There is a pattern of bias that often permeates all of these types of investigations . "
The FBI , meanwhile , insisted the search had nothing to do with religion or Middle East politics .
" This is a criminal investigation , not a political investigation , " a spokeswoman said .
" We 're hoping to find evidence of criminal activity . "
Several Muslim groups have linked the raid to an article which appeared in the Wall Street Journal on August 13 .
Written by Daniel Pipes , director of the foreign policy research institute in Philadelphia , it called on the US to " support Israel in rolling back the forces of terror " by shutting down websites belonging to the Islamic Association for Palestine and the Holy Land Foundation .
" The federal authorities should use the tools it already has in closing down these websites and organisations , " the article said .
Daniel Pipes appears regularly in the US media , where he is regarded as an authority on the Middle East .
Arab - Americans , on the other hand , regard him as a Muslim - basher and a staunch supporter of Israel .
In one magazine article Pipes wrote : " Western European societies are unprepared for the massive immigration of brown - skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene ...
All immigrants bring exotic customs and attitudes , but Muslim customs are more troublesome than most . "
In 1995 , after the Oklahoma bombing ( for which former war hero Timothy McVeigh was eventually executed )
Pipes wasted no time in pinning the blame on Muslim extremists .
He told USA Today : " People need to understand that this is just the beginning .
The fundamentalists are on the upsurge , and they make it very clear that they are targeting us .
They are absolutely obsessed with us . "
It is unlikely , however , that the FBI could have obtained a warrant to search InfoCom on the basis of Daniel Pipes 's remarks in the Wall Street Journal .
They would have to demonstrate " probable cause " to a judge , but in this case the reasons may never be known because the judge ordered the warrant to be sealed .
InfoCom 's lawyer , Mark Enoch , said that whatever the company was suspected of , the FBI had " bad information " ; InfoCom was innocent of any wrongdoing .
According to the New York Times , citing unnamed government officials , the purpose of the search was to discover whether InfoCom has any links to the militant Palestinian organisation , Hamas .
Under an anti-terrorism law introduced in 1996 , it is illegal in the US to provide " material support " for Hamas or other organisations on the state department 's banned list .
Although Israeli sympathisers in the US have been clamouring for prosecutions , there have been no major cases so far and some lawyers question whether the 1996 law is constitutional .
Just across the road from InfoCom 's offices , in Richardson on the outskirts of Dallas , is the headquarters of the Holy Land Foundation ( HLF ) .
Apart from their physical proximity , InfoCom and HLF are intimately connected through two brothers : Ghassan and Bayan Elashi .
The Elashis are of Palestinian origin and of a religious disposition .
Ghassan is chairman of HLF and vice - president ( marketing ) of InfoCom .
InfoCom is a small but apparently successful company with a global business in computers , networking , telecommunications and internet services .
Established in 1982 , it moved to the area of Texas known as " Telecom Corridor " nine years ago .
Its business in the Middle East has been expanding largely because of its expertise in Arabic - language databases .
It recently won a contract in Jordan for a website where people can buy and sell cars .
Asked about the company 's ownership of " .iq " , the Iraqi national internet address , Ghassan Elashi said : " We were one of the pioneers of the internet at a time when all the upper domain names were available for everyone .
We searched the lists and found Iraq was available for registration . "
To avoid any trouble over sanctions , InfoCom informed the state department that it had registered " .iq " , Elashi said .
The state department replied with a " ridiculous " list of restrictions which mean that the company has never been able to make use of the Iraqi domain .
He said he had no idea what the task force was looking for in raiding InfoCom 's offices , though the staff were giving them full cooperation .
He added : " Over the last four to five weeks we have experienced some unusual hacking - mostly by pro-Israeli hackers . "
The HLF , on the other side of the street , is a tax - exempt charity established in 1989 .
Most of its efforts are focused on helping Palestinians in Jordan , Lebanon and the occupied territories , but it has also sent humanitarian aid to Bosnia , Kosovo and Chechnya , as well as earthquake relief to Turkey and flood relief to Mozambique .
According to its website , the HLF has provided sponsorship for more than 1,800 Palestinian orphans and 450 families living in refugee camps .
It has funded several medical projects , including Dar al - Salam hospital in Gaza , al - Razi hospital in Jenin , al - Ahli hospital in Hebron and a rehabilitation center for the handicapped located in Amman , Jordan .
In Lebanon , it provided safe water supplies for 72,000 refugees in the Palestinian camps .
For several years the HLF has been the target of attacks by Israeli sympathisers .
A letter sent to news organisations by New York senator Charles Schumer accused it of " raising millions of dollars for the Palestinian cause in the Middle East , some of which has been knowingly channelled to support the families of Hamas terrorists . "
A more specific claim , mentioned on the website of a Jewish organisation , the Anti-Defamation League , is that it has provided " monthly stipends to the families of terrorist suicide bombers in Israel , the West Bank , and Gaza " .
The evidence against the HLF presented by the League in a 1998 press release was somewhat tenuous .
It said that Israel had banned a Jerusalem - based organisation called the Holy Land Foundation ( which it described as the " apparent counterpart " of the Texas charity ) on the grounds that it was a front for Hamas .
Also , the League said , the Texas - based Islamic Association for Palestine ( IAP ) had urged its members to send donations to the HLF .
The League noted that the IAP had also " distributed official Hamas literature in the United States " and that its fundraising letter described the Palestinian struggle as " jihad " - " a term regularly used by Hamas " .
More recently , HLF and several other Muslim charities have become the target of a $ 600 m ( £ 409 m ) lawsuit by the parents of David Boim , an Israeli - American student who was shot dead in the West Bank in 1996 .
Using the 1996 anti-terrorism law , the family are claiming compensation from the charities , alleging that they provided " material support " to Hamas and were therefore responsible for David 's death .
Ghassan Elashi dismisses all these allegations .
" The Holy Land Foundation is as clean as crystal water , " he says .
" We have never been bothered by any government agencies . "
But to the alarm of America 's Arab and Muslim minorities , there are signs that the climate may be changing .
Assistant New York state attorney general Karen Goldman has recently been pressing for a tax audit of HLF to " enforce the laws applicable to exempt organisations " .
Another Muslim charity , the Islamic African Relief Agency , is engaged in a legal dispute with the state department after it revoked US aid grants worth $ 4.2 m .
It is , of course , a duty of governments to ensure that charities maintain financial probity .
The concern is that some charities may be getting singled out for discriminatory reasons .
The catch - all nature of the 1996 law against providing " material support " to banned organisations is also arousing controversy .
" It makes any support whatever a crime , " one Arab - American said last week .
" Simply giving blankets to the wrong kind of hospital could be a violation of the law . "

( CNN ) --
The search for a second - grade student who disappeared last week after he arrived at his Portland , Oregon , elementary school intensified Monday .
Kyron Horman , 7 , did not return home Friday from Skyline Elementary School , police said .
According to investigators , the boy 's stepmother said she last saw Kyron on Friday morning while he was walking down the hallway toward his classroom .
" There was a science fair here at the school , " Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby told CNN .
" You had a situation with lots of parents and friends coming through the school , going class to class . "
" Kyron was here with his stepmother , seen with his stepmother , " Shelby said .
The science fair was held before the beginning of classes , Shelby added , " so working parents could come and participate . "
The Multnomah County sheriff 's office reported that no one at the school saw Kyron after 8:45 a.m.
Friday and that the child never made it to his classroom .
Searches in the school area were conducted Friday and over the weekend by several agencies , including the Portland Police Bureau , Gresham Police Department , Fairview Police Department , Oregon State Patrol , and the FBI .
Authorities have also utilized Portland Police Bureau 's air unit in an attempt to locate the child .
" My heart , and the hearts of everyone who is a part of Portland Public Schools , goes out to Kyron Horman and his family , " Superintendent Carole Smith said in a written statement .
" We are all wishing for Kyron 's safe return as quickly as possible and we are grateful for the efforts of all the law enforcement agencies who have worked so tirelessly over the past 48 hours to determine the cause of Kyron 's disappearance , locate him and return him safely home .
" The reported disappearance of a student from one of our schools is unprecedented and deeply troubling .
Portland Public Schools is doing everything we can to assist the authorities in their effort to find Kyron . "
Counselors have been made available today to children and teachers at Kyron 's school , Shelby said .
" Our focus is on supporting the students and staff , " he said .
Anyone with information on Kyron Horman 's whereabouts is asked to call the Multnomah County Sheriff 's Office at 503-261-2847 .
In an attempt to spark some momentum for Mozilla 's open - source Web browser , Firefox team leader Mike Beltzner delivered a Web video presentation Monday night outlining the product 's plans for the near future .
Beltzner outlined goals and dates for changes to Firefox 's internals and user interface , with the caveat that they were subject to change .
Firefox growth has recently stalled in the face of , and enthusiasm has been growing around other recent efforts such as Microsoft 's and Norway 's .
Apple , too , has made waves lately with its Safari browser , a version of which is included in its hot CE devices , the iPhone and iPad .
Beltzner listed the three main goals of the plan , to make Firefox : fast , as in super - duper fast ; powerful , enabling new open , standard Web technologies ( HTML5 and beyond ) ; and empowering , putting users in full control of their browser , data , and Web experience .
Beltzner noted that Firefox 3.7 would be ditched in favor of an update to 3.6 , called 3.6.4 .
Both use plug-ins to run in separate processes ( called " Lorentz " ) for improved stability and security .
He said unequivocally that the target was to ship version 4 by the end of the year .
A beta is planned to hit by the end of June , and the final release should ship sometime from next October to November .
Since the , Firefox 's market share has stalled at just under 25 percent , and this has to concern Mozilla , whose browser had enjoyed seemingly unbridled growth over most of its five years of existence .
But when questioned about this increasing pressure from competitors , Beltzer unambiguously stated , " We are in it to win it . "
But he went on , " It 's no longer the case where it 's all easy wins .
There 's hard work to be done here . "
Improving Firefox 's speed was foremost among Beltzner 's goals .
The fact that Chrome , Opera , Safari , and Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview score higher than Firefox on the widely used SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark has to be a motivator for this objective .
The browser 's next JavaScript engine , dubbed JägerMonkey , is the first line of attack on this front .
Firefox has also long trailed these competitors in the time it takes to open the browser app .
Beltzner noted that not only does he want Firefox to run faster , but that the interface should be simplified so that it would " seem " faster .
But this means taking interface elements away , which could provoke a user backlash .
And speed has n't been the only setback for Firefox : the recent fracas over web video started by Apple has also put Mozilla 's browser in a lonely position .
Apple 's Steve Jobs as the standard for Web video , saying that Apple products like the iPad and iPhone would instead favor HTML 5 video .
Though Firefox has been an early supporter of HTML 5 video , too , it 's gone with the less - polished and less - popular Ogg Theora format , where Apple , Microsoft , and Chrome have settled on support for the licensed H.264 video format , which enjoys widespread use on the Internet .
Mozilla considers
Ogg completely license - free , though there have been doubts raised about its vulnerability to patent claims .
While a truly free and open video format would be ideal , the backing by the three software powerhouses Apple , Google , and Microsoft point to HTML 5 video settling on H.264 .
If that 's the case , Firefox will be the only big browser whose implementation wo n't play most HTML 5 videos .
Beltzner 's last point about empowering the user has led to some user interface objectives .
Tab treatment figures heavily in this , with " application tabs " similar to those we saw in Chrome OS , and tab " candy " among the ideas .
The actual design prototype resembles Opera 10.5 's look , with no toolbars or menus cluttering the browser window , and a very top Firefox button that resembles Opera 's " O " button .
A " switch to Tabs " feature , too , will help users navigate more quickly by dropping down other tabs in the address bar .
Syncing , better privacy controls that allow users to easily decide what they want to share with sites , and geolocation features are also on the table for Firefox 4 .
Like Opera 's Link and Google 's Sync , Mozilla 's Weave Sync lets you synchronize bookmarks , history , saved passwords , open tabs to a server and all your devices .
The new JetPack plugin system and a new extension manager will limit extensions ' ability to affect the entire browser and make programming compatibly easier .
Better on - page search with highlighting is also in development .
Under the covers , some new capabilities for developers to take advantage of will appear in the next Firefox .
Support for 64 - bit platforms will bring Firefox in line with Internet Explorer and Safari .
And work is being done on speeding up graphics display using hardware acceleration ( a big push for IE9 ) using WebGL .
Developers get some new tools , as well : Firebug compatibility , a remote JavaScript debugger , web console , web inspector , a new profile manager , and possibly a timer API and memory diagnostic tools .
The presentation emphasized that plans might change , so we should n't take any of this as written in stone .
For a complete look at the plan , you can view the video presentation and its accompanying slideshow on Beltzner 's blog .

Editor 's note : America 's 300 million - plus people are declaring their identity in the 2010 Census this year .
This piece is part of a special series on CNN.com in which people describe how they see their own identity .
Michelle Alexander is the author of The New Jim Crow : Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness ( The New Press , 2010 ) She is the former director of the Racial Justice Project of the ACLU of Northern California and of the Civil Rights Clinic at Stanford Law School .
She holds a joint appointment with the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity and the Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University .
( CNN ) -- Who am I ?
How do I identify ?
Lately , I 've been telling people that I 'm a criminal .
This shocks most people , since I do n't " look like " one .
I 'm a fairly clean - cut , light - skinned black woman with fancy degrees from Vanderbilt University and Stanford Law School .
I 'm a law professor and I once clerked for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice -- not the sort of thing you 'd expect a criminal to do .
What 'd you get convicted of ?
people ask .
Nothing , I say .
Well , then why do you say you 're a criminal ?
Because I am a criminal , I say , just like you .
This is where the conversation gets interesting .
Most of my acquaintances do n't think of themselves as criminals .
No matter what their color , age or gender , most of the people in my neighborhood and in my workplace seem to think criminals exist somewhere else -- in ghettos , mainly .
They have an unspoken , but deeply rooted identity as " law - abiding citizens . "
I ask them , " Have n't you ever committed a crime ? "
Oddly , people often seem perplexed by this question .
What do you mean ?
they say .
I mean , have n't you ever smoked pot , did n't you ever drink underage , do n't you sometimes speed on the freeway , have n't you gotten behind the wheel after having a couple of drinks ?
Have n't you broken the law ?
Well , yeah , they say , but I 'm not a criminal .
Oh , really ?
What are you , then ?
As I see it , you 're just somebody who has n't been caught .
You 're still a criminal , no better than many of those who 've been branded felons for life .
Perhaps there should be a box on the census form that says " I'm a criminal . "
Everyone who has ever committed a crime would be required to check it .
If everyone were forced to acknowledge their own criminality , maybe we , as a nation , would second - guess our apparent zeal for denying full citizenship to those branded felons .
In this country , we force millions of people -- who are largely black and brown -- into a permanent second - class status , simply because they once committed a crime .
Once labeled a felon , you are ushered into a parallel social universe .
You can be denied the right to vote , automatically excluded from juries and legally discriminated against in employment , housing , access to education and public benefits -- forms of discrimination that we supposedly left behind .
This kind of stigma , discrimination and social exclusion may befall you for no reason other than you were once caught with drugs .
I doubt Barack Obama thinks of himself as a criminal , though he should .
He has admitted to using illegal drugs during his college years -- lots , in fact .
What if he thought of himself as a criminal ?
What if he identified that way ?
Would it lead him to feel a bit more compassion for those who are branded drug felons for life , unable to find work or housing , and deemed ineligible even for food stamps ?
Maybe if Obama thought of himself as a criminal he would n't have just endorsed spending even more money on prisons at a time when scarce resources would be much better spent on education or health care , or just about anything else .
I am a criminal .
Coming to terms with this aspect of my identity has helped me to see more clearly -- with blinders off -- the ways in which I have been encouraged not to feel any connection to " them , " those labeled criminals .
I see now that " they " are me , and I am them .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michelle Alexander .
Sen .
John Kerry says the Gulf oil spill makes passage of his pending energy and climate change legislation more urgent , but he acknowledges that concern about the ecological disaster may be a hurdle to Senate action this year .
Speaking about offshore drilling at a Monitor - sponsored breakfast for reporters , Senator Kerry said , “ The fact is it is urgent to move to the alternatives to that ....
Our bill gives you an alternative to diesel fuel by converting trucks to natural gas .
Natural gas is on land and we have the largest supply in the world .
We are the Saudi Arabia of natural gas . ”
One potential obstacle for the energy and climate bill is that it would increase offshoring drilling at a time when that activity is politically toxic .
Such drilling “ is n’t realistically expanded in a significant way , because the only two states that will wind up with any expanded drilling , conceivably , are Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico , " Kerry said .
" And that will not happen , let me emphasize , until and unless there is a full explanation of what happened in the Gulf and there is a showing that there is a capacity to prevent it from ever happening again . ”
Stopping offshore drilling is not a realistic option , the senator said .
“ Now we are not going to stop drilling in the Gulf tomorrow , folks .
Let ’s be realistic .
There are 48,000 wells out there .
One of them went sour .
About 30 percent of our transportation fuel comes from the Gulf .
You think Americans are going to suddenly stop driving to work tomorrow ?
Do you think people are going to stop driving the trucks to deliver the goods to the department stores ?
Not going to happen , ” said the Massachusetts Democrat .
President Obama made a similar point Tuesday at a fundraiser in California .
“ The reason that folks are now having to go down a mile deep into the ocean , and then another mile drilling into the ground below that is because the easy oilfields and oil wells are gone , or they 're starting to diminish .
And what does that tell us ?
That tells us that we ’ve got to have a long - term energy strategy in this country , ” the president said .
Kerry , at the end of his session with reporters , acknowledged that the measure he co-authored with Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I ) may not clear the Senate this year .
“ This is n’t going away .
We may not get enough people to get out of the election fear factor this year , but this is n’t going away .
And we are going to stay on it and keep pushing because I think it is the best thing that could happen for America ’s economy , for our national security , for our health , and for our stewardship of our country . ”
On another topic , Senator Kerry said the current Congress is “ the most productive ” he had seen despite Republicans engaging in what he said was “ the most obstructionist partisanship that I have seen in the entire 26 years I have been here . “

IT is a cherished Brussels maxim that the European Union takes its greatest leaps forwards in a crisis — and then only after several false starts .
Thus for Euro - optimists , the fact that it has taken EU leaders nearly three months to deliver a promised rescue package for Greece is less important than the fact that on May 2nd the block finally leapt , setting in motion the biggest sovereign bail out plan in EU history .
Meeting in Brussels , finance ministers from the 16 countries that use the single currency accepted the need to stump up more than € 110 billion ( $ 146 billion ) over the next three years .
In effect , the rescue funds ( €80 billion from the eurozone buttressed by € 30 billion from the International Monetary Fund ) will replace commercial borrowing from the financial markets between now and 2012 .
The hope is that will buy Greece time to bring its deficit under control through savage cuts in public spending : Greece has agreed to austerity measures worth 13 % of national income over the next four years .
So is this a big leap forward : the start of an economic union willing to transfer vast sums from rich regions to ropier members of the club , in the interests of all ?
For the moment , scepticism is in order .
The pattern of the past three months has been a series of gambles by EU leaders .
Their bet , each time , has been that a fierce enough political declaration will intimidate markets into backing away from a weak member of the club .
This latest announcement looks different but it is not : it is just the biggest and fiercest declaration yet that markets should leave the eurozone alone .
The idea is to shock and awe markets with a big number , so that Greece and its toxic public finances are ringfenced behind a wall of European political will .
But this , too is a gamble .
If markets lose confidence in other members of the club , such as Portugal , the whole scramble for solidarity will begin again .
Both Greece and Portugal are rather small , moreover .
If the markets find good reasons to doubt the long - term sustainability of a much bigger economy , Spain , the cumulative bailout bill for other EU governments quickly reaches a very big number indeed ( in Brussels , figures of a trillion euros or more are talked of in queasy tones ) .
In the words of one Brussels official tonight : “ the EU can't afford Spain . ”
There is more political will to defend the eurozone than there was three months ago .
But there is not a trillion euros worth of political will out there .
That is mostly because this is such a dynamic crisis : EU political will to act has deepened and strengthened over the past three months , and continues to do so .
But the strengthening of EU political will has not kept pace with the worsening of the crisis .
All that means this does not ( yet ) look like a great leap forwards .
Those who think that Europe simply must address the founding defect of the euro now and move towards a European economic government must deal with these two awkward facts .
One , all the signs are that EU leaders lack the will for such a fiscal union ( ie , the kind of union that sees rich states in America send money to places like Louisiana ) [ corrected in response to comment below ] .
Two , if contagion spreads too far in the eurozone , EU governments do not have enough money to replace financial markets for years on end .
True , for the first time the EU is making a declaration that is likely to be backed by actual money heading south in the near future .
True , the biggest holdout , Germany , is going to ask its parliament to approve billions of euros of aid for Greece as soon as next Friday ( when eurozone heads of state and government will also meet in Brussels for an emergency summit to check the progress of the bailout ) .
True , too , that the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , for the first time threw her full weight behind the rescue plan , despite opposition from members of her centre - right coalition and much anger from voters a few days ahead of a crucial election .
Significantly , Mrs Merkel made the case for a rescue in the Sunday edition of Bild , the tabloid that has led noisy opposition to any transfers to Athens , railing about “ our money ” going to fund “ luxury pensions ” for spendthrift Greeks .
Noting that Greece is going to have to make deep and painful cuts to public sector pay and benefits while raising taxes sharply , Mrs Merkel said those harsh terms would deter other eurozone countries from getting into similar pickles .
Other heavily indebted governments would " see that Greece 's path , with the IMF 's strict terms , is not easy , so they will do everything to avoid that for themselves , " Mrs Merkel said .
But Mrs Merkel is also still pretending that this bailout may not cost German taxpayers in the long run .
Apeing promises from finance ministers in places like France and Belgium , she told Bild that if the IMF - led austerity program for Greece succeeds , the package of rescue loans will make a profit for German taxpayers ( because Germany can borrow money cheaply , and will lend it to Greece at rates of around 5 % ) .
In private , though , EU officials admit that is a big “ if ” : the IMF - led austerity plan may not work .
George Papaconstantinou , the Greek finance minister , said in Athens on May 2nd that his country faced a choice between a “ difficult ” path to “ salvation ” ( measures will include a rise in value - added tax to 23 % from 21 % percent , a 10 % rise in fuel , alcohol and tobacco taxes and further reductions in public sector salaries and pensions ) and “ the country reaching an absolute dead - end . "
Yet salvation will be hard to reach , especially before a three year holiday from market forces ends .
Boosters say that Greece only has to become a little more like a normal country to become a lot better off ( ie , it would gain hugely from just collecting taxes like a normal country , and issuing economic statistics that the markets trust ) .
But that is a hard task .
With a nasty recession looming ( Greece says its economy will shrink 4 % this year and 2.6 % before returning to growth in 2012 ) , and painful cuts on the way , Greek citizens already feel they are being made to pay for the sins of the country 's ruling elite .
A default , meaning at least the restructuring of Greek loans , still looks horribly likely .
At which point , EU political leaders will find themselves explaining to voters not just why they had to bail out Greece , but why that money may never be repaid in full , or even at all .
That would take them into a whole new category of political pain .
Forget talk of great leaps forward for the moment .
Just keeping the euro on the rails over the next few months and years is going to be a terrifying task .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has promised the " biggest shake - up of our democracy " in 178 years as he sets out plans for political reform .
The Tory - Lib Dem coalition is proposing fixed - term parliaments , an elected House of Lords and a referendum on changing the voting system .
Mr Clegg said the government was " not insecure about relinquishing control " .
The Lib Dem leader also called on the public to nominate laws to be repealed , as part of a " power revolution " .
Mr Clegg , who is overseeing the government 's political reform plans , said he wanted to " transform our politics so the state has far less control over you , and you have far more control over the state " .
' Centralised '
This would include scrapping the ID card scheme and accompanying National Identity Register , all future biometric passports and the children 's Contact Point Database .
It would also ensure CCTV was " properly regulated " in future and the storage of innocent people 's DNA restricted .
Mr Clegg said : " Britain was once the cradle of modern democracy .
We are now , on some measures , the most centralised country in Europe , bar Malta . "
Political reform and the civil liberties agenda will be very much Mr Clegg 's project .
It is an area where the coalition should find much agreement
The BBC's Ben Wright
Analysis : A great reformer ?
The deputy prime minister promised to give voters powers to " recall " corrupt MPs and for an elected House of Lords , based on a " proportional " voting system .
He said : " I 'm talking about the most significant programme of empowerment by a British government since the great enfranchisement of the 19th Century .
" The biggest shake up of our democracy since 1832 , when the Great Reform Act redrew the boundaries of British democracy , for the first time extending the franchise beyond the landed classes . "
He added : " Incremental change will not do .
It is time for a wholesale , big bang approach to political reform . "
He accused the previous government of " obsessive lawmaking " and pledged to " get rid of the unnecessary laws " and " introduce a mechanism to block pointless new criminal offences " .
PROPOSED REFORMS
Elected House of Lords Scrapping the ID card scheme and the national identity register Libel to be reviewed to protect freedom of speech Limits on the rights to peaceful protest to be removed Scrapping the ContactPoint database of 11 million under - 18s

He promised to ask the public " which laws you think should go " as they " tear through the statute book " .
Mr Clegg added : " This government is going to persuade you to put your faith in politics once again . "
He said differences between the Lib Dems and Conservatives were " almost impossible to spot " when it came to wanting to decentralise power .
He added : " We do n't , unlike Labour , believe that change in our society must be forced from the centre .
Unlike the previous Labour government , we 're not insecure about relinquishing control . "
Mr Clegg , who was heckled by protesters as he arrived at City and Islington College to give his speech , did not give a date for the referendum on electoral reform which the government is promising or its " precise wording " .
He also acknowledged that the Lib Dems and Conservatives would not be " united " on the issue and would campaign for different outcomes .
' Right balance '
The deputy prime minister defended the government 's decision to set a threshold of 55 % of MPs having to back a dissolution of Parliament for it to happen .
Critics argue that the change , which accompanies the move to five - year fixed - term parliaments , is unconstitutional and gives the incumbent administration an unfair advantage .
1832 REFORM ACT
Widened franchise to include one in seven adult males Abolished many " rotten boroughs " , with some large towns getting MPs for the first time
But only men with properties with rental value of more than £ 10 a year could vote , disappointing many reformers and leading to the Chartist movement , calling for universal male suffrage But Mr Clegg said : " That is a much lower threshold than the two - thirds required in Scottish Parliament but it strikes the right balance for our Parliament , maintaining stability , stopping parties from forcing a dissolution to serve their own interest .
" This last week , former Labour ministers who were once perfectly happy to ride roughshod over the rights of Parliament are now declaring that this is somehow an innovation which is a constitutional outrage .
They are completely missing the point .
" This is a new right for Parliament , additional to the existing powers of no confidence .
We are not taking away Parliament 's right to throw out government .
We are taking away government 's right to throw out Parliament . "
For Labour , former Home Secretary Alan Johnson accused Mr Clegg of using " rampant hyperbole " when talking about surveillance and added that the previous government 's law and order reforms had public backing .
He said : " If he [ Mr Clegg ] wants to ask the public which laws to get rid of , he should also ask which laws they would like to keep . "

Julie Tierney , the Assistant Public Health Director behind the scheme , said : " Our Health & Wellbeing 's Early Years Healthy Eating Guidelines encourage nurseries to provide healthy snacks and treats for all children in their care , and encourages them to choose foods and drinks that are not high in sugar as part of a healthy lifestyle .
What Is The Wild Fox Project ?
The Wild Fox project ( ' Wild Fox ' , or Wx for short ) , is a project aimed at releasing builds of Firefox which include features the Firefox builds do not include , including AVC ( h.264 ) support with HTML 5 video .
Why This Project ?
The Firefox project has opted to exclude certain features due to software patents , patents which are only valid in a small number of countries , including the USA and South - Korea ( Wikipedia link ) .
This means that decisions have been made due to patents which do not apply in most parts of the world .
The Wild Fox project aims to rectify this by releasing builds with these features included , builds which will of course only be available to those not in software patent - encumbered countries .
Developers Needed
As I ( Maya Posch AKA ' Elledan ' ) am just a single person , help is required to set up this project successfully and to release stable builds for as long as is required .
If you are familiar with the Mozilla source and / or C++ plus have at least passing familiarity with ( multimedia ) libraries , you are more than welcome to join the project .
Please contact me either via SourceForge or via my personal site .
Current Developments
( Updated 2011/02/13 )
An add - on is now available for regular Firefox builds which allows any video format to be played back in Firefox depending on the installed browser video plug -in :
The VLC plug - in works , but lacks controls for playback control .
The Windows Media Player 11 plug - in works , but can't have auto - playback of the video disabled .
At this point Linux & OS X probably have the better video playback plug-ins for browsers
You can download the add - on in XPI format from here .
Do keep in mind that it 's basically an Alpha build , and that I gladly welcome feedback to improve it :)
At this point the goal is to include at least AVC ( h.264 ) support to the HTML 5 video tag .
To this end the currently stable Firefox 3.6.3 source code is used and modified to include a decoder for AVC .
Possible decoder libraries include Libavcodec which also offers the possibility of adding support for more video and audio codecs if required .
There is also the option of using a generic codec framework like GStreamer , which allows for the use of codecs installed on the system .
** Note :
This article contains my personal speculation .
WireFly will neither confirm nor deny what I suggest in this article .
Please do n’t sue me .
**
Last week , WireFly started a contest called “ Why Android Can Beat Up Your iPhone . ”
Contestants had to write an essay explaining why they thought Android devices were superior to the iPhone (s ) .
There would be 5 winners , and their prize would be the Android device of their choice .
Today , they pulled down the contest .
Since Wirefly suspiciously refused to comment on the situation , I begin my rampant ( but , let 's be honest – probably correct ) speculation :
Apple is notorious for being an incredibly litigious company .
If I had to come up with an analogy for Apple , I ’d say they ’re like the jacked - up , angry pitbulls that are used for dog fighting .
You know – really mean , very particular , and massively overprotective .
Because of this , I strongly suspect that Apple was behind this .
As I ’ve stated before , I enjoy Apple products , and I think that they truly are the best choice for some people .
But … seriously ?
I ’m having trouble articulating how ridiculous it would be if Apple really were behind this .
At least it ’s worth a good “ lol ” and a facepalm .
This stuff writes itself .
Update : Based on comments , I feel the need to remind people of the very strong relationship between Apple and AT&T .
WireFly may not have any business dealings with Apple , but they are an AT&T dealer .
MATTHEW YGLESIAS wishes people would stop overstating the evils of gerrymandering .
It 's true that gerrymandering is n't the root of all evil , but that does n't mean it 's not a problem .
It is particularly pernicious in combination with another problem : the primary system .
Without the party primaries , rational choice among voters , even in gerrymandered districts , would produce more centrist winners .
But in the vast majority of utterly safe districts , only one party 's primary winner matters in the general .
The primary is thus the real election , and a contest only to see who can turn out more of their red - or blue - faced partisan faithful .
Mr Yglesias asks , slightly sarcastically , for someone to explain to him just how the ungerrymandered Senate is better than the House .
OK , deal .
The Senate 's tradition of comity is fairly legendary , even if it has been weakened a bit in the last few decades .
( It was probably always overstated , but it is nonetheless real . )
The Senate produces figures who are not only closer to the centre but who have the security of a six - year term .
Thus many of us can name senators known for crossing party lines , and thus name bills with sponsors from both sides of the aisle : McCain - Feingold , McCain - Kennedy , Kerry - Graham - Lieberman ...
Few of us can name comparable independent House members or truly bipartisan bills .
Strict party - line votes have always been rarer in the Senate than in the House .
Perhaps the clearest way the Senate is " better than " the House ?
Senators can actually lose their seats .
See these graphs from the Center for Responsive Politics :
Of course the Senate has its own problems .
Holds and the filibuster leap to mind .
But to say that " Gerrymandering is n't a problem ; just look at the Senate " is a surprisingly shallow argument from the usually sharp Mr Yglesias .
A former city employee in the Fukushima prefecture town of Koriyama has built a 4 - meter ( 13 - ft ) long canoe from thousands of used disposable chopsticks recovered from the city hall cafeteria .
Bothered that perfectly good wood was going to waste after a single use , Shuhei Ogawara -- whose job at city hall involved working with the local forestry industry -- spent the last two years of his career collecting used chopsticks from the cafeteria .
An experienced canoe builder , Ogawara spent over 3 months gluing 7,382 chopsticks together into strips to form the canoe shell , to which he added a polyester resin coat .
The canoe weighs about 30 kilograms ( 66 lbs ) , which is a bit heavier than an ordinary cedar canoe , but Ogawara is confident it will float .
A launching ceremony is planned for May at nearby Lake Inawashiro .

The majority of those lucky enough to have visited a beach in their lifetime will have experienced what is essentially a common sight at the coast ; a strip of golden sand ; a few dozen sunbeds ; calm blue sea and clear skies .
Of course , things are n't always normal depending on your location .
Here are some incredible , uncommon sights at the beach .
Haeundae Beach Image Source Haeundae Beach in South Korea is not the place to go should you be looking for a peaceful bout of sunbathing , as the mile long stretch of sand is apparently the world 's most populous during summer months .
As illustrated by the claustrophobia - inducing photo , over 100'000 people have been known to fill the beach simultaneously at its peak .
More pictures are here .
Cappuccino Coast Image Source
In August 2007 , visitors to the the coast of Yamba , New South Wales - especially Main Beach - were treated to a case of sea foam so extreme that the majority of onlookers were completely baffled .
Caused by ' impurities in the ocean ' , this particular case of what is actually a common event was further intensified by storms just off the coast which whipped up the foam to the extent seen in the photo above .
More can be seen here .
Seagaia Ocean Dome Image Source
At first sight the beautiful , inviting beach shown in the photo above seems as normal as most .
In truth though , it 's entirely man-made , and indoors .
The building in which it resides was , prior to its closure in 2007 , called Seagaia Ocean Dome and located in Japan proudly held the title of ' world 's largest indoor waterpark ' .
An engineering masterpiece .
Red Tide Image Source Surprisingly , the red water seen sweeping towards the beach in the photo above is entirely natural , and the result of a very often harmful onset of Algal Bloom ; a phenomenon in which algae accumulate in a body of water to such a degree that its colour actually changes .
Visually stunning , but potentially dangerous .
Duck !
Image Source Had countless similar photos not circulated the internet over the past few years , it would be easy to dismiss this picture as fake , but of course it is n't , and still deserves mention .
The beach pictured can be found on the island of Saint Martin in the Caribbean , and is unfortunately located directly underneath the landing path of planes approaching Princess Juliana International Airport .
If you have n't already done so , I strongly suggest a visit to Youtube for video footage .
Couple Image Source
As you sit on the beach in Newbiggin - by - the - Sea , England and look out at sea , you will no doubt notice two enormous characters - each five metres in height - standing above the water on a frame .
The permanent sculpture , entitled ' Couple ' , was created by artist Sean Henry and has been puzzling tourists since 2007 .

” Bollocks .
It ’s the fucking red hot jalapeño peppers , the Scotch Bonnet chillies and insanity sauces that put the spice in life .
I ’ve always loved me some hot and spicy food .
In fact , I pretty much heat up everything I eat in one way or another .
Tabasco sauce in tomato soup .
Raw chillies in a chicken salad .
I love it .
Suffice to say , I ’ve built up a hefty tolerance to the hot stuff .
What I would consider to be a mild chilli con carne would cripple most grown men , and my homemade curries could be considered dangerous for consumption .
My local curry house knows me so well , that when my number appears on their caller I.D , they simply pick up the phone and say “ yep , chicken Phaal , extra heat and rice .
Be about half hour , Joey .
” Any time , day or night , just gimme the heat .
I ’ve eaten Vindaloo for breakfast on several occasions , and I use my limited edition Hardman hot sauce to spice up a sandwich .
There ’s nothing that I can’t handle .
I ’m a Bruce Lee of the culinary kind .
Hard as fuck .
Or so I thought .
Friday night saw my brother ’s 30th birthday , and although I ca n’t stand him and his circle of friends , I thought I better show my face .
After visiting a few of the pubs in town , we decided it was time to get something to eat .
The chosen venue was a new curry house that had just opened , which suited me fine .
The restaurant itself was nice .
They even had ‘ beer towers ’ , which I ’d never come across before .
For people who do n’t know , these things are the ultimate shit .
They hold 9 pints of your chosen lager , which is kept cool by the frosted thermos tower walls .
Every time you finish your glass , just help yourself to more out of the tap at the bottom of the tower .
Brilliant .
But it was n’t just the choice of drinking vessels that had attracted us to this particular restaurant .
No .
It was me .
Me and my big fucking mouth .
“ That new curry place has got an offer on .
They reckon they do a dish so hot that if one person can eat it all , your whole group eats for free .
C’mon , I ’ll eat it all .
Piece of piss .
” I was so certain that I even told people not to bother getting any more cash out of the ATM ’s , because there ’s no way we would have to pay .
I ’m the fucking curry king , me .
They gave me a few dubious looks , but I was supremely confident in my quest .
I ’d never been beaten yet , and I was n’t about to start now .
We went inside , and after we had settled down with our drinks , the waiter came over to take the order .
“ Yeah , I ’ll have the ‘ hot ’ curry you do .
I ’ll finish it , no problem .
” “ Are you sure ? ” “ Listen , I know what I ’m talking about .
Bring it on !
” After taking everyone else ’s order , he proceeded to the kitchen , where I ’m sure I heard the fuckers laughing .
Well , I ’ll fucking show them ….. When the food arrived , I was the last to be served .
I think this may have just been done for effect , as when the guy came through the kitchen door with my meal , he was holding it away from his body , as if it was a bomb that was about to go off .
What he placed down in front of me was like no other curry I had ever seen before .
It was almost black , and the surface was bubbling away , giving it the impression of a boiling tar pit .
I got a whiff of the stuff , and I could almost feel the hairs in my nose begin to melt .
Oh well , no turning back now .
I picked up my fork , and tentatively speared a piece of chicken that was poking up from the depths of the deathly looking sauce .
I suddenly became aware of the faces that had appeared at the little round window that led to the kitchen , reminding of that scene from Jurassic Park .
The 2 guys behind the drinks bar appeared to be having some sort of bet .
I put the chicken in my mouth and began to chew .
I was expecting it to be hot .
What I was n’t expecting was for my mouth to explode with intense , agonising heat , that seemed to seep upwards and into my brain in a matter of seconds .
I remained calm and collected on the outside , not wanting to give the game away .
On the inside , my tongue felt like it was having contractions , and my gums were bleeding molten lava .
After what seemed like eternity , I had sufficiently chewed the offending piece of meat to consistency that I could swallow .
The sauce on the chicken burned my throat , and I could feel it as it slid down my gullet and headed towards my stomach .
“ Mmmm , not bad , not bad at all , ” I said , reaching swiftly for my pint glass , and trying to casually neck the entire contents without looking desperate .
I piled up another fork load , and shoved it into my mouth , determined to chew and swallow as quick as possible to avoid the agonising heat that was still trying to melt away my face from the inside .
Already I could feel beads of perspiration popping out across my forehead .
My brain was screaming out to me .
This was madness !
For fuck ’s sake , do n’t carry on !
But personal pride is a motherfucker .
And seeing as nobody even had any money on them , I was n’t about to spend the next 6 months washing dishes for these Indian fuckwits .
I managed another few mouthfuls in quick succession , but by now sweat was streaming down my face , and my calm composure was completely gone .
I was having to down nearly a whole pint of beer between each mouthful just to put the flames out .
I got about half way through , and I was in pain .
My lips were stinging , my eyes were streaming , and my throat felt like I had drunk a gallon of drain cleaner .
I pushed the bowl away , and the watching waiter came over to the table .
“ So , you cant finish the meal , no ?
Well , you ’ll have to pay …..
You should be proud though , that was a good attempt .
Just not good enough ….. ” Right .
Fuck you .
I ’m not being beaten by these assholes .
I grabbed the bowl and pulled it back in front of me .
What the hell was I doing ?
I pushed on , tackling the dish one mouthful at a time , pausing after each swallow to drink more and more .
My tower was starting to run low already .
But by this point , I was on a mission .
The pain began to become irrelevant .
I picked up speed , getting a second wind , and started piling 3 or 4 bits of meat into my mouth in one go .
I was really going to do it !
5 minutes later , I was wiping up the last of the sauce with a bit of naan bread , and I held the bowl aloft , like a hunter with a prized trophy .
“ Ha !
Fuck you guys , all done !
” The waiter came and checked the bowl , and looked at me like I was some sort of maniac .
We left the restaurant , and I got a taxi back home , where I passed out and dreamed some seriously trippy shit .
The following morning I was in no need of an alarm clock .
My stomach was churning , and making noises that surely were n’t natural .
As I swung my legs out of bed , I doubled up in pain , and squatted down on bent knees .
Already I could feel my colon starting to contract , and as my stomach gave another mystical churn , I wondered if I would make it to the toilet in time .
I crawled naked on my hands and knees along the landing , cursing myself for being such a stupid bastard .
I could see the toilet through the open bathroom door , taunting me like a despotic tyrant would taunt a prisoner who was just about to be executed .
As I reached the door , my stomach let out another gurgle of pre-explosion turmoil , and my passage began to open up against it ’s will .
It was coming whether I wanted it to or not .
I leapt up from the floor , and cleared the remaining distance in the air , landing on the toilet and hugging the cistern and shaking – I had n’t had the time to turn around .
I had just made it , but I wished I had n’t .
It was like a brown river had just burst a dam , and it ’s raging torrents were now free to cause havoc and destruction .
As the curry had burnt my mouth the night before , my wretched bodily waste would now rain fire and brimstone on my ravaged rectal passage .
The searing heat radiated through my intestines , and you could have fried an egg on my ass crack .
I hugged the cistern tighter , and prayed for it all to be over , prayed for the pain to stop .
Even when my bowels had been fully evacuated , I could n’t bear to wipe at first .
I reached a hand up to the cabinet , and pulled out a handful of cotton wool .
Then , leaning over to the sink , I soaked the cotton with fresh , cold water .
The cool refreshing cotton helped , but it still did n’t completely take away the fire that still burning relentlessly away .
45 minutes later , I managed to clean up the remaining mess , but I was to walk like John Wayne for the remainder of the day .
Later that evening , I paid the curry house another visit .
“ Seriously , guys – what did you put in that thing ?
You could run a fucking power plant on that stuff .
” The chef went into the kitchen , and came back with a small black bottle .
The top on the bottle was actually a golden skull .
It looked like a bottle of poison from a dark fairy tale .
“ Blair ’s 6 a.m reserve ” , he said in a deep grave like voice .
“ Only a thousand bottles ever made .
It ’s the closest you can get to pure Capsaicin without it becoming crystalline .
Tabasco sauce is about 2000 Scoville units .
This stuff registers in at nearly 16 million Scovilles .
I had to sign a disclaimer just to get it .
One drop in a gallon of water will produce extreme heat .
We put several drops in your curry alone !
” “ You bastards !
That ’s attempted murder .
” “ No , my friend .
That ’s just business .
We would n’t make any money if we had everybody getting free meals .
” I resisted the overwhelming urge to punch him in the face , and left the restaurant , and vowed never to return .
Blair ’s 6 am reserve – it ’s a little bit of death in a bottle .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- " Just like riding a bike " is a cliche for a simple skill you do not forget , but understanding how a human controls a bicycle is in some ways more challenging than understanding how a pilot flies an airplane , say two UC Davis engineers .
Professors Mont Hubbard and Ron Hess of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering are studying human control of bicycles , supported by a two - year , $ 300,000 grant from the National Science Foundation .
" There 's a lot of folklore and experience , but we do n't have a precise scientific understanding of how humans control bicycles , " said Hubbard , who leads the Sports Biomechanics Laboratory at UC Davis .
Hess , a nationally recognized expert on how pilots interact with aircraft control systems , said that riding a bike turns out to be a more complex problem .
" What makes riding a bicycle unique is that you have to use all the sensory information available , " Hess said .
That includes not just vision and hearing , but motion , orientation , awareness of where your limbs are , and the movement of muscle groups .
For example , it is possible to build a flight or driving simulator without motion cues , but a bicycle simulator without " lean " would not be realistic .
The research group includes graduate students Jason Moore , Dale Peterson , Danique Fintelman , Brendan Connors and Gilbert Gede , and undergraduates Derek Pell , Joseph Rinek , Eric Chan and Steve Brendel .
The team is building bicycles fitted with sensors to measure precisely how the vehicle and the rider move .
They will capture motion on video and analyze it with computer models .
They will also attempt to build a robot bicycle based on their findings , Hess said .
Hubbard and Hess hope that their work could lead to new insights into how humans interact with control systems , and perhaps new bicycle designs .
" We 'd like to know what makes a bicycle hard to ride , and can we make it easier , " Hubbard said .
The researchers hope to look at how different populations -- such as seniors -- ride , and whether bicycle designs could be tailored to their needs , he said .

COLUMBUS , Ohio –
An out - of - state person or business can be sued in Ohio for posting derogatory Internet comments about someone who lives in Ohio , the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday .
The full impact of the ruling is n't clear yet , given the ever - growing world of technology and the challenge of constantly updating legal guidelines to keep up with it .
But the lawyer who won the decision said it 's a warning to people who use the Internet to disparage others .
" I think it sends a very clear message to people both in this state and throughout the United States that the Internet is not to be used for means to destroy people whether intentionally or unintentionally , " said attorney Brett Jaffe , who represented Kauffman Racing Equipment in the case .
" When defamatory statements regarding an Ohio plaintiff are made outside the state yet with the purpose of causing injury to the Ohio resident , " then courtrooms here -- not elsewhere -- are the proper settings for the complaints , Justice Paul Pfeifer wrote for the court 's majority in a 4 - 2 decision .
The case stemmed from a 2006 business deal that soured .
Scott Roberts , a Virginia resident , purchased a Pontiac automobile motor from Kauffman , a Knox County company that specializes in building and selling auto racing parts .
After having the motor for eight months , Roberts sent it back to Kauffman claiming it was defective .
Kauffman refused to refund Roberts money after learning the motor had several modifications made to it , alterations Roberts admitted making .
A dissatisfied Roberts took to the Internet to seek revenge , posting negative comments about Steve Kauffman and his company on several websites popular with racing enthusiasts , the ruling said .
Kauffman sued Roberts in Knox County Common Pleas Court .
But Roberts successfully had the case dismissed on grounds that an Ohio court had no jurisdiction because he lives out - of - state .
A state appeals court , however , reinstated the case .
Roberts then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court .
The court 's challenge was to determine whether Ohio's " long arm statute , " which allows lawsuits against people who live outside of the state , applies in this case .
Roberts had argued the answer was no because he did not directly send the Internet comments to Ohio or publish them from Ohio .
They were posted from Virginia and sent to Internet sites available to anyone with a computer and Internet access .
But the court 's majority said Roberts ' comments could be accessed in Ohio and were clearly intended to hurt an Ohio business .
" How much of the world saw the comments is unknown , " Pfeifer wrote .
" But we do know . . . that at least five Ohioans saw Roberts ' statements .
The comments were thus published in Ohio . "
Eric Goldman , an associate law professor and director of the High - Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University , said the court 's ruling is in line with other states that have addressed similar cases .
He agreed with the court 's majority .
Because Roberts ' comments named a company that was known to operate from a specific location , it is clear he was attempting to hurt Kauffman 's business , Goldman said .
" Roberts was spoiling for a fight and went out of his way to tangle with a tiger , " Goldman said .
Had this been a major company like Sony , Goldman said , Roberts would have been on safer ground because it would be harder to say where exactly an international company is most harmed by Internet comments .
Still , Goldman questioned why Kauffman would bother fighting the grammatically challenged rants of a disgruntled customer to begin with .
" They are spending lots of money that will potentially get them nowhere , " Goldman said , because most of the time these cases get settled with little or no money exchanging hands .
Jaffe , Kauffman 's lawyer , acknowledged that after four years , all his client has to show for it is a chance to fight his case in Ohio and not elsewhere .
" We have spent all this money and all this time to essentially go back to state court to argue the case , " Jaffe said .
Still , Jaffe said , this case is about principle .
" We had to absolutely take this position because if we allow one person to do this , then everyone could do it and the line had to be drawn in the sand to let people know that businesses and people are not to be trifled with through use of the Internet , " Jaffe said .
Pfeifer was joined in the majority by Justices Evelyn Lundberg Stratton , Maureen O'Connor and Robert Cupp .
Justices Terrence O'Donnell and Judith Ann Lanzigner dissented .
O'Donnell said it was a stretch to say Ohio has jurisdiction over an out - of - state person who posts comments that may or may not be seen by someone in Ohio .
" By merely posting to general websites , " Roberts did n't do enough to be sued in Ohio , O'Donnell wrote in his dissent .
AT two in the morning on May 10th , European Union finance ministers agreed a huge increase in their political will to defend Europe 's single currency , backed by a stunning € 750 billion in aid for weak links in the 16 member eurozone .
Simultaneously , the European Central Bank took a revolutionary shift away from its inflation - fighting mission , announcing a scheme to buy up government bonds on the financial markets .
That new sense of resolve is good news .
The more troubling news is that it took 11 hours of bitter wrangling to get the ministers to that point , and — thanks to continued German anxiety about undermining eurozone discipline by bailing out the profligate — there will be three separate mechanisms to deliver that €750 billion , of such fiendish complexity that EU officials are still not quite sure how it will all work .
In a nice irony , the ministers — who have spent weeks denouncing financial markets as wicked speculators — only stopped arguing and agreed a plan in the early hours of this morning because they knew markets were about to open in Asia , well - informed sources say .
Does the good news trump the troubling news ?
Yes : as long as lingering disagreements and uncertainties do not hold up the rescue plan .
Europe is building its own financial bazooka to warn off the markets , to borrow Hank Paulson 's image .
If it is ready to fire when needed , then complexity probably does not matter for now .
What has been agreed ?
First off , a € 60 billion rapid reaction stabilisation fund , controlled by the European Commission , and able to send ready money to eurozone countries that are in a financing crunch .
The mechanism is modelled on an existing scheme for non-euro economies , the " balance of payments facility " .
The money is borrowed by the commission on the markets , using the EU budget as collateral .
Because the EU budget cannot legally go into the red , that means that all 27 EU members are on the hook if money from this € 60 billion pot is disbursed and not paid back : to simplify , all members would have to pay extra into the budget to top it up .
Britain , for instance , would be on the hook for 12 % of any losses : Alistair Darling , still the British chancellor of the exchequer , approved this after consulting his Tory counterpart , George Osborne , by telephone .
Secondly , a " special purpose vehicle " ( do n't call it a fund or Eurobonds , or the Germans will be very cross ) , which will be created in the next few days by an intergovernmental agreement among eurozone members , and which will raise up to €440 billion euro on the markets using a blend of loans and loan guarantees from the 16 members of the single currency club .
The European Commission wanted formal control of this warchest , using a clause of the Lisbon Treaty , Article 122 that allows the commission to rush emergency aid to countries hit by natural disasters or exceptional crises beyond their control ( Article 122 will be used for the € 60 billion pot ) .
The Germans , Dutch , Finns , Austrians and others , backed by the British , said no , and in the end won this argument : the commission may be invited to manage the warchest , which is also described as a temporary three year creation .
The Germans were also insistent that the fund should work in the same way as the € 110 billion rescue package just agreed for Greece : meaning it should involve money and budget discipline measures from the International Monetary Fund , and meaning that it should be a package of bilateral loans from each of the 16 , rather than open - ended loan guarantees .
The French , in particular , dreamed of open - ended loan guarantees and an EU - only structure : ie , something very close to a permanent Eurobond bailout instrument .
Germany said no , but that may or may not look in the future like a victory on process , not on the substance .
Thirdly , the finance ministers demanded that Spain and Portugal should work harder on consolidating their budgets this year and next : that was politically very hard for the Spanish ( who were nominally chairing the meeting ) .
The Spanish have asked to come back with a plan next week .
Fourthly , there was a stunning announcement that the IMF would match every two euros of EU rescue money with one of its own .
That could take the IMF contribution up to € 220 or € 250 billion , depending on whether they are matching the € 60 billion too .
In a slightly surreal moment , the Spanish economy minister Elena Salgado could not decide whether that extra € 30 billion was part of the deal .
Some of us are old enough ( ie , we were alive three weeks ago ) to remember when the EU as a whole thought € 30 billion was enough money on its own to put on the table and order markets to back off .
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , the European Central Bank went off and agreed exactly the thing that banks and politicians had been urging it to do : ie , start buying up government bonds on the financial markets .
Where does that leave ECB independence ?
In a tricky place , not to mention the ECB 's central mission to fight inflation , which is in danger of being trumped by political demands from the national governments of the eurozone .
One of the gripping stories of this crisis has been the roller - coaster fortunes of the ECB boss , Jean - Claude Trichet .
About nine months ago , Mr Trichet was one of the undisputed winners of the meltdown , hailed for his calm and decisive management of the banking crisis .
The last few months have been brutal for this urbane Frenchman .
First he said it would be a " humiliation " for the IMF to be involved in rescuing Greece , only to have to eat his words .
Then he said it was as clear as a mountain stream that the ECB could not make an exception for Greece alone , when it came to accepting Greek debt as collateral even if it was downgraded to junk by credit rating agencies .
Then he had to eat his words on that too .
So , what does this all mean politically ?
Is it the birth of Eurobonds , and a fiscal transfer union , in which the rich and strong pay for the weak ?
A sneaky way out of that question is to say that we have effectively had Eurobonds for ages , in the form of the balance of payments mechanism ( which was used only recently for Hungary and Latvia ) and that we have had transfers from rich to poor in the form of structural and cohesion funds ( ie , aid for poorer regions ) .
But that would be a cowardly answer .
I have been saying for ages that I did not believe that the political will was there to move to the sort of political or economic union that some in Brussels have always said was needed to make the euro work .
Do I still think I am right ?
I think that the politics have shifted dramatically in the last few days , and that the euro is looking less German and more French , even if Angela Merkel has won some late victories on process by insisting that national governments should not give open - ended loan guarantees to the European Commission to play with .
I think that the EU has developed a much stronger external narrative , telling markets that they should treat the eurozone as a single whole , which is strong and solvent , and not try to pick off weaker members because they will get their fingers burned .
But , and I think this is still a big but , the political narrative inside the eurozone is still lagging way behind .
If the markets outside are being told to treat the eurozone as a single fortress , defended by unlimited budgetary firepower from the rich members of the club , voters in places like Germany , the Netherlands or Finland are absolutely not being told that they now inhabit a single economic entity , in which big chunks of the budget are pooled .
Instead , the political messages being delivered internally are heading in quite different directions .
One , the Germans and co are still insisting that the point of constructing a vast bazooka is to avoid ever having to fire it .
In other words , whether or not you think the leaders are stumbling backwards into a fiscal transfer union , that is certainly not their purported intention : the intention is for none of this money ever to be needed .
Two , the political ground is not being prepared for a fiscal union : Angela Merkel has not gone on German television to tell German voters that the euro is incredibly important to their way of life and their prosperity , and that defending it may cost painful amounts of money .
Instead , the anti-market rhetoric is being stepped up to fever pitch .
Markets are wicked speculators , or " wolf packs " if you listen to the Swedish finance minister .
there is an international conspiracy to destroy the euro , says Jean - Claude Juncker , prime minister of Luxembourg .
In concrete terms , leaders like Mrs Merkel have yet to make the positive case for saving the euro , instead preferring to make the negative case for punishing speculators ( though , I note , those evil speculators magically turn back into " international markets " when the EU wants to raise € 440 billion in a short space of time ) .
A political quid pro quo is being prepared to buy off voters furious at the idea of sending money to weak or profligate members of the club , involving much tougher regulation of those wicked markets .
Mrs Salgado last night talked of probing the role played by credit ratings agencies , and much tougher regulation of derivatives .
There is constant talk of financial transaction taxes .
Nobody is denying that regulation will not need to change in the future , but the suggestions so far have much more to do with populism than common sense .
The idea of a publicly funded European Credit Rating Agency , supported by France and Germany , is particularly asinine : if the ECRA is much more bullish about EU sovereign debt than the commercial ratings agencies , markets will assume it is no more than a man next to a fax machine , taking orders from Paris and Berlin .
In which case it is not obvious what good it will do .
On the other hand , if its ratings match those of the commercial ratings agencies , it will change nothing in the markets , and it is not obvious what good it will do .
I think this bellicose talk of fighting battles with markets and being at war with perfidious bankers ( to quote Mrs Merkel ) may point to a useful analogy for what is going on in terms of political integration here , at least at this point .
I wonder if this new intergovernmental warchest of € 440 billion , working with the intergovernmental IMF , is a bit like the mutual defence clause , Article 5 , in the NATO treaty , that says an attack on one member of NATO is an attack on all .
That is hugely important , and commits each member government to big and serious things .
But it is not the same as those member countries agreeing to pool their militaries .
A wise colleague makes the point that the oddity for years was that markets gave all eurozone countries almost the same rates , ie assumed ( wrongly ) that default risk had gone .
In many ways the past few months have been healthy as that assumption no longer holds .
But the corollary is indeed the discovery that heavy borrowers can lose some of their independence .
But , he points out , big borrowers often lose some sovereignty , because markets set limits on debts .
Greece has lost fiscal independence not because it is moving towards being a part of a federal state but because it cannot any longer raise money in the markets .
Open source hardware hobbyists now have a chipset to play with that 's comparable to the powerful processors found in smartphones such as the Nexus One or HTC Incredible .
Texas Instruments has released a new version of its low - power , single - board computer called BeagleBoard - xM .
It 's based on the same 1 - GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor that drives the most sophisticated smartphones today .
That gives it far more processing power than the leading open - source microcontroller platform , Arduino , which many hobbyists currently use to create robots , sensors , toys and other DIY devices .
The BeagleBoard - xM has multimedia features similar to the processor seen in the Palm Pre and Motorola Droid , and includes on - board ethernet , five USB 2.0 ports and 512 MB of memory .
" It 's a fully loaded , open platform that allows users to run multiple applications and embed them in devices , " says Jason Kridner , ARM software architecture manager and BeagleBoard community manager .
" We wanted to offer something that 's cheap , ups the performance level and has sufficient memory . "
The first BeagleBoard debuted in 2008 , targeting hardware hobbyists who wanted a powerful chipset to build home - brewed gadgets .
But , so far , it has been eclipsed by the simpler open source microcontroller Arduino .
Arduino has become a big hit among DIYers powering an eclectic variety of projects including electronic textiles , a fire - breathing dragon and many robots .
BeagleBoard is n't as popular , even though it packs in more technical firepower .
Some hobbyists say that could change as open source hardware hackers get more ambitious and move beyond what a simple microcontroller can do .
The 3 - inch–square BeagleBoard - xM runs a full Linux operating system with desktop managers and office applications .
It also includes a 2 - D and 3 - D graphics accelerator , a port to add a computer monitor and an S - video port for TV .
BeagleBoard will let hobbyists and open source hardware enthusiasts go where the Arduino wo n't , says Justin Huynh , a open source hardware hacker .
" A lot of people complain that Arduino is not powerful enough and if you want something that 's more technical and intensive it is just not good enough , " he says .
" So BeagleBoard can be a very interesting alternative . "
And at $ 180 , the BeagleBoard - xM is inexpensive enough to be a technical toy for DIYers , says Hyunh .
" What we have seen happen in the Arduino community is now happening with the BeagleBoard , " he says .
Here are four cool ideas that use the BeagleBoard :
BeagleBoard Videowall — — — — — ——
There are at least two ways to create a large display :
Buy a giant TV screen from Best Buy , or MacGyver a solution using multiple PC monitors .
The BeagleBoard Videowall tries the latter .
It has six 19 - inch LCD monitors networked together over USB to run high definition full - screen video .
" I enjoy the challenge of making the most out of limited resources , and the BeagleBoard is a perfect platform for doing just that , " says Måns Rullgård , an embedded software consultant based in England .
" It has the power to do really cool things if you get it right , while remaining small both in physical size and power consumption . "
Rullgård and his project partners wanted to create " something spectacular " using the BeagleBoard and FFmpeg , open source multimedia libraries and programs .
The resulting Videowall project uses six BeagleBoards , where each board plays a special file containing only the corresponding segment of the video .
The files were created ahead of time on a PC .
To synchronize the playback across the BeagleBoards , they are interconnected with a USB - based network .
The video wall made its public debut in February in Brussels and it will be shown this week at the LinuxTag conference in Berlin .

BeagleBrick — ——
–
" The iPad for Hams , " Beagle Brick aims to be a portable , software - defined amateur ( " ham " ) radio station packaged in a nice , easy - to - use interface .
The 4 - inch x 8 - inch " brick " will have an LCD screen , run Linux and include a number of software applications , especially those that offer a visual graph of amateur radio transmissions .
" It ’s a combination of ham radio and a computer , " says industrial designer and ham radio enthusiast , Robert Thomas , who conceived the idea .
" It ’s also a web server so it can do a lot of things the iPad can't do yet .
It ’s really a communications package . "
The device could cost about $ 600 , estimates Thomas , who has been working on the idea for a year .
He hopes to have the BeagleBrick ready around fall .
" It was designed to be an inexpensive entry point for ham radio enthusiasts , students , educators and other experimenters to study the technology , " says Thomas on his website where he offers early details of software for the device .

Home Media Center on the BeagleBoard — — — — — — — — — — ——
Tired of Boxee ?
Think Apple TV is an underpowered , overpriced machine ?
Then try creating your own media center .
XBMC , formerly known as the Xbox Media Center , is an open source media player and home entertainment software manager that can run on Windows , Xbox and Apple TV among other platforms .
Now take XBMC and run it on the BeagleBoard and it could birth a new , low - cost low - power media player box that is almost entirely open source .
First , XBMC will have to be optimized for the ARM platform that the BeagleBoard is based on .
Over the next few months , with a little help from Google , the project will be underway .
The next step is to get XBMC running on a box with BeagleBoard at its heart .
It may not beat Google TV – scheduled to come out this fall – but it will be a big step forward for open source hardware .

BeagleBoard Meets Bug — — — — — ——
Bug Labs ' open source modules are suitable for building anything from a webcam to your own alarm system .
The BugBase , shown in the photo is a a palm - sized computer with storage , Wi-Fi , Bluetooth , rechargeable battery , mini LCD and USB port .
The platform is the building block for hackers and DIYers who want to create new gadgets in a modular way .
In February , Bug announced that it had moved the BugBase to the Cortex A8 - based OMAP3 core from the original ARM11 .
The result is that BugBase now supports both BeagleBoard apps and Android .
For hackers , it means Android apps can be directly ported onto the Bug hardware .
The ultimate goal is to have developers go beyond consumer products and build specialized hardware that can be used in areas such as health care and telematics , says Bug Labs .

AT&T has announced new data plans for the iPhone , iPad and other smartphones on its network .
In addition , the iPhone will get data - tethering when the iPhone OS4 update hits this summer .
The new plans are rather simple .
DataPlus gives you 200 MB of data per month for $ 15 ( and you can add an extra 200 MB for another $ 15 ) .
DataPro cuts you from the 5 - GB " unlimited " plan to 2 GB and it will cost $ 25 .
Get an additional 1 GB for another $ 10 .
To tether your phone and share its data connection with other devices , you 'll need to buy the $ 20 Tethering plan on top of DataPro .
AT&T is also killing off the $ 30 - per-month ( truly ) unlimited data plan for the iPad , replacing it with the $ 25 , 2 - GB DataPro option .
Before you panic too hard , these new plans , coming into effect June 7th , are for new subscribers only ( although you can opt in without renewing your contract ) .
From the press release :
Existing iPad customers who have the $ 29.99 per month unlimited plan can keep that plan or switch to the new $ 25 per month plan with 2 GB of data .
If you are a heavy data user , this clearly sucks , and it appears that there is no way you can pay extra for an unlimited plan .
[ UPDATE : AT&T just e-mailed me to make clear that you can add " as many buckets of 1 GB / $ 10 as you need beyond the plan 's included 2 GB . "
That 's not unlimited , but $ 10 per GB is n't a bad rate . ]
On the other hand , AT&T says that 98 percent of its smartphone customers average less than 2 GB per month .
In this case , the caps may actually improve the accessibility and speed of AT&T 's beleaguered network for the majority of users .
The cheaper entry - level prices will also let more people get mobile internet .
To help manage your usage , you 'll get a text message when you " reach 65 percent , 90 percent and 100 percent of the threshold , " and AT&T has apps for Blackberry , iPhone and Android to track consumption .
The real losers here are the content providers .
Were you wondering when Hulu would finally get around to making an iPad app ?
Well , quit worrying .
With 2 GB data , you wo n't be able to watch more than a few hours a month , anyway .
One more thing .
That June 7 launch date is the same day that Steve Jobs makes his keynote address at the 2010 WWDC .
Coincidence ?
I doubt it .

“ It ’s kind of the teach - a - person - to - fish school of cultural support , ” Mr. Pinsky said .
The group attending the five - week program includes painters , sculptors , photographers , filmmakers , creative writers , actors , directors , dancers , singers , musicians  and some who defied categorization , like Ryan Murdock .
He said his work encompassed filmmaking , radio documentary and photography , as well as organizing events that brought together “ silent films , live music and homemade pies . ”
He said he had recently quit his job in public television , and hoped to arrive at “ a business structure that will allow me to do everything I want to do , because I ’m too curious to pin myself down . ”

Along with group sessions covering subjects like intellectual property and Internet marketing , each artist has a 20 - minute meeting with a New York Foundation for the Arts staff member or an outside adviser to review his or her business plan .
At the end of the course , the students can apply for subsidized studio or rehearsal space at the Brooklyn Army Terminal , courtesy of Chashama , an organization that transforms vacant properties into art spaces .
“ Artists are not taught to plan , ” said Jackie Battenfield , a painter and the author of “ The Artist ’s Guide : How to Make a Living Doing What You Love . ”
Too often , she said , they ’re “ going in circles , and that ’s very demoralizing . ”
This is the first time the city has financed such a program , though others , like one at the Bronx Museum called Artists in the Marketplace , have long strived to help artists manage their careers .
Most of the artists in the class had some kind of day job .
Many teach .
Mr. Barman , who has released several albums , does freelance journalism and teaches hip - hop to high school students .
Mr. Hinojosa works as an assistant to a more established artist , Shinique Smith .
He has also sold his own works for as much as $ 2,000 , and thinks that he ’ll eventually be able to make a living from his art .
One benefit to art made from found materials , he points out : “ The supplies are free . ”
The Gulf of Mexico : what role will the Mississippi River play in oil washing ashore and into delta wetlands ?
One of the spill 's greatest environmental threats is to Louisiana 's wetlands , scientists believe .
But there may be good news ahead .
Scientists affiliated with the National Center for Earth - surface Dynamics ( NCED ) , a National Science Foundation ( NSF ) Science and Technology Center headquartered at the University of Minnesota , are using long - term field plots in Louisiana 's Wax Lake Delta to measure the baseline conditions of , and track the effects of the oil spill on , coastal Louisiana wetlands .
Robert Twilley and Guerry Holm of Louisiana State University ( LSU ) are investigating the degree to which two delta wetland characteristics may help mitigate oil contamination .
Fresh water head , as it's called , the slope of the water 's surface from a river delta to the sea , and residence time of river - mouth wetlands , the time it takes water to move through a wetland at a river 's mouth , are important to understanding how delta wetlands will respond to the oil spill , say the researchers .
" Since the Mississippi River is currently at a relatively high stage , we expect the river 's high volume of freshwater to act as a hydrologic barrier , keeping oil from moving into the Wax Lake Delta from the sea , " says Twilley .
Twilley and Holm are performing baseline and damage assessments on the plants and soils of , and comparing oil degradation processes in , freshwater and saltwater Louisiana wetlands .
" The Mississippi River 's ' plumbing ' provides a potential benefit to reducing the movement of oil onshore from shelf waters , " says Twilley .
The Mississippi's flow has been altered for flood control to protect people and infrastructure in this working delta .
River diversion structures -- concrete gates built within the levees of the river -- may be operated , however , to allow water to flow to specific coastal basins and floodways , says Twilley , " as a way to provide controlled floods . "
Warm / cool colors show current high / low elevations , respectively , in the Wax Lake Delta .
The operational features of this system " downriver to the control structure near Venice , Louisiana , " he says , " may provide a second line of defense against oil washing in . "
But any strategy using Mississippi River hydrology must be one of clear options and tradeoffs , says H. Richard Lane , program director in NSF 's Division of Earth Sciences , which funds NCED .
" As the river stage falls and protection diminishes , " says Lane , " it becomes a question of how best to distribute this freshwater resource to defend the coast from the movement of oil onshore . "
The answer , Twilley says , lies in the delicate balance of river , coastal and Gulf of Mexico processes " that must work in concert to benefit the incredible ' ecosystem services ' this region provides to the nation . "
Louisiana wetlands " play a vital role in protecting New Orleans from hurricane damage , providing habitat for wildlife , supporting economically important fisheries , and maintaining water quality , " says Efi Foufoula - Georgiou , director of NCED .
" We must look at all options for protecting them for the future . " ﻿
-- Reprint of research summary from National Science Foundation
A sharp view of the starry sky is difficult , because the atmosphere constantly distorts the image .
TU/e researcher Roger Hamelinck developed a new type of telescope mirror , which quickly corrects the image .
His prototypes are required for future large telescopes , but also gives old telescopes a sharper view .
The atmosphere contains ' bubbles ' of hot and cold air , each with their own refractive index , which distort the image .
As a result , the light reaching ground - based telescopes is distorted .
Hamelinck 's system tackles this problem with a deformable mirror in the telescope .
Under this ultrathin mirror there are actuators , which can wherever necessary quickly create bumps and dimples in the mirror .
These bumps and dimples correct the continuously changing distortion created in the atmosphere .
This is of crucial importance to the new generation of large telescopes in particular .
Hamelinck : " In principle , larger telescopes also have a higher resolution , but attaining an optimal optical quality is hampered by the atmosphere .
Therefore you absolutely need these corrections . "
The principle of the ' adaptive deformable mirror ' has been known some fifty odd years , but was limited especially by the technology .
Thus , the actuators of earlier systems generated much heat , which caused the systems themselves to become a source of distortion .
" Contrary to the old systems , this new system has an ultrathin mirror , so that very little power is needed for its deformation , " Hamelinck explains .
" In combination with the efficient , electromagnetic reluctance actuators , this reduces the heat generation of the system to a very low level .
Thanks to this , no active cooling is required . "
Hamelinck 's working prototype has a five - centimeter diameter .
Given that the design is scalable and expandable with modules , the system is suited for very large telescopes , such as the future 42 - meter - big E- ELT ( European Extra Large Telescope ) .
The E-ELT is fitted inter alia with an adaptive mirror of 2.4 meters .
Research institute TNO is so enthusiastic about Hamelinck 's work , that the institute is going to market it .
Not only so for new telescopes , but also for existing ones .
" It can be built into any telescope in the world , " says Ben Braam , business developer Space & Science of TNO .
" When you turn on the system , the image is suddenly enhanced .
As if it is putting on new spectacles at long last . "
Affordable spectacles , in Braam 's opinion .
" I 'm thinking in terms of fifty to one hundred thousand euro .
Which is relatively cheap for that world . "
Admittedly , the system does not correct for everything .
Clouds continue to be a problem , for example .
Consequently the best places for telescopes are still locations where one can enjoy a clear , cloudless sky most of the time .
That would exclude the Netherlands , then .

Mass Stalker Build :
Vs 4 Gate All - In : ( = )
Generally 4 - 5 gate will have the advantage earlier on , but as game progresses and mass Stalker blink kicks in the game will start to swing to mass Stalkers .
Overall the match up is pretty even I think it comes down a lot to micro / positioning by both players .
Either player can probably squeeze out some value with +1 attack upgrade .
Mass Stalker is more fun to play though imo .
Vs Colossus : ( ≤ )
This can be a closer match up , a lot comes down to micro .
If the Colossus player scouts mass Stalker or knows its coming then the smarter build would be to stay with Immortals .
If The Colossus player already invested into Colossus though then stick to it .
It comes down to micro really but with the ability to get an observer the Colossus player should bide his time until he can get a critical number of Colossus and move out .
The Stalker player should try to atilla the hun ( read : INSANE micro ) micro vs Colossus player and maybe invest in a + 1 forge upgrade and / or an expo .
I would give a very slight advantage to the Colossus player .
Vs 2 - 3 Gate Immortal : ( ≤ )
This is a hard match up for mass Stalkers but a better micro player can pull it off .
If you are in a good position map wise , you may be able to attack your opponents main before having to return to your own base .
If you can do this and defend the subsequent counter - attack , you will most likely have gain the advantage .
Once again the mass Stalker player might be able to sneak in a +1 for an advantage in the first major engagement .
You want to dance your Stalkers around your opponent 's army without committing to a large attack , which is exactly what your Immortal opponent will try to do .
Nice force field / positioning after a mass blink can easily win the game for immortal player .
Vs Void Ray : ( > )
Not much to say here , blink Stalkers are the pure counter to Void Rays .
As long as you do n't seriously mess up something mass stalker should be ahead here every time
Vs Phoenix : ( > )
Although tougher then playing against Void Rays , mass Stalker should still come out ahead ; maybe with a few Zealots and Sentries .
With blink you can easily pick off Phoenixes without taking losses and generally with good micro you will beat the Phoenix player in a major engagement .
Vs Dark Templar Rush : ( < )
For obvious reason your not going to have detection , but with some smart play if u see the Dark Templar coming through little ripples on your screen you can hold it off with Sentry call - in / fast forge and force field blocks .
You will still be behind though if you fend it off because Dark Templars give map control and an easy opportunity to expand .
4 - 5 Gate All - In Build :
Vs Colossus : ( < )
4 - 5 Gate obviously has a huge advantage early on , and huge disadvantage later on .
At the higher levels your not going to be able to pull it off unless you hide it really really well , or its on a open map ( Scrap Station ramp , Kulas Ravine choke , etc. )
Generally if you do n't do a good amount of damage within first 10 - 15 minutes you will slowly but surely fall behind unless you can manage to get an expansion up and pull off some great micro .
The Colossus player will be looking to bide his time until he knows he can steamroll over his opponent 's puny gateway army .
Vs 2 - 3 Gate Immortal : ( ≤ )
4 - 5 Gate will have the advantage early on , but slowly move to a disadvantage later on .
It is n't as bad as facing Colossus , but it still is a similar situation .
If you do n't do damage early on your going to fall far behind , but like every PvP match up good force field and micro will win you the game anyways ^^ ( LOL ) .
Vs Void Ray : ( > )
The 4 - 5 Gate will come out ahead here just because even if they wait for 2 - 3 Void Rays before showing up , your going have good early pressure and know SOMETHING is up .
You can easily throw down 5 stalkers immediately in addition to the units you already have .
After that just play smart and you should come out on top .
Vs Phoenix : ( > )
The game should play out the similar to fighting Void Rays .
Most Phoenix builds have a decent number of gateway units added in but you should have more units then he does overall .
As long as you do n't make some major mistakes .
Vs Dark Templar : ( < )
For obvious reasons ... like in mass Stalker vs Dark Templar if you can somehow manage to spot it or predict it , or see little ripples , you can survive .
Your going to want to warp in Sentries asap and force field your choke until u can get cannons and observers but either way it seems like your going to be behind here .
Colossus Tech Build :
Vs 2 - 3 Gate Immortal : ( > )
You 're going to have the edge here with higher tech vs a usually more passive / defensive player that for whatever reason thought you were n't going Colossus .
Either way the Immortal player will probably want to transition to Colossus after making the mistake of opening with immortal , and will be slightly behind .
The Colossus player would be smart to scout well and come out when range is upgraded ; usually enabling a good timing window to end game .
Vs Void Ray : ( ≤ )
It sucks when you rush Colossus and Thermal Lances / your first Colossus are about 1/2 way done when 2 void rays enter your base .
At this point your behind and should look to transition into 3 - 4 Gate +
Immortal ( if you can ) .
The Void Ray player needs to attack with a ground army and Void Rays , and try to win with early advantage if possible .
If you do opt to stick with Colossus then you 're going to be at a disadvantage just because your unit composition is going to be a lot harder to balance out then your opponent's .
Vs Phoenix : ( < )
Your going to be in a similar position as facing Void Rays except that now even if you transition to Immortals , they can be constantly liftoff / raped by phoenix 's anyways .
Your going to be very behind so basically do the same thing as you would against Void Rays and hope you can pull off some good micro or your opponent makes mistakes .
Vs Dark Templar : ( > )
With a Robotics you can easily get or already have an observer if they decide to Dark Templar rush you .
Basically your looking at an attack - move win here .
2 - 3 Gate Immortal :
Vs Void Ray : ( ≥ )
This is a pretty close match up and I 'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me but I feel like the immortal player can easily transition here while the Stargate player is more locked to what he started .
Generally the starting unit compositions are equal coming down to micro but I still will give the advantage here to Immortal player .
Watch out if the Void Ray Protoss tries to transition into Phoenixes however .
Vs Phoenix : ( > )
Also pretty close , usually Void Ray / Phoenix builds are pretty similar vs others .
I think Phoenix's are safer here but would get less " free wins " then Void Ray ( also very true in PvZ ) .
I would give the advantage to the Phoenix build , then Void Rays vs Immortals but its really close .
The liftoff ability really kills Immortals because in most battles you 're going to be able to always disable them or just target their anti-air , then clean up the rest later .
Vs Dark Templar : ( > )
Observers + attack move = gg .
Void Ray Build :
Vs Phoenix : ( < )
Although i have n't tested it Phoenixes should come out here as the victor as long as proper micro takes place , but i would assume 1 if not both players would transition here ( this is the key factor in why you never see this build happen ) .
Either way it would be pretty interesting to see since no matter what charge Void Rays beat Phoenixes , but Phoenixes have a faster movement speed and can harass Probes .
It could be extremely micro intensive .
Vs Dark Templar : ( ≤ )
This match up is the rarest / funniest IMO .
Basically what it comes down to is HOPEFULLY if your the Void Ray player your going to scout the Dark Templar when u attack his main , and HOPEFULLY your going to know to sentry / cannon / robo .
Even still , after all that your going to be a bit behind because if the Dark Templar player does n't flat out kill you , he is going to have free map control and easy access to blink Stalkers , which means once you do come out your going to be against a mass gateway army with blink stalkers and an earlier expo .
Phoenix Build :
Vs Dark Templar : ( < )
Similar to Void Rays except it depends on how you play it .
Some people who go Phoenix will hide it until they get 3 - 5 , while others will scout with 1 asap to see whats up .
If you scout with 1 and see the Dark Shrine your going to be ahead because you will have more then ample time to adjust accordingly .
If you wait for 4 - 5 your finished because they are going to have Dark Templar in your base before you even move out .
Wow , that 's a lot of data to sift through !
Give us your thoughts and opinions !

If you wait for 4 - 5 your finished because they are going to have Dark Templar in your base before you even move out .

The Israeli attack on the Gaza - bound flotilla sounded " the death knell of the Zionist regime , ” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told an enthusiastic crowd at Istanbul 's Abou Ayyoub Ansari Mosque on Tuesday .
He accused Israel of “ unmatched crimes in the course of sixty some years of its history , that have been unprecedented in the history of mankind , the last of which has been invading the Gaza Peace Flotilla , ” IRNA reported , added that the crowd responded with " Allahu akbar " Ahmadinejad was in Turkey for the summit of a 20 - member group of Asian countries – CICA – at which Turkey intended to propose a resolution condemning Israel 's flotilla raid .
The Iranian president said the two nations were the “ standard bearers of humanity and moralities ” emphasizing , “ everyone should know that the relations between the two countries are friendly , brotherly and deep rooted today and that the two countries would stand side by side till the end of the line , ” IRNA reported .
On Monday , Israeli officials said the two ships the Iranian Red Crescent had announced it would be sending to Gaza would not be allowed to reach their destination .
“ If we did n’t let an Irish ship reach Gaza , we are certainly not going to let Iranian ships pass , ” one diplomatic official said .
Reflecting upon my previous post , I am wondering why LISP triumphalists like Paul Graham annoy me so much ?
Perhaps it is because I used to be one myself , in spirit if not in syntax .
And also because I now see them as a major symptom of what ails programming .
It is an easy trap to fall into .
Programming requires a certain kind of analytical intelligence .
Being more intelligent in that way increases your programming ability exponentially .
It is emotionally satisfying to think of yourself as a different species from the average programmer .
Programming becomes a demonstration of your superior intellect .
Surely such powers should n’t be wasted on mundane chores , but instead applied to timeless works of brilliant inspiration , to be admired by the common programmer only through protective eyewear .
What a load of self - indulgent adolescent crap .
In programming as in the rest of life , attitude trumps intelligence .
I had to learn that the hard way .
My road to perdition was the seemingly noble cause of doing computer science research in the real world .
It is in the crucible of practical problems that great new ideas can form .
Unfortunately the result was a strange brew of triumph and disaster .
I built some systems that were uniquely powerful and far ahead of their time .
Yet they were also wildly idiosyncratic , and deeply flawed in some practical aspects .
I inflicted a legacy of pain upon the programmers who had to work with my misbegotten creations for decades afterwards .
I too was afflicted .
I spent those decades debugging the Frankenstein .
In the OS crash debugger .
In hex .
Because was n’t it oh so clever and efficient to build a radically new kind of database with extreme reliability requirements as a highly multithreaded kernel extension to the OS ?
What may have saved my soul is that I did not sell the company and walk away from my mess .
I stuck with it for 20 years , and eventually cleaned up the mess as best I could with a massive migration to a new framework .
That experience taught me a lot about what really matters in programming .
It is not about solving puzzles and being the brightest kid in the class .
It is about realizing that the complexity of software dwarfs even the most brilliant human ; that cleverness cannot win .
The only weapons we have are simplicity and convention .
Tattoo that on your forehead in reverse so that you always see it reflected in the screen .
What is truly decisive on the battlefield are attitudes : hard work , responsibility , and paying attention to reality instead of the voiceover in your head .
Programming is an embarrassment compared to other fields of engineering and design .
Our mainstream culture is one of adolescent self - indulgence .
It is like something from Gulliver ’s Travels , with the curly - bracketeers vs. the indentationites vs. the parenthesesophiles .
The only thing that everyone seems to agree upon is how stupid all the other programmers are .
Try googling “ stupid programmers ” .
We have met the enemy , and he is us .
Programming will not grow up until our culture grows up .
We can only patiently and persistently do our part to elevate the level of discourse , and share what wisdom we have gained .
P.S. I deleted a bunch of the cursing , but I think I ’ll let the rest stay as a testament to my point .
UNITED NATIONS / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain led calls on Thursday for harsher penalties to be imposed on Iran , as Tehran defied a compromise U.N. sanctions resolution to punish it for its suspected nuclear weapons programme .
The Security Council approved a fourth round of sanctions in as many years on Wednesday , but Iran said it would go ahead with uranium enrichment and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the U.N. resolution should be thrown “ in the waste bin . ”
The 15 - nation council passed a resolution that was the product of five months of talks between the United States , Britain , France , Germany , China and Russia .
With 12 votes in favor , it received the least support of the four sanctions resolutions adopted since 2006 .
Western diplomats argue it gives the EU , United States and allies a legal basis to impose their own much tougher measures .
“ I think it is very important that the European Union does take further measures , that we show the European Union is prepared on this subject and others to use its weight in the world , ” British Foreign Secretary William Hague said .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said shortly before the U.N. vote it could clear a way for individual states and the EU to block foreign firms expanding Tehran ’s oil and gas exports and impose other curbs on business activity .
The diluted U.N. resolution spares Iran ’s energy sector .
U.S. President Barack Obama said : “ We will ensure that these sanctions are vigorously enforced , just as we continue to refine and enforce our own sanctions on Iran . ”
The resolution passed despite “ no ” votes from Turkey and Brazil .
“ We would not want to participate in such a mistake because history will not forgive us , ” Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told Arab League ministers on Thursday .
“ Isolation is not the solution to Iran ’s problems . ”
He said Turkey intended , with Brazil , to continue engaging Tehran , having last month secured a nuclear fuel swap deal that they had hoped would head off sanctions .
Erdogan also announced plans to form a regional free trade zone with Jordan , Lebanon and Syria .
Such moves will add to concerns the pivotal Western ally could be lurching eastward in its alignment .
MISSILE DEAL
Russia , often reluctant in the past to follow the West ’s lead on Iran , said on Thursday the new U.N. sanctions did not oblige it to scrap a controversial deal to deliver surface - to - air missiles to Iran .
The Interfax news agency had earlier cited a Russian arms industry source as saying Moscow would freeze its contract to sell the S - 300 missiles to Iran because of the sanctions .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the new sanctions as a “ positive step .

“ We hope that this positive step will be followed by decisive actions by other countries , including sanctions targeting Iran ’s energy sector , ” he said .
“ This resolution warns Iran that the world ’s leading countries are opposed to its nuclear programme , ” he said .
“ The biggest threat to peace is that the world ’s most dangerous regimes arm themselves with the most dangerous weapon . ”
Israel , whose jets bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981 and what it said was a nuclear facility in Syria in 2007 , has hinted it could use force to deny Iran the means to build an atomic bomb .

IRAN DEFIANT
Iran ’s envoy to the U.N. nuclear watchdog in Vienna said the sanctions would not undermine a nuclear programme it insists is for purely civilian purposes .
“ Nothing will change .
The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue uranium enrichment activities , ” Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanieh said .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said sanctions were “ the same as pesky flies .
“ These resolutions have no value ... it is like a used handkerchief that should be thrown in the waste bin , ” he added .
The sanctions resolution calls for measures against new Iranian banks abroad if a connection to the nuclear or missile programs is suspected , as well as vigilance over transactions with any Iranian bank , including the central bank .
It expands a U.N. arms embargo against Tehran and blacklists three firms controlled by Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines and 15 belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps .
The resolution also calls for setting up a cargo inspection regime similar to one in place for North Korea .
“ The sanctions are n’t crippling by any means , ” said Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London , “ and are unlikely to change any minds in Tehran but they wo n’t pass unnoticed either . ”
He said their effectiveness would depend on implementation , in the past sometimes lax on the part of Russia and China .
Pakistan said a $ .7.6 billion project to export Iranian natural gas to Pakistan would be unaffected by the new steps .
EU diplomats said European states planned to use the U.N. move to impose their own unilateral sanctions and could agree on them in July .
The restrictions would target a number of Iranian banks and insurance companies , particularly those involved in trade finance , as well as more units of Iranian shipping group Irisl .
The companies would in effect be added to a U.N. blacklist of firms whose assets around the world are frozen on suspicion of providing aid to Tehran ’s nuclear or missile programmes .
In Washington , House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman predicted Congress would pass additional sanctions this month .
Rep. Peter King ( R - N.Y. ) said Sunday he is planning to introduce a resolution next week defending Israel against criticism it has received over its handling of the Gaza flotilla incident .
King , the ranking member on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security , told the conservative blog contentions of his plan and criticized the Obama administration 's stance on the matter .
Jennifer Rubin writes :
I asked whether he was surprised that the Obama team went along with a UN resolution on the flotilla , even a watered - down one , rather than vetoing it , as past administrations have done in similar situations to hold back the tide of Israel bashing .
He replied bluntly , “ No . ” He continued , “ This is basically what we have seen from day one – [ the administration ] putting distance between itself and Israel . ”
He believes there is a conscious effort by Obama to deny Israel the “ privileged status ” it has enjoyed as a close , democratic ally of the United States .
This is part and parcel , he explains , of the “ apology tour , how Netanyahu was treated , and [ asserting ] the moral equivalency between housing construction in Jerusalem and Iran constructing a nuclear weapon . ”
What does King intend to do when Congress returns tomorrow ?
He announces that he will send a “ Dear Colleague ” letter out on Monday , calling on all House members to join in a resolution that will be introduced in the next few days .
The resolution will include “ many paragraphs on Israel ’s right to defend itself , ” take issue with the critics of Israel , call for the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council , and demand that the administration oppose any U.N. investigation of Israel .

This weekend marks the 65th anniversary of V - E Day , the end of the Second World War in Europe .

It 's the first time active - duty U.S. troops have been invited to march in the ceremony .

For millions , the war in Europe did not end in 1945 : Vicious guerrilla warfare continued in the Baltics and Ukraine until the early 1950s ; ethnic groups deported by Stalin during the war remained in exile ; and German POWs were kept for years as forced laborers in the Soviet Union .
But Victory Day is not an occasion for ambivalence .
It marks the final collapse of a genocidal regime , a victory that would not have been possible without the sacrifice of millions of Soviet lives .
And for a child of the Reagan era , it 's always heartwarming for me to see U.S. and Russian soldiers meeting as friends and allies .
It 's an image reminiscent of the famous Meeting on the Elbe , the photo opportunity that foreshadowed the end of the Cold War .
And it 's a reminder of the hope for peace and reconciliation .

A new study from the Netherlands has shown that moderate tea and coffee drinking helps to protect people from heart disease .
The comprehensive study looked at the relationship between coffee and tea drinking and morbidity and mortality with respect to strokes , heart disease , and other causes of mortality .
The researchers studied 37,514 people in The Netherlands for about thirteen years .
The specifics of their study were published in the American Heart Association ( AHA ) journal Arteriosclerosis , Thrombosis and Vascular Biology .
The title of the study is : ' Tea and Coffee Consumption and Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality
It was authored by : J. Margot de Koning Gans ; Cuno S.P.M.
Uiterwaal ; Yvonne T. van der Schouw ; Jolanda M.A. Boer ; Diederick E. Grobbee ; W. M. Monique Verschuren ; and Joline W.J. Beulens .
The scientists are associated with at least one of the following two organizations : the Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care ( University Medical Center Utrecht , Utrecht , the Netherlands ) and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment ( Bilthoven , the Netherlands ) .
Page two concludes with the major conclusions of the study .
three to six cups of tea per day
According to the June 18 , 2010 WebMD article Tea , Coffee Drinkers Have Lower Heart Risk , the following are the results of the study : '¢
People who drankhad alower risk of death from heart disease than people who drank less than one cup of tea a day .
'¢ Drinking more than six cups of tea a day was associated with a 36 % lower risk of heart disease , compared to drinking less than one cup .
'¢ People who drank more than two , but no more than four , cups of coffee a day had about a 20 % lower risk of heart disease than people who drank more or less coffee or no coffee at all .
'¢ Moderate coffee consumption was associated with a slight , but not statistically significant , reduction in death from heart disease , but neither coffee nor tea affected stroke risk .
According to their paper , the researchers concluded : ' High tea consumption is associated with a reduced risk of CHD mortality .
Our results suggest a slight risk reduction for CHD mortality with moderate coffee consumption and strengthen the evidence on the lower risk of CHD with coffee and tea consumption . '

When it comes to climate and energy , most political attention has focused on Democrats , which makes perfect sense — they ’re in the majority and they ’re the ones putting together a bill .
Photo : Jared Rodriguez / truthout.org via FlickrBut it is worth pausing periodically to contemplate the utter corruption and intellectual bankruptcy of today ’s Republican Party .
Darren Samuelsohn has a great story in Politico today noting that Republicans in the Senate are absolutely united in their refusal to work with Democrats on … well , anything , but specifically this energy bill .
In particular , they are united in their opposition to the one policy that virtually every energy analyst and a growing majority of businesses agree is the core of a credible energy strategy : a price on carbon pollution .
This is true even of the few remaining ( purported ) “ moderates ” on the Republican side , like Sens. Dick Lugar ( Ind. ) , George Voinovich ( Ohio ) , and Lisa Murkowski ( Alaska ) , who are abandoning their previous willingness to act responsibly in favor of slavish obedience to their retrograde caucus leader Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) .
Lugar says before we price carbon pollution , “ we really need to know more . ”
What does that mean ?
This policy has been on the table for 30 years , scrutinized to a faretheewell by every agency in the government and dozens of independent analysts , and implemented by numerous other countries and dozens of U.S. states .
What does Lugar want to know , exactly ?
When the teabaggers are going to release his testicles ?
Look at this remarkable passage :
Several energy industry officials — preferring certainty from Congress this year ahead of expected EPA climate rules next year — are upset about the GOP ’s reluctance to work with Democrats on the climate bill .
“ Bottom line is why would they want to try to kill it at all when coal faces a barrage of regulations , ” one power company source said .
“ Without putting a price on carbon , it will be very difficult to build nuclear or put money into clean coal , etc .
We are moving to a totally natural gas future , and they are not helping spur jobs or helping the coal industry by not working collectively to solve the problem . ”
This is an underappreciated phenomenon :
With a few exceptions , most people in the business community want Congress to act on this .
They need to know the rules of the game ; they need to be making 40 - and 50 - year investments .
Republicans are n’t even serving their interests any more .
They have drifted into their own hermetically sealed world , utterly dominated by their teabagger fringe .
One last point .
I ’m surprised Darren let this pass :
Republican leaders counter that they ’ve pitched their own alternatives — more nuclear power , incentives for electric cars — that are much less expensive but that could make a sizable shift in the nation ’s energy future .
The fate of big - ticket climate legislation , Republicans say , rests on the Democrats and not their members .
This has become the standard Republican line :
We offer weak , useless alternatives that justify our opposition to anything real or efficacious .
But Darren should n’t let them get away with saying their energy alternatives are “ much less expensive . ”
The whole point of pricing carbon is that it pays for all the incentives .
The Waxman - Markey bill and the Senate climate bill would both reduce the deficit ; Republican alternatives ( and Bingaman ’s weak - ass energy bill ) would increase it .
Good climate policy is good fiscal policy .
Republican plans to lavish the industries and technologies they favor with subsidies — which is called “ picking winners ” when Democrats do it — are new spending that ’s not paid for .
They are , by definition , “ more expensive ” than alternatives that are paid for .
This is a key aspect of the climate debate on which the mainstream media has utterly dropped the ball : Democratic plans on climate and energy are not only more environmentally credible , they are more fiscally credible .
Republican plans would achieve less at greater total cost to federal coffers .
Republicans today are driven entirely by the one principle that remains of a once - proud conservative intellectual tradition : absolute , unremitting opposition to any means of raising revenue .
That ’s it .
The fate of the climate is , like everything else , secondary .
Yet the media just takes their intransigent opposition for granted .
It hardly seems worth remarking any more .
And they never pay a political price for it .
In these circumstances , the country is ungovernable and the climate problem simply can’t be solved .
Soccer Star Proud of Gay Rumor
Soccer star Freddie Ljungberg is proud of swirling rumors calling him
gay , according to an interview in The New York Times Magazine .
" There ’s been a gay rumor for a long time , " said Ljungberg in the article .
" I do n’t mind at all .
I am proud of that . "
Ljungberg , who plays for the Seattle Sounders , says he thinks rumors about his sexual orientation are a " compliment , " and he refuses to acknowledge his sexuality when reporters ask .
The athlete , who loves fashion , says gay people have " amazing style . "
Soccer fans may remember Ljungberg for his stint as a player for London 's Arsenal Football Club , but he left European soccer in 2008 .
He also told Out that he felt " honored " that Calvin Klein recruited him to be the face of its underwear line .
" Mostly , I was honored to be asked by Calvin Klein .
I was worried about how being on a billboard in Times Square for several months would affect my image .
But the impact has been overwhelmingly positive .
The most unusual response is probably that people are always asking me to sign their underwear for them . "

Thursday is the big Android day at Google I /O .
There will be announcements .
We 're going to try to use this blog to deliver more depth and perspective than you can expect from an executive on a stage in a keynote .
So we 've lined up a whole lot of blog posts ; more than any human could be expected to read in a day .
The plan is to have a couple of posts on Thursday summarizing and highlighting what we think are probably the big - news stories .
Then we 'll have more detailed technical pieces every other day or so for the next couple of weeks , filling in the details behind the announcements .
It 's heart - warming how eager the engineers are to tell the world about what they 've been building , and it makes me happy to facilitate the process .
There are other Google blogs that are going to be working hard too , telling the other stories coming out of this gathering .
We 'll post some links to things that seem particularly newsworthy , either to the world in general or to the Android comunity in particular .
Stay tuned !
news Will Munro , by Bruce LaBruce
Will Munro. Photo by John Caffery .
The night before I heard Will Munro had passed on to that great rock ’n ’roll fag bar in the sky , I was sitting in Trinity Bellwoods Park smoking a joint with my good friend and his , Kevin Hegge , the cute young man who used to work at Rotate
This to tell you what cool music to buy .
Earlier in the evening , Kevin and I had gone to see legendary Lydia Lunch at the Royal , whose eloquent spoken - word diatribe against this increasingly fascist world was still ringing in our ears .
Long story short , a young cop emerged from a cherry top to inform us snidely that it was against the law for us to be there at 2:30 a.m. , and that because there was a random empty beer bottle under our bench , he had the right to search our backpacks .
The fact that he failed to find my secret cache of illicit substances , from poppers on up , was the only upside to this sobering encounter , which made me realize , finally , that we are pretty much on the verge of , if not already , living in a police state .
( FYI , Toronto Bylaw Section 608- 9 B states : “ Unless authorized by permit , no person shall use , enter or gather in a park between the hours of 12:01 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. ”
In other words , walking through any public park in Toronto after midnight is illegal and subject to a considerable fine . )
I bring up this incident now because it represents exactly the kind of Toronto — and world — that Will Munro always fought against .
Although Will himself did n’t smoke or drink or do drugs — he was always a straight - edge queen , and a vegan to boot — he never passed judgment on anyone who did , and in fact he was all about celebrating various sorts of nonconformist , rebellious , and anti-authoritarian behaviour .
The loss of Will hits so many of us so hard because he was a warrior in that regard , someone who was offended by the very idea of being boring and conventional .
In his own words , he always said he wanted to see “ a lot of freak flags flying in Toronto . ”
And his , I say with the utmost admiration , was one of the freakiest .
Will was always an art fag par excellence , even in his OCAD days causing consternation with his choice of medium ( found underwear , largely ) and his defiant , open queerness .
For many years , he volunteered at an LGBT youth crisis hotline , providing an empathetic ear for kids who found it difficult to cope in a homophobic world .
Empathy , in fact , was one of the essential parts of Will ’s character .
He was a great listener , and he always made you feel good about yourself .
He also rarely had a bad thing to say about anybody .
These are exceedingly rare qualities .
Let there be no mistake , though : Sheena was a punk rocker .
Will had a very distinct punk sensibility , both in musical taste and attitude , and he enjoyed walking on the wild side .
He had a fondness for the macabre and the grotesque , occasionally dressing up in drag as a zombie hag from hell .
His infamous guerilla birthday parties , wherein dozens of his friends and comrades would descend in costume on a particular subway car and party while literally hanging from the overhead handrails by their knees , creating general panic and a public nuisance , were just his style .
No mindless vandalism , no hostility : just a fun reminder that it ’s okay to act out in public , to break the rules , to challenge the status quo .
It ’s hard to imagine getting away with something like that in Toronto now .
More ’s the pity .
Will was a real Renaissance man — a successful artist ( collaborating with a host of Toronto ’s most creative characters , including Luis Jacob and Jeremy Laing ) , but also a respected DJ , promoter , activist , and restaurateur .
He truly hit his stride with Vazaleen , a club night that allowed him to combine all his favourite obsessions : punk and no -wave rock ’n ’roll music , queers , dykes , trannies , pornography , performance art , go - go dancers , wild costumes , public indecency , strap - on dildos , what have you .
He was the only promoter in town who consistently brought in the international royalty of queer and underground performers , everyone from Stink Mitt to Limp Wrist to Vaginal Crème Davis to Cherie Curie to Jayne County to Carol Pope to the Toilet Boys to Kembra Pfahler .
( I took a particularly memorable road trip to Niagara Falls with Kembra and Will the day after she performed at Vazaleen , a memory I will always cherish . )
He also provided an early platform for now more widely known musical forces such as Peaches , The Hidden Cameras , and The Gossip .
Vazaleen , which started at the El Mocambo before moving to Lee ’s Palace , was the first real homo club of note outside the gay ghetto , opening up queer culture to a broader audience of like - minded misfits of all genders and sexual persuasions .
In Will ’s own words : “ When I started doing Vazaleen I was like finally there is a space where you can do fucking anything and no one is going to turn their nose up at you . ”
In a nutshell , that was Will ’s credo .
Will insisted on being inclusive , but he also never betrayed his old school gay roots .
Of all his club nights , one of my favourites was Moustache , which he held upstairs at Remingtons , Toronto ’s only gay male strip bar .
It was so much fun to see people of all sexes and ages participating in the amateur strip competition alongside the professional male strippers and the regular clientele .
Only
Will could pull off that kind of bizarre cultural fusion .
After Vazaleen ,
Will doggedly pursued his promise of creating life outside the ghetto by turning the Beaver Café ( with Lyn McNeil ) into the first real hothouse of queer activity on the west side .
It was only after several successful years there that he discovered he had a brain tumour .
It was a particularly aggressive from of cancer ( one more often found in children ) , and it ’s a testament to his heart and determination , his unwaveringly positive attitude about everything , and his sheer love of life that he valiantly fought the disease for two years .
I think we all believed that if anyone could beat it , against all conceivable odds , Will could .
The last time I had a chance to speak at length with Will was at his art opening at the Paul Petro gallery a couple of months ago .
( I ’ve reviewed the show in the latest issue of C Magazine . )
The cancer had already come back with a vengeance and he was a bit fragile , but what struck me was that he maintained the same commitment to his art , the same positive energy , the same consistency of attitude , and the same generosity of spirit that he ’d always had .
It was beyond humbling .
From all reports ,
Will was surrounded by an extremely loyal , loving , and supportive group of family and friends , including his boyfriend Peter , until the end .
I know that many people are profoundly and painfully feeling the loss of this gentle , elegant soul , including yours truly .
Toronto is already a much , much dimmer and less bearable place without him .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
Late May 2010 brought peacock - hued swirls of blue and green to the North Atlantic .
The iridescent waters formed a giant arc hundreds of kilometers across , extending from west of Ireland to the Bay of Biscay .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured this natural - color image on May 22 , 2010 .
The vibrant colors are from tiny organisms , phytoplankton , that grow explosively in the North Atlantic — from Iceland to the shores of France — in the spring and summer .
Phytoplankton require nutrients to reproduce , and phytoplankton blooms are often tied to events that bring nutrients to the ocean surface , such as dust plumes .
Volcanic ash can also contribute nutrients for phytoplankton blooms .
Researchers from the University of Hamburg ’s Institute of Geophysics found that a 2008 eruption of the Kasotochi Volcano in the Aleutian Islands generated a massive phytoplankton bloom in the Northeast Pacific Ocean .
They concluded that iron - rich ash falling on waters that are otherwise poor in iron can create conditions in which phytoplankton thrive .
MODIS acquired this image after weeks of eruptive activity at Iceland ’s Eyjafjallajökull Volcano .
Considering that ash plumes from that volcano closed airspace over much of Europe , one might wonder whether ash provided fertilizer for this bloom .
In this case , the answer is probably no .
The North Atlantic Ocean already contains plenty of iron , and these waters experience massive phytoplankton blooms every spring and summer .

Trees in urban areas deliver a range of benefits , the report says
Trees can play an essential role in improving the quality of life in UK towns and cities , a report has said .
The Woodland Trust says planting more trees has been shown to improve air quality , reduce ambient temperatures and benefit people 's health .
The trend of declining tree cover in many areas needs to be reversed in order to improve access to green spaces in urban areas , the study adds .
The trust is also launching a campaign to plant 20 m native trees each year .
" Towns and cities tend to put into sharp relief some of the key problems we are facing as a society , " said lead author Mike Townsend .
" So they are a good place to start when try to illustrate just where green spaces can deliver significant improvements for relatively little cost . "
Taking cover
The issues outlined in the report included physical and mental health problems , childhood obesity , air pollution , soaring summer temperatures , flash flooding and diminishing wildlife .
The UK has very low woodland cover compared with the rest of Europe Sian Atkinson , Woodland Trust
The trust estimated that 80 % of the UK population live in urban areas , yet less than 10 % of people have access to local woodlands within 500 m of their homes .
" If you look back over history , Victorian times saw a real move towards parks and street trees ; some of the big street trees that you find in our cities today go back to these times , " explained Woodland Trust conservation policy expert Sian Atkinson .
" What we have seen more recently is that there has been reduction in the number of trees being planted , and there has also been a loss of the lovely Victorian trees with big canopies , " she told BBC News .
" We are starting to miss these from our towns and cities , and not enough thought has been given to replacements and to ensuring that there is going to be enough tree cover in the future . "
' Slow the flow '
The report also highlighted the role urban trees could play in preventing flash floods .
Ms Atkinson said : " Hard surfaces in towns and cities have increased in recent years , and we are seeing more flooding .
" One of the problems is surface water drainage .
It has been shown that trees and woods are key to help control this sort of flooding .
" As well as absorbing groundwater , tree canopies help reduce the volume of rainfall hitting the ground and relieve pressure on urban drainage systems .
She called on civic planners to address the issues highlighted by the report .
" This is quite a lot of talk about green infrastructure , " she observed , " and our message is that we hope that trees and woods are a really big part of that . "
In its Programme for Government report , the coalition government announced that it would initiate a national tree planting campaign .
During a speech in May , Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said : " If any organism has demonstrated an ability to multi-task , it 's trees .
" They capture carbon and hold soils together , prevent flooding and help control our climate .
They also add immeasurably to the quality of life of our towns and cities . "
She added that in some parts of inner London , it was calculated that each tree was deemed to be worth as much as £ 78,000 in terms of its benefits .
Ms Atkinson welcomed the government 's announcement : " The UK has very low woodland cover compared with the rest of Europe .
We are actually looking for a doubling in native woodland cover .
" There are some areas that have more cover than others , but - overall - there is quite a big job to do in order to increase tree cover to a level that provides all the benefits outlined in the report . "
To coincide with the publication of the report , the Woodland Trust is also launching a More Trees More Good campaign , which will look to plant 20 m native trees across the UK for the next 50 years .

Time Magazine 's May 31 issue will hit newsstands with a cover and feature story dedicated to the " scary " side of Facebook .
The cover art pays homage to the Facebook generation with a mosaic of 1,295 Facebook profile photos , accompanied by a blurb from the feature article : " Facebook ... and how it 's redefining privacy .
With nearly 500 million users , Facebook is connecting us in new ( and scary ) ways . "
The feature article by Dan Fletcher delves inside Facebook and its methodologies for hooking new users and explores the historical events leading up to present - day privacy concerns around Open Graph and instant personalization .
At first glance , the feature story appears less critical than the cover makes it out to be .
But Fletcher lends a sharp eye to Facebook 's grand vision and enormous growth , and eventually concludes that Facebook is on the path to become " the Web 's sketchy Big Brother , sucking up our identities into a massive Borg brain to slice , dice and categorize for advertisers . "
Although Time Magazine no longer has the same distribution it once did , the print piece — with its online duplicate — is bound to get traction from a very mainstream audience .
Unfortunately for Facebook , it looks like the controversy around its approach to user privacy is n't going away anytime soon .

7 Ways to Help Gulf Coast Oil Spill Victims from Your Home
If you can't volunteer at the beaches , there are plenty of ways you can help Gulf Coast victims of the BP oil spill from your own home .
When you see photos and videos of the horrific damage to the Gulf Coast waters and marine life caused by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , it ’s tempting to pack everything up and volunteer to clean beaches or clean off oil - soaked animals .
But you ca n’t leave your home , family , or job at a moment ’s notice — and besides , most of the volunteer positions require special certifications that you probably do n’t have .
So how can you help Gulf Coast victims of the oil spill from the comfort of your own home ?
Here are a few ideas .
Donate .
If you ca n’t physically aid the clean - up efforts , your dollars will help in your absence .
Great non-profits who could use your contribution include the National Wildlife Federation , which is helping injured animals in the Gulf Coast region ; the Gulf Coast Oil Spill Fund from the Greater New Orleans Foundation , which provides help to fishermen who have lost their jobs ; and Defenders of Wildlife , which is advocating for better environmental policies in government to prevent such disasters from happening in the future .
Hold a fundraiser .
If your birthday or another special event is coming up , ask for donations to fund the oil spill clean - up effort instead of presents .
Services like Razoo , FirstGiving , and Crowdrise provide free online platforms to help you raise funds for any US - based non-profit group .
Submit your own idea for how to stop the leak or clean up the spill .
Do you have a background in science and a great idea for containing the spill ?
BP wants to hear it .
Send your suggestion to this site , or call the hotline at ( 281 ) 366-5511 .
All of the ideas are reviewed , and the ones that seem feasible will be tested and potentially used in the clean - up efforts .
Convince your local salons and dog groomers to donate hair to Matter of Trust .
A non-profit group called Matter of Trust is collecting human and animal hair , which can be used to soak up oil in booms .
Spread the word about their efforts with local businesses .
Send a political action message to the White House requesting more aid for the Gulf Coast .
The National Wildlife Federation has a form letter available here .
Become a virtual volunteer .
Do you have skills in fundraising , design , grantwriting , or public relations , and a bit of extra time on your hands ?
Then you can help Gulf Coast victims from home by becoming a virtual volunteer for a non-profit involved with rescue efforts .
Visit Idealist.org to find opportunities , or ask the non-profit of your choice directly if there ’s a way that you can help .
Reduce dependence on oil in your own community .
We ’ll be honest , there ’s no way a single person can curb our country ’s overreliance on oil .
But every little bit helps .
Do your part by riding a bicycle to get around when possible , buying local foods and locally made products , and spreading the word about how to live a more sustainable life .
Check out this post on Planet Green for some great tips for getting off oil .
Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
It is an age - old axiom that little creates absurdities like war , and this notion remains evergreen today .
Take the case of the two victims of gunshot wounds shown in Tyler Hicks ’s photographs , which accompany this post .
Both men were struck by bullets in a gunfight between Marines and the Taliban in Marja on May 29 .
The first victim , the elderly man , had been shot through the right hip .
The Marines assumed he was a civilian .
Under NATO rules , when civilians are wounded in any way related to NATO activity , including when they are struck by stray bullets or caught between fighting forces , they are eligible for military medical care .
This man ’s wound led to the standard reaction .
The Marine patrol in the firefight called for an Army medevac helicopter , which was located on an airfield to the south .
The air crew scrambled .
With an escort aircraft trailing behind , a Blackhawk from the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade , with a medic aboard , was soon racing over the desert to Marja .
Minutes later , the helicopter landed in a field beside where the fighting had been , and the Marines carried the wounded man , whom they had been treating on the spot , to the aircraft ’s open doors , just as if he were one of their own .
With its escort aircraft circling and buzzing the tree lines to suppress any lingering Taliban fighters , the medevac helicopter took off , and began its evasive moves low over the ground , headed to a trauma - care center at Camp Dwyer .
But as they flew away from the landing zone , the aircraft ’s two pilots , Chief Warrant Officer Deric Sempsrott and First Lt. Matthew E. Stewart , spotted a red plume of smoke rising from another field .
They thought a nearby Marine had been shot , and that his patrol was signaling for help .
They banked their Blackhawk into a tight left turn , doubled back and descended toward a field near where they had just picked up the first man .
This was a dangerous move .
The longer a helicopter loiters near a fight , the greater its risk of drawing ground fire , either from small arms or a rocket - propelled grenade .
The pilots did not hesitate .
Soon their aircraft was on the ground .
Its escort was buzzing a fast circle around it again .
The crew waited for the wounded Marine .
No Marine had been hit .
Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
Instead , a second Afghan , the younger man pictured at right , was led toward the aircraft and helped aboard .
He had a gunshot wound , too .
The pilots took off again and banked hard , gathering speed and heading to Camp Dwyer once more .
Sergeant Ian Bugh , the medic , examined the two men and began to treat them .
Under the rules guiding American troops ’ actions in the field , and in alignment with current Western notions of counterinsurgency , this was exactly how civilian casualties were supposed to be handled .
The helicopter landed roughly 10 minutes later , and teams of Navy corpsmen on litter - bearer duty ran out and carried the Afghans to the surgical tent — again , the same treatment that any American service member would get .
The pilots taxied their aircraft to its parking space , and shut the Blackhawk down .
Mission complete .
Then came the twist .
A short while later , after the patients had been evaluated and stabilized , another medic from the Blackhawk detachment visited the hospital to check on the two Afghan men .
He found that when a forensic examination had been conducted of the patients ’ hands , both men had tested positive for gunshot residue .
This meant that in all likelihood they had been firing weapons a short while before .
If this was so , then the most likely explanation was this : they had been firing at the American patrol , and after being shot had assumed the role of wounded civilians , seeking help from the same men they had been trying to kill , and from the same helicopters that , each day , the Taliban fighters try to shoot down .
This is the bizarre world of Afghan war , where both sides know the rules and fight according to them .
For one side , the rules can resemble constraints .
For the other , they can mean opportunity .
NATO ’s rules of engagement govern when , where and how force can be used , and in what forms , from a pistol shot to an airstrike .
They also guide decisions on when and how Afghan homes can be entered .
Rules of eligibility help shape when an Afghan can be given access to the military ’s medical system .
Other rules determine when an Afghan can be detained , and by whom , and for how long , and where , and under what conditions .
Over the years , the rules have shifted repeatedly .
No doubt they will continue to change .
And whenever a change is made , soldiers and Marines often joke that it seems that the Afghans they fight know the new rules as surely as American troops do , and adjust to them immediately .
This seemed to be the case on May 29 — when , if the soldiers had it right , two Afghans fighting the Americans took a break when they got shot , tossed aside their rifles or machine guns , and chose the wounded civilian option to hitch a ride from their enemy to their enemy ’s top - shelf gunshot - trauma care .
How the case ends is anyone ’s guess .
The medic who checked on the patients said they were being fingerprinted and undergoing iris scans .
This meant that they were being logged into the military ’s biometric database .
This might help identify them , or link to them to crimes or other firefights .
But military officers and law enforcement contractors said the Afghan government often does not accept the results of gunshot residue tests as evidence .
Medics and pilots have no say in matters of detention .
They are , in a simple sense , a high - risk ambulance service , bound by rules and a propelled by a desire to recover patients from dangerous places in the service of saving lives .
They move the patients , an early leg of what is often a patient ’s long journey .
Other people decide the next steps .
After the mission , Chief Warrant Officer Sempsrott accepted the news of the forensic evidence calmly .
“ It does n’t surprise me , ” he said , and shrugged .
Dwelling on unpleasant facts serves little purpose , at least for crews that wait beside an airstrip for a call that could come at any time .
One mantra here is this :
Put aside the last mission .
Be ready for the next , whatever it might bring .
Despite the rain , around 2,000 demonstrators gathered in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday to march in protest of Israel ’s May 31st attack on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla .
Only 5 days prior , many of these same activists gathered on this same city block in a significantly smaller demonstration in support of the embarking 6 - ship convoy , which carried over 600 international activists and 10,000 tons of aid meant for the besieged residents of Gaza .
This latest , much larger protest is one of many actions against the illegal attack across the globe , from Malaysia to Beirut to Sweden .
Showing up in force were hundreds of veteran Palestinian - rights activists representing numerous organizations , including Jews Say No , the Palestinian right - to - return coalition Al - Awda , and the orthodox Anti-Zionist group Neturei Karta .
But , as the large turnout suggests , there was something different about these latest protests .
The crowd included many folks like Michael , who was watching the rally enthusiastically from outside the police barrier .
“ It ’s nice to see this , ” he said .
“ It ’s nice to see people are finely waking up . ”
Michael , who stopped by the demonstration after work , is not an experienced activist ; he is one of a growing number of conscientious citizens pushed to speak up and take action by Israel ’s increasingly brutal and illegitimate aggression .
Echoing the words of many attendees , Michael said , “ This , for me , was a boiling point . ”
As protesters made their way down 42nd Street towards Times Square , where the gathering wrapped up , they expressed dismay and frustration over Israel ’s attack on the flotilla , as well as over the ongoing siege of Gaza , which necessitated the flotilla ’s mission .
Sarah Wellington , with the Activist Response Team , said , “ I ’m here because we need to stand up and speak out against Israel shamelessly murdering people . ”
She handed out signs reading “ Israel attacks again ” and “ Stop the Israeli blockade . ”
Condemnation of the United States and its policy of unconditional support for Israel was equally prevalent .
Dana Balicki , an organizer with the peace group Code Pink , called the U.S. response “ abhorrent . ”
Signs and chants demanded an end to U.S. military aid to Israel , which amounted to at least $ 7 million each day during Fiscal Year 2009 , and urged President Obama to hold Israel accountable for its intransigence .
Activist Debra Sweet said she felt that Americans have a particular responsibility to hold their government accountable since the U.S. provides Israel with such enormous funding .
Code Pink ’s Balicki stressed the need to put pressure on the Obama administration to stop letting Israel get away with continued indefensible violence against civilians .
As more Americans wake up and speak out , Obama is bound to feel the pressure .
“ There will be more protests , ” Balicki promised .
“ Operation Cast Lead was a tipping point for a lot of Americans , this is another . ”

ST .
GEORGE --
When a law enforcement officer speeds past you , most of us believe he is doing so to protect us .
His or her speed , we assume , is justified because they 're going to save lives .
But what if the officer was driving more than double the speed limit to a scene that was already under control ?
Are his or her actions still justified ?
During a horrific crash in St. George in March , a Utah Highway Patrol trooper was rushing to a separate accident and crashed into a car carrying two sisters .
The trooper was cleared of any wrongdoing , but a source close to the investigation says what happened was wrong .
It was Wednesday , March 10 , and the LDS church building near 900 South and River Road was buzzing with women headed to a luncheon .
Sisters Karen Gummow , 71 , and Ila Jean Moore , 75 , had just pulled out of their housing community across the street and were waiting to turn left toward the church .
They never made it .
" I heard the sound , and the car flew up in the air , " witness Betty Yeater recalls .
Kay Pinkston , who also witnessed the accident , says , " My car shuttered .
There was glass , debris , the smell of gasoline . "
" Nobody could have lived through that , " Yeater says .
" There was no way . "
The sisters ' tan Buick was struck by a Highway Patrol trooper 's car traveling at 86 miles per hour -- nearly double the speed limit .
Both women were ejected from the vehicle ; neither survived .
The trooper walked away with minor injuries .
UHP Trooper Lars Gardner was interviewed by police shortly after the fatal accident
The Washington County Attorney 's Office ruled it was an accident , that Trooper Lars Gardner was not negligent in the crash .
But a source familiar with the investigation told KSL evidence to charge Gardner was there and ignored .
According to the source , pressure was placed on investigators to clear Gardner of any wrongdoing and , despite an investigator 's recommendation to charge him , he was cleared .
Gardner was responding to an accident 45 miles away that was already at least 30 minutes old .
According Gardner 's interview after the accident , he did not leave immediately .
" He asked me if I could come out , and I said , ‘ Yeah , let me clean up , get dressed , grab a snack , and I 'll be on my way , ' " Gardner said .
Gardner took time to grab some food , then started heading north on River Road .
He sped with lights flashing through several intersections , hitting speeds over 85 miles per hour in a 40 mile per hour zone .
" The law in the state of Utah is that even bad mistakes in judgment by law enforcement officer in the course of his duties do n't arise to criminal negligence , " says Washington County Attorney Brock Belnap .
After a source questioned the investigation , we took all of the records to an independent expert outside the state of Utah .
His analysis :
The case was investigated thoroughly and properly .
But the source who is familiar with the case says the evidence proved the trooper was traveling too fast and taking too many risks , just to get to an accident scene already under control .
" We 're dealing with the Highway Patrol 's policy , and the Highway Patrol 's policy does n't have any upper limit , " Belnap says .
Belnap says because the UHP does n't set an upper speed limit , he can't charge a trooper with doing something policy says he is empowered to do .
Attorney and former prosecutor Greg Skordas was not involved in the case but questions whether the call for assistance justified Trooper Gardner 's actions .
" Was he going to a scene where his attention was needed immediately ?
Was it an emergency ?
You have to weigh the social utility of what 's he doing with the conduct that he 's using , " Skordas says .
Signs of what happened that Wednesday afternoon on River Road have started to fade -- there 's only a slight trace of spray paint on the asphalt .
But for the eight children Karen Gummow left behind , they lost both their mother and aunt .
" She was ripped right out of our lives , " says Gummow 's daughter , Melinda Olsen .
" But I know he 's got to live with that the rest of his life . "
The Commission of Peace Officer Standards and Training ( POST ) , the council that disciplines officers , did not discipline Trooper Gardner is any way .
He is now back on duty .
An attorney for Gummow 's family says they want to see a change to Utah law that would dictate speeds for all law enforcement agencies , including UHP .

Tax credit expiration ramifications
This week brought signs of a general real estate recovery as the U.S. Commerce Department announced building starts are up and that building permits are steady and not overly ambitious .
With the expiration of the home buyer tax credits , analysts are publishing an array of forecasts for how the market should react with some proving to right and others proving to be completely off .
One of the immediate effects felt in the mortgage world is a drop in volume of mortgage applications which has now hit a 13 year low , down 27 % from the previous month , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
Delinquencies and other bad news
The volume can be recovered with a strong summer , so that is not worrysome , but trouble lies in news that of all mortgage loans in America , 10 % are delinquent .
Even more troubling but less surprising is the continuing failure of the Obama Administration ’s Home Affordable Modification Program ( HAMP ) , now showing that a large number of participants are “ flunking out , ” according to CNN Money .
We ’ve noted before but must reiterate that HAMP is not working .
Politicians are currently considering plans from various states on how they will use funds coming their way , and although the plans are not public , they have been reported to all include subsidizing mortgage payments for underwater homeowners and paying down principle .
Critics point to HAMP as a hesitation for supporting any further government programs in any effort to prop up the residential real estate sector .
This next quarter may be critical for the stabilization of the real estate market as it has the chance to make a stable recovery but could continue to bounce at the bottom if everything does n’t line up properly .
What say you ?
A NSFW Playboy.com article claims to summarize , " how and why women 's breasts have changed over the years , " from '60s torpedo boobs to today 's rounder implant - inspired ideal .
But it is n't women 's breasts that " evolved , " now is it ?
Advertisement
For those who can't ( or wo n't ) click the link , it uses photos of 12 Playmates going back to the '50s to illustrate each decade 's in vogue breast shape .
In the post - WWII era , breasts were " natural , wholesome , fun , " whatever that means .
Apparently the '60s rocket - shaped breasts were a response to the Cuban Missile Crisis : " It was a palpable physiological response to the tension , almost as if to say ' You 're gonna point those things at us ?
Well , we 're gonna point these things right back at you ! ' "
In the '70s boobs were allowed to droop , but with the advent of breast implants in the ' 80s they were required to be round and firm like grapefruits .
Then in the '90s , " smaller , more athletic breasts ( an ' alternative ' to ' 80s racks , if you will ) came back into vogue . "
Playboy claims that in the past decade we 've developed " appreciation for all boobs great and small " — as long as they 're bare and attached to a thin blonde woman , judging from the photos .
While this is a good summation of how breasts have been portrayed in the media in the the past 60 years , unsurprisingly , the anonymous author of the feature acts like women passed around a memo on the new breast style for each decade and developed accordingly .
Obviously in reality , breasts have always come in all these shapes and sizes , but the editors of Playboy decided certain styles were no longer worthy of being ogled in their magazine .

Playboy may no longer be the arbiter of what 's sexy —
I 've never met a guy in his 20s who did n't get his porn on a free internet site — but it 's fascinating to look back through the magazine 's archives and see how the mainstream idea of what a woman should look like has changed .
Recently , I came across some sort of Playboy retrospective in a used book store .
I expected to see curvier Marilyn Monroe types in the older photos , but the models were even fleshier ( and hairier ) than I 'd anticipated .
And their breasts , uh , stood out , in particular — they were different from anything you 'd see in a modern porno .
As I stared at women with large sagging breasts and slightly pudgy thighs and others with totally flat chests complementing their gigantic bushes , all I could think was , " there 's no way Hef would put this woman in the magazine today . "
Unlike the ladies on The Girls Next Door , I did n't dream of having my appearance validated by Playboy as a child , so I was n't very focused on the magazine 's narrow overall portrait of what I should look like naked .
Some of the changes , like the use of thinner models and the sudden appearance of black models in the ' 70s , clearly is n't particular to porn .
However , I do hold the magazine partially responsible for one issue that 's bothered me since I was a teen — the continually changing concept of what breasts should look like .

When I was in high school , my mother complained constantly that I needed a better bra .
At first this was probably true , since I 'd shot up to a DD but was still squeezing myself into a C because I did n't want to go through the irritation of bra shopping .
But even after what I considered a successful trip to Victoria 's Secret , anytime I tried on new clothes she 'd suggest that something was off in the bust or complain that I needed to tighten my straps because I was " hanging too low " as she elegantly put it .
My mom has a ' 50s mindset I did n't fully comprehend until I encountered Betty Draper , and favors the type of bras that come in boxes from the department store .
I always assumed the source of our epic bra conflict was that she wanted her newly - chesty 15 - year - old daughter to wear a matronly support bra contraption rather than a lacy push - up bra that came with a matching thong .

Finally , after one particularly tear - filled shopping excursion during my quest to find a prom dress , I snapped and opened the door to the dressing room with only my bra on .
I asked what , exactly , her problem was with my breasts .
" They 're just so round , " she said .
It was n't that my underwear was too sexy , we had a fundamentally different idea of what breasts should look like .
She preferred her brand of itchy , " full - figure " bras because that 's the closest thing you 'll find to Mad Men undergarments in this day and age .
The sweater - missile shape was drilled into her head as the ideal when she was young .
As someone who grew up in the '90s , shots of Pamela Anderson bouncing down the beach with two half - melons under he swimsuit stuck with me even though I 've never even seen an episode of Baywatch .
Thanks to the boom in implants during my lifetime , I subconsciously pictured breasts like the set modeled by Miss October 2001 in the Playboy article , and was disappointed when I wound up with something closer to Miss January 1973 — so untrendy !
Society 's entire obsession with breasts is bizarre , but it 's particularly strange that they 're the only body part that can go out of style .
There is n't really an ass shape that defined a decade ( though J.Lo may disagree ) , or a nose that fell out of favor in the past 30 years .
Plus , there 's no similarly fetishized body part for men .
Bigger , more muscular chests became popular in the ' 80s with He - Man toys and various Rocky sequels , and that definitely affected boys ' body image at the time ( as shown in the great documentary Bigger , Faster , Stronger . )
But aside from a general demand to be " bigger " you could not make a similar gallery of the most popular peck ( or even penis ) shape of the past few decades .

The idea of an " in " style of body part is insane not only because it does n't have any bearing on what humans actually look like , but because it does n't necessarily reflect what people are attracted to .
It may be more acceptable for current male heartthrobs not to be built , but personally , I 'm less attracted to super - skinny hipster dudes .
People may be influenced by the images they see in porn , but I 'm also pretty sure guys did n't start shunning big - breasted women en masse in the '90s because Playboy featured more small boobs .
I was reminded of this as I read through Playboy 's big book o' naked ladies .
My boyfriend found me in the bookstore , and after pointing out that I should be more discreet about flipping through porn when there are kids running around a store , I showed him the book .
Somehow , even as a man who grew up with internet access , giving him access to an endless barrage of perky , Pam Anderson - esque boobs , he said , " Honestly , I think the women from the older pictures look better . "
And I have to say , he 's been handling the fact that my breasts have been out of style for 40 years rather well .

Evolution Of The Boob [ NSFW ] [ Playboy.com via Buzzfeed ]
On Monday , a number of Russian nationals got arrested for espionage against the US [ 1 ] .
With all the talk and attention paid to cyber spies , spear phishing , APT and new high tech satellites and drones , it is almost refreshing to see that good old fashioned human spies are still used and apparently found valuable .
Skynet has n't taken over quite yet .
However , the story has a few neat cyber security lessons .
Lesson 1 : Encrypt your Wifi
The spies evidently used WiFi networks to communicate .
However , instead of all of them to connect to a particular access point , they established Ad - Hoc networks .
This idea is interesting in so far as it does make remote surveillance of the connection a bit harder .
The FBI had to have a listening post close by in order to intercept the connection .
It appears the FBI used to be parked close to coffee shops and such frequented by the spies in order to observe them meeting with their embassy contacts .
The FBI was able to intercept the communication , and apparently used MAC addresses to track the participant .
It is not clear if any kind of encryption was used for the WiFi connection .
But Ad - Hoc networking would only allow for WEP unless encrypted chat software is used .
As a " sub lesson " one may take away that you should change your MAC address as a spy to avoid tracking .
But it is not clear if this would have made a difference .
One neat side effect of this meeting method :
The participants of the meeting never had to acknowledge each other visibly .
Lesson 2 : Keep your password secure
The FBI followed these spies for a while already .
A few years back , the FBI secretly searched the homes of some of the spies , copying various hard disks in the process .
Small problem :
The hard disk was encrypted .
Luckily , an observant FBI agent noted a piece of paper during the search with a long number / letter combination .
Turned out it was the password .
This turned out to be critical as it allowed the agents to not only decrypt the hard disk , but after decrypting the hard disk the agents found steganography software and other encryption tools , as well as lists of web sites used to exchange steganographic messages .
Lesson 3 : Obscurity !=
Security
The spies to some extend used steganography to exchange messages .
These messages where encoded into an image , and then uploaded to various web sites .
As explained above , the FBI was able to obtain a list of these sites and the software used to encode them .
However , at least according to some reports , the messages were not encrypted .
Typically , if you want to do steganography right , first encrypt the message , then encode it in an image .
In particular if you use standard software to perform your steganography .
( Update : Some reports mention that the messages had been encrypted before encoding them into the images )
Lesson 4 : Perfect forward security
Perfect forward security is an important cryptographic concept .
You never want to use an old password to encrypt the new password .
If you do , once an attacker figured out one password , they will be able to decrypt all future passwords .
It appears that the spies frequently made arrangements about future meetings and communication protocols over insecure channels ( like the ad - hoc wifi ) .
In some ways this may also be considered as relying on obscurity again .

Sodium :
How to tame your salt habit
Find out how much sodium you really need , what high - sodium foods to avoid , and ways to prepare and serve foods without adding sodium .
By Mayo Clinic Staff
If you 're like many people , you 're getting far more sodium than is recommended , and that could lead to serious health problems .
You probably are n't even aware of just how much sodium is in your diet .
Consider that a single teaspoon of table salt , which is a combination of sodium and chloride , has 2,325 milligrams ( mg ) of sodium — more than the daily amount recommended in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) diet .
And it 's not just table salt you have to worry about .
Many processed and prepared foods contain sodium .
See how sodium sneaks into your diet , and find out about ways you can shake the habit .
Sodium : Essential in small amounts
Your body needs some sodium to function properly because it :
Helps maintain the right balance of fluids in your body
Helps transmit nerve impulses
Influences the contraction and relaxation of muscles
Your kidneys naturally balance the amount of sodium stored in your body for optimal health .
When your body sodium is low , your kidneys essentially hold on to the sodium .
When body sodium is high , your kidneys excrete the excess in urine .
But if for some reason your kidneys can't eliminate enough sodium , the sodium starts to build up in your blood .
Because sodium attracts and holds water , your blood volume increases , which makes your heart work harder and increases pressure in your arteries .
Such diseases as congestive heart failure , cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease can make it hard for your kidneys to keep sodium levels balanced .
Some people 's bodies are more sensitive to the effects of sodium than are others .
If you 're sodium sensitive , you retain sodium more easily , leading to fluid retention and increased blood pressure .
If this becomes chronic , it can lead to heart disease , stroke , kidney disease and congestive heart failure .
Sodium :
How much is too much ?
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting sodium to less than 2,300 mg a day .
Keep in mind that these are upper limits , and less is usually best , especially if you 're sensitive to the effects of sodium .
If you are n't sure how much sodium your diet should include , talk to your doctor or dietitian .
Sodium :
What are the major dietary sources ?
The average American gets about 3,400 mg of sodium a day — much more than is recommended .
Here are the main sources of sodium in a typical diet :
Processed and prepared foods .
The vast majority of sodium in the typical American diet comes from foods that are processed and prepared .
These foods are typically high in salt and additives that contain sodium .
Processed foods include bread , pizza , cold cuts and bacon , cheese , soups , fast foods , and prepared dinners , such as pasta , meat and egg dishes .

Natural sources .
Some foods naturally contain sodium .
These include all vegetables and dairy products , meat , and shellfish .
While they do n't have an abundance of sodium , eating these foods does add to your overall body sodium content .
For example , 1 cup ( 237 milliliters ) of low - fat milk has about 100 mg of sodium .

In the kitchen and at the table .
Many recipes call for salt , and many people also salt their food at the table .
Condiments also may contain sodium .
One tablespoon ( 15 milliliters ) of soy sauce , for example , has about 1,000 mg of sodium .
Tips for cutting back on sodium
Virtually all Americans can benefit from reducing the sodium in their diets .
Here are more ways you can cut back on sodium :
Eat more fresh foods .
Most fresh fruits and vegetables are naturally low in sodium .
Also , fresh meat is lower in sodium than are lunchmeat , bacon , hot dogs , sausage and ham .
Buy fresh or frozen poultry or meat that has n't been injected with a sodium - containing solution .
Look on the label or ask your butcher .

Opt for low - sodium products .
If you do buy processed foods , choose those that are labeled low sodium .
Better yet , buy plain whole - grain rice and pasta instead of products that have added seasonings .

Remove salt from recipes whenever possible .
You can leave out the salt in many recipes , including casseroles , soups , stews and other main dishes that you cook .
Look for cookbooks that focus on lowering risks of high blood pressure and heart disease .

Use herbs , spices and other flavorings to season foods .
Use fresh or dried herbs , spices , zest and juice from citrus fruit to jazz up your meals .
Sea salt , however , is n't a good substitute .
It has about the same amount of sodium as table salt .

Use salt substitutes wisely .
Some salt substitutes or light salts contain a mixture of table salt and other compounds .
To achieve that familiar salty taste , you may use too much of the substitute — and get too much sodium .
Also , many salt substitutes contain potassium chloride .
Although potassium can lessen some of the problems from excess sodium intake , too much potassium can be harmful , especially if you have kidney problems or if you 're taking medications for congestive heart failure or high blood pressure that cause potassium retention .
Sodium :
Be a savvy shopper
Taste alone may not tell you which foods are high in sodium .
For example , you may not think a bagel tastes salty , but a typical 4 - inch ( 10 - centimeter ) oat bran bagel has about 600 mg of sodium , and even a slice of whole - wheat bread contains about 150 mg of sodium .
So how can you tell which foods are high in sodium ?
Read food labels .
The Nutrition Facts label found on most packaged and processed foods lists the amount of sodium in each serving .
It also lists whether the ingredients include salt or sodium - containing compounds , such as :
Monosodium glutamate ( MSG )
Baking soda ( also called sodium bicarbonate )
Baking powder
Disodium phosphate
Sodium alginate
Sodium citrate
Sodium nitrite
Try to avoid products with more than 200 mg of sodium per serving .
And be sure you know how many servings are in a package — that information is also on the Nutrition Facts label .
Know the label lingo
The supermarket is full of foods labeled reduced sodium or light in sodium .
But do n't assume that means they 're low in sodium .
For example , a can of chicken noodle soup that claims to have 25 % less sodium still has a whopping 524 mg in 1 cup .
It 's only lower in sodium compared with regular chicken noodle soup , which has more than 790 mg of sodium in a cup .
Here 's a rundown on common sodium claims and what they really mean :
Best choices
Sodium - free or salt - free .
Each serving in this product contains less than 5 mg of sodium .
Each serving in this product contains less than 5 mg of sodium .
Very low sodium .
Each serving contains 35 mg of sodium or less .
Each serving contains 35 mg of sodium or less .
Low sodium .
Each serving contains 140 mg of sodium or less .
What the other sodium label claims mean
Reduced or less sodium .
The product contains at least 25 % less sodium than the regular version .
The product contains at least 25 % less sodium than the regular version .
Lite or light in sodium .
The sodium content has been reduced by at least 50 % from the regular version .
The sodium content has been reduced by at least 50 % from the regular version .
Unsalted or no salt added .
No salt is added during processing of a food that normally contains salt .
However , some foods with these labels may still be high in sodium because some of the ingredients may be high in sodium .
Go low and take it slow
Your taste for salt is acquired , so you can learn to enjoy less .
Decrease your use of salt gradually and your taste buds will adjust .
Consider using salt - free seasonings to help with the transition .
After a few weeks of cutting back on salt , you probably wo n't miss it , and some foods may even taste too salty .
Start by using no more than 1 /4 teaspoon of salt daily — at the table and in cooking .
Then throw away the saltshaker .
As you use less salt , your preference for it diminishes , allowing you to enjoy the taste of the food itself , with heart - healthy benefits .
United Airlines and Continental Airlines agreed Sunday to a $ 3 billion merger that would create the world ’s biggest airline , according to people briefed on the negotiations .
The deal , to be announced officially on Monday , would form a coast - to - coast behemoth with a leading presence in the top domestic markets , including New York , Chicago and Los Angeles , along with an extended network to Asia , Latin America and Europe .
The deal was completed in a remarkably swift three weeks , and would give the airlines the muscle to fend off low - cost rivals at home and to take on foreign carriers abroad .
United is buying Continental , and the combined company will keep the United name and be based in Chicago .
Jeffery A. Smisek , Continental ’s chief executive , would run the company .
If the deal wins antitrust approval , the merged airline would replace Delta Air Lines as the top carrier .
The boards of both companies met Sunday to approve the all - stock deal , according to people familiar with the companies who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were delicate .
The UAL Corporation , United ’s parent company , would issue 1.05 shares for each Continental share , valuing the acquisition at $ 3.17 billion , based on Friday ’s closing price .
The merger is expected to be completed before the end of the year .

Even after his time was up , Apfel refused to step down from the stage and continued to denounce the " Jewish terror state . "
His speech was finally stopped after the chairman turned off his microphone and instructed ushers to escort Apfel out of the hall .
President of the Saxony Parliament Matthias Roessler instructed to keep Apfel out of parliament hearings until December .
This is not the first time Apfel has expressed his harsh feeling toward Israel , and the need to cut ties with it .
On NPS ' official website , the former neo -Nazi published his reaction to the recent flotilla incident , saying : " Today 's attack , with at least 10 fatalities , demonstrates a new ' characteristic ' of ' state terror ' employed by Israel .
" Since the establishment of the state in 1948 and the expulsion of millions of Palestinians – the history of Israel has been accompanied by bloodshed . "
Apfel called to " cut off Germany 's political ties with Israel and issue economic sanctions against it . "

But Democrats believe that even if Collins votes to block a bill , other centrist Republicans , such as Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe , may vote to allow debate .
A Democratic aide said Reid still hopes to bring the bill to the floor by the end of this week .
“ It ’s time to move forward with this bill , ” said the aide .
“ Chairman Dodd has been negotiating with Republicans for months . ”
Forty - one Republicans signed a letter to Reid urging him to support bipartisan negotiations on the Banking and Agriculture panels , which have jurisdiction over the legislation .
Reid argued that Dodd spent hours on Monday negotiating with Sen. Richard Shelby ( Ala. ) , ranking Republican on the Banking Committee .
The Democratic leader has shown little inclination to allow these talks to stretch for another three or four weeks , a span Collins estimated would be needed to produce a bipartisan compromise .
Instead , Reid has shown a willingness to force Republicans to vote on and kill the legislation .
If the bill derails , Democrats say they will make it a prominent issue in the midterm elections .
“ Let 's move forward in a bipartisan manner to get this bill done as quickly as possible , go to conference with the House , have the president sign a bill , ” Reid said .
“ The sooner we do that , the more stable our economy will be . ”

' Washington just can't imagine a world in which Republicans would have subpoena power , ' he said .
It can now .
But so far , Republican scrutiny has been about embarrassment more than enlightenment . " -- Gloria Borger , 7/31/95
Keep in mind , Borger wrote that before Dan Burton 's clown - show of an investigation repeatedly issued subpoenas to the wrong people and before the Republican House of Representatives impeached a president for having an affair .
Now , Republican Rep. Darrell Issa wants to make clear that if you liked the Republican investigations of the White House cat , the armed assault on vegetable gardens Dan Burton waged in a delusional attempt to disprove Vince Foster 's suicide , the endless distractions and wasted money of partisan investigations of non-scandals , you 'll love what the GOP has in store for Barack Obama if they win control of Congress :
Rep. Darrell Issa , the conservative firebrand whose specialty is lobbing corruption allegations at the Obama White House , is making plans to hire dozens of subpoena - wielding investigators if Republicans win the House this fall .
The California Republican ’s daily denunciations draw cheers from partisans and bookings from cable TV producers .
He even bought his own earphone for live shots .
But his bombastic style and attention - seeking investigations draw eye rolls from other quarters .
Now , he ’s making clear he wo n’t be so easy to shrug off if he becomes chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in 2011 .
... Issa has told Republican leadership that if he becomes chairman , he wants to roughly double his staff from 40 to between 70 and 80 .
And he is not subtle about what that means for President Barack Obama .
At a recent speech to Pennsylvania Republicans here , he boasted about what would happen if the GOP wins 39 seats , and he gets the power to subpoena .
“ That will make all the difference in the world , ” he told 400 applauding party members during a dinner at the chocolate - themed Hershey Lodge .
“ I wo n’t use it to have corporate America live in fear that we ’re going to subpoena everything .
I will use it to get the very information that today the White House is either shredding or not producing . ”
In other words , Issa wants to be to the Obama administration what Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind. ) was to the Clinton administration — a subpoena machine in search of White House scandals .
Assuring the BPs and Blackwaters of the world that they wo n't be the target of GOP investigations is a nice touch , is n't it ?
Good to know Issa 's focus will be on the things that really matter -- like whether someone offered a 30 - year Navy vet a job .
A description on the online - portfolio of concept - artist Keith Thompson has further substantiated rumors concerning a potential sequel to Borderlands .
Thompsons website has recently been updated with several pieces of concept art for the Guardians found Borderlands , as well as several concepts for alien weaponry .
The artist states that his work mainly concerned designs for the alien civilization found in the game , the story , and ‘ The Vault ’ , which forms a central element in the storyline .
He adds that much of the art produced by him was not used in the eventual product that was launched in October 2009 , and states that :
Much of the art not seen here may be used in DLCs or Borderlands II .
Speculation concerning a sequel to Borderlands was already incited in November last year , when the Creative Director of Gearbox Software Mike Neumann that the decision to make Borderlands II “ seems like a no - brainer ” , given the success of the original .
However , a sequel has not been formally announced .
Take - Two , the publisher of Borderlands , recently stated that it intends to continue providing downloadable content for Borderlands .

There ’s only one problem : none of this is proven .
In the February issue of the Journal of Marriage and Family , Judith Stacey , a professor of sociology at New York University , and Timothy Biblarz , a demographer from the University of Southern California , consolidated the available data on the role of gender in child rearing .
As Stacey and Biblarz point out , our ideas of what dads do and provide are based primarily on contrasts between married - couple parents and single - female parents : an apples - to - oranges exercise that conflates gender , sexual orientation , marital status , and biogenetic relationships in ways that a true comparison of parent gender — one that compared married gay - male couples or married lesbian couples to married heterosexuals , or single fathers to single mothers — would not .
Most of the data fail to distinguish between a father and the income a father provides , or between the presence of a father and the presence of a second parent , regardless of gender .
Drawing on reliable comparative studies , you could say this : single moms tend to be more involved , set more rules , communicate better , and feel closer to their children than single dads .
They have less difficulty monitoring their children ’s whereabouts , friendships , and school progress .
Their children do better on standardized tests and have higher grades , and teenagers of single moms are actually less likely to engage in delinquent behavior or substance abuse than those of single dads .
Go , Murphy Brown .
The quality of parenting , Biblarz and Stacey say , is what really matters , not gender .
But the real challenge to our notion of the “ essential ” father might well be the lesbian mom .
On average , lesbian parents spend more time with their children than fathers do .
They rate disputes with their children as less frequent than do hetero couples , and describe co-parenting more compatibly and with greater satisfaction .
Their kids perceive their parents to be more available and dependable than do the children of heteros .
They also discuss more emotional issues with their parents .
They have fewer behavioral problems , and show more interest in and try harder at school .
According to Stacey and Biblarz , “ Two women who chose to become parents together seemed to provide a double dose of a middle - class ‘ feminine ’ approach to parenting . ”
And , they conclude , “ based strictly on the published science , one could argue that two women parent better on average than a woman and a man , or at least than a woman and man with a traditional division of family labor . ”
Ah , there ’s the rub .
All howling to the contrary , most heterosexual men and women like that traditional division .
Sticking to “ gendered ” parenting roles offers a seductive affirmation .
Fathers , roughhouse all you want .
But we , gatekeeper moms , are in charge of the rest .
We could give you detailed instruction , and you still could n’t possibly do it as well .
“ Even women who want their husbands to help more with the kids do n’t want to give up their traditional authority , ” says Stephanie Coontz , director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families .
In addition to our pragmatic embrace of these roles , we still live in a culture with a deeply embedded notion of what a father is , beyond just another set of hands , and men , women , and children cling to it .
The bad news for Dad is that despite common perception , there ’s nothing objectively essential about his contribution .
The good news is , we ’ve gotten used to him .
* Product is first vaccine to treat cancer
* Cost set at $ 93,000
* Dendreon shares close up 27 percent ( Adds comments from Dendreon , analyst , closing share price )
WASHINGTON , April 29 ( Reuters ) -
The first vaccine to treat cancer won U.S. approval on Thursday as Dendreon Corp's DNDN.O Provenge marked a step forward in the search for new ways to the fight the disease .
Shares of biotechnology company Dendreon soared more than 30 percent after health officials approved the Provenge vaccine for advanced prostate cancer three years after the product ’s surprise rejection .
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^
“ Provenge provides a new treatment option for men with advanced prostate cancer , who currently have limited effective therapies available , ” Karen Midthun , acting head of the Food and Drug Administration ’s biologics center , said in a statement .
Unlike traditional vaccines that prevent a disease , Provenge treats prostate cancer by stimulating the body ’s own immune system to attack malignant cells .
It is produced by taking cells from a patient ’s tumor and incorporating them into a vaccine that is injected back into the patient .
The field has been littered with failures .
Dendreon is the first company to show a cancer vaccine can extend patient survival .
In a late - stage study of 512 patients , men given Provenge lived an average of 4.1 months longer than those who got a placebo .
Common side effects were chills , fever and headache that lasted up to two days following infusion .
This is seen as an advantage over the debilitating side effects typical of chemotherapy .
Most reactions were mild or moderate but one - quarter of patients reported a serious problem , the FDA said .
Problems such as strokes were seen in 3.5 percent of Provenge patients compared with 2.6 percent in the placebo group .
Dendreon said Provenge would cost a total of $ 93,000 for the full treatment of three infusions .
The vaccine ’s sales could easily top $ 1 billion a year , analysts say .
Brean Murray Carret & Co analyst Jonathan Aschoff forecast annual Provenge sales of $ 1.45 billion in 2013 based on a higher - than - expected price , with peak sales topping $ 2 billion .
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among U.S. men behind skin cancer and usually occurs in older men .
The FDA approved Provenge for hormone - resistant prostate cancer that has spread in the body but is causing no or minimal symptoms .
Dr. Len Lichtenfeld , deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society , said Provenge would give a boost to future efforts to develop treatment vaccines for cancer .
“ This is exciting because it does represent a proof of concept .
( Provenge ) does seem to prolong life in a very specific group of men , ” he said .
Other companies are exploring the field .
GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L is studying a lung cancer vaccine while Bristol - Myers Squibb BMY .N is testing a melanoma vaccine .
Danish biotech Bavarian Nordic A/S BAVA .CO is about to start late - stage testing of a rival prostate cancer vaccine called Prostvac that does not need to be tailored to the individual patient .
It received a fast track designation from the FDA under which Bavarian Nordic can submit key data as it becomes available rather than waiting until pivotal studies are completed .
Initial Provenge supplies will be limited .
Dendreon said it will make the vaccine available at about 50 sites .
Christopher Raymond , an analyst with Robert Baird & Co , said the company told investors in a conference call there will be only enough Provenge within the next 12 months to treat 2,000 patients , all from a factory in New Jersey that is operating at 25 percent capacity .
Dendreon said three plants will be running by mid-2011 , which Raymond said should be able to supply 4,400 patients in 2011 , and about 8,000 patients in 2012 .
“ I think the drug goes to $ 1 billion in short order , ” once the three plants are all up and running , he said .
Dendreon executives said the plants will be able to produce enough Provenge to generate annual sales of $ 1.2 billion to $ 2.5 billion .
“ We think it will be used in a majority of these 30,000 patients per year ” with an advanced type of prostate cancer , Cowen and Co analyst Ziad Bakri said .
Provenge had a rocky path to the market .
Three years ago , an FDA advisory panel of outside experts found it was safe and had shown “ substantial effectiveness . ”
Despite the panel ’s favorable comments , the FDA sent Dendreon back to the clinic to confirm that the drug could extend patient survival .
Some cancer patients and Dendreon investors sharply criticized the agency for denying approval of a drug they said could help critically ill men with few options .
Dendreon shares were trading below $ 3 in March 2009 before the company unveiled the positive survival data .
Analyst Aschoff , who raised his price target on Dendreon stock to $ 50 earlier in the week , said he thinks the shares can now go even higher .
“ I do n’t think the $ 50 range is a ceiling .
You ’ve just removed a very large risk element and you have a higher price ” for Provenge than many investors expected , he said .

PARIS — Going to the World Cup in South Africa ?
Bring your camera and your Visa card .
But do n’t wear a little orange dress , or you may get hauled into court .
That is what happened to two Dutch women who attended the Netherlands - Denmark soccer match Monday in the company of about three dozen others , all sporting the distinctive Dutch orange .
The two are believed to have led an “ ambush marketing ” stunt on behalf of a Dutch beer brand , Bavaria .
“ These women , who have been part of a larger group , are suspected to be involved in organized acts to conduct unlawful commercial activities during the Denmark - Netherlands match on Monday , ” the South African police said in a statement Wednesday , after arresting the two women , confiscating their passports and releasing them on bail .
The arrests demonstrate the considerable lengths to which executives of FIFA , the soccer governing body , will go to protect sponsors of the World Cup , which include the official beer , Anheuser - Busch ’s Budweiser .
The Federal Government has stepped in after it was revealed the Royal Flying Doctor Service ( RFDS ) has been in breach of the federal Crimes Act for the past 20 years .
The organisation was unaware it was illegal to distribute high - grade painkillers such as morphine and pethidine via Australia Post .
The Government will make changes to the Act to allow the service to re-stock its remote medicine chests .
The Federal Minister for Rural and Regional Health , Warren Snowdon , said it was imperative the Government acted swiftly to ensure people would be looked after in medical emergencies .
" We needed to get a change to the Crimes Act effectively to make it OK for Australia Post to handle these sorts of drugs on behalf of the RFDS , " he said .
" We were able to work with the Minister for Justice , Brendan O'Connor , and get an amendment made to the Act to allow this to happen . "
JIEGU , China —
The Buddhist monks stood atop the jagged remains of a vocational school , struggling to move concrete slabs with pickax shovels and bare hands .
Suddenly a cry went out :
An arm , clearly lifeless , was poking through the debris .
But before the monks could finish their task , a group of Chinese soldiers who had been relaxing on the school grounds sprang to action .
They put on their army caps , waved the monks away , and with a video camera for their unit rolling , quickly extricated the body of a young girl .
The monks stifled their rage and stood below , mumbling a Tibetan prayer for the dead .
“ You wo n’t see the cameras while we are working , ” said one of the monks , Ga Tsai , who with 200 others , had driven from their lamasery in Sichuan Province as soon as they heard about the quake .
“ We want to save lives .
They see this tragedy as an opportunity to make propaganda . ”
Since a deadly earthquake nearly flattened this predominantly Tibetan city early Wednesday , killing at least 1,400 people , China ’s leadership has treated the quake as a dual emergency — a humanitarian crisis almost three miles above sea level in remote Qinghai Province , and a fresh test of the Communist Party ’s ability to keep a lid on dissent among restive Tibetans .

Indigestion affects just about everyone at some point in life .
You ’ve probably dealt with indigestion also , and you know just how uncomfortable it can be .
There are many over the counter medicines to ease the discomfort that comes with indigestion .
If you suffer from persistent indigestion , buying over the counter medications can get quite expensive over time .
There might be an easier , and more affordable way to help ease indigestion .
Baking soda and water .
Does taking baking soda and water for indigestion work ?
Let ’s first take a look at what indigestion is and what can cause it .
What Is Indigestion ?
Indigestion is usually described as an “ upset stomach ” .
It normally happens after you eat too much , but it can also happen if you eat too fast .
One of the major symptoms of indigestion is heart burn , or esophageal reflux .
Heartburn happens when too much acid is produced , and backs up into the esophagus .
Symptoms of indigestion include :
Pain in the abdomen .
Nausea or vomiting .
Loss of appetite .
Diarrhea .
Constipation .
Excessive gas .
What Causes Indigestion ?
Several things can cause indigestion .
Certain foods can cause an upset stomach in some people .
There ’s a better chance of getting indigestion if the person smokes , drinks alcohol , does n’t get enough sleep , or is stressed out .
Other things that can cause indigestion include :
Anti-inflammatory drugs .
Drinking too much water with meals .
Emotions such as fear , jealousy , and anger .
Insomnia .
Foods that are especially spicy or rich .
Pregnancy .
Other diseases including peptic ulcer , hiatus hernia , or gall stones .
Allergies to certain foods .
A sedentary lifestyle .
An imbalance in digestive enzymes or stomach acid .
In the case of certain foods , if a particular food causes indigestion in one person , it does not mean that same food will have the same result in another person .
Make a list of the foods that give you indigestion , and avoid eating them .
A few of the more common foods include onions , coffee , chocolate , milk , baked beans , cauliflower , and fried foods .
How Does Baking Soda And Water For Indigestion Work ?
Baking soda has a way of breaking up food particles that are hard to digest .
It is able to break down fatty substances so they are more easily digested .
Baking soda mixed with water can help calm down the acid producing “ pumps ” in the stomach .
The less acid that is produced , the less your stomach will feel upset .
To use baking soda and water to help with indigestion , add a half teaspoon of baking soda to a half cup of water .
This will help to neutralize the stomach acid .
It will also help any rumblings that the stomach is making .
It is safe to drink this mixture again in two hours if you still have indigestion discomfort .
It is safe to dink this mixture up to seven times in a 24 hour period if you ’re under the age of 60 .
You can also add in a half a teaspoon of baking soda to a cup of warm peppermint tea .
Peppermint has been known to soothe an upset stomach , and combining baking soda to the tea can provide extra relief .
Drinking the mixture of baking soda and water for indigestion relief normally takes about 10 to 15 minutes to work .
If you have indigestion , or someone in your family suffers from it , there ’s no need to spend lots of money for expensive over the counter medicines .
Baking soda added to water will help soothe an upset stomach .
It ’s best to avoid the things ( foods , stress , and anger ) that trigger indigestion .
It ’s always best to see a doctor to be sure you ’re suffering from indigestion , and not something more serious .
Comments
Jonathan
Toews takes the opening draw with Marian Hossa and Tomas Kopecky and they immediately have the puck moving the right way .
This is a good change for the Hawks and early returns look promising despite the presence of the loser Slovak .
Patrick Sharp 's new line was next over the boards but not for long - once they see Mike Richards is on the ice , it 's off to the bench and , good God , Joel Quennville !
He 's still going for that damned Bolland match .
With Dustin Byfuglien !
Did n't the Chicago guys tell me this guy needs protecting ?
Jesus .
Nice interception though .
It 's been all Hawks for the first eight minutes .
Line after line is just dominating and the world is the way conventional wisdom had supposed except that they have n't scored and that 's always a bit troubling .
The Flyers just had their first offensive pressure of the game - big shocker here , it 's against the damned Bolland line - and it ends with Dave Bolland in the box .
I guess Ville Leino is really getting under his skin .
The PK was a bit scary .
The Flyers had a glorious chance at the side of the net to steal the lead which would have been a real coup for Michael Leighton .
Antti Niemi is n't looking good and Leighton has been fantastic .
The Hawks are on the power play now and they had better keep the pressure on or this could be a long ...
GOAL !
Off Pronger 's skate .
They deserved that one .
Ambiguous pronouns are awesome .
This has definitely been the Hawks ' best period of the series but Leighton is n't going to give them much .
I was wrong .
It 's three - zip after one and Leighton just came unraveled .
The goals got progressively more stoppable and his last save was a gong - show .
This is n't really his fault though .
The Hawks owned the puck that whole period and the Flyers look done .
The Hawks were due for a big game so unless they go full - on shell the rest of the way or Niemi is awful , this one is finished .
Scoring chances and more after the jump .
For those who'd like a definition : a scoring chance is defined as a clear play directed toward the opposing net from a dangerous scoring area - loosely defined as the top of the circle in and inside the faceoff dots , though sometimes slightly more generous than that depending on the amount of immediately - preceding puck movement or screens in front of the net .
Blocked shots are generally not included but missed shots are .
A player is awarded a scoring chance anytime he is on the ice and someone from either team has a chance to score .
He is awarded a " chance for " if someone on his team has a chance to score and a " chance against " if the opposing team has a chance to score .
And , of course , a big thanks to Vic Ferrari for making the whole damn thing possible with his awesome scripts .
The Hawks had a big game at even strength in the first two periods and the third saw both teams play heavily to the score with the Hawks again being a bit better - you 're not going to lose too many three goal leads if you only allow five scoring chances ( though Antti Niemi did his best ) .
On special teams , it was an odd game .
The Hawks scored twice on the power play and the Flyers not at all , but the Flyers looked a lot better on the plays that did n't end in goals .
They 've been the more efficient club all series on the power play which has got to be frustrating for a Chicago group that 's been so good on the penalty kill all year .
As for the plays that did end up in the net , the Hawks ' second power play marker featured some truly awesome passing .
The Hawks were " on " tonight , clearly the better team , and absolutely full value for the win for the first time in five games .
I made Bolland and Byfuglien sound pretty bad in the opening but this was definitely one of their better games .
Anytime Bolland finishes on top in scoring chances , Chicago should win the game because he 's going head - to - head with Philly 's best line .
Bolland ended up +3 - 2 against Richards including the empty - net goal at the end of the game , so the two were about even throughout which is a trade I 'm sure Joel Quenneville is happy to take any time .
Byfuglien was a physical force all night and also scored four points .
A real good game from both guys .
Worth mentioning , they did n't get the short end of the stick too often with defensive zone draws .
That gig was spread around nicely except that John Madden played almost all of his nine and a half minutes in the defensive zone , often coming on to replace a winger for draws so that Quenneville could have two centers on the ice .
There were only three chances against him , but two ended up in the back of the net .
Poor bugger .
The new Toews line got Briere for the most part and hammered them something fierce .
Toews was + 7 - 2 head - to - head on Briere which is a huge shift from how he was doing with Byfuglien and Kane .
You'd think that it was because the match - up got him away from Pronger but as you can see by Pronger 's numbers , getting away from him really was n't necessary .
Of course , with the Richards and Briere lines accounted for , this left Andrew Ladd , Patrick Sharp and Patrick Kane the dregs which ended in exactly the manner one would expect .
Sharp was +4 - 0 against Claude Giroux , including the two goals his line scored at evens .
Kane has really struggled in the series but playing with good players against less good players , he can be very good and he most certainly looked good last night .
For the Flyers ?
Pretty much everyone was outplayed .
Walking in the Law of the Lord
3. Kimmo Timonen - Pretty much everyone but Timonen .
He had a really strong game for the Flyers with a solid + 2 rating and two points including one of the four goals that brought the Flyers within two .
He was also the only Flyer to play ten minutes at even strength and finish in the black with regard to scoring chances or Corsi .
All of this despite starting six more faceoffs in his defensive zone than in the other end of the rink .
2. Patrick Kane - I enjoyed watching Kane tonight , especially the play where he dragged Pronger around the zone , and then spun off for a scoring chance .
Once the puck came out of the zone , it was quickly relayed back to Kane at the blue - line who took the puck wide around Pronger with a second spin-move to draw a penalty .
This perhaps says as much about Pronger being off his game as anything else , but it was still loads of fun to watch .
1. Jonathan Toews -
He played with Hossa and Kopecky and they were very good .
Personally , I 'd rather see Brouwer , who barely played , take Kopecky 's spot , but I doubt Quenneville 's messes with something that worked so well .
After being beaten up by Briere so badly in this series , this line really turned the tide .
Toews had a couple almost - beauties in this one as well .
My favourite rush was early in the first when he won the race race to a loose puck , skated in one - on - four and tried to go around the defender for a scoring chance .
When the puck got knocked to the corner , he won the race again and controlled the puck for the Blackhawks .
The shift eventually ended in Kopecky drawing a penalty and the puck never left the Flyers ' zone .
The Hawks may not have generated a scoring chance on that play , but it was exactly the way Toews plays when he's at his best
Worshiping the Golden Calf
3. Scott Hartnell - Bonus points for the dirty elbow to the back of the head .
Personally , I hope the league suspends people for that kind of thing ( is n't that what the head - shot rule is for ? ) but it 's the Finals so that probably wo n't happen .
Setting aside that piece , it was Hartnell 's second minor of the game which does n't do your team any favours .
On top of that , when he was actually on the ice , his line was getting the cherry minutes ( one DZ start vs. eight OZ starts ) and they did very little with it .
Given that context , ( and I 'm sure RO will be over - the - top in vigorously coming to my defense if there 's even the slightest hint of dissent ) I have no problem saying that line got crushed despite combining for 1 - 5 - 6 , +3 in the more traditional counting stats .
2. Brian Boucher - I decided to only go with one goalie even though they were all pretty bad .
I mean , I feel pretty confident in saying that Michael Leighton was the best goaltender tonight and he allowed three goals in one period .
Boucher just could n't come up with very many difficult saves .
The Flyers got within two four different times and every time the Hawks managed to bring the lead back to three .
These were not easy saves by any means but when you 're trying to come back , you need your goalie to make some difficult saves : three goals on twelve chances suggest that Boucher is n't going to be good enough .
1. Bizzarro - Pronger - Good God .
I do n't know what happened here but I refuse to believe that this was Chris Pronger .
Maybe Chris was sick and called his brother Sean .
Now Sean Pronger is a much better writer than his brother but he 's not nearly as good at hockey .
Without Pronger on the ice the Flyers were +9 - 6 in terms of scoring chances , with him they were +3 - 13 .
Without Pronger , they had a Corsi of +8 , with him it was - 19 .
Without Pronger , the Flyers scored four goals and allowed none , with him they allowed four and scored none ( plus the empty - netter ) , and you had better believe he had a hand in those goals .
It was in off his skate , or off his bad pinch or because he was in the box or ... you get the idea .
Aisha , Miriam and Akhi are three young factory workers in Dhaka , the capital of Bangladesh .
They are poorly educated and badly paid .
But , like millions of other young women , they relish their freedom from the stultifying conformity of rural life , where women are at the constant beck and call of fathers , brothers and husbands .
There is something else .
The three women together have 22 siblings .
But Aisha plans three children , Miriam two and Akhi just one .
They represent a gender revolution that many see as irrevocably tied to a reproductive revolution .
Together , the changes are solving what once seemed the most difficult problem facing the future of humanity : growing population .
Almost without anyone noticing , the population bomb is being defused .
It is being done without draconian measures by big government , without crackdowns on our liberties — by women making their own choices .
Family planning experts used to say that women only started having fewer children when they got educated or escaped poverty .
Pessimists feared that if rising population prevented the world 's poor from advancing , they would get caught in a cycle of poverty and large families .
The poverty trap would become a demographic trap .
But the reality is proving very different .
Round the world , women today are having half as many children as their mothers did .
And often it is the poorest and least educated women who are in the vanguard .
Women like Aisha , Miriam and Akhi .
There are holdouts , in parts of the Middle East and rural Africa .
But more than 60 countries — containing approaching half of the world 's population — already have fertility rates at or below the rate needed to maintain their populations long - term .
The club now includes most of the Caribbean islands , Japan , South Korea , China , Thailand , Sri Lanka , Iran , Turkey , Vietnam , Brazil , Algeria , Kazakhstan and Tunisia .
Within 20 years , demographic giants like Indonesia , Bangladesh , Mexico and India will in all probability also have below - replacement fertility .
Now is this happening ?
For one thing , more and more women are leading independent working lives , rather than succumbing to a life of child bearing and raising .
In many countries , women are staying single through their 20s and beyond .
In 1960 , two thirds of American women in their early 20s were already married ; today the figure is less than a quarter .
The habit is spreading fast .
As recently as 1980 , a UN study found that nuptials were " near universal " across Asia , and half of Asian women were married by the age of 18 .
No more .
In Japan , half of all 30 - year - old women today are unmarried .
In South Korea , the figure is 40 per cent .
The trend is especially marked in cities .
In Bangkok , a fifth of all women are single at 45 .
Manila , Singapore and Hong Kong are not far behind .
And , again largely unremarked , it is women who are heading the urbanization of the planet .
Whether sweatshop workers in Dhaka , bar girls in Bangkok , office workers in Shanghai , students in Delhi or maids in Caracas , there are more young women than men in almost every city in the world .
Academics debate whether they are there for the jobs or the men ( there are more rich educated men in cities , but more women of all sorts ) .
But whatever the motive , they are there : in the bars , shoe shops , gyms and clubs .
With jobs but often no dependants .
In Japan , they get called wagamama , or " single parasites . "
No matter ; it 's better than changing daipers .
How have they gained their freedom ?
Some say liberation allowed women to make new choices about their lives .
Equally , however , it has been the dramatic improvement in the survival rate of infants that for the first time has freed women from the social obligation for a lifetime producing and rearing babies .
Women are having smaller families and grabbing a new life outside the home because , for the first time in history , they can .
In the 20th century , the world largely eradicated the diseases that used to mean most children died before growing up .
Mothers no longer need to have five or six children to ensure the next generation .
So they do not .
Two or three is enough .
Rich or poor , educated or illiterate , socialist or capitalist , Muslim or Catholic , secular or devout , with tough government birth control policies or none , most — most families — tell the same story .
Scottish sociologist John MacInnes at the University of Edinburgh calls this the reproductive revolution .
Until the 18th century , half of children died before entering their fertile years , and many more before they completed them .
Most women spent almost all their ( often rather short ) adult lives bearing and rearing children .
The patrician societies that have dominated the world for millennia were designed to ensure women fulfilled this role .
The regulation of child production was done " through church and state , the norms surrounding sexual activity and sex roles , illegitimacy , cohabitation and marriage , family and kinship obligations and property law , " says MacInnes .
In much of the world , the drive to maintain fertility institutionalized arranged marriages , often of very young girls , maintained brutal sanctions against female adulterers or girls who would not accept their lot , and ostracized any form of homosexuality .
The reproductive revolution is kicking all this away , because it is simply no longer needed to sustain populations .
Feminism is not a new idea .
And some individuals have always broken free .
But , for most women , the reproductive revolution has " taken it from the realm of utopia to practical possibility , " says MacInnes .
The global collapse in fertility rates and rise of feminism is not the slow diffusion of a new idea , or a mechanistic response to aid workers handing out condoms .
This is the breaking of a logjam .
The logjam of a patriarchy that has suddenly lost its purpose .
British demographer Tim Dyson of the London School of Economics sees the change even in rural India .
India still adds about 19 million people to its population each year — a quarter of total global growth .
But its fertility is falling fast , now averaging 2.8 children per woman .
Dyson remembers that back in the 1960s , sociologists compared women 's lives in India and the U.S. " In India they married at 17 , had seven kids , the last one at 43 years old , and died typically at 46 .
In America , women typically married at 18 , had two kids quickly and then more than 40 years of life after childbearing .
Now , Indian women are grabbing that life too .
Sterilization is the main form of contraception in India , and the average age of sterilization is 26 years old . "
Where is this taking us ?
Through most of history , women have had between five and eight live births each .
For a while after childhood death rates fell , they continued to do so .
That 's why world population quadrupled in the 20th century .
But today the global average is 2.6 births , half the figure even a generation ago .
The figure is falling fast towards the current global replacement rate which , allowing for girls who do not reach adulthood , is 2.3 children per woman .
Smaller families do not immediately cut population growth .
There is rising life expectancy to account for , along with a legacy of 20th - century baby boomers who remain fertile .
But the trend is clear .
And in the past 40 years , the world 's population growth rate has fallen from 2.1 per cent to below 1.2 per cent .
Percentages are not the same as absolute numbers , of course .
But since 1987 , the number of additional people on the planet each year has fallen from 87 million to 78 million .
The downward trend will accelerate .
Growth may , on current trends , be zero or even negative by mid-century .
Some countries are already shrinking .
In 2008 there were 26 of them , headed by Russia , Montenegro , Bulgaria , Zimbabwe , Ukraine , Latvia and Swaziland .
Others are only sustained by inward migration .
It took around 130 years , from about 1800 to 1927 , for the world to get from one billion people to two billion , but only another 33 years to reach three billion , which happened in 1960 .
Reaching four billion took just 15 years to 1975 .
The fifth billion came in 12 years , in 1987 , as did the next billion , achieved in 1999 .
The next billion people will take a little longer than the last , probably 14 years if we reach seven billion as expected in 2013 .
And getting to eight billion will take another 20 or more years .
And we may never reach 9 billion .
Peak population is probably much closer than most people think .
Virtually all countries that have brought their fertility rates down from five , to four and three have gone on down below the replacement level .
Much of Europe is below 1.5 .
By 2100 , on current fertility trends , Germany could have fewer natives than today ’s Berlin , and Italy ’s population could crash from 58 million to just 8 million .
Once a negative trend has set in , it may prove very hard to break .
As well as having ever fewer potential mothers , societies may get out of the habit of having babies .
Children will be rare , exotic and unusual .
We can see this already .
Only a few years ago , going to a cafe in Italy would see you surrounded by noisy children .
Now you will likely only see adults , including many young latte - sipping men and women who would once have been surrounded by kids .
Other repercussions of the baby bust will play out over the coming decades .
One of the most controversial is the rising tide of migration .
It is created in part by the income differentials round the world , but even more by current record differences in fertility .
When women in some countries have more than six children , while others have barely more than one , trading people is an obvious safety valve for both sides .
Europe and North America already badly need foreign hands to keep societies and economies functioning .
We should stop pretending otherwise .
The other critical change is aging .
As fertility falls , the world is becoming older .
Our species has never lived in societies where there were more old people than children .
But soon we will .
This is truly terra incognita .
Some say we will never be able to afford to look after all those old people .
But there is , to coin a phrase , a silver lining .
The old are human capital , sources of wisdom and experience .
We have to harness that capital better .
The old will have to work longer — but they will also expect to be valued more .
Take health .
All the things I have been talking about have happened because the 20th century eradicated the killer diseases that wiped out most children before they could grow up .
But in the 21st century there is a new priority — to help the old stay fitter for longer .
So they can have better lives , of course .
But also so they can contribute more .
We are coming through the greatest surge of human population numbers in history .
It has already changed us profoundly and the end game will change us even more .
The reproductive revolution unleashed huge forces of economic activity , social dislocation and liberation — for women in particular .
But well before the end of this century , Homo sapiens — the brash , go - getting , hormone - driven , young naked ape of the 20th century — will be older and will likely be more conservative , less innovative , more boring even .
But perhaps also wiser , less frenetic , and more caring of each other and the environment .
Older , wiser , greener .
The tribal elders may take center stage once more .
But this time they will not just be revered , they will be the largest group in society .
And in all the probability , they will be dominated by women .
Demography is destiny .
There is no going back .

Now Ireland expels Israeli diplomat in passports row over murder of Hamas leader in Dubai hotel
The Irish government today called on Israel to withdraw an employee at its Dublin embassy over the use of fake passports in the assassination of a Hamas commander in Dubai in January .
Dubai has accused Israel of being behind the killing of the Palestinian and has provided the names of over two dozen alleged members of a team it says tracked and killed him , using fraudulent British , Irish , French , German and Australian passports .
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied any role in the assassination , prompting international indignation .
Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said an investigation had shown that the eight Irish passports used by suspects in the assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh were forgeries .
Assassins : Two of the killers follow Mahmoud al - Mabhouh ( bottom ) to find out what Dubai hotel room he is staying in .
The Irish government today called on Israel to withdraw an employee at its Dublin embassy
Australia and Britain have also ordered the expulsion of Israeli diplomats over fake passports used by the killers to travel to and from Dubai .
German prosecutors said at the weekend they were seeking the extradition of a suspected Israeli agent who was arrested in Poland in early June for passport fraud in the same case .
' The misuse of Irish passports by a state with which Ireland enjoys friendly , if sometimes frank , bilateral relations is clearly unacceptable and requires a firm response , ' Mr Martin said in a statement .
He said he would not reveal the name or function of the official concerned , in accordance with diplomatic practice .
He added : ' I want to state clearly that the official concerned is not accused or suspected of any particular wrongdoing .
' In being obliged to leave their post prematurely , the official concerned is a victim of the actions of the state they represent . '
Passports stolen : ( Clockwise from top left ) Irish citizens Anna Clasby , Evan Dennings , Chester Halvey , Gail Folliard and Kevin Daveron
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Israel regretted the decision of the Irish government , ' which does not conform to the importance that we attribute to our relationship ' .
Mr Martin said he wanted Ireland and Israel to enjoy ' productive bilateral relations ' even though Dublin disagreed with certain Israeli government policies .
Ireland ordered investigations into the matter after Dubai officials said Irish passports had been used in the hit .
Mr Martin said they discovered no additional evidence linking the Irish passports to Israel .
' The fact that the forged Irish passports were used by members of the same group who carried the forged British and Australian passports , leads us to the inescapable conclusion that an Israeli government agency was responsible for the misuse and , most likely , the manufacture of the forged Irish passports associated with the murder of Mr. Mabhouh , ' he said .

Mr Martin added that the level of sophistication required in the manufacture of the forged passports pointed to the involvement of a foreign state agency or a very well resourced criminal organisation with access to the details of a significant number of Irish passports .
Those responsible for the forgery of the Irish passports sought to replicate potential valid Irish passport information , with six of the eight fake passports using the numbers of existing Irish passport holders , he said .
The other two Irish passports used numbers conforming to Irish passport number format , although valid passports carrying these numbers were never actually issued , he said .
Mabhouh , born in the Gaza Strip , had lived in Syria since 1989 and Israeli and Palestinian sources have said he played a key role in smuggling Iranian - funded arms to militants in Gaza .
In 1977 , Massimo Vignelli designed the Unigrid System for the National Park Service .
The module grid system sized at ISO A2 ( 16.5 ? × 23.4 ? or 420 mm × 594 mm ) allowed the NPS to created brochures in ten basic formats and to keep a consistent , recognizable structure across all it ’s materials .
Not to mention how economical the system has been for them .
The grid features a black bar at the top and bottom with text set in Helvetica in the header bar .
It ’s pretty incredible how the Unigrid is still in use today .
It just goes to shows how flexible a grid system can be when properly designed .
Issue Journal has an in - depth article on the Unigrid and you can see the grid in action in this Flick group .

Beginning one week ago , thousands of young Kyrgyz men rampaged through parts of southern Kyrgyzstan with weapons and torches , attacking ethnic Uzbek neighborhoods , burning homes and stores , and , according to reports , beating , raping and killing Uzbek residents .
The official death toll is over 200 , though officials have indicated it may be ten times that number .
The attacks lasted for several days , setting off a massive rush to flee the violence - an estimated 400,000 Uzbeks fled the region in the last week , heading to larger cities or the Uzbekistan border .
It remains unclear exactly what instigated the attacks , or who exactly was the organizing force behind them .
Kyrgyzstan 's interim government suggested loyalists of recently - deposed former president Bakiyev were behind the attacks .
Though the recent violence seems to have ebbed , instability remains in Kyrgyzstan , with Uzbeks barricading their neighborhoods and taking their defense into their own hands .

Collection of 75 early American films , including several that had been considered lost to history , have been discovered in New Zealand
An extraordinary collection of 75 early American films , including several that had been considered lost to history , have been discovered in New Zealand and are being returned to the US .
The cache includes the only copy believed to exist of a late silent movie by one of the giants of American film - making , John Ford , as well as several works produced between 1910 and 1920 starring important female actors such as Clara Bow and Mabel Normand .
The collection had been stored at the New Zealand Film Archive but their significance was not fully recognised until last year when they were dug out by a Los Angeles - based film preservationist .
A deal has since been struck with the National Film Preservation Foundation based in San Francisco to preserve the reels and return them to the US .
The batch is being seen as a time capsule of American film from the 1910s and 1920s .
Only about a fifth of all US films produced between 1900 and 1940 have survived , the rest having been lost through decay or neglect .
The collection comes from a period when the American film industry was just taking off and , propelled by the success of westerns , had begun to triumph around the world .
About nine out of every 10 films shown in cinemas globally in the 1910s were made in the US .
" This is a wonderful group of movies , " said Annette Melville , the NFPF 's director .
" About 70 % of them are complete , which is extraordinary in itself , and many have their original colour tints . "
The crown jewel of the collection is Upstream , a 1927 film by John Ford , the director who later made such Oscar - winning classics as The Grapes of Wrath and The Quiet Man .
Ford made more than 60 silent films between 1917 and 1928 but only about 10 are known to exist in their complete form .
The copy of Upstream found in New Zealand has a little damage from decay to its nitrates at the start of the film , obscuring the credits , which might explain why it has taken so long to come to light .
The collection also includes a trailer for another Ford film , Strong Boy , which has otherwise been lost .
It is thought that New Zealand had such a rich trove of early films largely because of the distribution system at the time .
Copies would be sent out across America and beyond , and after their run had finished they would either be sent back to the distributors or simply be destroyed .
New Zealand was so distant that cinemas hung on to the copies and in some cases stored them , from where some made their way into the national film archive .
Melville said that film historians would be fascinated by the relative prevalence of female actors among the cast lineups , particularly in those films made in the 1910s when women enjoyed almost equal billing to their male colleagues .
They include the silent comedian Mabel Normand of Keystone Studios , Clara Bow , and Mary Fuller , who features in a 1914 serial in which she plays an ace newspaper reporter who always gets the scoop .
" Fuller 's films were tremendously popular , as women had just started to enter the workplace and would go to the movies on their way home from work , " said Melville .
" They wanted to see strong , adventurous women on the screen . "
Other films are important for documenting America in the early 20th century .
The first film to be preserved from the collection , The Sergeant from 1910 , was shot on location in Yosemite before the Californian wilderness had been turned into a national park , and features US army cavalry troops , who at that time were keeping order in the park .
Update : State Senate calls for EPA to change rule classifying cow 's milk as oil
GRAND RAPIDS --
Having watched the oil gushing in the Gulf of Mexico , dairy farmer Frank Konkel has a hard time seeing how spilled milk can be labeled the same kind of environmental hazard .
But the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) is classifying milk as oil because it contains a percentage of animal fat , which is a non-petroleum oil .
The Hesperia farmer and others would be required to develop and implement spill prevention plans for milk storage tanks .
The rules are set to take effect in November , though that date might be pushed back .
" That could get expensive quickly , " Konkel said .
" We have a serious problem in the Gulf .
Milk is a wholesome product that does not equate to spilling oil . "
But last week environmentalists disagreed at a Senate committee hearing on a resolution from Sen.
Wayne Kuipers , R- Holland , calling for the EPA to rescind its ruling .
" The federal Clean Water Act requirements were meant to protect the environment from petroleum - based oils , not milk , " he said .
" I think it is an example of federal government gone amuck . "
But Gayle Miller , legislative director of Sierra Club Michigan Chapter , said agricultural pollution probably is the nation 's most severe chronic problem when it comes to water pollution .
" Milk is wholesome in a child 's body .
It is devastating in a waterway , " Miller said .
" The fact that it 's biodegradable is irrelevant if people die as a result of cryptosporidium , beaches close for E. coli and fish are killed . "
Miller said " big agriculture " is constantly trying to be exempted from environmental regulations at the state and federal level .
She was disappointed to learn the EPA told The Press it " expects shortly to issue a notice to extend the date for milk storage tanks to comply with SPCC ( Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure ) regulations . "
Also , the International Dairy Foods Association said it has learned the EPA will exempt the industry from the rule .
But state lawmakers say they wo n't let up until that is official .
Konkel , who also spoke at the Senate hearing , co-owns Silver Sky Dairy , with his wife , Shari , and a brother - in - law and his wife .
They have 300 milking cows on about 800 acres and a 5,000 - gallon tank that keeps their milk cool .
The regulations apply to farms that store more than 1,320 gallons in above - ground containers or more than 42,000 gallons in buried containers .
In May , U.S. Rep. Candice Miller , R- Mount Clemens , introduced legislation , co-sponsored by Rep. Pete Hoekstra , R- Holland , that prohibits enforcement of the EPA 's regulations on dairy and dairy product producers , processors , handlers and distributors .
" This is an example of where we have overreach by the department that defies common sense , " said Matt Smego , legislative counsel for Michigan Farm Bureau .
Smego said its an unnecessary regulatory burden that creates additional costs .
He said it could cost $ 2,500 for a certified engineer to safeguard milk , plus more to construct secondary containment structures .
Michigan has 2,299 dairy farms .
According to the Michigan Department of Agriculture , dairy is the leading segment of Michigan 's agricultural industry , providing a $ 5.1 billion impact on the state 's economy .
This month the International Dairy Foods Association said it has learned the EPA will exempt the industry from the rule .
But state lawmakers say they wo n't let up until that is official .
In the meantime , Konkel and other dairy farmers are in limbo .
" The federal government has gotten out touch what 's going on in rural America , " said Konkel .
" This is our livelihood . "

“ The five tenets of injustice are that : elitism is efficient , exclusion is necessary , prejudice is natural , greed is good and despair is inevitable .
Because of widespread and growing opposition to the five key unjust beliefs , including the belief that so many should now be ‘ losers ’ , most of those advocating injustice are careful with their words .
And those who believe in these tenets are the majority in power across almost all rich countries .
Although many of those who are powerful may want to make the conditions of life a little less painful for others , they do not believe that there is a cure for modern social ills , or even that a few inequalities can be much alleviated .
Rather , they believe that just a few children are sufficiently able to be fully educated and only a few of those are then able to govern ; the rest must be led .
They believe that the poor will always be with us no matter how rich we are .
They have also come to believe that most others are naturally , perhaps genetically , inferior to them .
And many of this small group believe that their friends ’ and their own greed is helping the rest of humanity as much as humanity can be helped ; they are convinced that to argue against such a counsel of despair is foolhardy .
It is their beliefs that uphold injustice . ”

The ' Family Guy ' 150th episode and the return of ' The Boondocks ' :
One of them was brilliant
Family Guy type TV Show network Fox genre Animated
Family Guy ‘s hour - long 150th episode began with a two - character piece that revolved around Stewie and Brian being trapped in a bank vault , then finished up with some memorable musical numbers from the show .
The “ regular ” episode , “ Brian and Stewie , ” was both tedious , predictably vulgar , and , by the end , sentimental .
The big joke : Stewie had a soiled diaper , and convinced the dog to “ eat my poop ” to prevent stench and diaper rash .
Oh , and Stewie wanted Brian to “ possibly lick my fanny ” clean , as well .
Baby and dog also got really drunk .
As the episode wore on , the discovery that Brian owned a gun he kept in the bank safe - deposit box led to a discussion of suicide , an admission by the usually flinty Stewie that he ’d miss Brian if he were gone , and concluded with the baby falling asleep on Brian ’s lap as the dog read to him from David Copperfield .
Awwww …
Better were the musical moments .
Guy creator Seth MacFarlane is a clever musical comedy producer , and set - pieces like Peter doing the Jerry Lewis mime number from The Errand Boy , and the Guy version of The Music Man‘s “ Shipoopi , ” are pleasures to watch .
The Boondocks has n’t aired a new episode since 2008 , and so , in a brilliant stroke , the new season began with the ’08 election of Barack Obama , cast as a documentary being made by a German filmmaker whose voice sounded an awful lot like director Werner Herzog , voiced by — well , whattaya know — Werner Herzog .
The half - hour , titled “ It ’s a Black President , Huey Freeman , ” written by Boondocks creator Aaron McGruder , was a terrific parody of Obama - mania and a ferocious critique of all the hatred that has been directed against Obama .
Warning ; this clip contains strong language .
Placed in the Boondocks universe , Obama publicly condemned angry - kid realist Huey .
Why ?
Because Huey is friends with Obama on MySpace , and Huey ’s politics are far too radical for mass America , so Obama did the politically expedient thing .
The episode played out with shrewd , nuanced satire .
( Although will .i.am may not feel that way , after seeing the way his style was parodied . )
It ’s great to have the cantankerous Boondocks back again .
( CNN ) -- Oregon authorities said Wednesday that a woman accused former Vice President Al Gore of " unwanted sexual contact " in connection with a 2006 encounter , but no charges resulted because detectives could not substantiate her claim .
In a statement released to the media , the Portland Police Department said the allegation involved an encounter between Gore and a licensed massage therapist at a hotel on October 24 , 2006 .
" The detectives concluded that there was not enough evidence to support the allegations , " Portland police spokeswoman Mary Wheat told CNN .
The department explained its timing in releasing a statement Wednesday by saying that while the department does not usually release information on alleged sex crimes , " A national tabloid magazine has published a story discussing allegations made by a Portland woman against former Vice President Al Gore . "
The department statement said police were contacted by a lawyer for the woman in 2006 and , " After repeated attempts by Portland Police Detectives to interview the woman involved , the Police Bureau was told by her attorney in January 2007 , that they were pursuing civil litigation and declined the assistance of the Portland Police Bureau 's Detective Division . "
The woman came to police in January 2009 and " explained that she would like to give a statement ... The woman read from a prepared statement and detailed the events of October 24 , 2006 .
She reported that she was repeatedly subjected to unwanted sexual touching while in his ( Gore 's ) presence , " the police department 's statement Wednesday said .
The statement said the woman told detectives she had gone to Gore 's hotel room because she had been called " to provide a massage to Mr. Gore . "
Earlier this year , the woman asked investigators if she could edit her statement , indicating that she could provide detectives with more information , authorities said .
" At this point , the police bureau does not consider this an ongoing investigation unless new evidence is received in the case , said Wednesday 's police statement .
CNN contacted Gore 's office for a response to the allegations .
" Our office has no comment , " said Kalee Kreider , communications director for Gore .
There ’s been a lot of mumbling about how the 2010 Dragon * con guest list was shaping up ; some griped about the lack of a truly big name on the guest list .
Well , I do n’t think they will be complaining anymore , as comic legend Stan Lee is officially coming to Dragon*con in 2010 .
For those who may not be comic aficionados , Lee is credited with creating the Fantastic Four , the Hulk , Iron Man , Thor , the X - Men , Daredevil , Doctor Strange and Marvel ’s most successful character , Spider - Man .
Stan has been making appearances at fandom conventions across the country for the past couple years , and was most recently at Phoenix ComiCon in Arizona .
There ’s no word yet on whether he ’ll be signing , and if he does , whether it will be capped at a certain number .
Update : Lee will be signing , and his autograph is available for pre-order .

LABOR is facing political oblivion , with Premier Kristina Keneally having failed to woo angry western Sydney voters in Penrith .
In a devastating result for the State Government , Liberal candidate Stuart Ayres annihilated Labor , with former mayor John Thain suffering a two - party preferred swing of more than 25 per cent .
Across the polling booths , swings of up to 35 per cent were recorded in favour of the Coalition as voters turned their back on Labor .
Labor needs to lose only six seats to hand government to the Coalition .
Despite Ms Keneally 's personal popularity with voters , the backlash in the Western Sydney seat of Penrith was staggering .
If this swing were to be repeated uniformly in March , Labor would be facing a wipeout .
A repeat of the Penrith result across the State would leave only six Labor MPs in parliament .
Ms Keneally 's own seat of Heffron would be lost .
The defeat in Penrith , which had been held by Labor with a 9.2 per cent margin , is a huge blow to party strategists , who are counting on the popularity of the Premier in buffering voter anger in March .
At an 11 pm press conference , Ms Keneally - who had led Opposition Leader Barry O'Farrell by 15 points at the last opinion poll - distanced herself from the backlash .
She refused to take responsibility for the result , putting voters ' anger down to the behaviour of disgraced local member Karyn Paluzzano .
" I am disappointed , but the result was not unexpected , " she said .
" I think every member in my team is heeding the lesson of tonight . "
Ms Keneally said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was not to blame for the anti-Labor sentiment in the seat .
" The people always get it right .
I am indicating to the people of Penrith that I am listening to their message and humbly accept the verdict . "
Jubilant Liberal Party MPs and volunteers crammed into the Penrith RSL to celebrate having won the first western Sydney seat from Labor in almost 20 years .
An emotional Mr Ayres , who at 29 becomes the youngest MP in the NSW parliament , was welcomed by deafening cheers as he entered the venue with his partner , Senator Marise Payne , and Mr O'Farrell .
" Labor does not have a lock on certain classes of people , as it constantly claims but forever continues to neglect , " Mr O'Farrell said .
At the Penrith Paceway , the atmosphere at Labor 's campaign party was akin to a wake as 30 devastated party members gathered for a quiet drink .
Mr Thain said he knew it was going to be a tough fight to retain the seat .
" I said it would be like climbing Mount Everest , " he said .
The seat was made vacant when Ms Paluzzano resigned after having admitted misusing public funds and lying about it .
In the lead - up to yesterday 's vote , ALP strategists had predicted a swing of 20 to 30 per cent to the Coalition .
Although commentators were yesterday suggesting the result would have no ramifications at a federal level , voters approached by The Sunday Telegraph appeared to be angry at both Mr Rudd and Ms Keneally .
At polling booths and on street corners , angry voters spilled forth a litany of complaints about roads , hospitals , politicians , kerbs and the Paluzzano corruption scandal .
" Frustration , more than anything else , was the mood of the electorate , " Regentville Rural Fire Brigade member Graham Northey said .
" It 's time for a change .
" I'm an accountant and , in the course of my job , people talk politics .
" It all revolves around what 's happening federally : they do n't like what Rudd 's doing , they do n't like what Keneally 's doing . "
The Greens doubled their vote as disgruntled Labor voters sought out alternative candidates .
Greens MP
Lee Rhiannon said the result showed the party was more than likely to win its first Lower House seat in March .
With 75 per cent of the vote counted last night , the Liberals had 66.3 per cent of the two - part preferred vote , and Labor just 33.5 per cent - a swing of 25.6 per cent .
Greens candidate Suzie Wright has received 12.6 per cent of the primary vote .
At the 2007 State election , the Greens received 5.5 per cent of the vote in Penrith .
The Greens actually outpolled Labor on primary votes at several booths in the electorate .
Although the vast majority of voters said they were voting Liberal , there was strong evidence of a protest vote for the Greens .
Judge Tahaliyani said 35 men , including Hafiz Saeed , the founder of the group , appeared to have been involved in planning the attack .
But the judge added that their guilt could not be proven in his court .
India has sought the extradition of Mr. Saeed and other Pakistanis without success .
Officials in Pakistan have said that India needs to provide more evidence of their involvement .
The trial took just over a year , a swift resolution for the judicial system here , where cases can drag on for decades .
The court heard testimony from more than 600 witnesses , and reviewed thousands of pages of evidence and video and audio surveillance of the attack .
The judge ’s verdict ran more than 1,500 pages .
The trial has stumbled and lurched through setbacks and reversals .
Mr. Kasab ’s court - appointed lawyer was dismissed on the first day of hearings when she was found to be representing a witness to the attacks in a separate civil case .
His second lawyer was dismissed late last year after a disagreement with the judge over a procedural matter .
Mr. Kasab has also changed his version of the events several times .
After his arrest , he provided the authorities with a rich narrative about how he became a terrorist .
But he recanted the statement at the start of the trial .
Last July , he said in court that he was guilty and wanted to be hanged .
He changed his mind again in December and told the court he was a tourist who had been framed by the police .
The attacks started Nov. 26 , 2008 .
Mr. Kasab and a partner , Abu Ismail , shot and killed commuters at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus , a busy train station , where the Indian authorities said 58 people died .
After a confrontation later that evening , police officers killed Mr. Ismail and arrested Mr. Kasab .
It took commandos nearly three days to kill the other eight attackers who had taken over two of Mumbai ’s finest hotels , the Oberoi and the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower , and a Chabad - Lubavitch center then known as Nariman House .
Yesterday , a lot of Australians reported seeing a bizarre UFO .
Just before 6:00 a.m. local time , numerous reports came in about a spiral of light in the sky with a bright central spot .
The light was actually spinning around , like a pinwheel !
One site has pretty cool video of it , and pictures are turning up on the web as well .
Sound familiar ?
Yeah , it should : these reports are almost exactly like a spiral shaped light seen over Norway last year .
The Norway sighting -- a picture of it is below , on the right -- was positively identified as a Russian missile , so of course as soon as I heard of this new Aussie sighting the first thing I thought of was that it was a rocket booster .
So I leaned over my keyboard and was about to Google " rocket launch schedule " or something similar , when I suddenly stopped .
I smiled , leaned back , and almost literally facepalmed myself .
Gee , I thought to myself , what rocket would 've launched yesterday morning ?
Duh : the SpaceX Falcon 9 !
The private company successfully held its first test launch of the big rocket , blasting off from its Florida pad at 18:45 UT Friday -- which is 04:45 Sydney , Australia time .
I do n't have ground tracks yet ( maps of the path of the rocket over the Earth 's surface )
Here 's the Falcon 9 ground track -- the path of the rocket over the Earth 's surface -- provided by jetforme ( based on orbital parameters ) :
Note how the path goes right over eastern Australia !
The timing is perfect , too : about an hour later , the second stage would 've been halfway around the world , matching the position and time of the UFO sightings .
The spiral pattern seen in Norway is known to be from gas leaking out of the booster .
As the booster spins and the gas shoots out , it makes a water - sprinkler spiral pattern in the sky .
As it happens , the second stage of the Falcon 9 was rotating ; this was not supposed to happen and the SpaceX engineers are looking into it ( it did n't affect the launch adversely ; the payload achieved orbit ) .
So the timing was right , the booster was spinning , and we know that spirals like this are an outcome of rocket launches .
Of course , this is n't enough for some UFO believers .
ABC in Australia had this from Doug Moffett of the UFO Research NSW :
" Firstly , the time of the launch was 18.45 GMT , which translates to 4.45 am EST , the duration of the flight was 9 minutes 38 seconds - this is a full hour before the reported sightings , " he said .
" Secondly , where was the glow from the boosters or from the friction created by the craft moving through the atmosphere , where was the tail of the rocket ? "
" Thirdly , why would anyone launch a rocket on a maiden test flight with a trajectory that would take it over the most heavily populated parts of Australia ?
" And how big must this rocket have been to be seen so clearly , at the same time , over such a vast distance ? "
I have to admit , it 's pretty rare to see somebody get so many things wrong in so few words !
Let 's take them point by point :
1 ) This is n't a starship , it 's a rocket , and takes time to go around the Earth .
An orbit is usually 90 minutes in period , so it takes about 45 minutes or so to get from Florida to Australia .
Plus , since this was a launch it was n't moving at top speed the whole time ; it took a few minutes to accelerate to orbital speeds .
That makes the timing about perfect .
2 ) Mr. Moffett needs to understand that a launch from Florida , tens of thousands of kilometers from Australia , gives the rocket plenty of time to get above our atmosphere ( which is only a few kilometers high ) .
Heck , the Falcon 9 was up and outside the atmosphere in the first few minutes of flight , when it was barely over the Atlantic !
So by the time it was passing over Australia it would 've been a couple of hundred kilometers up .
3 ) Again , Mr. Moffett 's grasp of scale is lacking .
If the rocket failed , it would have done so over the Atlantic .
That 's why we launch rockets from Florida in the first place !
There 's essentially no way a failure could cause a rocket to crash in Australia ; by the time it gets there it's in orbit and safe .
4 ) This is the most telling point : anyone familiar with the sky knows that satellites are easy to spot with just your eye .
Rockets can be even easier , especially when they 're spewing out gas !
This is something I 've been saying for years : if you know what you 're looking at in the sky -- meteors , satellites , planets , and so on -- a lot of UFO stories evaporate .
The fact that so many reported UFOs turn out to be mundane objects is a pretty good sign that more than a few UFO enthusiasts are n't terribly familiar with observing the sky .
I find that highly ironic .
For what it 's worth , the ABC story did have a quote from an astronomer who also posits it 's the Falcon 9 , but they gave more space to the UFO guy , and put his claims after the astronomer 's , giving them more weight .
So despite the nonsense you 'll hear from the news sites and the bulletin boards that will claim this is some sort of transdimensional stargate warp , I think we have a pretty good idea that we actually do have a UFO here , as long as it's an Übercool Falcon ( in ) Orbit .

When last I visited the concept of the Power Forward in the NHL , I tested the traditional fan description of a Power Forward and found :
Over the last three years , there are two players that qualify as power forwards -- Alexander Ovechkin and Shane Doan .
The beast , though gravely endangered , exists .
.5 % of all NHL forwards can truly be considered power forwards in this sense .
Perhaps asking these players to perform at this high of a level for three straight years is too much , given the beating that they must take on a game - by - game basis .
With the book closed on the 2009 - 2010 regular season , I decided revisit the topic to see if there were any newcomers to the position .
As I did in the last look at the noble creature , I set the minimums for the position at .3 goals per game ( 25 goals over and 82 game season ) and 1.5 hits per game .
The following charts detail each player , by season that met the minimums .
All of the charts are sorted by goals per game .
06-07 Power Forwards
07-08 Power Forwards
08-09 Power Forwards
09 - 10 Power Forwards
Shane Doan drops from the list due to a brutal shooting percentage season .
If Doan spends 09 - 10 shooting at his previous career average , he pots 25 goals and is again on the list .
So Alex Ovechkin is the only man that has met the conditions of a traditional power forward for the last four years .
There are some interesting items surrounding this year 's list though :
Ryan Malone has made the list three years in a row .
Injuries have limited him ( as is the case with many of the people that appear on this list once ) , but he still managed to average .304 GPG .
At first glance , his shooting percentage seems high , but Malone has managed to shoot 15 % for his career .
Mike Richards has also made this list three years running .
It 's especially impressive for a center , given the extra work .
Richards is also among the leaders in faceoffs taken each year - he 's a workhorse .
James
Neal is making a case for himself as the second - best power forward in the league as he's on the list for the second time in his career -- a career that is just two seasons old .
Guillaume Latendresse will have to generate a much larger volume of shots to get back on this list - his 16.9 % shooting percentage is not likely sustainable .
Steve
Ott is an interesting case - he 's taken more shots in each of the last three seasons and his shooting percentage has increased .
The type of minutes that Ott players are n't going to be conducive to him getting more than two shots per game on net ( his average this year ) and 15.1 % is not sustainable .
There were a number of players that could n't duplicate their 08-09 season : David Backes , Andrei Kostitsyn , Ryane Clowe and Chuck Kobasew all had extremely high shooting percentages last season .
My conclusion about the traditional Power Forward still holds :
A roster fix via the vaunted " power forward " is nearly impossible .
The players in this mold are extremely rare and the ones that do actually exist come with a heavy cap number .
Their trade cost is just about priceless .
Beyond that , the guys that fit this mold are n't necessarily dynamic scorers ...
... there were 37 " power forward " seasons by 27 different players in this period .
Only 8 of those players broke the 30 goal mark and the other 19 players averaged 24.8 goals per season .
These types of seasons have a very low rate of repeatability .
The players that are n't named Ovechkin , Doan or Richards depend on extremely high shooting percentages to score their goals .
When those percentages regress , those forwards are dropped from the list .
Chicago , IL - Tyler McCormick , Mr. Rio Grande Leather of New Mexico , was named International Mr. Leather at the 32nd Anniversary IML Competition Sunday night in Chicago .
McCormick , a female - to - male transgender man who uses a wheelchair , bested a field of over 50 contestants , from from across the U.S. and around the world .
" When I first transitioned , I was told I would never be accepted and that I would never be able to take my shirt off in public , " McCormick said during Sunday 's competition .
" Standing here as a strong , confident leatherman is proof to the contrary .
" Participants were judged on stage presence and personality ( Pecs and Personality ) , leather image , presentation skills , and physical appearance .
Over 2,000 leather enthusiasts packed the Grand Ballroom of the Hyatt Regency Chicago for Sunday 's competition .
Colton Ford entertained the audience .
First runner up was Lance Holman , Mr. San Francisco Leather , while Jack Andrew Duke , Mr. Texas Leather , was second runner - up .
The Mr. International Bootblack winner was Tim Starkey of the Boston Ramrod .
The judges for the 32nd International Mr. Leather competition are International Mr. Leather 2009 Jeffrey Payne ( Dallas , TX ) , Laura Antoniou ( Queens , NY ) , Shawn Carroll ( Ottawa , Canada ) , Demetri Moshoyannis ( San Francisco , CA ) , Chad Neal ( Kansas City , MO ) , Gene Romaine ( Seattle , WA ) , Daniel Ruester ( Berlin , Germany ) , William " Rubberwilli " Schendel ( Chicago ) , and Robert Valin ( New York ) .
IML began in 1979 when about 400 gay leathermen gathered in Chicago .
Today thousands gather in the Windy City over Memorial Day Weekend for what has become an annual tradition for the leather community .

With only one game left of the 2009 / 10 season , it ’s time to create that inevitable , impossible - to - please dream team from across the major European leagues .
Playing in a fluid 4 - 3 - 3 / 4-2-3- 1 system that remains the most popular formation throughout Europe , it also reflects the current emphasis upon centre - backs who can pass the ball , attacking full - backs , ball - playing central midfielders and versatile attacking players .
Goalkeeper :
Pepe Reina , Liverpool
It ’s remarkable that any Liverpool player has managed to emerge from this season with their reputation enhanced , but Reina has saved Liverpool from yet more misery on countless occasions .
Whilst his season will probably be remembered solely for the unfortunate / hilarious ‘ beach ball ’ goal at Sunderland , he still managed to keep the ( joint ) highest - number of clean sheets in the Premiership , for the fourth time in his five Premiership seasons .
Incredibly , despite this record he has still never got into the PFA Team of the Year , suggesting that despite his consistent individual brilliance , he remains underappreciated .
Have some of his best saves from 2009 :
Right - back :
Daniel Alves , Barcelona
It is often assumed that full - backs who attack constantly are also weak defenders , a tag that seems to have been given to Alves .
But he ’s consistently shown he is more than a competent right - back defensively , rarely being beaten on his own flank , and covering his full - backs well from balls over the top from the left .
Rarely has any footballer possessed such speed and stamina , and Alves is as close as any footballer has come to being able to play in two positions at once , right - back and right - wing , once Messi has drifted inside .
And when he does get forward , he can do things like this :
Centre -back :
Lucio , Inter
Quite possibly the signing of the season .
Getting Brazil ’s captain at a knock - down rate last summer was one of the best pieces of business Jose Mourinho has done since leaving Portugal , as Lucio has formed a mildly terrifying partnership with another South American veteran , Walter Samuel .
Lucio is remarkably unconventional for a top - notch defender – whereas many of his class are calm , assured players who read the game well and look to be playing it at a stroll , Lucio is a rugged , dramatic player who seems to want to exaggerate every tackle , clearance and coming - together with an opponent .
Everything Lucio does is the outfield equivalent of a goalkeeper ’s ’ save for the cameras ’ .
Regardless , when it comes to the pure nitty - gritty of defending , he is one of the world ’s best and has had a tremendous first season with Inter .
The way he handled Didier Drogba against Chelsea was particularly impressive :
Centre -back :
Gerard Pique , Barcelona
If Lucio is a throwback to the brutal South American defenders of years gone by , Pique is every inch the modern centre - back .
Able to bring the ball forward as well as spread to the flanks to widen the pitch , Pique is also excellent defensively and his reading of the game is superb .
Last season ’s Champions League final against his former seemed to be a watershed moment for Pique – transforming from a decent centre - back to a world class one , and he ’s continued that form this season .
How many other centre - backs could score this goal ?
.
Left - back :
John Arne Riise , Roma
Many thought Riise ’s career as a top - level player was over when he was forced out of Anfield by Rafael Benitez , but this season ’s form has shown he still has a few years left in him yet .
Perhaps the key to his rejuvenation as a player was finding a club that suits his playing style .
At Roma he does not merely have a license to get forward , he has strict instructions to get forward – with their left - sided attacking width coming from Mirko Vucinic , their main striker , Riise overlapping is important to allow Vucinic to cut in and offer a goal threat .
He has made one or two mistakes when defending at the far post , but has made up for them with some crucial goals , such as against Juventus :
Central midfield :
David Pizarro , Roma
Is this man Europe ’s most underrated footballer ?
Few players can control a game as completely as Pizarro can , and he was vital in Roma ’s near - triumphant return from the dead .
Pizarro is essentially an Andrea Pirlo - style deep playmaker , sitting infront of the defence and spraying passes around the pitch .
But whereas Pirlo often seems unconvincing when forced to take on a slightly more defensive role , Pizarro is a more complete midfielder , battling to win the ball before keeping hold of it expertly .
There is no better footballer that will be absent from this year ’s World Cup .
Check out the tackle and cross for Riise ’s goal above , and here ’s highlights of his performance against Fiorentina this season :
Central midfield :
Xavi Hernandez , Barcelona
Two seasons in a row , Xavi has dominated the biggest club game in Europe at the Bernabeu .
Four assists last season in the 2 - 6 , both assists this season in the 0 - 2 .
And it would have been more , had Lionel Messi not missed two fairly basic one - on - ones with Iker Casillas .
He is probably the most reliable , consistent passer of the ball in the world , and ZM ’s passing statistics for Barcelona games generally resulted in a ludicrous dominance from Barcelona ’s vice - captain ( see here , here and here .
Now aged 30 , he continues to get better and better .
Here ’s his two assists at the Bernabeu :
.
Attacking midfield :
Wesley Sneijder , Inter
There can be few players in Sneijder ’s position who have adapted so quickly to a new league .
From the first game of the season , where he helped inspire Inter to a 0 - 4 victory over Milan , it was clear that he was to be Inter ’s main man this season .
Whilst the trequartista role has declined in popularity in recent years , Sneijder thrived in that advanced position behind two strikers , whilst also able to play a slightly deeper position , sometimes in a 4 - 2 - 4 when Inter went chasing games .
His passing ability in open play , his direct running and his free - kick ability make him a wonderful player to watch , and a very difficult one to stop .
Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge he dominated the game and it was fitting that Inter won the game after a superb Sneijder through - ball :
Forward :
Arjen Robben , Bayern
Another Dutchman chucked out by Real Madrid last summer , Arjen Robben has been the Bundesliga player of the year , and had a vital impact in Bayern Munich ’s run to the European Cup final too .
His ‘ winners ’ against Fiorentina and against Manchester United were two of the goals of the tournament in terms of pure technical quality , and even better considering the importance of both .
Robben has generally stuck to the right - hand side in Bayern ’s fluid 4 - 4 - 2 / 4 -2-3- 1 system , cutting onto his stronger left foot to score 16 goals in 24 league games , and is therefore the posterboy for the recent popularity of inverted wingers .
Now a Champion in four different countries – Holland , England , Spain and Germany – Robben is playing for the first time as the key player at a top club , and is playing his best - ever football as a result .
The Fiorentina and Manchester United goals have been played non -stop in recent months , so how about his incredible winner in the German Cup semi-final against Schalke :
Forward :
Lionel Messi , Barcelona
Inclusion into the band of all - time greats might have to wait until he has performed brilliantly on the international stage , but Messi ’s form over the past two seasons has already elevated him to the best footballer of this century .
The most immediate comparison there is to Zinedine Zidane , but for all the Frenchman ’s moments of magic , at no stage in his career did he play football as consistently well as in Messi ’s last two seasons .
Able to play wide - right , as a central playmaker or as false nine , specific position does n’t seem to matter for Messi .
His record of 34 league goals equals Ronaldo ’s legendary record of 1996 / 97 , and having played two games fewer and further from goal , Messi ’s record is probably even more incredible .
He is still only 22 .
Here ’s his hattrick against Valencia :
Forward :
Wayne Rooney , Manchester United
Many in England protested that Wayne Rooney was being played out of position for the past couple of seasons when he often featured on the left flank , allowing Cristiano Ronaldo more of a forward role .
The consensus , however , was that his ‘ true ’ position was as a deep - lying forward , creating chances more than finishing them .
It ’s a surprise to most , therefore , that he has played the best football of his career as an out - and - out striker , a poacher inside the 18 - yard box – it ’s not long since he was given the ‘ a scorer of great goals , but not a great goalscorer ’ tag .
Rooney has actually played three distinct roles this season upfront .
Firstly , in a 4 - 4 - 2 as an out - and - out striker who looks to link with Dimitar Berbatov , his strike partner , who plays slightly deeper .
Secondly , as a lone striker playing purely as a ‘ poacher ’ in games United dominate possession in , in a vaguely similar way Ruud van Nistelrooy used to .
Thirdly , also playing as a lone striker but playing as a false nine – dropping deep and looking to create space for midfield runners , like against Arsenal .
Like Messi , Sneijder ( and Cristiano Ronaldo )
Rooney is proving that the very best attacking players can play well in a variety of roles .
His goal away at Arsenal showed the value of the false nine role brilliantly :

CleanTech has signed a contract with the Chant Group for the delivery of a cogeneration biomass power plant to Heilongjiang province , China .
The agreement follows a similar deal between the two companies made last year for a biomass power plant in Yishui , Shandong Province which is currently being installed .
The new cogeneration plant will consume soft straw residues from the local farming community to provide an annual total of 1.8576�108 kilowatt hours of electricity to the China state national grid in addition to 571,000 gigajoules of energy for district heating bringing much needed infrastructure and employment to the Mingshui area .
The new biomass power plant will be powered by DP CleanTech 's high - pressure high - temperature technology , the boiler island will consist of two 75t/h boilers instead of the usual single 130t/h boiler .
It is expected the dual boiler system will provide increased power as well as offer better fuel load flexibility .
DP CleanTech 's advanced technology combined with the additional heating capacity is estimated to boost the overall thermal efficiency of the plant to nearly 46 percent .
" This is our second contract with the Chant Group , we are very excited to be working with them , we consider them to be a visionary client with great plans to develop biomass energy , " said Simon Parker of DP CleanTech .
DP
CleanTech is currently involved with six other biomass power plant projects in Heilongjiang Province alone , a region that is now beginning to benefit enormously from the industry .

This is the personal story of my daughter Dakota Root .
In each of the books Ive written , Ive taken great care to acknowledge my beautiful and brilliant little girl , Dakota .
I often noted that Dakota and her parents were aiming for her acceptance at either Harvard or Stanford and would accept nothing less .
The easy part is aiming for gold .
The hard part is achieving it .
" Homeschool to Harvard " is a story about turning dreams into reality .

Dakota has been home - schooled since birth .
While other kids spent their school days being indoctrinated to believe competition and winning are unimportant , and that others are to blame for their shortcomings and failures , Dakota was learning the value of work ethic , discipline , sacrifice and personal responsibility .
While other kids were becoming experts at partying , Dakota and her dad debated current events at the dinner table .
While other kids shopped and gossiped , Dakota was devouring books on science , math , history , literature , politics and business .

I often traveled to business events and political speeches with my home - schooled daughter in tow .
While other kids came home to empty homes , Dakotas mom , dad , or both were there every day to share meals and a bedtime kiss and prayer .
Despite a crazy schedule of business and politics , I m proud to report that Ive missed very few bedtime kisses with my four home - schooled kids .
While others were out learning to drive so they could attend more parties , or experimenting with alcohol and drugs , Dakota was practicing the sport she loves with dedication , intensity and passion — fencing .
The result ?
She became one of the elite junior fencers in America  winning the Pacific Coast Championship and representing the United States at World Cup events in Germany and Austria .
Was all the discipline and sacrifice worth it ?
A few days ago , Dakota Root achieved her lifelong dream .
She was accepted at both Harvard and Stanford .
She was also accepted at Columbia , Penn , Brown , Duke , Chicago , Cal - Berkeley , USC and several more of the elite schools in America , an unheard of record for a home - school kid .
She actually had the confidence to turn down an offer from the Yale fencing coach before she had gotten her other acceptances .
The kid turned down Yale !

Your Credit Report : It ’s all About What Others Report
You know that your credit score is based on information in your credit history .
However , few people wonder how it gets there .
The answer is relatively simple : Your creditors report information about you to the credit bureaus .
When you pay on time , or if you are late , your lenders report that information .
Your entire credit history and credit report depends on how creditors and others report to the credit bureaus , and that information can impact the way your financial reputation looks on paper .
Here are a few areas to watch out for .
Late Payments
One of the biggest determinants of your credit score is whether or not you make on time payments .
If you are generally a good borrower , and pay on time , but miss the due date by a couple of days one time , your creditor may decide not to report it as a late payment .
Some creditors wo n’t report you as late until after the payment is 30 days late .
While this is nice , there are some creditors that will report a payment as late the day after — no matter how good a customer you are — and negatively impact your credit score .
It is important to get a feel for the way creditors report late payments so that you know what to expect .
Of course , it ’s best to make sure payments are on time , and avoid the problem altogether .
Editor ’s Note : Beware about credit card payments .
The credit card companies are required to report your payment dates to the credit bureau .
If it ’s late , it ’s late , even if it ’s just one day .
If you care about your credit score , then make sure your payments are on time without exception !
Non-Credit Payment Delinquencies
While creditors will report that your account is paid on time , others to whom you have obligations wo n’t .
This includes utilities , cell phone providers and other service providers .
You wo n’t get any good marks for making these payments on time , but these non-credit obligations can affect your credit score if you do n’t pay .
Your landlord , utility company or any other provider can report your delinquency to the major credit bureaus , even though they are n’t lending you money .
Most will wait at least 60 days to report you , but some may report a missed payment sooner .
This is a good reminder that negative decisions you make with regard to money can find its way to your credit history , even if you are n’t borrowing money .
Credit Report Mistakes
With millions of records being report constantly , there are bound to be mistakes here and there .
Sometimes , a creditor will report an account as closed by the company , rather than by the customer ( which is a slightly more negative situation ) , even though the customer made the request .
In some cases , as happened with one of my husband ’s student loans , a credit item can be reported twice , making it look like you have more debt than you actually do .
And , of course , there are other mistakes that find their way on to a credit report too .
When you find mistakes in your credit history , you need to contact the creditor in order to get the problem fixed .
While you can send copies of your documentation to the credit bureaus that have the mistake , it is up to the company that reported the information incorrectly to carry through with getting the problem fixed .
You should write a letter to the creditor , explaining the situation , and including copies of supporting documents .
Keep copies for yourself , and send the information by certified mail , so you know when it arrives .
A creditor has 30 days to investigate and fix the problem if an error occurred .
Be sure to follow up after 30 days to make sure the mistake is corrected .
You have to be careful of what is on your credit report , and remember that the information in there is only as good as what others report about you .

Half a million consumers downloaded Doctor Who : The Adventure Games in its first two weeks .
The free downloadable game was the first of its kind from the BBC , and the broadcaster hopes its success will inspire the games and TV industries to work closer together .
The result is a lot more than I was expecting , ” Simon Nelson , controller of portfolio and multiplatform at BBC Vision told MCV .
We had set ourselves some fairly stretched targets on this and we ’ve blown them away .
The credit goes to the Doctor Who and marketing teams , who are among the best in the BBC at creating integrated campaigns , messages and interactive spin - offs .
This has been part of the Who planning process rather than just a bolt on at the end , which too many interactive things have been .
I ’m hoping that we have demonstrated to the TV and the games side that there is a marriage worth pursuing here .
There have been many frustrated attempts to bring TV and games together before .
And I wo n’t say that this is the final article , but I like to think we ’ve broken ground for the TV industry , games industry , the public service sector and hopefully even the commercial sector , too . ”
Despite the initial success , the BBC is not resting on its laurels and is focused on making sure the rest of The Adventure Games are a success before looking ahead to future projects .
We are not complacent here and there ’s plenty we can be doing to drive awareness , ” continued Nelson .
It is a dilemma for anyone doing original web stuff because it is such a crowded environment .
We will be reviewing this pretty hard .
We are not short of ideas , but we will be picking them very carefully .
Crucially , the industry and the audience have felt we have created something different here that works .
That ’s probably more important than the numbers . ”
On one hand Microsoft has been releasing and updating its smartphone operating systems , geeks are going the other way by porting windows on their respective iPhone ’s and Android based phones .
On an earlier note , a Norwegian developer named Erik Kristiansen developed the first “ boot camp ” ( later turned out to be a hoax ) but that had the devs going for the inevitable .
Google about windows on iPhone and you will get loads of results .
The suit was followed by android geek Shawn McHenry who ported Windows 3.1 on Android phone .
As he confesses -
I realized , Hey , Windows can be installed VIA Dos .
So I went on google & youtube and looked up " Windows on Android " and what do you know , No results .
However , I saw a lot of videos about Windows 95 , NT , 3.1 , etc on a Nokia .
So I thought , I want to try and put it on Android .
It appears its never been done before .
So I gave it a shot ...
The hack was done using DOSBOX emulator which allows to run old MS - DOS games for Intel x86 PCs that can't be run on modern operating systems such as Window XP , Vista , Linux , or FreeBSD Unix .
Windows 3.1 was launched in 1992 & added quite an array of features at that time like support for long file names , virtual memory and support for sharing .
McHenry explains what he did here but finishes off quickly
" It 's completely useless , but really damn cool . "
Windows on Android ?
Watch out Windows 7 :P

As expected , Portugal has become the sixth European country to legalize same - sex marriage .
President Anibal Cavaco Silva said today he had decided to ratify the legislation that passed Parliament in January , the AP is reporting .
Portugal , which is about 90 % Catholic , joins the Netherlands , Belgium , Spain , Norway and Sweden .
France and Denmark recognize same - sex unions , but they do not extend all rights enjoyed by married heterosexual couples .

The second - ranking House Republican on Tuesday did not criticize or support Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's critical comments about the administration , but suggested that questions need to be raised about its Afghan war strategy .
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) said in a statement that McChrystal and his aides would not have criticized administration officials without having a reason to do so .
ADVERTISEMENT
" Obviously a general and his top brass do n’t make statements like these without being frustrated , so I hope that the president ’s meeting with General McChrystal will include a frank discussion about what is happening on the ground , and whether the resources and the plan are there to defeat terrorists and accomplish our mission in Afghanistan , " he said .
Most members of Congress have criticized McChrystal 's comments in a Rolling Stone article released Tuesday in which he and his aides had harsh words for President Barack Obama , Vice President Joe Biden and other top officials who deal with Afghanistan .
Rep. David Obey ( D - Wis. ) , the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee , has called for McChrystal 's ouster , saying that he wrongly spoke out in public against civilian officials who are supposed to have control over the military .
While Cantor said that the article " raises a lot of concerns , " he largely refrained from criticizing the general 's comments directly .
The Virginia Republican also took aim at congressional Democrats for their handling of a war funding measure .
" Democrats in Congress are standing in the way of a clean bill to fund our troops and provide the resources needed because they want to lard it up with domestic spending , " he said .
" We need to get our troops these funds , and should do so without any pork or unrelated domestic spending items thrown in . ”

Addressing the unanswered questions
The possibility of an extinction event ?
( NaturalNews ) Reports about the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill have been largely underestimated , according to commentators , including Paul Noel , a Software Engineer for the U.S. Army at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama .
He believes that the pocket of oil that 's been hit is so powerful and under so much pressure that it may be virtually impossible to contain it .
And Noel is not the only person questioning the scope of this disaster .
recent story from the Christian Science Monitor ( CSM ) reports that many independent scientists believe the leak is spewing far more than the 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day being reported by most media sources .
They believe the leak could be discharging up to 25,000 barrels ( more than one million gallons ) of crude oil a day right now .
The riser pipe that was bent and crimped after the oil rig sank is restricting some of the flow from the tapped oil pocket , but as the leaking oil rushes into the well 's riser , it is forcing sand with it at very high speeds and " sand blasting " the pipe ( which is quickly eroding its structural integrity ) .
According to a leaked National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration memo obtained by an Alabama newspaper , if the riser erodes any further and creates more leaks , up to 50,000 barrels , or 2.1 million gallons , per day of crude oil could begin flooding Gulf waters every day .
When this disaster first occurred , the media downplayed it .
BP spokespersons were quick to claim that the leakage was minimal and that crews would eventually be able to contain it .
But as time went on , it became clear that things were not under control and that the spill was far more serious than we were originally told .
( Gee , sound familiar ?
Remember Katrina ? )
Yet some of the media reports still seem more like press releases than actual reporting because they continue to repeat what the public relations cleanup crews ( pun intended ) wouldthe public to believe rather than what 's actually happening .
Reality , it seems , has a nasty habit of interfering with corporate spin .
The New York Times yesterday reported that BP is working on a large containment dome that is intended to cap the leak and catch the escaping oil so that it can be safely pumped to the surface .
Meanwhile , crews are said to be working on fixing the broken blow - out preventer valve that should have stopped the leak from happening in the first place , but they have been unsuccessful thus far .
Almost every report says that BP is doing everything it can to contain the spill and stop the leak , even though the company claims it is not technically at fault .
According to an article from the U.K. Daily Mail , BP's CEO Tony Hayward recently responded to the cleanup efforts by explaining , " This is not our accident but it is our responsibility to deal with it .
" Swiss - based Transocean is the company that actually owned and operated the sunken rig .
It manned the rig with its own crew and BP just leased it from Transocean ( which makes you wonder why BP is so willing to take full responsibility for everything ) .
BP says that it 's working on a relief well , but that it could take up to three months to complete .
Until then , the company is trying several different approaches to at least slow the leak and hopefully stop it altogether .
Mind you , almost all of the information about the spill from day one has come directly from BP which obviously has every incentive to downplay the true environmental destruction that could be caused by this oil spill Even the word " spill " is incorrect .
This is n't some ship of oil that spilled into the ocean -- it 's a " volcano " of oil spewing from the belly of Mother Earth herself .
It 's under extremely high pressure , it 's spewing a huge volume of oil directly into the ocean , and there so far seems to be no human - engineered way of stopping it ( short of setting off an underground nuclear bomb near the well site ) .
According to the CSM article , environmental risk models are normally performed for pollutants like crude oil , yet not one model has yet been released for this incident by BP or the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Many are wondering why this crucial information has not been made public .
Could it be because the results of the model might seem too catastrophic ?
Neither has there been an adequate explanation given for exactlythe oil rig exploded ... twice !
Some reports indicate that the crews responsible for properly cementing the well casing did n't do it right .
Others suggest that the oil deposit was just too large and under too much pressure for the equipment to handle it .
( Be careful where you poke around the planet if you can't handle what comes out , right ? )
It 's also important to note that , according to a recent New York Times article , Halliburton was actually the company responsible for all the cementing work on the rig , which brings a third party into the picture .
BP's federal permits allowed the company to drill up to 20,000 feet deep , but according to one of the workers who was onboard the rig during the explosion , drilling in excess of 22,000 feet had been taking place .
This same worker is said to handle company records for BP , but BP has denied these allegations .
BP has declined to comment , however , on other allegations that the spill happened because it chose not to install necessary deep - water valves which would have acted as a last resort seal of protection in the event of an emergency .
Several other allegations include suspicions that the crews allowed gas to build up in the well bore and that the rig operator tried to detach too quickly from the well , causing a disruption .
BP , Halliburton and Transocean have all indicated that they are continuing to investigate the situation .
When companies investigate themselves , however , the truth rarely comes out .
It 's hard to say exactly what 's going on in the Gulf right now , especially because there are so many conflicting reports and unanswered questions .
But one thing 's for sure : if the situation is actually much worse than we 're being led to believe , there could be worldwide catastrophic consequences .
If it 's true that millions upon millions of gallons of crude oil are flooding the Gulf with no end in sight , the massive oil slicks being created could make their way into the Gulf Stream currents , which would carry them not only up the East Coast but around the world where they could absolutely destroy the global fishing industries .
Already these slicks are making their way into Gulf wetlands and beaches where they are destroying birds , fish , and even oyster beds .
This is disastrous for both the seafood industry and the people whose livelihoods depend on it .
It 's also devastating to the local wildlife which could begin to die off from petroleum toxicity .
Various ecosystems around the world could be heavily impacted by this spill in ways that we do n't even yet realize .
There 's no telling where this continuous stream of oil will end up and what damage it might cause .
Theoretically , we could be looking at modern man 's final act of destruction on planet Earth , because this one oil rig blowout could set in motionthat begins with the oceans and then whiplashes back onto human beings themselves .
We cannot live without life in the oceans .
Man is arrogant to drill so deeply into the belly of Mother Earth , and through this arrogance , we may have just set in motion events that will ultimately destroy us .
In the future , we may in fact talk about life on Earth as " pre-spill " versus " post - spill . "
Because a post - spill world may be drowned in oil , devoid of much ocean life , and suffering a global extinction event that will crash the human population by 90 percent or more .
We may have just done to ourselves , in other words , what a giant meteorite did to the dinosaurs .

CHICAGO – Colin Hanks and Bradley Whitford seem like a pair of good guys in real life and the creator of their new show ( Matt Nix of “ Burn Notice ” ) has definitely been more - than - good in the past but their new action series , “ The Good Guys ” might be more correctly titled “ The Mediocre Guys , ” although that ’s not quite as catchy .
Television Rating : 2.5 /5.0
On “ The Good Guys , ” debuting tonight , May 19th , 2010 on FOX , Hanks and Whitford play a pair of Texan cops who are cut from the classic oil - and - water buddy comedy cloth .
Hanks plays the buttoned - up Jack Bailey while Whitford plays the unbuttoned Dan Stark .
Bailey longs for a more high - profile gig than chasing down stolen humidifiers while Stark barely lives a sober moment , more focused on his mustache grooming than anything else .
Jenny Wade plays Assistant District Attorney Liz Traynor while Diana Maria Riva co-stars as Lt. Ana Ruiz .

The premiere of “ The Good Guys ” features a plot that starts with the aforementioned appliance and works its way through a complex drug money theft involving a plastic surgeon and two of the best assassins in the world .
Bailey and Stark essentially stumble into the crime - in - progress and the two have to deal with their own personality differences while dodging gunfire and apprehending the bad guys .

What ’s interesting to me is how often “ The Good Guys ” reminded me of other shows .
It has the feel of cop shows from the ’70s and ’ 80s , programs that were sort of half - comedy and half - action in that they only took themselves seriously with their tongue in cheek manner .
It ’s a style that has been perfected in the last few years by the USA Network on shows like “ Burn Notice , ” “ Psych , ” and “ Royal Pains ” in that the mysteries - of - the - week are driven by the personalities of the leads .
“ The Good Guys ” seems like it would have made a perfect fit on USA and its fascinating to think that the cable nets are now influencing the broadcast ones after so many years in reverse .
The problem is that USA probably turned down the pilot for “ The Good Guys ” .
More often than not , it simply does n’t click .
There ’s an intangible chemistry of character , mystery , and , often , location on shows like “ Burn Notice ” and “ Psych ” that this program does n’t have , at least not in the pilot .
It ’s a fast - paced , frenetic show but it too often feels unfocused , as if it ’s as - yet - unsure what to do with its quirky characters or its unusual concept .
It can be extremely difficult to judge a new program on the basis of one episode , especially for a show that relies so heavily on the chemistry of its leads and the rhythm of its dialogue .
Right now , neither that necessary chemistry nor the witty dialogue one would expect from the creator of “ Burn Notice ” is in place , and if there ’s anything that ’s notably different about broadcast programs compared to cable ones is that viewers and executives are more impatient .
It ’s unlikely that this pair will be given the time to develop into something “ good ” .

EU to ban selling eggs by the dozen : Shopkeepers ' fury as they are told all food must be weighed and sold by the kilo
British shoppers are to be banned from buying eggs by the dozen under new regulations approved by the European Parliament .
For the first time , eggs and ­other products such as oranges and bread rolls will be sold by weight instead of by the number contained in a packet .
Until now , Britain has been exempt from EU regulations that forbid the selling of goods by number .
But last week MEPs voted to end Britain ’s deal despite objections from UK members .
The new rules will mean that instead of packaging telling shoppers a box contains six eggs , it will show the weight in grams of the eggs inside , for example 372g .
British shoppers are to be banned from buying eggs by the dozen under new regulations approved by the EU
Or that a bag of white rolls has 322g inside instead of half a dozen .
The rules will not allow both the weight and the quantity to be displayed .
Last night , Britain ’s Food Standards
Agency said it was opposed to the move , putting the UK on a potential collision course with Brussels .
It could be the first test of David Cameron ’s pre-Election promise to stand up for Britain ’s interests in the EU .
Eggs have traditionally been sold by the dozen or half - dozen , because the old imperial measurements such as inches or pennies were calculated in groups of 12 .
Early in the 20th Century , eggs were sold from trays on shop counters and carried home in paper bags .
But between the two world wars , it was discovered that eggs kept longer if they were left standing on their ends , so the cartons of 12 and six were developed .
Last night , an FSA spokeswoman said : ‘ This proposal would disallow selling by numbers .
Retailers would not be allowed to put “ Six eggs ” on the front of the box .
If it was a bag of rolls , it would say “ 500g ” instead of six rolls .
It could be the first test of David Cameron 's pre-Election promise to stand up for Britain 's interests in the EU
‘ It is important that information is provided in a way that is meaningful and beneficial to consumers .
This issue is still being considered by EU member states and it will be some time before the regulation is finalised . ’
The move could cost retailers millions of pounds because of changes they will have to make to packaging and labelling , as well as the extra burden of weighing each box of food before it is put on sale .
The cost is likely to be passed on to shoppers through higher grocery bills .
Experts say it will be next year before the EU is able to pass the controversial measure , which bureaucrats say is designed to help consumers make an informed choice when buying their food because it will require suppliers to provide more comprehensive information .
But last night , food industry experts said the EU plan was ‘ bonkers ’ and ‘ absolute madness ’ .
Federation of Bakers director Gordon Polson warned that it may be too late to change the rules , even though they will be debated further in the European Parliament .
He revealed that lobbyists had already tried to rectify the regulations , discovered in the 174 pages of amendments to the initial 75 - page proposal , but there was not enough time to convince MEPs before the crucial vote .
The British Retail Consortium , which represents 90 per cent of UK shops , will ask Government Ministers to press for the decision to be reversed .
Andrew Opie , the consor­tium ’s food director , said : ‘ This is a bad proposal – we need to help consumers , not confuse them .
We ’ll be talking to the Government to encourage them to make sure these plans do n’t come into force . ’
One major food supplier said : ‘ This is hindering rather than helping the consumer , taking away one of the key bits of information .
If this goes through it would demonstrate how far removed the legislators are from the real world .
It ’s bonkers . ’
Another industry source added : ‘ It ’s absolute madness .
You ca n’t make any argument that consumers are being confused by labels for six eggs or four bread rolls . ’
Adam Leyland , editor of The Grocer trade magazine , said : ‘ You could n’t make it up , could you ?
It would be funny if it were an April Fool ’s joke .
But it ’s not and it will potentially cost the industry millions , while confusing customers no end .
‘ The EU ’s attempt to simplify labelling has created a multi- headed monster . ’
The new labelling row is the latest in a long line of European Union food policy scandals .
The EU passed a directive in 1994 ruling that top - of - the - range bananas had to be ‘ free from malformation or abnormal curvature of the fingers ’ .
The directive was ridiculed as a symbol of bureaucratic excess in Brussels .
In 1988 , it ruled that top - of - the - range cucumbers must bend by only 10 mm per 10 cm in a directive designed to help packaging and transport .
In 1979 , another directive ruled that carrots should be termed as fruits , as the Portuguese made jam out of them .
In 2003 , a threatened European ban on smoky - bacon crisps was averted at the last minute when MEPs forced through amendments after a backlash from the British ­public .
Neil Herron , campaign dir­ector of the Metric Martyrs Defence Fund , said the EU directive was ‘ absolute nonsense ’ .
He added : ‘ If I was a farmer I would get my customers to throw eggs at any official trying to enforce this .
It is dir­ectives like this that give the European project a bad name .
' It makes the British public want to just pull out of the whole thing altogether . ’
As Stroustrup said , there ’s no such programming language as C / C ++. C and C++ are two different beasts .
I ’m not going to argue here about which is better .
For small or embedded projects , the complexities of C++ can get in the way .
For larger projects , some of the features of C++ are very useful .
I ’m simply going to list the features C++ adds to C , from an ex-C programmer ’s point of view ( yes , I was one of those people who believed that C++ was just “ C with classes ” ) .
The idea is to follow the links to further information if you want to know more about any of them .
This is part 1 of 2 , the non-OO features :
Default arguments to functions : defining int read ( int bufsize = 512 ) means that if you call read ( ) without arguments it ’s like you called read ( 512 ) .
means that if you call without arguments it ’s like you called .
Somewhat related is function overloading .
You can define a function twice , with two different argument lists .
The compiler will use the “ closest match ” when you call it .
For example , defining int print ( int n ) {...} and int print ( const char * s ) {...} means you can print ( ) both ints and char strings .
and means you can both ints and char strings .
The compiler uses ambiguity resolution to resolve all these overloaded functions .
You can declare local variables wherever in the code you need them , not just at the start of a function ( also a C99 feature ) .
This means variables can be declared closer to where you use them .
The variable is scoped to the {...} block you put it in .
block you put it in .
References , as in int& x .
This is n’t some weird Microsoft - only syntax for smart pointers .
I started to think of these as pointers without all the * ‘s , but they ’re quite different .
An alias is another name for the referred - to object , usually used for pass - by - reference — and unlike pointers , you can call say swap( x , y ) instead of swap ( &x , &y ) .
A const reference means you ’re not allowed to change the object it refers to .

Const - correctness in general .
This is not just a C++ thing , but C++ folks tend to be stricter about it ( usually for good reason ) .
A namespace just groups a bunch of names together ( functions or variables ) .
C should have had them all along , to avoid everyone having to use their own brand of mylib_myfunc ( ) pseudo - namespaces .

A much larger standard library than C. The Standard Template Library ( STL ) is definitely worth knowing , especially the container datatypes like vector ( growable array ) and map ( associative array ) , and the STL algorithms such as find ( ) and sort ( ) .
C++’s iostreams are just plain weird ( I mean , using the bit - shift operators to print stuff out ? ) , but they ’re here to stay .
Of course , you can still use all of C ’s standard library , and if you #include < cstdio > instead of < stdio.h > , you ’ll get the names in the std namespace , as in std:: printf ( ) .

Linking C++ code to C code has several gotchas .

3 May 2010 by Ben 14 comments
For me personally , one of the most creative and fun aspects of costuming involves accessorizing .
For many costumes , the most important accessory is the weaponry .
Whether you ’re going to a fandom convention as Cloud from Final Fantasy , or Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean , the weapon can make or break the costume .
However , more and more conventions seem to be cracking down on rules concerning weapons , even if they are simply made from foam and cardboard .
These days if you bring a weapon into a convention ’s facility , you will probably end up having a nice chat with security .
Most conventions actually have weapon policies in place – even if the weapons in question are completely fake and / or harmless .
Now , I ’ve never heard of anyone getting sliced in half by a swordsman at a convention , but the rules are the rules , and when you buy your ticket to a convention , you ’re agreeing to uphold them .
In order to help you better prepare for your costume , I ’ve actually visited the websites of conventions big and small and compiled a list of common weapon policy statements .
I ’ve also posted some of the stricter policy statements out there .
This is so you can get a general idea of what is commonly acceptable , and what is not .
However , do n’t assume anything about a convention ’s weapon policy .
If you are attending an upcoming convention , you are highly advised to ask for their specific weapon policy , as some of their rules may differ .
If a convention does n’t have a clearly stated policy on their website , find a way to ask in advance .
You do n’t want to have your wonderfully hand sculpted Final Fantasy sword confiscated by the venue ’s security , or worse , the police .
And just because a weapon clearly looks “ fake ” or “ too fantastical ” to be real in your eyes , security may not feel the same way .
Common Weapon Policy Rules and Procedures :
“ All weapons must be non-working and peace bonded . ” ( see below for further explanation of peace - bonding )
“ No functioning projectile weapons includes water pistols , silly - string guns , and ping - pong pistols . ”
“ Bladed weapons must be cased or sheathed at all times . ”
“ There will be absolutely no play - acting with props allowed outside of the rooms designated for contests . ”
“ Explosives or chemicals of any kind including , but not limited to , smoke powder , sparklers , and fireworks , are not permitted at the con . ”
“ Do n’t bring anything that would annoy another attendee or set us up for a crazy lawsuit . ”
“ If a prop or weapon can be broken over the head of the person who brings it , then it is fine ; Otherwise , no . ”
Some of the Stricter Weapon Policies :
“ NO LIVE STEEL at all will be permitted on the premises . ”
“ NO GUNS of any kind will be permitted . ”
“ No paddles , of any sort , will be allowed at the convention .
This includes , but is not limited to Yaoi / Yuri Paddles . ”
“ All weapons must be carried into the hall in a bag of some sort . ”
“ Do not bring real swords , guns or any other type of an authentic weapon ! ”
Given the statements above , you can see that there is a pretty wide spectrum of rules and regulations , everything from “ just do n’t annoy anyone ” to “ absolutely no steel or guns . ”
The key is to do your homework , and find out the policy before you start making your prop , or selecting your costume ’s accessories .
You may even want to prepare a few different variations of the same weapon ( fake vs real steel ) if you intend to wear the costume to different conventions .
Even if a convention does permit certain weapons , they usually require them to be sheathed , or peace bonded .
Peace - bonding is the act of making it clear that your weapon cannot be used ( either by a brightly colored tie , or trigger lock ) and that your intentions are peaceful .
Some conventions may actually offer a peace - bonding booth , or otherwise have assistance available for those who need it .
Again , you need to check with each convention specifically .
But if you know a con requires peace - bonding , I recommend arriving with the weapon already bonded .
Better safe than confiscated .
There is no doubt that certain costumes involve iconic weapons , and that the cosplay is n’t quite complete without them .
However , when there are thousands of people in a shared space , considerations must be made .
Are some conventions ’ policies too lenient ?
Too strict ?
Can there be a happy medium ?
Where do you stand on the issue ?

One of the benefits of open source software that many people are most familiar with is that it 's free to download .
This means you can grab great applications — such as Mozilla 's Firefox Web browser , the OpenOffice.org office suite or the GIMP photo editing program — without paying a cent .
However , the other major benefit of truly open source software ( some " open source " software licences are more restrictive than others ) is that you 're allowed to modify a program and redistribute your altered version so other people can enjoy it .
Linux is a classic example of this : there are hundreds ( at least ! ) of different Linux - based operating systems .
Most people will be familiar with some of the big names — distributions like Ubuntu , Red Hat Enterprise Linux , Debian and Mandriva .
Most of the well - known Linux distros are designed to be used as general purpose desktop operating systems or installed on servers .
But beyond these distros are hundreds of others either designed to appeal to very specific audiences or to fulfil the somewhat niche needs of some users .
We rounded up some of the most interesting Linux distros out there that you might not have heard of .
Insecure by design : Damn Vulnerable Linux
Damn Vulnerable Linux is " The most vulnerable and exploitable operating system ever " according to its Web site .
It 's designed for security training ; it includes training material and exercises ( as well as a whole bunch of flaws to exploit ) .
As Mayank Sharma notes : " Damn Vulnerable Linux ( DVL ) is everything a good Linux distribution is n't .
Its developers have spent hours stuffing it with broken , ill - configured , outdated , and exploitable software that makes it vulnerable to attacks . "
Indulge in paranoia : Tinfoil Hat Linux
Image : Tinfoilhat.shmoo.com
Tinfoil Hat Linux is pretty much the opposite of Damn Vulnerable Linux : it 's designed for the paranoid among us .
" It started as a secure , single floppy , bootable Linux distribution for storing PGP keys and then encrypting , signing and wiping files .
At some point it became an exercise in over - engineering . "
According to its developers , a possible reason for using it is that that " Illuminati are watching your computer , and you need to use morse code to blink out your PGP messages on the numlock key . "
They 're joking .
Probably .
( In case you want more tinfoil protection , there are some links to a site about aluminium foil deflector beanies and tinfoil suits . )
CSI Linux : CAINE
CAINE ( Computer Aided INvestigative Environment ) is probably one of the coolest niche Linux distributions around .
It 's designed for digital forensics ( so sadly , no blood spatter analysis ) and was developed at the Information Engineering Department of the University of Modena e Reggio Emilia in Italy .
It includes software such as TheSleuthKit and Autopsy Forensic Browser for examining file systems , data recovery applications , steganography tools and utilities for securely wiping drives ( you know , in case someone else has a copy of CAINE ) .
Open source engineering : CAELinux
Image : Caelinux.com
CAELinux is designed for computer - aided engineering ( CAE ) .
It 's an Ubuntu - based operating system that 's packaged with a range of open source applications designed for simulating physics involving " non-linear thermo - mechanics , coupled fluid - structure dynamics , seismic / non-linear explicit dynamics , contacts , visco - plasticity , fluid dynamics , heat exchange , convection heat transfer and radiation , electro - magnetics " .
Seeking open source converts : Ubuntu Christian Edition
Image : Ubuntuce.com
According to the project 's FAQ page , Ubuntu Christian Edition is not intended to split the Ubuntu community .
Instead , it 's " intended to draw a larger Christian base to the already thriving community of Ubuntu users .
The Ubuntu Christian Edition simply makes it easier for Christians who are new to Linux to see the power of Ubuntu combined with the added benefit of having the best available Linux Christian software pre-installed " .
It 's a good example of a community constructing a Linux OS to meet their needs .
It includes applications such as Xiphos and e-Sword ( Bible - study tools ) , as well as DansGuardian Web filtering software .
Frag-tastic : live.linuX-gamers.net
Image : live.linux-gamers.net
The live .
linuX - gamers.net distro is a great piece of Linux evangelism : it 's a live DVD ( you do n't need to install it on your hard drive ) and it does exactly what it says on the box ( err , or downloadable ISO file , or something ) .
It 's designed to showcase Linux as a gaming environment , and ditches all the standard productivity software included in distros in favour of open source games .
Hard disk wizardry : Parted Magic
Image : Partedmagic.com
Parted Magic is a one - stop shop for manipulating your PC's hard drive — creating and manipulating partitions ( if you want to dual boot operating systems , for example ) , benchmarking drive speeds and testing for bad sectors .
Get creative : Musix GNU + Linux
Image : Musix.org.ar
There are a number of Linux - based operating systems designed for multimedia work .
Musix is one such distro , and it's a based on Debian .
It has the distinction of being on the Free Software Foundations list of fully free ( as in speech ) Linux distros .
Musix GNU + Linux is available for download as a live CD / DVD .

Who can keep up with the swarms of malware churned out by professional operations ?
The activities of smaller hacking groups such as the one operated by TJX and Heartland hacker Albert Gonzalez , or state - sponsored hacking operations such as the one believed to be responsible for the attacks on Google and other IT firms are even more difficult to monitor .
The malware authoring community is more clubby than stealthy , but it has typically operated just below the surface , communicating through members only listservs and Websites that are n't publicly accessible .
But as Mikko H. Hyppönen at F - Secure points out , malware authors are increasingly willing -- if not eager -- to talk about what they 're working on in a public forum .
[ Learn how to secure your systems with Roger Grimes ' Security Adviser blog and newsletter , both from InfoWorld . ]
Witness the phenomenon of the tweeting Trojan author @ DarkCoderSc , a French hacker who has been updating his couple dozen followers since April on the progress of DarkComet RT , a remote administration tool ( RAT ) application he is developing .
( Note : " Remote administration tools " are also referred to as " Trojans " when they 're used for things other than " administration . " )
The program itself , which is pre-release , has n't yet been identified by the major antivirus companies , but DarkCoderSc promises that , when finished , it will have many features that should get it flagged as malicious , including keylogging , multithreaded upload / download , botnet functions , and remote capture and webcam streaming -- basically features that let you spy on infected systems .
Using Twitter , you can keep up with the progress on DarkComet .
A post from April updates us on work on the keylogger function , which DarkCoderSc said " works very well and get all the keys with special carracters for all type of keyboard ; ) " and on " persistence " in 32 - and 64 - bit environments .
Of course , creating new " remote administration " tools is perfectly legal .
Yet DarkCoderSc's Website makes mention of a desire to do " partnerships . "
If through these " partners " the intent is to unleash DarkComet RT on the general public , we could be witnessing the birth of a new family of Trojan that , like Zeus or countless others , could aid and abet data theft from private computer networks .
You 'd think DarkCoderSc 's employer might like to know about his extracurricular activities .
He describes himself as " working in a French IT company as Web / System and misc programer " ( sic ) .
Although many companies would be happy to hire talented coders who think it 's fun to dream up new applications in their free time , DarkCoderSc 's activities might not be what they had in mind .
Recent history shows that it's a short leap from developing malicious programs to being involved in illegal schemes that leverage them .
Look no further than Stephen Watt , the talented programmer who was working for Morgan Stanley during the day , while coding a sniffer program that Albert Gonzalez used to siphon credit card numbers from the network of TJX and other firms .

The following is a fact - check from the August 22 , 2010 episode of Meet the Press :
FMR .
REP .
RICK LAZIO ( R - NY )
1 ) Within a month of Sept , 11 , 2001 , Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf said that America was “ an accessory to the crime of 9/11 . ” – TRUE
2 ) Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf said that Osama bin Laden was created in America .
– TRUE
3 ) Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has made statements with the past several months regarding Hamas in which he refused to “ distance himself ” from the group and / or protected them .
– LIKELY FALSE
4 ) Recently one of the Cordoba House developers said that they would consider taking money from Iran .
– FALSE
FMR .
REP .
LAZIO : Well , first of all I would say , David , there are millions of peace - loving , good Muslims in America .
This Imam Rauf is not one of them .
He ’s not a bridge builder .
This is a man , the very same month that people were burying their loved ones that were lost in 9/11 , he said that America was an accessory to the crime of 9/11 .
He said that Osama bin Laden was created in the USA .
He refuses , only months ago , to , to distance himself from Hamas , in fact , protecting him–protecting them , and only recently one of the developers said that they would consider taking money from Iran .
1 ) On Sept. 30th , 2001 an interview with Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf was shown on the CBS television program 60 Minutes , in which he stated that he believed that America was an accessory to the crime of 9/11 .
MR. BRADLEY ( voiceover ) :
And throughout the Muslim world , there is also strong opposition to America ’s foreign policy , particularly in the Middle East , because of its support of Israel and economic sanctions against Iraq .
MR .
ABDUL RAUF :
It is a reaction against the policies of the U.S. government , politically , where we espouse principles of democracy and human rights and where we ally ourselves with oppressive regimes in many of these countries .
MR .
BRADLEY : Are — are — are you in any way suggesting that we in the United States deserved what happened ?
MR .
ABDUL RAUF : I would n’t say that the United States deserved what happened , but the United States policies were an accessory to the crime that happened .
MR .
BRADLEY : O.K .
You say that we ’re an accessory ?
MR .
ABDUL RAUF : Yes .
Therefore , we rate this statement TRUE .
2 ) A moment later in the same 60 Minutes interview :
MR. BRADLEY : How ?
MR . ABDUL RAUF : Because we have been an accessory to a lot of — of innocent lives dying in the world .
In fact , it — in the most direct sense , Osama bin Laden is made in the U.S.A . …
The quote ends there , and the Cordoba Initiative has said it was taken out of context , however at least some context was indeed included in the program , as FactCheck.org has noted :
That was a reference to U.S. support for bin Laden when he was fighting Soviet occupiers in Afghanistan , as CBS ’
Bradley made clear in the sequence that immediately followed Rauf ’s remark : CBS ’ Ed Bradley , Sept. 30 , 2001 : “ Bin Laden and his supporters were , in fact , recruited and paid nearly $ 4 billion by the CIA and the government of Saudi Arabia in the 1980s to fight with the Mujahedeen rebels against the former Soviet Union , which had invaded Afghanistan .
After the Soviets pulled out , the Saudis , our best friends in the Arab world , our staunchest ally during the Gulf War , poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the newly formed Taliban regime until 1999 . ”
While it is impossible to know exactly whether or not Fmr. Rep. Lazio believes Mr. Abdul Rauf was speaking literally , we ’ll let the above context stand as it is .
Regardless , the statement is TRUE .
3 ) During a June 18th ABC radio interview , in response to the question “ Do you believe that the State Department is correct in designating Hamas as a terrorist organization ? ” – here is the statement Mr. Abdul Rauf made that started this particular controversy , which The New York Times characterizes as being part of “ a long conversation with many interruptions ” ( and also via FactCheck.org ) :
“ Well , I ’m not a politician . …
The issue of terrorism is a very complex question . … I am a bridge builder .
My work is … I do not want to be placed nor will I accept a position where I am the target of one side or another .
My attempt is to see a peace in Israel .
…
Targeting of civilians is wrong .
It ’s a sin in our religion , whoever does it . … I am a supporter of the State of Israel . ”
Fmr. Rep. Lazio said that Mr. Abdul Rauf “ refuses , only months ago , to , to distance himself from Hamas , in fact , protecting him–protecting them ” and in our judgment that is not an accurate summary of Mr. Abdul Rauf ’s comments .
This is of course a classic example of journo - political gamesmanship , where someone declining to answer a question is used to imply their opinion on that question .
While anyone reading the above remarks could certainly choose to believe that it was a statement of support for Hamas , we see it simply as a more nuanced “ I am not going to comment about that ”
To say that Mr. Abdul Rauf refused to distance himself from Hamas , or that he was protecting them , is LIKELY FALSE .
If someone does not answer the question “ Do the believe the sky is blue ? ” that does not mean they believe the sky is not blue , or that it is some other color .
4 ) Regarding the issue of money from Iran for the Park51 project , this is another even more clear example of “ no comment ” being used to assume a person ’s opinion .
Here is what the spokesman for the Park51 developers , Oz Sultan , said to ABC News :
“ We ’ll look at all available options within the United States to start .
We ’re hoping to fund this predominately from domestic donors .
That can be everything from institutions all the way down to personal [ contributors , ] ” said Sultan .
When asked if they would then turn to foreign donors , Sultan replied , “ I ca n’t comment on that . ”
Pressed on whether the developers were willilng rule out accepting donations from the governments of Saudi Arabia or Iran , he repeated , “ I ca n’t comment on that . ”
While this is clearly not a “ No ” to the question , that does not mean Fmr. Rep .
Lazio is accurate when saying they are considering taking money from Iran .
That is of course unless Fmr. Rep. Lazio is a psychic and knows exactly what they are indeed thinking , which we are going to presume he does not .
Therefore , technically his statement is FALSE , as the phrase “ we are considering taking money from Iran ” or it ’s equivalent was not said .
Mr. Sultan simply refused to answer the question , and while people can read into that whatever they wish , it is worth noting that on Aug. 26 , in an interview with CBS News , Park51 developer Sharif El - Gamal did answer the question :
“ We will not take money from Iran .
We will not take money from Hamas , ”
Incidentally it is also worth noting that ABC News , in its article summary of Mr. Sultan ’s statement of “ I ca n’t comment on that ” characterized it as “ refusing to rule out ” taking money from Iran .
We believe that to be an inaccurate summary of his statement , and most likely that kind of headlining contributed to the controversy .
We would very much recommend reading in their entirety , both this New York Times article and this FactCheck.org piece regarding these statements and many others referring to the “ Ground Zero Mosque ” ( both were used as references for this check ) .
Also as an editors note , we have used the term “ Ground Zero Mosque ” because it is the phrase which is now most commonly associated with this particular story , but we agree with PolitiFact that the term itself is likely inaccurate .
We recommend reading their judgment on the term here , and also their checks of the statements “ There is already a mosque four blocks away ” ( Michael Bloomberg , TRUE ) and “ This is not a mosque .
It ’s a cultural center that has a prayer area . ” ( Al Hunt , FALSE ) .
This fact - check took a combined 2.5 hours .

Bull Spec is the newest pro-paying magazine to hit the speculative fiction bookstore shelves .
It is the brainchild of Durham , North Carolina ’s favorite son , Samuel Montgomery - Blinn .
Sam has an ambitious plan for his magazine ; display the best North Carolina has to offer , showcase all that is new and relevant in the world of speculative fiction , and become the next SFWA qualifying magazine .
Sam was kind enough to send me his first copy to find out what I thought .
At 72 pages , there was n’t a shortage of things for me to comment on .
Rise Up by C S Fuqua
Life took a turn for the better the day Bobby walked into Sharps & Flats .
Not only did he find a jewel of a music store but he also found Wynne , the love of his life and missing piece to his band .
True , the old lady who owned the store was a bit odd , speaking nonsense on how music had power and was a conduit to the spirit world , but she did know her music .
With Wynne ’s help , Bobby ’s band found new heights .
A drive to meet a record executive brought it all to halt .
When he pulled Wynne ’s lifeless body from the twisted car , Bobby thought his world just ended .
The old lady said he had the power in him , a power over life and death .
Bobby had no idea that the line between life and death would n’t be so clear .
C S Fuqua employed a tactic that I am finding more common these days .
Open your story with the most dramatic part of your story then flashback to show the events that led up to it , risky and difficult to pull off .
It almost did n’t work , almost .
Rise
Up opened with a car crash ( which was done well ) .
After the dynamic opening , half of the story became a build up to the crash .
The flashback , I thought , was slow developing and my interest waned .
The story had a familiar tone to it and I believed I could see where it was heading from a mile away .
Mr. Fuqua proved that I was n’t a bright as I thought I was .
Good horror ( which is what I believe this is ) is n’t about gore but about the unexpected , and I admit I did n’t expect where Rise Up ended up .
C S Fuqua is a master of prose .
I found his writing crisp , filled with details that make a story come to life .
But for my tastes , Rise Up was n’t all that grand .
The characters were n’t all that interesting and their story was n’t that deep .
For a large section I found the story dull and wondered if the payoff for sticking with it would be worth it .
I am happy to say it was .
Rise
Up is a solid but thin story .
The writing is worthy of a professional publication .
Not too bad for an opening to the magazines first publication .
Almost A Good Day To Go Outside by Peter Wood
Ricardo has brought home the latest fad for his family to enjoy , a TV .
Just in time to catch the 1950 ’s programming that is just now reaching the terraforming colonist .
The TV is a distraction for Ricardo ’s cabin - fevered family .
The entire population of the colony is confined into a single mammoth structure called the hive .
The terraforming is taking longer than anticipated and depression is setting in .
Daily routine with no place to go is having an adverse effect , one that is tearing Ricardo ’s family apart .
Imagine working in a large factory , raising your family inside its walls , and never being able to leave .
Peter Wood effectively showed a small slice of such a problem .
In Almost A Good Day To Go Outside we also see the flipside of the problem .
On a planet light - years from Earth , workers ca n’t be replaced , no matter how badly they do their jobs .
Almost A Good Day To Go Outside is a good Sci -Fi story .
I liked the dilemma presented and the solution at the end .
It was an idea I ’d imagine the great writers of the 70’s would think of , yet would be still relevant today .
Although I thought the story lacked a depth of detail and settings that C S Fuqua so eloquently provided , it had a quick pace with characters I could relate to .
I enjoyed reading this one .
Doctor Adderson ’s Lens by Natania Barron
( reprinted from Gatehouse Gazette )
It was not unusual for Dellacarta to be summoned by her employer , Dr Adderson , even if it was by her reanimated zombie brother , Anton .
She is used to the unusual and strange as an aide to the brilliant doctor , or she thought she was .
One look through his latest invention , a monocle that grants sight of an unseen realm , and she realized that there is more to fear than an undead brother .
I classify this one as something that came out of left field .
Steampunk stories can be strange but Doctor Adderson ’s Lens has to be one of the oddest stories that I have ever read .
Ms Barron effectively made reanimated corpses as servants seem normal .
The unseen bird / parasites were an abrupt turn in an odd piece .
The style of writing a story as a past tense recollection I found distracting .
Doctor Adderson ’s
Lens is not my type of story but I can see how many would love it .
I found the plot a bit compressed but it did amuse me .
A Gathering of Doorways by Michael Jasper
( novel excerpt )
We get a glimpse of Mr. Jasper ’s prologue and first chapter in his latest novel .
The prologue is a recollection of dream Gil has of a place called the Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœUndercity ’ .
We learn of his wife plus one family , and a real life problem with polluted water on their farm .
Much of the prologue is devoted to his dream of the Undercity , which looks like any old , normal city , but for reasons unknown , the dream keeps him awake most nights .
In the first chapter , Gil is looking for his recently missing son , Noah .
He is joined in the search by his neighbor Ray and his dog .
Both men are disabled and there is an underlying fear of the forest that young Noah has wandered into .
I found the prologue to be unclear .
It did n’t build a curiosity about Gil , his problem , or about the mysterious Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœUndercity ’ .
The first chapter was more relevant but the flashback , which could n’t have been more than a few minutes before the opening dilemma , and the unexplained mysteries of the forest , polluted water , and Undercity , left me more lost than intrigued .
Gil ’s bad hip , judgmental wife , and dark reference to a shovel and a squatter , was n’t enough for me to want to know more .
When shopping for a novel , I like to read a sample of the book , especially when the author is new to me .
The sample Bull Spec provided should be a perfect length to draw a conclusion .
May I suggested to future authors , that take advantage of the mutually beneficial service , that you need not present the beginning of the novel , just an early portion .
I suspect a better scene to hook potential readers could be found in a later chapter for A Gathering of Doorways .
The excerpt should be enough for readers to get a feel for Mr. Jaspers writing .
Not for me , but judging by the reviews that he had for the entire novel , I ’m sure more than a few readers will want a closer look .
Closed System Part One : The Author of Time by Mike Gallagher
( comic strip )
The hero of Mr. Gallagher ’s work is Cambridge University ’s chosen time traveler .
He is traveling back in his flying ape - headed time machine to Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœdocument false historical facts ’ as one of his tasks , which he finds many of , as well as few faux pas the got by the author ( potatoes in the middle ages , George Washington at the signing of the Declaration of Independence ) .
The art of the strip is done well , and the story he created is fitting for a comic strip .
I am sure a few readers would be interested in the ongoing adventures of the traveler .
D Harlan Wilson an interview and review of his works .
Huh ?
It was the first word a writer used in his review of Wilson ’s novel Peckinpah , and a word that summed up my thoughts of the first half of Bull Spec ’s interview with Mr. Wilson .
In Sam Montgomery - Blinn ’s in depth interview , we learn that his latest novel has been long - listed for a Bram Stroker award , that he has sold many other works of fiction , is regarded as a respected literary critic and analyst , has a masters in SF studies ( who knew that existed ) , and has a PH.D devoted to a genre that he admits Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬academia still consider (s ) ( SF literature and scholarships ) as trash , detritus of the literary ghettoÃ¢â‚ ¬ ’
Quite an impressive resume , which proves the point that just because I never heard of him , does n’t mean he is n’t important .
In Mr. Blinn ’s lengthy review of D Harlan ’s Technologized Desire : Selfhood and the Body in Postcapitalist Science Fiction we get a glimpse of his critiquing talents as well as his opinions on the direction of Science Fiction as well as how it relates to the attitudes of today ’s society .
Mr. Blinn ’s sums up D Harlan ’s theme with his quote “ the universe of consumer - capitalism is an illusory prison from which there is no escape , despite the fact that it is illusory ” and delves deeper into his description of Sci - Fi ’s tendencies toward “ technocapitalist ” futures , a dark and dreary existence for man , one where “ free will is fiction ” .
In J. David Osbourne ’s review of Mr. Wilson ’s Peckinpah : An Ultraviolent Romance , we get a view of D Harlan ’s fictional prowess .
By Mr. Osbourne ’s brief analysis , the novel sounds every bit as bloody as the title suggests .
J. David summarizes it to be a “ Ã¢â‚¬satirical meta mash up of microfiction and microcriticism into something that maybe resembles a novel ,
Both reviewers thought highly of the novels , as did the editors of D Harlan Wilson in the interview .
They know him better than I , but unfortunately ( like most first time readers to Bull Spec ) I base all my impressions on what I have read in these few pages .
Mr. Wilson comes off as a bright but bitter man .
He sounds as ostentatious as his lengthy book titles , and as sure of his opinions as the blunt messages in them ( the titles ) .
Of course , good critics are n’t afraid to share their opinions , and D Harlan is all too happy to share what he thinks .
He used his boyhood town of Celina , OH as a template for his fictional novel , a place he admitted he “ hated ’ .
He sums up his time at Michigan State University as a “ sh*t experience ” while earning his PH.D , describing the program as “ Ã¢â‚¬full of glitches ranging from structural disorderliness to crummy and / or meatheaded faculty . ”
The critic Mr. Wilson also commented on his contemporary , Stephen King .
Admitting that he respected him — not for his writing , but for the fact he got rich writing it .
D Harlan ’s dour outlook on society and mankind ’s fate really comes through on his criticisms of Science Fiction over the past few decades , especially in the art of film .
He focuses on the darkest of works , choosing to stick with the Blade Runner blueprint of a dire future , one ’s that examine the depressing eventualities where technology and human physiology merge in a parasitic relationship ( and it ’s unsure which is the parasite ) .
He concludes the evolution of SF and mankind ’s fate is likely to head toward a future of “ no choice but to live as a technopathological extension of the machine . ”
Mr. Wilson comes to these conclusions by saying capitalistic technologies shape SF Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœfor “ unrelenting socioeconomic ends ” in an increasingly violent , self - perpetuating cycle of production and consumption . ’
While reading Sam ’s interview and the two reviews of D Harlan ’s fictional work and analytical critique , I could n’t help to think Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthis guy is overeducated and probably has n’t held a real job in his life ’ .
Noticing how he used the word Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcapitalism ’ as if it were a curse word only solidified my first impression .
Mr. Wilson ’s bases his conclusions on an assumption of capitalistic societies are evil and counter productive to mankind , as an accepted universal truth .
Mr. Wilson furthers his conclusions of Science Fiction reflecting the cynical nature of man eventual demise through a symbiotic relationship with technology , fueled by a capitalistic engine , by examining the darkest of SF works such as A Clockwork Orange , Fire on the Mountain , and Army of Darkness .
While looking on how a world would come about in the Matrix trilogy .
His works of fiction also reflect his cynical attitudes .
He is proud of his works but finds them difficult to classify , describing his style as “ creative freedom in narrative catastrophe , albeit catastrophe with order and purpose . ”
His latest accomplishments are of trilogy he calls “ Scikungfi ” ( good grief ) , a story of a time jumping man that knows kung fu .
His Peckinpah novel is filled with what the reviewer described as “ hyperviolence ” .
His novels follow the same path as the ones he gravitates to in his critical analysis , reflecting the worst of human nature .
All of which makes for some very depressing reading , which brings me to my own theory on how a bright mind could have such a bleak outlook and reflect it in his writings and criticisms .
D Harlan Wilson admitted he did n’t discover Science Fiction until his early twenties , when he was already hip deep in academic studies at a high - pressured Masters program .
That time of life is usually the most cynical in a person ’s life .
The world seems to be against you and people in power appear to be interested in their own ends instead of working toward the good of the people .
Most Sci-Fi and fantasy genre fans first discover the genre at an earlier age , mid to early teens .
It is a time when the world looks bright ; full of hope and opportunity .
Most readers look for the type of entertainment that fits their ideal outlook .
What you first fall in love with is what tends to stick with you .
It is the reason why the Star Trek phenomenon has such legs ( a fictional work Mr. Wilson ignored ) .
It is an idealistic future , one that shows a promising future without limits .
Most works of SF I read followed this theme .
Granted , I do n’t read as much SF novels as I used to , but most of the mountain of short stories I ’ve sample over the past couple of years has stayed true to this future of hope .
D Harlan Wilson may be correct of the future of SF and mankind but I tend to doubt it .
Humans are not inheritably evil beings that are after their own narrow interests , nor are they sheep that will accept techno - attachments so willingly , as a decree from the powers that be .
Capitalism is not an engine that is out to control and subvert man .
Corporations need customers .
Zombies make lousy consumers .
Any person that becomes a parent realizes that a future is important .
As long as children grace our lives , I choose to see man ’s future as a promising one , and most SF will continue to reflect that promise .
I wonder if D Harlan Wilson would buy my notion of a bright future ?
He better .
Resistance is futile .
The Other StuffÃ¢â‚¬
The Windup Girl by Paolo Bacigalupi ( as reviewed by Blue Tyson ) is a novel set in a future where most of Earth ’s oil reserves have been exhausted .
Set around Bangkok , much of the power generated is done so by the kinetic energy from human labor and genetically engineered animals .
The novel is done from more than one perspective and brings to life a world that must deal with mutated animals and diseases brought upon by meddling with genetics .
New political lines , old technologies , and fresh technological solutions for a power - starved world appear to be the draw of this novel .
Tyson ’s review describes Bacigalupi ’s novel as a dystopia , one that “ leaves you uneasy the whole way through , but fascinated ” .
Mr. Tyson is so enamored with it that he gave it 5 stars , and believes that it will be important to the future of Sci - Fi .
I ca n’t imagine a higher praise than that .
Panverse
One edited by Dario Cireillo ( as reviewed by Charles Tan ) is an anthology with five original novellas .
The theme is unclear but Mr. Tan does provide a small review for each story .
I found the cover of the book fascinating and Charles leads me to believe the work within is fitting for it .
He writes favorably of each story but reserves his highest praise for “ Delusion ’s Song ” written by Alan Smale , proclaiming that it is deserving of an award .
Although short , Charles
Tan ’s review was the most convincing as a sales pitch .
I just may buy myself a copy .
There are two poems in Bull Spec. Inspired by Windmills by Kaolin Imago Fire and Ratang by Ralan Conley .
As one not drawn to poetry I have little to offer .
If I were to pick from the two I would choose Ratang for its humor .
In Sam Montgomery - Blinn ’s interview of game developer , Lee Hammock , we learn of the creation and premise of one of the most anticipated RPG games of the year , Fallen Earth .
The premise of the game is set in the year 2156 in the Grand Canyon .
It is a hundred years after a plague has wiped out 99.9 % of life on Earth .
The Shiva virus has mutant life .
Players in the game are immune carriers that battle deadly monsters while escaping from a revolt of dictatorship that controls the Hoover Dam .
Mr. Hammock provides insight to what potential players may face in the game as well as the direction the designers are planning for future adaptations to the game as well as the collaborative process involved in creating the game .
The conversation between Sam and Lee changes to Lee ’s earlier RPG games and to his contributions to the graphic novels of the Halo RPG .
Â Mr. Hammock speaks highly of his writing team as well as rubbing elbows with his colleagues , even showing a little envy for a successful competitorÃ¢â‚ ¬
“ Ã¢â‚ ¬you ’re going for a burrito , why are you driving the Lamborghini ?
That ’s just rubbing our noses in it ! ”
If only I could face such problems .
I am not one to play computer RPG games .
However , it would be naÃ� ’ �ve to ignore their effect on today ’s SF market .
The shelves of the bookstores are filling with these fan - fic popular books .
Lee Hammock , I imagine , is a person that fascinates many people .
This interview should provide a glimpse many are after .
Sam also interviews the owner ( Jennifer Bedell ) and manager ( Zachary Boyd ) of SCI - FI GENRE COMICS AND GAMES .
The store , located at 3125 Old Chapel Hill RD , Durham , NC , is set in an old warehouse .
It is a haven for those that love the games , D&D games , and collectable game cards , like the Magic Gathering that have become popular .
The store boasts a sizeable staff that can provide you help that no ordinary department store can .
The duo have a business plan that I hope keeps it alive for years to come .
It sounds like a fun place to visit .
There is also one micro- flash story titled There Are No Orcs by Josh Whiton , short but sweet .
It is translated into French and Spanish .
Would n’t it be something if it were to become the Rosetta Stone for future generations ?
If you are looking for variety in your Speculative Fiction , Bull Spec is the magazine for you .
The stories cover a wide spectrum for fans of all types .
The reviews and interviews follow the same pattern .
I believe that is wise if the editors are looking for a wide audience .
I did see one thing that linked them all together .
All the stories , as well as the subject in the chief interview , were a shade on the darker side .
Could be it was just a coincidence but I worry it could become common because of the prevailing tastes .
Knowing that all the works of fiction carry that same theme would make them predictable over time .
Other than the slightly shaded theme , all the storytellers varied in quality and style .
The differences were good and added to my enjoyment .
However , the most thought provoking item in the magazine was D Harlan Wilson ’s interview .
Of the three short stories I thought Rise Up was written the best but A Good Day To Go Outside I enjoyed the most .
All the reviews I found helpful and I encourage Bull Spec to continue this service .
I also appreciated the novel excerpt .
Keep that up as well .
Sam Montgomery - Blinn ’s interviews were well done .
He asked relevant questions and steered the conversations on an engaging path , getting his subjects to relax , which made for a lot of information given freely .
Quite a skill he has for this .
Perhaps that microphone Sam is talking into on page 63 explains how he fine - tuned that skill .
I thought the artwork was well done , the announcements at the end informative , and the GUD ad fitting .
The quality and set up of Bull Spec is worthy of any pro-magazine .
However , for Bull Spec to become a SFWA it needs to stand out .
The cover art by Mike Gallagher is drawn well , a little too well .
If Bull Spec is sitting on a long rack in a bookstore among a hundred of other magazines , I may assume it to be an American Art Review knock off .
Although the old woman presenting a mandolin did fit the lead story it would n’t have been enough to capture my eye .
Bull Spec is full of variety but it is n’t set up that way .
The first third is all stories , then all reviews and interviews from that point on .
It is wise to place your lead story in the opening pages but the interviews , I thought , should have been mixed in with the fictional works .
The readers that are n’t so inclined to read interviews may toss the magazine aside and remember Bull Spec to be thin in content because only the first 20 to 30 pages interested them .
Bull Spec did make for a nice read .
Enjoyed all the stories , liked that they were spread across a variety of genres , appreciated the reviews , and was impressed by the interviews .
What I would like to see from future issues would be more of a mixed format .
Also there were four stories to enjoy but only two were original shorts and one of the four a novel excerpt .
The interviews were nice but three was one too many .
Lee Hammock and D Harlan Wilson were both worthy of headlining promotion , splitting them up onto separate issues might have been a better idea .
One more original work of fiction and one less interview I think is the way to go , and it is that additional work of fiction I believe would put Bull Spec on the map .
The only thing the magazine needs to make it stand out is star power , a recognizable name on its cover .
Without knowing the inner workings of running or editing a magazine ( which may make me naÃ � ’ �ve ) , the editors should reach out and offer a spot in its pages , even if it is sight unseen , to a big name in SF .
It would be the magnet Bull Spec needs .
True , C S Fuqua and Michael Jasper are not first time writers , but there are several well known attention grabbers that may be all to happy to showcase there work for a new audience .
All it might take is contacting them or their agents .
In fact , D Harlan Wilson may have been able to provide one of his short works for the magazine .
I learned of who he was in the interview , what the reviewers thought of his two books , but aside from a brief excerpt in one of the reviews , I have no idea of what his writing was like .
All in all , I thought Sam and his staff did a fine job with their debut issue .
Look for Bull Spec to be gracing the shelves of your favorite bookstore , or you can order a print copy or PDF copy online .
Â
The PDF copy is available for “ donate what you want ” , and yes that includes $ 0 ( but if you like it I hope you consider chipping in a few bucks ) .
Â I recommend that you get yourself a copy .

Update 2
Good news !
Two people ( Katie , who comments below , and a co-conspirator ) are putting together an anthology of writings by “ perverts of color ” , which includes kinky and poly people .
It was this sort of eventual product that I was trying to get at in this post , though I did not do a good job of it .
So I am very excited about the upcoming anthology .
You can read about the status of the anthology here .
Update
If it were possible to truly retract a blog post , I would want to do so with this post .
But it is not , and I have a moral problem with deleting pithy comments such as those below .
I am leaving this post up as a lesson in what not to do , and as a starting point for conversations .
The first rule of this sort of work is to not further the oppression in question .
And that ’s where I failed in this posting .
By centering white people in my language and discussing the polyamory movement in unqualified terms , I made it difficult to have a productive conversation about race , which is what I was looking for .
In retrospect , it is not at all surprising that the post resulted in various critical comments but not much in the way of stories .
I encourage readers to read this post in a critical manner , remembering that polyamory communities include people of color , and there are many kinds of poly community out there , some more visible and some less .
Please read Katie and Nabil ’s comments along with my original post in order to get the full picture .
To their criticisms , let me add that it is perhaps problematic ( patronizing ?
colonizing ? ) for a white person to ask people of color to put their stories on the line as I have done here .
At the very least it is difficult to do elegantly , and my activist urges have outrun my skill level in this case .
With these issues in mind , feel free to comment or continue any of the conversations started below .
I am abandoning the stories project for now .
It is clear that I need to think hard about my positioning in racial power dynamics before trying again .
If I decide that I am the right person to lead another attempt , the end goal would be to have a kind of mini-reference of the issues and experiences that people of color face around race and polyamory , something that could be referred to during power struggles around race within poly community .
I may still do a somewhat more generic interview project for polyweekly , because I think polyweekly could greatly be improved with more personal voices .
If I do , I will be sure to include poly people of color as interviewees and race as a salient feature .
I apologize deeply for this abortive attempt .
I do understand that flailing about like this can cause damage , and at the very least is not productive in anti-oppression work .
I know I should have devoted a lot more attention and care to this post .
I will be sure to do so in the future when dealing with race and racism .
Original Post
Motivation
Recently at a large poly speed dating event here in San Francisco , I estimated that around 85 % of the room was white .
This may not seem like a lot to some of my readers , but it looks a lot bigger if we remember that San Francisco itself is only 43 % white , and the greater Bay Area is still only about half white .
For some reason , or more likely a series of reasons , poly community in the area is either failing to attract or managing to exclude people of color .
This disparity becomes even stronger if we look at the the well - known luminaries of the polyamory movement .
I have eleven books about polyamory on my shelf , and all but one were written by white people as far as I know .
( And the exception is not a well - known poly book . )
And while there definitely are a growing number of poly activists of color , that number was still a handful at the recent summit of poly leaders in Philadelphia .
I have been collecting my thoughts on race and polyamory into a separate post , but as I was writing that essay , I realized that my writing should not be the first or last word on the matter , in this blog or anywhere else .
One of the intersectional issues for race and polyamory is the near - complete lack of representation of people of color who are nonmonogamous .
So I am trying to do my little part to remedy this visibility problem , both here on the blog and on the polyweekly podcast .
My personal motivation here is related to my polyamory organizing and activism .
I put on local polyamory events , and any understanding of racial dynamics around nonmonogamy is immediately useful to me in making these events more inclusive , and for figuring out how to support local poly people of color .
I am hoping this call will be a conversation starter around these issues .
The Call
I am looking for stories or thoughts by people of color ( including mixed - race people ) who identify as polyamorous or nonmonogamous .
I am also looking to hear from white people in interracial relationships .
I will collect these together and then post them here as a separate blog post .
If you are a nonmonogamous person of color with something to relate , please send me something as short as a paragraph or as long as a couple thousand words .
You can do that by posting it as a comment here or by emailing me .
I will only perform minor edits for grammar or clarity before reposting .
I will not post these thoughts anywhere other than this blog .
Also , let me know what level of attribution you want : name ?
link ?
bio ? anonymous ?
I am also looking for interview folks for polyweekly .
I am a co-host there , and the show is an easy way to reach a couple thousand people .
My current vague plan is to do human - interest style interviews with race as a salient presence .
If you are interested in being interviewed , or have some other idea for creating content , email me .
You should write about whatever seems important to you .
However , if you are short on ideas , here are some questions that might get things flowing :
What do you think of local polyamory community ?
Are you engaged with it in some way ?
Do you think that attending events would be a good or bad idea ?
If you have gone to local poly events , what good or bad experiences did you have ?
How do race and polyamory intersect for you ?
Do you find that stigma tends to stack as a poly person of color ?
Does dealing with racism tend to take priority over figuring out nonmonogamy , or vice versa ?
Do you find yourself traveling between communities ?
I have noticed that the poly people of color who attend local poly events in my area are mostly those who are willing to date white folks , which is not too surprising given the white super - majority at these events .
For those poly people of color who date white people , do you run into difficulties around race in these relationships ?
Or trouble finding partners ?
I do reserve the right to exclude posts that are egregious in some way : completely incoherent , hate speech against an oppressed group , etc .
However , I do not anticipate this being an issue .
All other stories will be reposted unless the author specifically requests that they are not .
Comment Policy
Because the purpose of this post is to hear people ’s experiences , I will have a comment policy in place .
I encourage folks to start discussions based on any posted experiences , but responses that are overly critical or which seek to invalidate people ’s experience will be moderated .
Please be respectful .
Similarly , comments which seek to shut down or derail the conversation will be moderated .
If you are curious if this includes your response , check it against these bingo sheets .
White commenters , please state your race .
I welcome comments from people of color which are critical of this project .
If you see flaws in this , please speak up .
By now my voice has almost recovered : I 'm looking back on four days of non -stop explaining USE flags , summarizing a Gentoo installation , selling 28 shirts in total , coordinating this and that : LinuxTag 2010 Berlin / Germany is over .
All kinds of visitors accepted flyers -- we were rather proactive on distributing them -- and asked questions : young and old , with wheelchair and without , hobbyists and professionals , men and women .
Especially to meet three female Gentoo users was a welcome surprise :
With less - than - we - wish - for female developers in Gentoo I did n't expect to meet any ;
interestingly they did n't seem to know that they were even wanted to join as developers .
I hope all of them will get in touch with us .
We took the opportunity to participate with the Projects Fast Forward -- a collection of talks , 2 slides in 2 minutes each -- on all four days , teasing visitors to find out more at our booth .
Florian Streibelt did great at the talks and the slides itself .
On Friday the Förderverein Gentoo e.V. had a two hour meeting on fairgrounds .
This German initiative -- which has conceptual similarities to the US - based Gentoo Foundation -- is funding flyers from member fees and provides other background services for the European community .
Four new members joined during LinuxTag .
On Saturday rbu and I teamed up for an interview with RadioTux introducing Gentoo hosting of user overlays , the upcoming Git migration and changes in tone on communication mediums .
You 'll hear more on that soon .
Also Saturday was the day that a Swedish consultant who is part of upstream of the free Linux - based BIOS replacement Coreboot ( formerly LinuxBIOS )
approached me articulating interest in joining as a developer in close - to - native German .
He would be the fourth Swedish developer and I am optimistic he could be that soon .
His overlay " stuge " hit Layman earlier today .
On the non-Gentoo front I had a chance to shake hands with the new Debian project leader Stefano Zacchiroli , and to learn about QA processes in Debian from Jan Hauke Rahm .
The Kernel report talk was interesting , too .
Also part of my time explaining things went to Free Software , not just Gentoo .
Back to Gentoo .
As Gentoo is about choice we had a few visitors choose what flavor of sweets to re-fill the sweet distribution plate with : they will never forget the sweet taste of choice in Gentoo .
Also , the Gentoo badge compiling machine served demonstrating choice and compilation again , operated by Daniel Sturm most of the time .
Chithanh participated in the distro contest for us and also was part of the team winning the hacking contest .
I assume with his Gentoo shirt on in that moment .
The hopefully complete list of current developers who I met on LinuxTag is : lu_zero , idl0r , polynomial - c , dertobi123 , amne , rbu , hollow , chithanh , a3li , vorlon , hanno .
Current Gentoo - GSoC student Andreas Nüsslein ( rewriting webapp - config ) also came by , Timo Antweiler said hello , too .
Thanks for the chocolate to lu_zero , thanks to the helpful and friendly LinuxTag team ( especially Jacqueline ) , thanks to everyone helping out , especially to Sebastian Dyroff for joining with setup on Tuesday evening .
See you again next year !

Kenyan MP James Orengo
A Kenyan lawmaker told the nation 's parliament last month that Barack Obama was born in Africa and is therefore " not even a native American . "
During debate over the draft of a new Kenyan constitution , James Orengo , the country 's minister of lands and a member of parliament for the Ugenya constituency , cited America 's election of a Kenyan - born president as an example of what can be accomplished when diverse peoples unite :
" If America was living in a situation where they feared ethnicity and did not see itself as a multiparty state or nation , " Orengo posited , " how could a young man born here in Kenya , who is not even a native American , become the president of America ? "
Orengo held up the U.S. as a country no longer " living in the past , " since Americans elected a Kenyan - born president without regard to " ethnic consideration and objectives . "
TRENDING : The Bidens avoided paying more than $ 500,000 in payroll taxes by exploiting S corporations
A new strategy has been unveiled to demand answers to Obama 's eligibility questions .
See how you can help .
Debate is then recorded in the Kenyan government 's official March 25 , 2010 , hansard – a traditional name for printed transcripts of a parliamentary debate – as continuing with no other MPs mentioning or attempting to correct Orengo 's comments about Obama .
As WND has reported , several other sources – including National Public Radio – have claimed Obama 's birthplace as Kenya prior to his election as president .
WND also reported when a video appeared in which Michelle Obama said her husband 's " home country " was Kenya , though her comments did n't specifically suggest his birth there .
The video , posted April 3 on YouTube and forwarded by a score of Internet e-mails , shows Michelle Obama saying , " When we took our trip to Africa and visited his home country in Kenya , we took a public HIV test . "
The reference drew attention because of the claim made in numerous lawsuits and other challenges to Obama 's occupancy of the Oval Office that he is not eligible to be president under the requirement of Article 2 , Section 1 of the Constitution that the president be a " natural born citizen . "
But the NPR reference and Michelle Obama 's comment are far from the only ones of their kind .
RELATED : THE BIG LIST of eligibility ' proofers '
At one point , there were reports that even Obama 's grandmother claimed being in attendance at his birth in Africa .
According to a compilation of images at a military forum , another reference was made in 2008 in the Nigerian Observer .
Under a byline from Solomon Asowata and a Washington dateline , the report says , " Americans will today go to the polls to elect their next president with Democratic Party candidate , Senator Barack Obama largely favoured to win .
The Kenyan - born Senator will , however , face a stiff competition from his Republican counterpart … "
A commentary at The Post & Email website said , " It is no wonder that many doubt Obama 's claim of a Hawaiian birth . "
It cited another report from African Travel Magazine that said , " As Kenyan born U.S. Senator Barack Obama jets into Kenya today as part of his African tour , concerns have once again been raised on the security preparations for other visitors and residents .
.... "
The Post & Email commentary also cited a report from Indonesia Matters that includes similar references .
WND documented earlier several other statements linking Obama and Kenya .
These included the apparently archived article from the Sunday Standard in Kenya .
The report begins , " Kenyan - born US Senate hopeful , Barrack ( sic ) Obama , appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival , Jack Ryan , dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations . "
The article is credited to the wire service Associated Press at the bottom of the page .
However , the article could not be found either in the AP archives available to the public online or the archive on the newspaper 's website .
WND telephone calls and e-mails to the newspaper did not generate a response .
Last year , an African news site and an MSNBC broadcaster referred to President Obama 's birthplace as being outside of the United States .
Network correspondent Mara Schiavocampo was reporting on the celebratory atmosphere in Accra , Ghana , immediately prior to Obama 's visit to the west African nation .
Interviewing a person who appeared to be a shop operator , she stated , " Barack Obama is Kenyan … but Ghanaians are still proud of him . "
The video of the report is at this link .
Also , a report at Modern Ghana posted in advance of the president 's visit cited his birthplace on the continent of Africa .
" For Ghana , Obama 's visit will be a celebration of another milestone in African history as it hosts the first - ever African - American President on this presidential visit to the continent of his birth , " the report said .
WND has reported on dozens of legal challenges to Obama 's status as a " natural born citizen . "
The Constitution , Article 2 , Section 1 , states , " No Person except a natural born Citizen , or a Citizen of the United States , at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution , shall be eligible to the Office of President . "
Some of the lawsuits question whether he was actually born in Hawaii , as he insists .
If he was born out of the country , Obama 's American mother , the suits contend , was too young at the time of his birth to confer American citizenship to her son under the law at the time .
Other challenges have focused on Obama 's citizenship through his father , a Kenyan subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom at the time of his birth , thus making him a dual citizen .
The cases contend the framers of the Constitution excluded dual citizens from qualifying as natural born .
Complicating the situation is Obama 's decision to spend sums exceeding $ 1.7 million to avoid releasing an original long - form state birth certificate that would put to rest the questions .
WND also has reported that among the documentation not yet available for Obama includes his kindergarten records , Punahou school records , Occidental College records , Columbia University records , Columbia thesis , Harvard Law School records , Harvard Law Review articles , scholarly articles from the University of Chicago , passport , medical records , files from his years as an Illinois state senator , his Illinois State Bar Association records , any baptism records and his adoption records .
Because of the dearth of information about Obama 's eligibility , WND founder Joseph Farah has launched a campaign to raise contributions to post billboards asking a simple question : " Where 's the birth certificate ? "
" Where 's The Birth Certificate ? " billboard at the Mandalay Bay resort on the Las Vegas Strip
WND also reported previously when Michelle Obama contradicted Obama 's story that he lived with his mother and father for several years in Hawaii after he was born before his father left to pursue a graduate degree .
Michelle Obama said her husband 's mother , Ann Dunham , was " very young and very single " when she gave birth to the future U.S. president .
Her comments undermine the official story as told by Barack Obama – that Dunham was married to his father , Barack Obama Sr. , at the time of birth .
The remarks were made by Michelle Obama during a July 2008 round table at the University of Missouri .
Obama was responding to criticism of her husband 's presidential campaign speeches about fatherhood and faith - based initiatives .

A Swedish artist who created an international furore by depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a dog was assaulted as he delivered a university lecture .
Lars Vilks says he was head - butted by an audience member as he spoke about the limits of artistic freedom .
The cartoonist 's glasses were broken , but he was not injured .
Mr Vilks has been threatened on numerous occasions , but the assault at Uppsala University was the first time he has been physically attacked .
The artist said a group of about 15 people had been shouting and trying to interrupt the lecture , which was attended by about 250 people .
" A man ran up and threw himself over me .
I was head - butted and my glasses were broken , " Mr Vilks was quoted as saying by the AP news agency .
A video clip of the attack was posted on the website of a Swedish newspaper .
It showed police using pepper spray and batons to control an angry crowd shouting " God is great " in Arabic as Mr Vilks was led away .
Two people were detained .
Earlier this year , Mr Vilks was the target of an alleged murder plot involving Colleen LaRose , an American who called herself " Jihad Jane " .
She has pleaded not guilty , but faces life in prison if convicted .
In 2007 , a group linked to al - Qaeda in Iraq offered a $ 100,000 ( £ 66,000 ) reward for killing Mr Vilks , and a 50 % bonus if he was " slaughtered like a lamb " by having his throat cut .
The Vilks cartoon was published about a year - and - a - half after a series of depictions of the Prophet Muhammad in Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten paper caused protests by Muslims around the world .
The State Department and personnel at U.S. embassies around the world are reportedly waiting anxiously to find out if an Army intelligence analyst was telling the truth when he boasted that he had supplied 260,000 classified State Department diplomatic cables to the whistleblower site Wikileaks .
If Wikileaks has the secret documents and publishes them , the leak could not only expose damaging information about U.S. foreign policy and national security issues , but also expose embarrassing information about backroom diplomatic deals and U.S. attitudes toward foreign leaders — such as the opinions of U.S. ambassadors about the honesty , integrity , and strength and longevity of those leaders .
The concerns are reported in a story published at the Daily Beast that appears to confirm that alleged leaker Bradley Manning had access to the kinds of cables he recently discussed with a former hacker who turned him in to authorities .
As previously reported , Manning told ex-hacker Adrian Lamo that he had recently given 260,000 classified U.S. diplomatic cables to Wikileaks , and said the documents exposed “ almost - criminal political back dealings . ”
“ Hillary Clinton and several thousand diplomats around the world are going to have a heart attack when they wake up one morning , and find an entire repository of classified foreign policy is available , in searchable format , to the public , ” Manning told Lamo in an online chat session .
" If he really had access to these cables , we 've got a terrible situation on our hands , " an anonymous American diplomat told the Daily Beast .
" We 're still trying to figure out what he had access to .
A lot of my colleagues overseas are sweating this out , given what those cables may contain . ”
He said the cables could damage diplomatic efforts of the U.S. and its allies , and that the State Department and law enforcement agencies have been trying to determine whether , and how , to approach Wikileaks about not publishing the cables if it has them .
SPC Bradley Manning , 22 , of Potomac , Maryland , was an Army intelligence analyst stationed at Forward Operating Base Hammer , 40 miles east of Baghdad .
He was put under pre-trial confinement in Kuwait nearly two weeks ago by the Army ’s Criminal Investigation Division .
The Defense Department said in a statement this week that Manning has not been formally charged , but is being investigated for allegedly leaking classified information .
A U.S. military official told Wired.com that " everybody 's scattering in a thousand different directions , digging deep [ for this investigation ] .
We do n't just do that for every story that pops up . "
He added that the public revelations about Manning 's alleged activities this week " alerted a lot of people that did n't even know about this at the highest level . "
Manning was turned in late last month by Lamo , with whom he spoke online .
In the course of their chats , Manning took credit for leaking the State Department cables to Wikileaks , as well as a headline - making video of a helicopter attack in Iraq that Wikileaks posted online April 5 , another video showing the notorious 2009 Garani air strike in Afghanistan that Wikileaks has previously acknowledged is in its possession , and a classified Army document evaluating Wikileaks as a security threat .
Manning told Lamo he sent the Iraq video to Wikileaks in February .
He does n't say when he allegedly transmitted the cables .
Wikileaks has not responded to calls and e-mails from Wired.com .
A message published on the organization 's Twitter account Monday said that allegations " that we have been sent 260,000 classified U.S , embassy cables are , as far as we can tell , incorrect . "
The site has , however , posted one diplomatic cable that Manning mentions in his chat with Lamo .
It was published by Wikileaks last February and describes a U.S. embassy meeting with the government of Iceland .
The State Department has suggested to the Daily Beast that even if Manning did n't give thousands of cables to Wikileaks , he may still have downloaded a huge library of them and stored them for later transmission .
According to the Daily Beast , Manning apparently had " special access to cables prepared by diplomats and State Department officials throughout the Middle East regarding the workings of Arab governments and their leaders . "
The cables date back several years and traversed interagency computer networks that are available to the Army .
They contain information about U.S. diplomatic and intelligence efforts in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones , the diplomat said .
Manning enlisted in the Army in 2007 and was deployed with the 2nd Brigade 10th Mountain Division in Baghdad last November .
Prior to this , he had been stationed at Fort Drum in New York , where his division is headquartered .
Manning was a 35 F intelligence analyst with a Top Secret / SCI security clearance .
According to the Army's web site , analysts in this position " use information derived from all intelligence disciplines to determine changes in enemy capabilities , vulnerabilities and probable courses of action . "
Duties include receiving and processing incoming intelligence reports and messages and maintaining intelligence records and files .
In chats with Lamo that Wired.com has examined , Manning said he had access to two classified networks from two separate secured laptops : SIPRnet , the Secret - level network used by the Department of Defense and the State Department , and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System which serves both agencies at the Top Secret / SCI level .
The networks , he said , were both “ air - gapped ” from unclassified networks , but the environment at the base made it easy to smuggle data out .
“ I would come in with music on a CD - RW labeled with something like ‘ Lady Gaga , ’ erase the music then write a compressed split file , ” he wrote .
“ No one suspected a thing and , odds are , they never will . ”
“ [ I ] listened and lip - synced to Lady Gaga ’s ‘ Telephone ’ while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history , ” he added later .
” Weak servers , weak logging , weak physical security , weak counterintelligence , inattentive signal analysis … a perfect storm . ”
Regarding the State Department cables specifically , Manning told Lamo , " State dept fucked itself .
Placed volumes and volumes of information in a single spot , with no security . "
Manning described personal issues that got him into trouble with his superiors and left him socially isolated .
He said he had been demoted after he punched a colleague in the face during an argument , and was reassigned to a job in a supply office pending early discharge .
He also told Lamo , " I 'm restricted to SIPR now , because of the discharge proceedings . "
Army spokesman Lt. Col. Eric Bloom in Baghdad confirmed that in early May , Manning was demoted to private first class and was reassigned job duties .
He did not know the reason behind the demotion but said Manning was not being discharged early and that his deployment in Iraq was supposed to last a year .
Bloom said the demotion was conducted under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice in a nonjudicial proceeding , and that Manning maintained his security clearance after the demotion .
He did not know what access Manning would have had to classified networks following his job reassignment .
A State Department source told the Daily Beast that Pentagon investigators have been searching through Manning 's e-mail accounts and computer hard drives for evidence of the data he claims to have downloaded and transmitted to Wikileaks .
But in his chats with Lamo , Manning told the ex-hacker that all traces of evidence had been deleted from his work computers as part of the troop - withdrawal procedures that have started in Iraq .
" I had two computers .
One connected to SIPRnet the other to JWICS , " he wrote .
" They 've been zero - filled .
Because of the pullout , evidence was destroyed ... by the system itself . "
He also told Lamo that network security monitoring and logging was ineffective or nonexistent .
" There 's god -awful accountability of IP addresses , " he wrote .
" The network was upgraded , and patched up so many times , and systems would go down , logs would be lost .
And when moved or upgraded , hard drives were zeroed .
It 's impossible to trace much on these field networks . "

NYC has the greatest number of bus commuters in North America but the some of slowest bus service in the nation .
In an attempt to turn the tortoise into a hare , the DOT is moving forward with " Select Bus " service on First and Second Avenues .
Construction will begin this month , creating dedicated terra - cotta brown bus lanes and extending some sidewalks to allow buses to pick up and discharge passengers without having to exit and reenter traffic .
The new service , running from 125th to Houston Streets , is expected to improve overall travel time by 20 percent .
Buses will be equipped with three doors for quicker boarding and exiting , and tickets will be sold at sidewalk kiosks .
Riders will be on the honor system and not required to show their tickets unless asked .
( Scofflaws will be subject to a $ 100 fine . )
The Select Buses will make fewer stops than the current M15 Limited , but unlike the physically separated bus lanes planned for 34th Street , the Select Bus lanes will not be separated from traffic .
" New Yorkers are tired of waiting years and decades for changes to make their streets work better , " DOT commissioner Janette Sadik - Khan tells the Times .
" We want to give buses the red carpet . "
The service will be similar to the one that runs along Fordham Road in The Bronx , and the DOT says police will step up enforcement of the bus lanes , issuing $ 150 tickets to cabs and other motorists who block the lane .
( On about half the route , trucks will be allowed to use the lane for deliveries from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on weekdays . )
A plan to give Select Buses technology that would extend green traffic lights as they approach has been put on the backburner for now .
The Select Buses are expected to start running in October , and the changes will include 3.5 miles of protected bike lanes , separated from traffic by a row of parked cars .
But the bike lane improvement will only run between Houston and 34th Street , and the dedicated bus lane on Second Avenue will cease between 70th and 100th Streets because of construction of the Second Avenue subway .
Transporation Alternatives spokesman Wiley Norvell tells us that cycling advocates " will be working overtime to make sure the bike lanes we ’ve been fighting for from 34th to 125th , and the pedestrian safety islands that accompany them . "
But he says , " When it 's completed up through East Harlem , the East side will have the best streets for biking , walking and buses anywhere in the country . "

Media reports in Ankara on Wednesday revealed that three out of the four Turkish citizens that were killed during the raid declared their wishes to become shahids ( martyrs ) .
Another Dutch report claimed a Dutch activist , who was arrested by the IDF is suspected of being a senior Hamas operative .

" I am going to be a shahid ; I dreamt I will become a shahid – I saw in a dream that I will be killed , " Benginin told his family before leaving for the sail .
Gaza flotilla , latest stories on Ynet :
According to the report , beniginin , who graduated from al - Azhar University in Cairo , served for the past two years as the chairman of a foundation for rights and freedom in education and culture .
His family noted that he had spoken in the past about his dream to become a shahid in Gaza .
Another Turkish citizen killed during the raid , Ali Akhbar Iritilmis ( 55 ) , a father of four from Ankara , was active in the IHH organization , which led the naval convoy to Gaza .
" He was devoted to this activity , and always dreamt about becoming a shahid , " said his close friend Mehmet Faruq Cheber .
Anadolu News Agency reported that the third activist killed on boards the Marmara , Ibrahim Bilgen ( 61 ) , an engineer and father of six , was active in the Islamic party in southern Turkey .
" He was a role model to all of us ; a true philanthropist .
Therefore , it suited him to die a shahid 's death .
Allah gave him the death he wanted , " said Ibrahim 's brother , Nuri Mergen .
The fourth slain activist , Muharram Kuchak , was also a volunteer with the IHH .
The three Turkish " shahids , " as it turns out , were not alone .
Holland - based Teltarif newspaper reported Wednesday morning that Amin Abou Rashed , 43 , and Anne de Jong , 29 , are probably the only two Dutch citizens that were arrested among the flotilla participants .
The newspaper 's investigation revealed incriminating details from Abou Rashed 's past ; intelligence sources claimed he is the local Hamas leader , while the Muslim Brotherhood 's website identified him as one of the organizers of the naval convoy .
According to Teltarif 's report , Dutch intelligence services have been following Abou Rashed 's activities for a long time .
He worked , among other places , with al- Aqsa Foundation , suspected of acting under the guise of a charity , while funneling its donations to Hamas .
New Delhi , India ( CNN ) --
Rescue teams worked into the night at the smoldering scene of an Air India plane crash that killed 158 people Saturday after the jet overshot a runway in southern India , crashed into a ravine and burst into flames , officials said .
As darkness descended , workers used portable lights to pull charred bodies out of the wreckage outside Mangalore International Airport .
All but eight bodies have been recovered , the civil aviation ministry said .
Eight of the 166 people on board Air India Flight IX - 812 survived the crash and were taken to hospitals , where most were in good condition , CNN - IBN reported .

The Boeing 737 took off from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and crashed while trying to make its scheduled landing in Mangalore at 6:30 a.m. Saturday ( 9 p.m. ET Friday ) , Air India spokesman Anup Srivastava said .
India 's civil aviation minister Praful Patel said an investigation was underway but reasons for the crash would not be known until the flight data and voice data recorders have been recovered .
Emergency workers were attempting to cool the fiery wreckage Saturday night to keep the data intact .
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board announced Saturday that it will send a team to India to assist in the investigation .
The Air India jet touched down on an 8,000 - foot runway -- 2,000 feet longer than the old runway and more than sufficient for the Boeing 737 , Patel said .
The runway has been operational since 2006 .
Some of the survivors recounted their harrowing tales for CNN - IBN .
Ummerfarook Mohammed said the cabin quickly filled with smoke after the jet skidded off the runway and hit a boundary wall .
The impact created a hole in the plane 's body , he said , through which he crawled out and ran for his life .
Nearby villagers carted him in a rickshaw to a hospital .
A medical student said she escaped from the plane but that she then free - fell until she was snagged by a tree , where rescuers found her .
Some of those flying back from Dubai were among the millions of Indians who work as laborers in Persian Gulf states .
Mangalore 's airport was " technically certified " by the country 's civil aviation regulator .
Patel said weather conditions were good -- calm winds , no rain and good visibility of 6 kilometers -- and both the pilot and co-pilot were experienced and had landed many times before at the Mangalore airport .
They did not report any problems before landing the plane , India 's civil aviation ministry said .
However , the 90 - meter spillover sand bed beyond the runway was limited and was not able to stop the aircraft after it overshot the tarmac , Patel said .
Only the tail of the aircraft was left intact .
Witnesses said the plane crashed through the hilltop airport 's boundary wall and fell into a valley , CNN - IBN reported .
Survivors told CNN 's sister network that they jumped out of the plane after it crashed , seconds before it burst into flames .
Rescue workers struggled to reach the crash site in a hilly wooded area , the network said .
Smoke from the plane also hampered rescue efforts and many of the recovered bodies were badly burned , CNN - IBN reported .
Abhay Pathak , a regional manager for Air India based in Dubai , said there were 160 passengers on board the plane and six crew members .
Of the passengers , 32 were women , 105 were men , 19 were children and four were infants , he said .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced financial aid for the victims Saturday and canceled scheduled events at his residence to mark the end of his first year in office .
The government said families would receive 200,000 rupees , or about $ 4,260 , for each dead passenger and 50,000 rupees , or $ 1,064 , for every injured passenger .
The airline has offered relatives of crash victims in the United Arab Emirates free passage to India , Pathak said , and about 20 people have accepted the offer .
Boeing released a statement saying the company would send a team to provide technical assistance to Indian authorities during their investigation .
The NTSB team is expected to arrive in Mangalore on Tuesday morning and will include a senior air safety investigator , a flight operations specialist , an aircraft systems specialist , and technical advisers for Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration , the NTSB said in a statement .
The city of Mangalore , situated in the state of Karnataka along India 's Western Ghats or hills , had just christened a new terminal .
A week later , it was marred by the crash , India 's worst aviation disaster in a decade .
In 2000 , an Alliance Air jet crashed while trying to land in the northeastern city of Patna , killing about 60 people .
Air India has released the following telephone numbers to learn more information about the crash :
General : +91 2560 3101 +91 2565 6196
In Mangalore : 0824 222 0422
Dubai ( Air India Express ) : 00971 4 2165828/29

Alert : A correction was made to this article .
It incorrectly implied that Kate Lundy was Shadow Communications Minister from 2001 through 2004 .
In fact , Lundy was Shadow Information Technology Minister ( among other roles in Sport and the Arts ) .
Lindsay Tanner was Shadow Communications Minister from 2001 through 2004 .
opinion
In an insightful commentary posted late yesterday , iTnews editor Brett Winterford posed the question of whether Labor backbencher Kate Lundy would make a better Communications Minister than incumbent Stephen Conroy .
The blunt answer to that question is yes .
But it ’s not enough to simply say that Lundy understands the technology portfolio better and leave it at that .
It ’s important to look back at their history since the pair both joined the Senate in 1996 to learn why one has maintained a strong reputation in Australia ’s technology sector while the other is having theirs torn further into shreds every day .
And why , despite this , Lundy is unlikely to win back the portfolio any time soon .
Right from the start of her tenure in the Senate , Lundy has demonstrated a strong commitment to the technology sector .
In the 14 years since 1996 ( as her website proudly states and as is evident from her parliamentary record ) , Lundy has participated in every Senate inquiry relating to telecommunications and information technology that has been held .
As Greens Senator Scott Ludlam has discovered since taking his own Senate chair in late 2008 , the Senate inquiry process — as well as the similar Senate Estimates Committee arena — provides significant scope for Senators to raise important issues and question those in power .
The last 14 years have seen Australia ’s telecommunications industry de-regulated — and revolutionised several times over , firstly with the onset of the internet in the late 1990 ’s , then with the onset of broadband in the 2000 ’s , and in recent times with the growing power of the mobile broadband networks .
And through it all , Lundy has sat in her Senate chair calmly asking questions — in Opposition and in Government .
The senator ’s long - standing engagement in this area gives her a depth of understanding of the current revolutionary change being wrought in Australia ’s telecommunications industry that no other currently serving politician can match , with the potential exception of former Communications Minister Helen Coonan .
This commitment is evident as far back as Lundy ’s maiden speech on 7 May , 1996 , when the neophyte senator stated :
By the year 2000 the information sector will be the world ’s second largest industry .
Those nations that develop the infrastructure necessary for this industry to flourish are the nations that will prosper into the next millennium .
Infrastructure is not just cable and microwave dishes ; it is an education and training system which can increase people ’s skills in developing software and creating useful content .
Already in Australia information and information related activities employ more than 40 per cent of the work force and generate 36 per cent of gross domestic product , and this can only improve .
High quality communications , widespread computer usage and literacy , and a willingness to use modern engineering technologies will be essential ingredients in our economic wellbeing .
However , I am not yet convinced that we have sufficiently analysed and discussed the societal and community effects of this shift in our economic base .
For example , although the need to take this technology to rural Australia is well recognised , have we explored the long - term impact on the economies of country towns ?
The geography of Australia provides special challenges in terms of access to information infrastructure ; challenges that can be met only in a policy framework with priorities of equal access , universal service and that which puts the needs of Australians –both suppliers and consumers–first .
The best way of ensuring this is through public ownership .
These are pretty clear words for a junior senator .
They speak to a long - term interest in the technology portfolio .
How many other politicians , you may well ask , demonstrate an interest in government use of technology in their maiden speech to parliament ?
Precious few .
Lundy ’s commitment to the technology portfolio was recognised just two years after she took office , when she won a junior shadow ministry role assisting the then - shadow minister for industry and technology .
This ascension marked the start of Lundy ’s long spell as one minister opposing long - standing Communications Minister Richard Alston , who held the portfolio from 1996 to 2003 .
In 2001 Lundy was rewarded further , taking over the whole shadow information technology portfolio , although she never held the title of Shadow Communications Minister — Lindsay Tanner held this role from 2001 through 2004 , when Conroy became Shadow Communications Minister .
Alston presided over several important developments in the portfolio , including the deregulation of the telco sector , which has led to dramatically improved competition and outcomes for consumers .
However , he was repeatedly lampooned in the press for his demonstratable lack of understanding of technology , with UK stalwart the Register describing him as “ the world ’s biggest luddite ” .
Like Conroy , Alston also took a stance against rogue content on the internet — stating on one memorable occasion that pornography was one reason behind the take - up of fibre broadband in South Korea .
Those with long memories will recall that Lundy took full advantage of the situation , handing Alston his ass on a daily basis and delivering the press a constant series of juicy headlines about his incompetence .
And Lundy is still delivering results in the portfolio .
For example , in March 2002 she slammed Alston and the Howard government for leaving small to medium enterprises out in the cold when it came to government IT contracts .
In March 2010 — eight years later , it was Lundy ( in cohort with Industry Minister Kim Carr ) who revealed an IT supplier advocate would be appointed to resolve just that problem .
Talk about long - term policy .
For a politician , eight years is eight lifetimes .
Count us amazed and impressed — it appears Lundy never forgets an issue once she gets interested in it .
You can even see Lundy ’s commitment to the technology sector in the people she surrounds herself with .
One of her chief advisors is Pia Waugh — long - time open source advocate and former Volante staffer and power couple with Jeff Waugh , himself a prominent member of the open source community and IT industry luminary .
And Lundy is married to David Forman , director of the Competitive Carrier ’s Coalition , a lobby group which represents … well just about every other telco in Australia apart from Telstra .
Despite what many saw as Lundy ’s long - running success as shadow IT minister , she eventually lost the portfolio in October 2004 .
A comparison with Conroy ’s own parliamentary history may prove illuminating at this stage .
Conroy also ascended to the Senate in 1996 .
Like Lundy , he mentioned technology in his maiden speech on 8 May :
The Labor Party ’s next challenge is to confront the changing structure of Australia ’s work force .
Technological change is forcing the pace as more people work part time and from home .
A new type of poverty is beginning to emerge and its impact will need to be assessed carefully .
We are seeing a growing gap between the information rich and the information poor .
This has many implications for public policy .
How do we ensure that every Australian child has the education including the standard of literacy they need to be able to use the new information technologies ?
How do we ensure that all Australians have access to the information carriers that will revolutionise the way we learn , work and enjoy ourselves ?
More practically , what can we do to make sure Australians have the skills and backup they need to be leaders in developing and providing these new technologies ?
But to my mind there is a subtle difference between their respective approaches .
Both emphasised the fear of unequal access .
But Lundy went further — discussing the potential for the technology sector to promote positive economic change .
Unlike Lundy , Conroy appears to have sought out more powerful and broader parliamentary roles .
He was immediately appointed deputy opposition whip in the Senate after he ascended to the Senate alongside Lundy in 1996 and then had a succession of shadow ministries in finance , small business and corporate governance until he won the shadow communications portfolio in late 2004 .
It was only at this point — some six years after Lundy — that he joined the Senate committee on Environment , Communications , IT and the Arts .
Lundy has been controversial at points and has not been shy of grabbing headlines — especially in her tenure opposing Alston .
And she is happy to attack the Opposition when she feels it is appropriate .
But generally she does not go on the attack within her own party — even going to public lengths to emphasise her commitment to working within partly lines on the mandatory internet filter policy , which she opposes but will vote for when its associated legislation lands in parliament ( she will not cross the floor ) .
Her approach could be broadly characterised as consultative rather than confrontational — she has rarely used her Senate position to go heavily on the attack in parliament , appearing to prefer a behind the scenes approach .
She is believed to be part of Labor ’s ‘ socialist left ’ faction — which Wikipedia describes as championing socially liberal values such as women ’s rights and Aboriginal reconciliation .
In comparison , Conroy ( a member of the Labor right ) has earned himself a reputation even within his own party for his confrontational approach .
His 2006 attack on fellow Laborite Simon Crean ’s run for a pre-selection seat in Hotham — which led to Crean ’s repeated calls for Conroy ’s resignation as deputy leader of the opposition in the Senate — is a good example of this .
Conroy also had a differing level of success in Opposition to Lundy .
I was a full - time telecommunications reporter through much of Conroy ’s tenure in opposition — for two years from the start of 2006 until mid-2008 .
And I can testify that Conroy was broadly ineffectual in the portfolio at opposing then - Communications Minister Helen Coonan , as I chronicled in this article from March 2006 — a year and a half into Conroy ’s ascension to the portfolio .
Not quite as ineffectual as Tony Smith has been in opposing Conroy .
But that ’s another story .
There was one great exception to Conroy ’s poor performance .
And this was the National Broadband Network .
In early 2007 , Conroy persuaded then - leader of the Opposition Kevin Rudd and shadow finance minister Lindsay Tanner of the ‘ nation - building ’ virtue of a significant new communications policy to defeat what was at that time seen as a great problem in the Australian technology sector — the issue of broadband blackspots .
The policy — drawn up quickly and with few details — was a blatant populist pitch to deliver fibre broadband to an Australian public whose interest in the idea had been piqued by a similar project proposed by then - Telstra chief executive Sol Trujillo and thrown out by John Howard ’s government .
And there is no doubt it was one big plank in Kevin Rudd ’s successful pitch to win government in 2007 .
As Brett mentions in his iTnews commentary , Conroy has suffered a spectacular fall from grace in the eyes of the Australian public since the November 2007 election .
The primary reason is the public distaste for the mandatory internet filter policy , but he also continues to mis-speak , conduct sustained attacks on technology industry stalwarts such as Google and potentially prejudice legal trials such as iiNet ’s defence against the Australian Federation Against Copyright
Theft .
Perhaps most importantly , he appears to lack a fundamental grasp of much of the technology which he is charged with regulating .
But it is delivering the National Broadband Network policy which Rudd no doubt sees as his chief responsibility .
And I do n’t expect him to lose his position as Communications Minister any time soon , because of this reason .
To Rudd , Conroy is likely “ NBN guy ” .
And “ NBN guy ” he will stay through thick and thin , no matter how much the public rages against him because of the internet filter policy .
This single fact does much to illustrate Kate Lundy ’s plight .
Yes , she understands technology itself , as well as policy in the area and the industry much better than Conroy ever will .
And her personal style makes it much more likely she will drive outcomes that will please more in the sector .
However , Lundy was not able to muster the political capital to get a massive , multi-billion - dollar policy like the NBN through cabinet .
In relation to technology policy , Conroy has failed on almost every other front but the NBN .
But the NBN is a king - hit , winner takes all prize that will define his career .
To take it away from him , Lundy will need to play a much harder , faster and tougher style of politics or continue to be marginalised within Labor .
You can see this harder style of politics being played by other politicians in the portfolio .
Conroy plays it .
Ludlam — who bent Conroy over a barrel and forced him to cough up the NBN Implementation Study — is playing it .
Nick Minchin played it very well .
And even Malcolm Turnbull has flirted with it from a distance .
But so far Lundy has not demonstrated the stomache for it .
In politics , you do n’t earn a position of power .
You seize it .

AS INVESTIGATIONS are now revealing , there were laws that should have prevented the BP oil blowout , but the oil companies kept getting waivers from the Minerals Management Service , which was thoroughly tamed by the petroleum industry and its political allies in Washington .
The government ’s supervision of the oil drilling industry was particularly corrupted under the direction of Vice President Dick Cheney , the former chief executive of Halliburton who ran the Bush administration ’s energy task force .
But restoring vigilant supervision evidently was not a priority for the Obama administration either .
The same hijacking of the regulatory apparatus occurred on the financial front .
Ample laws could have prevented the speculative collapse if they had been enforced , including requiring banks to use sound underwriting standards , preventing credit rating agencies from bestowing triple - A ratings on junk , or keeping derivatives in check .
The regulatory defaults spanned the Clinton and Bush administrations .
At issue are two interconnected failures of the economy and politics : what economists call market failure , and what political scientists call regulatory capture — and their cause and cure .
The financial and oil blowouts were spectacular cases of markets failing to price risks correctly .
While market fundamentalists still insist that all markets eventually correct their own errors , fewer economists maintain that view in the face of recent events .
Oil companies pursuing short - term gains did not invest enough in safety precautions , and their shareholders did n’t care .
Only government could compel action — but it failed to act .
Financial markets priced risky securities disastrously wrong .
How could mortgages — whose distinguishing feature was that they were unlikely to be paid back — possibly have been converted into investment - grade securities ?
There is a revealing expression in the world of hedge funds that you wo n’t find in most economics textbooks — “ IBGYBG , ’’ or “ I ’ll be gone , you ’ll be gone . ’’
Translation : by the time the dumb money finds out that it has been sucker - punched , we ’ll both have made our fortunes and we ’ll be out of here .
The ordinary forces of supply and demand that accurately price tomatoes can’t fix market myopia when it comes to pricing complex financial securities or risks of a drilling rig explosion .
But to say that market failures require government regulation is only the beginning of the story — because regulation requires competent and honest regulators .
And if private business invests serious money in the corruption of regulation , then a market incentive trumps government ’s capacity to correct the market ’s mistakes .
So who keeps the regulators honest ?
The answer takes us back to politics .
More than half a century ago , the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith coined an important concept — “ countervailing power . ’’
Big business , Galbraith observed , had immense economic influence .
But countervailing forces such as the trade union movement or activist citizens groups could neutralize that economic power by harnessing government to keep business ’s less savory tendencies from overpowering its benign ones .
But that was then .
Despite a seemingly formidable environmentalist movement , the oil industry overwhelmed its regulators .
Americans for Financial Reform , the coalition of consumer groups pushing for better banking regulation , is outspent by Wall Street lobbyists by at least 100 to one .
There has been a lot of commentary lately contending that we have a tendency to underestimate risk .
Truly catastrophic events occur only rarely — they are “ black swans . ’’
In the meantime , a lot of money can be made by betting that disaster wo n’t occur , or that it will occur on somebody else ’s watch .
But who , in this account , is “ we ’ ’ ?
In fact , plenty of voices in the wilderness were warning against the risk of a catastrophic oil blowout , or a financial one .
These critics did not lack prescience or insight .
What they lacked was political power .
It ’s true that technologies , both financial and oleaginous , are becoming ever more complex ; and this does create new kinds of risk .
But the cure is less technical than political .
Citizens need to act more vigorously to restore Galbraith ’s countervailing power .
Otherwise , private business acting in its short run self interest will ruin us twice — once when private markets pay no heed to the risks they are imposing , and a second time when they corrupt our regulatory institutions .

Gulf states ’ economies devastated by BP spill
By Kristina Betinis
21 June 2010
The oil eruption in the Gulf of Mexico — the worst environmental disaster in US history — is devastating local economies .
Tens of thousands of fishermen , tourist - industry and oil workers are directly affected .
The indirect ramifications are incalculable .
The Gulf Coast region is already one of the poorest parts of the country .
Alabama includes counties with unemployment rates as high as 24 percent , and Mississippi has the sixth highest official unemployment rate in the country , at 11.4 percent .
The gulf states of Texas and Louisiana , with their oil and gas intensive economies , have the greatest income inequality in the United States behind the state of New York .
On June 16 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) increased the no-fishing zone in the Gulf to 80,806 square miles , about 33.4 percent of federal Gulf waters .
Affected areas stretch from Louisiana ’s Atchafalaya Bay in the west through Mississippi and Alabama , to the coastal areas by Panama City on the Florida panhandle in the east .
Broad swaths of Gulf southward are also closed .
A minority of the fishermen seeing their livelihoods destroyed have been hired by BP or contractors to help with the clean - up efforts , but many say they have not been paid since May , according to Courthouse News .
Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser remarked , “ It ’s a Catch - 22 … .
If you can't fish and then you take a $ 5,000 monthly payment from BP , you cannot get food stamps because your income is too much , but then the $ 5,000 is really only half what you need . ”
While energy represents the largest economic sector , fishing alone accounts for a multi-billion dollar segment of the regional economy ( See “ The social and economic impact of the Gulf oil spill ” ) .
In addition to shrimping and fishing , tens of thousands of acres of oyster beds are contaminated in Louisiana , forcing oyster shucking and distribution operations to shut down .
Job losses are difficult to estimate .
The Lafayette , Louisiana , Advertiser reports that the closure of one major oyster company , Pearl Reef , means permanent job loss for at least 100 workers .
Another shucker , P&J Oyster , is the oldest in the US .
It has closed and will lay off around 25 workers .
These job losses are expected to be permanent because the prospect for a revival of the oyster industry is poor .
Existing beds are covered with tarballs , which are dredged up along with the oysters at harvest , rendering the oysters unmarketable .
There is not currently any method for removing the tar from the beds .
For many bays in the area , contaminated soil will not support oyster beds for at least 10 years .
According to NOAA , just over 65 percent of the nation ’s oysters come from the Gulf region .
The loss of jobs related to tourism is also difficult to estimate , since many boat captains and marine guides and instructors of various types are self - employed .
David Butler , director of the Call Center Research Laboratory at University of Southern Mississippi , told Hattiesburg television station WHLT that the oil spill is a “ rolling disaster , ” estimating a revenue loss of $ 120 million this summer for that state ’s tourism sector alone .
Earlier in June , University of Central Florida economist Sean Snaith provided an analysis to the Orlando Sentinel , predicting that Florida will lose around 195,000 tourism - related jobs , or half of the sector , if oil from the spill hits the beaches , as has now happened .
Florida hotels have been receiving cancellations for weeks .
Oil drifting in at Okaloosa Island near Destin , Florida , closed the beaches and fishing piers on June 18 .
Credit rating agency Moody ’s forecasts significant losses in GDP , home values , and jobs for the entire region , extending into 2012 .
Employment prospects are very poor for many workers in the region who have little or no formal education , especially those of middle age .
Effects are beginning to be felt far beyond industries immediately impacted .
Grocery stores in the region are reporting 10 to 25 percent drops in sales .
Midwestern grain exporters have expressed concern about incurring cleaning costs , slow lanes and declining revenues if the oil slows Mississippi River traffic on its way to deliver grain overseas .
Oil and gas , fishing , shipping and tourism are the largest sectors of the Gulf Coast region ’s economy , worth about $ 234 billion , two thirds of which is attributed to the US and one third to Mexico , according to a CNN report from May 30 .
Oil and gas production makes up over half of that value .
Seventeen percent of jobs in Louisiana , the state currently hardest hit by the disaster , are oil and gas related .
An Obama administration moratorium on new offshore drilling has been in place since April , which has been the focus of a good deal of political posturing .
Thirty - three oil rigs are currently idled , while most oil rigs , including deep sea drilling rigs , continue to operate .
Estimates on the number of oil - related jobs affected vary widely and have become the subject of posturing , as the oil industry and opponents of the moratorium seek to exploit the plight of laid off workers to press for a full resumption of all drilling .
The Obama administration is working on quickly restoring all oil drilling projects on the grounds that this is necessary to restore lost jobs and can be done safely .
No one , least of all Obama , has suggested what is a necessary step in addressing both the ecological disaster and the economic disaster : a massive public works clean - up and restoration program to provide quality jobs to hundreds of thousands of workers .
On Monday business strategist Ben Brown was in a meeting in a downtown Los Angeles office building when he heard a commotion outside the window .
When he looked down , he saw the alleyway had been closed off to shoot an exterior scene for a movie – a common enough sight in L.A .
But this movie was more than meets the eye .
" I immediately recognized it , " says Brown .
" ' Oh my God , it 's Transformers ! ' "
It turned out Brown was witnessing one of the first days of filming for Transformers 3 .
A fan of the toy - inspired robot franchise , he whipped out his iPhone and captured about 3 minutes of video showing a film crew standing around , followed by three pretty awesome seconds of a hydraulic lift flinging a car 100 feet down the alley .
Brown says he posted the video to YouTube , where it was soon accumulating 1,000 views an hour after being spotted by entertainment sites .
Unfortunately , it was also apparently spotted by Paramount Pictures , the production company behind Transformers .
Brown says Paramount promptly issued a take down notice to the Google - owned YouTube , which unceremoniously yanked the video and warned Brown that repeated copyright violations would get him banned .
" I 'm not a copyright expert , " says Brown .
" But I know that I was n't violating anyone 's copyright . "
Dubious DMCA notices are the dog bites man story of the internet .
But this might be the first case of a movie studio accusing someone of piracy for filming the people filming a movie – on public streets , no less .
Brown has filed a DMCA counter - notice , but YouTube told him it'll take up to two weeks to restore the video unless Paramount retracts its copyright claim .
Paramount 's parent company , Viacom , is currently suing Google for allegedly allowing copyright infringement on YouTube .
It not likely anyone mistook the cellphone footage as actual movie clip , so it seems possible that someone at Paramount saw " Transformers " in the YouTube title and fired off the notice without watching the video .
That would be sad , since issuing bogus DMCA notices can sometimes be civilly actionable .
Plus it would mean they missed some excellent car - flinging .
A second video shot by one of Brown 's coworkers is still on YouTube , and at the top of this post .
There was no answer at Paramount 's press office late Friday afternoon .
* Public , private sector unions to strike May 20
* Unions threaten to step up protests
* Say resolved to block “ disaster ” austerity recipes
( Updates with new strike date , details )
ATHENS , May 12 ( Reuters ) - Greek workers on Wednesday called a 24 - hour general strike for May 20 , the latest in a series of protests against planned pension cuts linked to an international 110 - billion - euro ( $ 139.7 billion ) bailout for Greece .
Public and private sector unions had initially called a strike for May 19 , but decided later on Wednesday to move the walkout a day later , saying they did not want to hinder national university entry tests on the same day .
Unionists have vowed to stop the pension reform , a key condition in a financial rescue plan for Greece agreed last week with the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The country ’s socialist government unveiled a draft law on Monday that raises the average retirement age and pares back benefits to plug the pension system ’s ballooning deficits .
“ The IMF will not stop thirsting for workers ’ blood , ” said Yannis Panagopoulos , chairman of Greece ’s main private sector labour union GSEE .
“ Its recipes are a disaster and the government must turn them down . ”
The walkout is expected to ground flights to and from Greece , disrupt transport and shut down ministries and public services across the country .
The unions will convene after the strike to decide on future action .
Greek workers last went on strike on May 5 , when protesters threw petrol bombs at a bank in Athens , killing three employees , in the worst violence the country saw since riots in 2008 .
Civil servants and public sector employees , who have vowed to step up protests , will march to parliament late on Wednesday to protest against austerity .
Greece submitted this week a formal request for the first tranche of the EU / IMF multi-billion euro aid , seeking money to refinance an 8.5 - billion - euro bond maturing on May 19 .

The elusive founder of WikiLeaks , who is at the centre of a potential US national security sensation , has surfaced from almost a month in hiding to tell he does not fear for his safety but is on permanent alert .
Julian Assange , a renowned Australian hacker who founded the electronic whistleblowers ' platform WikiLeaks , vanished when a young US intelligence analyst in Baghdad was arrested .
Australian - born Julian Assange
The analyst , Bradley Manning , had bragged he had sent 260,000 incendiary US state department cables on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to WikiLeaks .
The prospect of the cache of classified intelligence on the US conduct of the two wars being put online is a nightmare for Washington .
The sensitivity of the information has generated media reports that Assange is the target of a US manhunt .

By John S. Saul
May 2010 – At Issue Ezine – Many of us came to southern Africa from the starting point of support for the peoples there who were struggling , in the '60s , '70s and ' 80s , against the white minority / colonial regimes that dominated them and shaped so negatively their life chances .
However , some in the worldwide liberation support / anti-apartheid movement also came to understand that defining liberation only in terms of national liberation from white colonial dominance told , at best , half the story .
For , important as it was to overcome apartheid and similar racist structures in southern Africa , seeing people liberate themselves from class and corporate oppression , from structures of male domination and from authoritarian political practices could readily be seen to be at least as important to any true liberation as was national self - assertion .
Now , several decades or more after the fall of the most visible forms of colonial and racial domination , it is ever more apparent just how accurate that critical insight was .
For what we have seen , various commentators have argued , is the virtual recolonisation of southern Africa by capital .
This is something new , for it is at present much less easy to disaggregate this " capital " than previously into national capitals and see it as being primarily the instrument of various nationally based imperialisms and their several colonialisms .
No , coming from the global North and West ( as it has done historically ) but also now from the East ( Japan , China and India ) , it is an " Empire of Capital " that is currently recolonising Africa .
Of course , this has been complicated by the still independent role that national states per se ( of both the North and the East ) , with their diverse raisons d’etat , also play in the imperial equation .
Moreover , it is the case that such a " recolonisation " has been accomplished with the overt connivance of indigenous leaders / elites – those who have inherited power with the demise of " white rule " but who , in doing so , have manifested much greater commitment to the interests of their own privileged class - in- creation than to those of the mass of their own people .
In short , it is not a happy world for the vast mass of ordinary southern African citizens – despite the freedom that they had seemed once to have won .
What we have seen is the virtual recolonization of southern Africa by capital ...
It is not a happy world for the vast mass of ordinary southern African citizens .
So what do we now celebrate in 2010 , precisely fifty years after the launching , in 1960 , of the " thirty years war ( 1960 - 1990 ) for southern African liberation " , thirty - five years after the year of Angola ’s and Mozambique ’s independence , more or less thirty years after the day of independence in Zimbabwe , and a full twenty years after both Namibia ’s inaugural day and the release from prison of Nelson Mandela that marked so clearly the first of the very last days of apartheid ( days of transition that would culminate in Mandela ’s election as president in 1994 ) ?
For it is a sad fact that one feels forced to ask the question , as I have recently done , as to just who actually won the struggle for southern African liberation .
As I continued :
We know who lost , of course : the white minorities in positions of formal political power ( whether colonially in the Portuguese colonies or quasi- independently in South Africa and perhaps in Rhodesia / Zimbabwe ) .
And thank fortune , and hard and brave work , for that .
But who , in contrast , has won , at least for the time being : global capitalism , the West and the IFIs , and local elites of state and private sectors , both white and black ?
But how about the mass of southern African populations , both urban and rural and largely black ?
Not so obviously the winners , I would suggest , and certainly not in any very expansive sense .
Has it not been a kind of defeat for them too ? [ 1 ]
How much of a defeat ?
Some facts for South Africa may provide an indication of such a reality , one that has also scarred each of the five countries of the region that once became key sites of overt liberation struggle : Mozambique , Angola , Zimbabwe , Namibia and South Africa .
Indeed , the several country case studies that comprise the body of this edition of AfricaFiles '
Ezine will , cumulatively , give a very clear sense of this reality .
Merely note here that in South Africa , for example , the economic gap between black and white has indeed narrowed statistically – framed by the fact that some blacks have indeed got very much richer ( from their own upward mobility as junior partners to recolonisation and from the fresh spoils of victory that this has offered them ) .
Yet the gap between rich and poor is actually wider than ever it was – and it is growing .
The gap between rich and poor is actually wider than it ever was – and it is growing ...
" People do not eat human rights ; they want food on the table . "
Much valuable research ( by the likes of Terreblanche , McDonald and Nattrass and Seekings , as cited in the selected bibliography ) documents this harsh fact – and other similarly sobering facts – and its stark implications .
But note also the intervention several months ago by a leading South African prelate , Rev. Fuleni Mzukisi , who charged that poverty in South Africa is now worse than apartheid and , in fact , " a terrible disease " .
As he said , " Apartheid was a deep crime against humanity .
It left people with deep scars , but I can assure you that poverty is worse than that ...
People do not eat human rights ; they want food on the table . " [ 2 ]
This outcome is the result , most generally , of the grim overall inequalities between the global North and the global South that , as in many other regions , mark southern Africa .
But , more specifically , it also reflects the choice of economic strategies in this latter region that can now imagine only elite enrichment and the presumed " trickle down benefits " of unchecked capitalism as being the way in which the lot of the poorest of the poor might be improved there .
How far a cry this is from the populist , even socialist , hopes for more effective and egalitarian outcomes that originally seemed to define the development dreams of all the liberation movements .
Indeed , what is especially disconcerting about the present recolonisation of the region under the flag of capitalism is that it has been driven by precisely the same movements ( at least in name ) that led their countries to independence in the long years of overt regional struggle .
But just why this should have occurred , how inevitable it was , is something we must consider in the essays that follow .
To be sure , the record varies somewhat from country to country .
Thus , Mozambique under Frelimo [ Frente de Libertação de Moçambique , Liberation Front of Mozambique ] , once the most forthrightly socialist of all the region ’s countries , has had to abandon that claim .
True , it has also abandoned its initial brand of developmental dictatorship in favour of a formal democratisation that has stabilised the country – albeit without markedly empowering the mass of its people or improving their socioeconomic lot .
Indeed , a recent text book by Bauer and Taylor on southern Africa ( a book of sympathetic though not notably radical predisposition ) notes that the election to the presidency of Armando Guebuza who is the " holder of an expansive business empire and one of the richest men in Mozambique hardly signals that Frelimo will attempt to run anything but a globalist , neo-liberal agenda – regardless of the abject poverty suffered by most of the electorate . "
What is especially disconcerting about the present recolonization of the region ... is that it has been driven by precisely the same movements that led their countries to independence .
As for Angola it has , until quite recently , experienced a much greater and more dramatic degree of divisive fragmentation than Mozambique – although its antidote to that , since the death of Savimbi , has had as little to do with popular empowerment and broad - based development as have the present policies of its fellow ex-Portuguese colony , Mozambique .
In fact , it has been argued that it is only a handful of progressive international initiatives ( Human Rights Watch , Global Witness and the like ) that have had some success in holding the feet of exploitative corporations and of Angola ’s own government to the fire of critical scrutiny .
For unfortunately , as David Sogge will argue in his article on Angola in the present collection , the country ’s own population , battle scarred and battle weary , has been rather slower to find effective means to exert their own claims .
Yet , as the same Bauer and Taylor volume quoted above feels forced conclude of Angola , oil money and corruption have merely " exacerbated the already glaring discrepancies between rich and poor " and have " quite simply , threatened the country ’s recovery and future development " .
Meanwhile Zimbabwe , in the brutal thrall of Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front ( ZANU - PF ) , has witnessed an even greater deterioration of national circumstances than either of these two countries .
There , say Bauer and Taylor , " the ZANU - PF ’s stewardship of the economy [ has ] been an unmitigated disaster " while its politics , through years of overt and enormously costly dictatorial practices , have produced a situation , as Richard Saunders will detail in his own essay here , that is proving enormously difficult both to displace and to move beyond .
The results in both Namibia and South Africa , even if not quite so bloody as those produced by Renamo ’s war , the prolonged sparring of Savimbi with the MPLA [ Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ] and Mugabe ’s depredations , are not much more inspiring in terms of effective mass enfranchisement and broad - gauged human betterment – as we will see in the articles by Henning Melber and William Gumede included in this issue of the Ezine .
Thus , a long - time and firmly loyal ANC cadre ( Ben Turok ) has himself , in a recent book entitled The Evolution of ANC Economic Policy , acknowledged both the contribution of ANC policies to growing inequality in his country while reaching " the irresistible conclusion that the ANC government has lost a great deal of its earlier focus on the fundamental transformation of the inherited social system " !
In sum , South Africa , like the other " liberated " locales of the region , has become , in the sober phrase with which Neville Alexander has titled a book of his own on South Africa ’s " transition from apartheid to democracy " , merely " an ordinary country " – despite the rather finer future that many , both in southern Africa and beyond , had hoped would prove to be the outcome of the long years of liberation struggle themselves .
But Alexander ’s characterisation could be said to apply to all of the countries in the region : what we now have , instead of a liberated southern Africa that is vibrant , humane and just , is a region of a very different sort indeed .
Moreover , not only is there deepening inequality within countries but , in the region taken as a whole , there is also – to take one glaring example – a situation in which South Africa ’s capitalist economic power now merely complements global capitalist power in holding the impoverished people of southern Africa in quasi- colonial thrall ( as the six - part series of Africafiles ' Ezine on South Africa in the southern Africa region recently documented [ 3 ] ) – while doing disturbingly little to better the lot of such people , the vast majority both in South Africa and elsewhere .
Or take the Southern African Development Community : it has become ( albeit with a few honourable exceptions ) primarily a Club of Presidents that reveal itself to be – as the sad case of its kid-gloves treatment of Zimbabwe and its backing of an otherwise deservedly embattled Mugabe amply demonstrates – to be more a source of tacit support for the status quo than a force for facilitating any kind of just transition to effective democracy in Zimbabwe .
What we now have , instead of a liberated southern Africa that is vibrant , humane and just , is a region of a very different sort indeed ...
The current global situation offers no real alternatives , no real hope .
In truth , it is now often said by people of left persuasion that the current global situation offers no real alternatives , no real hope , for Africa ( including southern Africa ) .
It cannot , they say , count on any plausible socialist alternative ( see Gabriel Kolko ’s deeply unsettling After Socialism ) .
Moreover , a seasoned observer like Giovanni Arrighi can only urge Africa to look to a relatively benign China ( a doubtful haven of hope , one fears ) and / or to the kinder and gentler practices of its own elites in order to realise even a marginal adjustment to its desperate plight .
Others fall back on the equally unlikely prospect of a revolutionary transformation of the exploitative
West to then lift many of the key barriers towards a brighter future .
Thus , as one friend has recently written to me : " I do n’t see how the South can ever liberate itself in the absence of a new socialist project becoming powerful in the North . "
Yet he feels forced to add that " I do n’t see that happening until people are hurting and see no prospect of meeting their personal needs under globalized neoliberalism , and until a new left movement with a serious attitude to organization and democracy . "
But this is a faint hope too , my correspondent – who confesses to feeling " very pessimistic " – obviously fears .
Failing a revolution in the global capitalist centres , however , what are the actual prospects for some dramatic change occurring within the region itself , one , necessarily , driven from below ?
The present author has called elsewhere for " a next liberation struggle " in southern Africa for precisely this reason , a struggle , like the one that is currently afoot in several places in Latin America for example , that seeks to at least neutralise the intervention of imperialist forces from the North while also facilitating the empowerment of its own people in political and economic terms .
And there are – as will be surveyed on a country by country basis in the articles that follow – localised and grassroots resistances in the region in a wide variety of settings and on a broad range of policy fronts that seek to make headway and even to begin to add up to potential hegemonic alternatives to the failed liberation movements that we still see in power .
Moreover , some attempts to so resist – the initial rise of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) in opposition to Mugabe for example , and the removal of the brazen Thabo Mbeki from South Africa ’s presidency before the end of his term ; the dramatic grassroots resistance , especially in South Africa , to the AIDS pandemic that stalks the entire region ; and the signs of a resurgent economic nationalism that threatens to renegotiate contracts with the private sector and even to reverse certain privatisations – do begin to so promise : promise , that is , to " add up " , even if to this point , " not quite " and certainly " not yet " !
There are ... grassroots resistances in the region ... that seek to make headway and even to begin to add up to potential hegemonic alternatives to the failed liberation movements that we still see in power .
So the question remains : how might one hope , even expect , that the diverse instances of resistance that are visible could come to pose hegemonic alternatives in southern Africa to the recolonisation that has been the fate of that part of the continent in the wake of its seeming " liberation " ?
What might Africans on the ground in the region have to do next , and how can they best be supported from outside in doing so ?
Equally importantly , how might residents of the global North organise themselves in order – with respect to any " next liberation support struggle " – to best assist them : staying the hand of our own governments and corporations on the one hand and speaking out clearly and effectively on behalf of such movements for genuine liberation on the ground on the other ?
One thing is clear : the liberation struggle continues .
We can not live in the ( recent ) past .
We must act to shape the future .

In a report published in Science , a team of oceanographers , including MBL ( Marine Biological Laboratory ) Ecosystems Center director Hugh Ducklow , outline a polar ocean observation strategy they say will revolutionize scientists ' understanding of marine ecosystem response to climate change .
The approach , which calls for the use of a suite of automated technologies that complement traditional data collection , could serve as a model for marine ecosystems worldwide and help form the foundation for a comprehensive polar ocean observation system .
The complexity of marine food webs and the " chronic under - sampling " of the world 's oceans present major constraints to predicting the future of and optimally managing and protecting marine resources .
" We know more about Venus than we do about the Earth 's oceans , " says Ducklow .
" We need an ocean observation system analogous to meteorological monitoring for weather forecasting , but it 's harder to do in the ocean . "
In polar oceans in particular , including the Western Antarctic Peninsula ( WAP ) where Ducklow and his colleagues conduct research as part of the NSF 's Long - Term Ecological Research project at Palmer Station , high operation costs and harsh conditions restrict the coverage provided by research ships , where much of the data on this ecosystem is collected .
To overcome these hurdles , oceanographers around the world have been developing technologies to complement traditional data collection by research ships .
The coordinated use of these technologies will enable sustained observations throughout the year in the polar oceans and could form the foundation for a comprehensive observation strategy the team says .
In their report the scientists , led by Oscar Schofield of Rutgers University , describe a multi-platform approach to ocean observation , where data is collected by a host of automated sources including glider robots that measure ocean characteristics continuously for weeks at a time and tourist vessels , ferries , and other " ships of opportunity " outfitted with chemical and biological sensors .
The authors also encourage the deployment of oceanographic instruments on animals such as elephant seals and penguins to provide information on animal behavior and oceanographic conditions .
Recent tagging of Adélie penguins nesting near Palmer Station has helped scientists understand the link between nutrient upwelling and penguin foraging .
" We 're looking for ways to use our existing capabilities to obtain data , " says Ducklow .
" Our goal is to make things cheaper and get a lot of them out there .
This will help to narrow down uncertainty about the effects of warming on the polar oceans in the coming decades to century . "
The team says the WAP is an ideal location for monitoring the impacts of rapid climate change on marine ecosystems and could serve as a model observation system for marine ecosystems worldwide .
The rapid climate change in this region is driving large - scale changes in the food web , impacting everything from phytoplankton -- the foundation of the food web -- to Antarctic krill , to apex predators such as penguins , whales , and seals .
" The comprehensive deployment of these observational systems will revolutionize our understanding of how marine ecosystems are responding to climate change everywhere , not just in Antarctica , " says Ducklow .
" With current observation methods , the data you collect , whether it 's from land or from a research vessel , is limited to access by people .
Where we are only getting dozens of measurements a year from data collected by people , you could get hundreds or thousands each day with the use of automated technologies . "
This paper stems from work done as part of the National Science Foundation Office of Polar Program 's Long - Term Ecological Research ( LTER ) project at Palmer Station , Antarctica .

FROM CHAIN -EMAILS TO BECK TO CONGRESS ….
About a year ago , a right - wing chain - email started making the rounds , about an alleged nefarious scheme .
As the story went , President Obama loaned $ 2 billion to a Brazilian oil company to drill for oil in Brazilian waters , to benefit China .
Worse , the tale continued , George Soros was involved in some way , as an investor in the project .
The whole thing was debunked last year by , among others , FactCheck.org .
In reality , it seems the Brazilian oil company , PetroBras , received a loan from the independent Export - Import Bank , approved by appointees of the Bush / Cheney administration .
Soros is part of the project , but his investment came in 2008 — months before the Export - Import Bank agreed to make the loan .
The Export - Import Bank agreed to the loan , by the way , in large part because PetroBras will use U.S. - made oilfield equipment and services on the project .
With this reality in mind , here was Glenn Beck ’s message to his misguided audience on Monday :
“ Then Obama suspends the deepwater drilling at 1,500 meters .
He says , ‘ He-ey , that ’s dangerous .
1,500 meters , that ’s crazy ! ’
PetroBras is drilling at 2,777 meters .
Obama knows it and loans $ 2 billion to ?
PetroBras .
Last stop ?
PetroBras shareholders get rich .
Oh my gosh , we ’re back at the beginning !
Shareholder , PetroBras , getting rich .
You getting screwed . ”
Beck added that the loan came “ just days ” after Soros strengthened his investment .
None of this is true .
The deranged media personality is just recycling nonsense from an old chain - email .
And yet , here ’s Rep. Dan Burton ( R - Ind . ) the day after Beck ’s program :
“ The thing that really is funny about this is we just sent $ 2 billion to Brazil so they could do offshore drilling … .
We ’ve got the energy here in the United States to solve these problems .
We do n’t need to be sending Mr. Soros money in Brazil so he can make more money by doing offshore drilling with our taxpayers ’ money . ”
The problem here is not just that a House Republican is confused — that ’s a daily occurrence — but that GOP lawmakers believe they ’re getting actual , reliable information from Glenn Beck ’s program .
It ’s one thing to tolerate madness for entertainment ’s sake .
It ’s even understandable for Republicans to cheer Beck on to keep the party base riled up .
But actual members of Congress should know better than to rely on the self - described rodeo clown as a source of legitimate news , worthy of officials ’ interest .
eso1024 — Science Release
Exoplanet Caught on the Move
For the first time , astronomers have been able to directly follow the motion of an exoplanet as it moves from one side of its host star to the other .
The planet has the smallest orbit so far of all directly imaged exoplanets , lying almost as close to its parent star as Saturn is to the Sun .
Scientists believe that it may have formed in a similar way to the giant planets in the Solar System .
Because the star is so young , this discovery proves that gas giant planets can form within discs in only a few million years , a short time in cosmic terms .
Only 12 million years old , or less than three - thousandths of the age of the Sun , Beta Pictoris is 75 % more massive than our parent star .
It is located about 60 light - years away towards the constellation of Pictor ( the Painter ) and is one of the best - known examples of a star surrounded by a dusty debris disc [ 1 ] .
Earlier observations showed a warp of the disc , a secondary inclined disc and comets falling onto the star .
“ Those were indirect , but tell - tale signs that strongly suggested the presence of a massive planet , and our new observations now definitively prove this , ” says team leader Anne- Marie Lagrange .
“ Because the star is so young , our results prove that giant planets can form in discs in time - spans as short as a few million years . ”
Recent observations have shown that discs around young stars disperse within a few million years , and that giant planet formation must occur faster than previously thought .
Beta Pictoris is now clear proof that this is indeed possible .
The team used the NAOS - CONICA instrument ( or NACO [ 2 ] ) , mounted on one of the 8.2 - metre Unit Telescopes of ESO 's Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) , to study the immediate surroundings of Beta Pictoris in 2003 , 2008 and 2009 .
In 2003 a faint source inside the disc was seen ( eso0842 ) , but it was not possible to exclude the remote possibility that it was a background star .
In new images taken in 2008 and spring 2009 the source had disappeared !
The most recent observations , taken during autumn 2009 , revealed the object on the other side of the disc after a period of hiding either behind or in front of the star ( in which case it is hidden in the glare of the star ) .
This confirmed that the source indeed was an exoplanet and that it was orbiting its host star .
It also provided insights into the size of its orbit around the star .
Images are available for approximately ten exoplanets , and the planet around Beta Pictoris ( designated “ Beta Pictoris b ” ) has the smallest orbit known so far .
It is located at a distance between 8 and 15 times the Earth - Sun separation — or 8 - 15 Astronomical Units — which is about the distance of Saturn from the Sun .
“ The short period of the planet will allow us to record the full orbit within maybe 15 - 20 years , and further studies of Beta Pictoris b will provide invaluable insights into the physics and chemistry of a young giant planet ’s atmosphere , ” says student researcher Mickael Bonnefoy .
The planet has a mass of about nine Jupiter masses and the right mass and location to explain the observed warp in the inner parts of the disc .
This discovery therefore bears some similarity to the prediction of the existence of Neptune by astronomers Adams and Le Verrier in the 19th century , based on observations of the orbit of Uranus .
“ Together with the planets found around the young , massive stars Fomalhaut and HR8799 , the existence of Beta Pictoris b suggests that super - Jupiters could be frequent byproducts of planet formation around more massive stars , ” explains Gael Chauvin , a member of the team .
Such planets disturb the discs around their stars , creating structures that should be readily observable with the Atacama Large Millimeter / submillimeter Array ( ALMA ) , the revolutionary telescope being built by ESO together with international partners .
A few other planetary candidates have been imaged , but they are all located further from their host star than Beta Pictoris b.
If located in the Solar System , they all would lie close to or beyond the orbit of the furthest planet , Neptune .
The formation processes of these distant planets are likely to be quite different from those in our Solar System and in Beta Pictoris .
“ The recent direct images of exoplanets — many made by the VLT — illustrate the diversity of planetary systems , ” says Lagrange .
“ Among those , Beta Pictoris b is the most promising case of a planet that could have formed in the same way as the giant planets in our Solar System . ”
Notes
[ 1 ] Debris discs are composed of dust resulting from collisions among larger bodies such as planetary embryos or asteroids .
They are larger versions of the zodiacal dust band in our Solar System .
The disc around Beta Pictoris was the first to be imaged and is now known to extend up to about 1000 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun .
[ 2 ] NACO is an adaptive optics instrument attached to ESO ’s Very Large Telescope , located in Chile .
Thanks to adaptive optics , astronomers can remove most of the blurring effect of the atmosphere and obtain very sharp images .

Freethought Kampala ’s motto is Promoting Reason In A Superstitious Society .
There ’s a reason why this is so .
Superstition leads to , among many things , unnecessary death and suffering .
In Uganda there hardly seems to be what might be called a ‘ rational response ’ to this growing problem of superstition – I dare say , none , because most superstition falls under the realm of ‘ personal beliefs ’ and is therefore beyond reproach .
Superstition is rife in Africa and informs many people ’s ways of thinking on the continent .
The consequences of this are evident , and they are appalling .
Last week in Burundi , a 5 - year old albino boy was killed , his limbs chopped off .
They killed his mother too .
According to AP :
Ten assailants armed with guns and grenades killed Desire Vyegura , 5 , and his mother , Susann Vyegura , in Burundi on Monday , said Kassim Kazungu , head of the Burundi Albino Association .
Both victims had their limbs chopped off .
Attackers also pulled out one of Desire ’s eyes and chopped off his mother ’s breasts , Kazungu said .
The attack took place in Cankunko village in the Cendajuru district , about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) east of the capital city , Bujumbura .
Why did this happen ?
The killings are fuelled by superstitious beliefs that human albino body parts will bring others wealth and success , Ntetema said .
" Body parts are sought for their supposed miraculous powers , " she said .
" Some use them as human sacrifice as advised by witch doctors . "
Apparently a full set of albino body parts can fetch in excess of $ 75,000 , and since 2007 approximately 10,000 albinos have been displaced or have gone into hiding .
If the irrational belief in witchcraft was n’t so pervasive in this part of the world , people would not be hunting albinos for their body parts .
Sure , poverty would persist and make people take desperate measures , but killing albinos for body parts would n’t be one of them .
But why do such irrational beliefs persist ?
Have people not gone to school , or been educated ?
‘ Most Africans have n’t gone to school ’ you might say .
Well , then , where are the educate ‘ elite ’ among us , and why are they not actively explaining to the peasants the futility and pointlessness of engaging in juju and other forms of black magic ?
They ’re nowhere – because they believe in it themselves .
That is , they believe it works , even though not all might partake of it .
Surely , if even university educated Africans believe that witchcraft is efficacious , what hope do we have for peasants ?
If you are reading this , and you are a person who seriously thinks witchcraft works , I urge you to read this great lesson in critical thinking , watch this video , and apply critical thinking to your belief in the efficacy of witchcraft .
Witchcraft / juju / blackmagic does NOT work .
Stop killing albinos .
Icelandic volcano takes time out from disrupting flights ... to produce a giant smoke ring
Advertisement
After causing misery to millions of air passengers over the past few weeks , the infamous Icelandic volcano has at last provided us with something we can all admire - a giant smoke ring .
Like a human smoker , Eyjafjallajökull puffed out the magical circle .
Perfectly formed , it rose from the volcano 's main crater and hovered hundreds of feet above the seething mountain for more than five minutes .
Up in the air : Close up of the smoke ring rising above the Eyjafjallajökull volcano earlier this month
The magical ring hovers above the main crater of the Icelandic volcano , Eyjafjallajökull , earlier this month
And just as it was produced in the blink of an eye , so it disappeared - the vapours whisked off in a cold northern breeze .
Fortunately Joseph Licciardi , an earth sciences professor from Oregon State University , was there to see it - and he had enough time to grab his camera and take a snap .
He said : ' The ring was visible five minutes and then fell apart - I am thrilled that I was present at the event . '
' The apparent fact that Eyjafjallajokull has blown only one observed smoke ring in the past month or so seems to indicate that this is an exceedingly rare occurrence during the present eruption .
Volcano photographers captured images of a similar event at Italy 's Mt. Etna in 2000 , but despite good documentation , Licciardi said that just how the rings form remains a mystery .
It 's possible that bursts of gas through narrow vents would do the job , much like cigar or cigarette smokers blow rings with their mouths. ning of the mouth .
Eyjafjallajökull is still active , although activity are slowly decreasing .
It 's always hard to imagine a world fundamentally different to the one we encounter everyday .
Even when the balance shifts deeply between established political forces , it feels like there might be a new DJ playing different songs but that you 're still at the same party .
The days press in on us with familiar routines , demands and a storm force gale of unchanging multimedia information .
Unless , that is , something happens to really break the routine .
Wait long enough and something always will .
It was n't a gaffe , or a TV debate , but a blast that allowed us all to imagine a truly different world during this election campaign , one in which we are reconnnected to the environment .
In the early hours of Wednesday 14 April 2010 , a dormant volcano , covered in ice , with a hard - to - pronounce name ( Eyjafjallajökull ) exploded .
Nobody heard it across northern Europe because the volcano was far away in Iceland , but the skies above them fell silent .
Within hours , airports all over Europe were closing as if giant master switch for the aviation industry had been flicked to off .
Why ?
Fine dust from the vast billowing cloud thrown up by the volcano was lethal to modern jet engines .
Planes that had flown through similar clouds in the past had suffered terrifying , nearly disastrous losses of power .
For days Europe was grounded .
" Five miles up the hush and shush of ash / Yet the sky is as clean as a white slate , " wrote the poet Carol Ann Duffy .
One of the main arteries of the modern world – cheap , ubiquitous air travel – was suddenly cut .
What happened next was revelatory , and possibly a glimpse of a future world in which both climate change and strictly limited oil supplies have clipped the industry 's wings .
Philosophers , poets and stranded travellers filled the airwaves with reflections .
Yes , it was inconvenient , they said , of course it was .
No one was prepared for it .
But suddenly the skies were peaceful .
People found other ways to get from one place to another .
They took trains , buses , taxis and shared cars .
They talked to each other and , travelling at a slower pace , found themselves enjoying the scenery and being more aware of the world they were passing through .
Most strikingly , as flying was something we thought we could n't live without , the world did not come to a standstill .
The sky did n't fall , it just looked more peaceful .
We heard more clearly , as Duffy wrote , " the birds sing in the Spring " .
Almost everything simply carried on .
The airlines suffered economically , but it revealed how few of the things we depend on for day - to - day life really relied on the airlines .
Life would be different without them ( or far fewer of them ) but life would go on , as it had done for thousands of years .
Kew Gardens in south London is famous for two things .
One is its stunning botanical collection , the other is that it lies on the approach to Heathrow airport .
Normally , visitors have their appreciation of nature interrupted by low - flying aircraft every few seconds .
If you had visited Kew during the brief ceasefire in the skies in April , you would have seen crowds of people staring in quiet wonderment at what was missing from the air above their heads .
Like many others , behind the bluster of the threatened airline industry , I suspect they had the creeping sensation , that thanks to a random geological event on a faraway island , we had all stumbled upon a different and better world .
Of course , this is not what our political masters had planned .
Quite the contrary .
Typical of rich countries , the British government is planning for the number of air passengers using its airports to treble from around 200 million to 500 million by 2030 .
And , if aviation is allowed to grow , by 2050 it will account for between half and all of the UK 's acceptable carbon emissions , even if the growth slows down .
Yet , those few days in April revealed that even in the most dramatic circumstances , of the complete , sudden , unexpected closure of airspace over northern Europe , we could adapt .
Scandalously , the environment , our underlying physical life support system , has been considered worth barely a mention during the election campaign .
But , interestingly , both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties have said they oppose a new runway at Heathrow .
With that , and holding recent memories , as the poet put it , of the clear skies ' " silent summons " , perhaps we 'll remember that change is not only possible , it actually happens .
Whoever gets elected , they will have about 79 months and counting , to make a real difference on climate change .
At Wolfram|Alpha , our mission is to make all the world ’s systematic knowledge available , accessible , and computable .
The number - one priority of our new Managing Director , Barak Berkowitz , is to get Wolfram| Alpha in the hands of everyone .
It ’s all about ubiquity .
This is an exciting time .
To date , we ’ve focused on improving the Wolfram| Alpha experience , refining the processes we use to incorporate new information into the system , experimenting with Wolfram| Alpha on mobile devices , and solidifying programmatic access through the API .
As we approach the anniversary of the launch of Wolfram| Alpha , we ’ll be moving into Wolfram| Alpha ’s next phase , centered on growth — increasing the exposure and use of Wolfram| Alpha both by individuals seeking knowledge and by developers building computational knowledge into their applications in interesting ways .
We want Wolfram|Alpha to become ubiquitous .
The first step in this process is to improve Wolfram| Alpha ’s accessibility on smartphones and other mobile devices that are increasingly an integral part of one ’s online experience .
Today we ’re launching the mobile Wolfram| Alpha website , http://m.wolframalpha.com.
The new mobile website is a big step forward from the landing page it replaces , having been engineered from the ground up for the new generation of touch - screen smartphones while enabling access to Wolfram| Alpha from earlier handheld devices that have difficulty with the main website .
In addition to the mobile website , we ’ve changed the price of the Wolfram|Alpha App for the iPhone and iPod touch to $ 1.99 , down from $ 49.99 .
Many , if not most , of our mobile customers tell us that the app is their preferred way of using Wolfram| Alpha .
However , if you happen to be one of the few early adopters who are n’t happy with the app , you can request a refund .
Over the next few weeks and months , we will make a series of announcements that continue the push toward our ultimate goal — putting Wolfram| Alpha everywhere .
As we enter the age of ubiquity for Wolfram| Alpha , we look forward to seeing and hearing how you make use of computational knowledge in your life .
All flights in and out of the UK and several other European countries have been suspended as ash from a volcanic eruption in Iceland moves south .
Up to 4,000 flights are being cancelled with airspace closed in Norway , Sweden , Finland and Denmark among others .
The UK's air traffic control service ( Nats ) said no flights would be allowed in UK airspace until at least 0700 BST on Friday amid fears of engine damage .
Safety group Eurocontrol said the problem could persist for 48 hours .
The volcano is still spewing ash and the wind direction is expected to continue bringing clouds into UK and European airspace for some time to come .
The UK 's airspace restriction was the worst in living memory , a Nats spokesman said .
Some 600,000 people are thought to have been affected .
Nats suggested that the restrictions were unlikely to be lifted after 0700 , saying it was " very unlikely that the situation over England will improve in the foreseeable future " .
Passengers were advised to contact their carriers prior to travel .
Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said he was " closely monitoring the situation " and would be meeting with key transport officials on Friday morning .
Experts have warned that the tiny particles of rock , glass and sand contained in the ash cloud from the still - erupting volcano could be sufficient to jam aircraft engines .
The Health Protection Agency said the ash from the Eyjafjallajoekull eruption did not pose a significant risk to public health because of its high altitude .
However , the British Lung Foundation has warned people with lung conditions to keep their medication with them as a precautionary measure .
These are some of the knock - on effects :
Eurocontrol says Germany is monitoring the situation and considering partial airspace closures
The two main airports in Paris and many others in the north of France are closing
There is severe disruption in France and Spain , where all northbound flights are cancelled
Nats is due to make an announcement shortly as to the arrangements that will be in place through to 1300 BST on Friday
British Airways offers refunds or an option to rebook after all its domestic flights are suspended
Flybe announces it has cancelled all flights up until 1300BST on Friday and more than 25 services due to run after that .

One passenger at Glasgow told the BBC : " I 'm meant to be going to Lanzarote .
We 've travelled from Oban , leaving at 3 am .
Now we 've decided we might as well just go home and do a bit of gardening . "
Others switched from plane to train , with the East Coast line extending its 1830 BST London to Newcastle service through to Edinburgh .
A spokeswoman for Eurostar estimated an extra 10,000 seats had been booked .
She also said Friday 's services were " extremely full " .
Budget airline Ryanair said no flights were operating to or from the UK on Thursday and it expected cancellations and delays on Friday .
A spokesman for Nats , which was formerly known as the National Air Traffic Services , said : " The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre has issued a forecast that the ash cloud from the volcanic eruption in Iceland will track over Europe tonight .
" Nats is working with Eurocontrol and our colleagues in Europe 's other air navigation service providers to take the appropriate action to ensure safety in accordance with international aviation policy . "
The European air safety body , Eurocontrol , said the cloud of ash had reached 55,000ft and was expected to move through northern UK and Scotland .
Brian Flynn , assistant head of operations of its central flow management unit , told the BBC : " As it moves toward the Netherlands and Belgium it will dissipate and lose intensity , like any weather phenomenon .
But we do n't know what the extent of it will be . "
The Natural Environment Research Council ( NERC ) has sent up a reconnaissance flight to investigate how the ash is distributed in the cloud , something that is impossible to assess from satellite imagery .
Dr Mike Branney , senior lecturer in volcanology , University of Leicester , said : " Volcanic ash is not good to plane engines .
" Firstly it is highly abrasive and can scour and damage moving parts .
Secondly , if it enters a jet engine the intense heat of the engine can fuse it to the interior of the engine with a caking of hot glass , which ultimately can cause the engine to cut out completely .
" This is a sensible precaution . "
In 1982 a British Airways jumbo had all four of its engines shut down as it flew through a plume of volcanic ash .
There was also an incident on 15 December 1989 when KLM Flight 867 , a B747-400 from Amsterdam to Anchorage , Alaska , flew into the plume of the erupting Mount Redoubt , causing all four engines to fail .
Once the flight cleared the ash cloud , the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage , but the aircraft was substantially damaged .
A BAA spokesman said : " Passengers intending to fly today are asked to contact their airline for further information . "
The eruption under a glacier in the Eyjafjallajoekull area of Iceland is the second in the country in less than a month .
Prof Bill McGuire , professor at the Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre , said it was not " particularly unusual " for ash from Icelandic eruptions to reach the UK .
" Such a large eruption ... would have the potential to severely affect air travel at high northern latitudes for six months or more .
" In relation to the current eruption , it is worth noting that the last eruption of Eyjafjallajoekull lasted more than 12 months . "
No matter whether or not you liked or even saw Sex and the City 2 what you ca n’t have missed is the cultural conversation that film has caused in all quarters .
We ’ve been talking about women aging onscreen , we ’ve been talking about women ’s rights in the Middle East , we ’ve been talking about menopause , and we ’ve been talking about American excess .
Not too many films , even really good ones , are able to create conversations about a single topic , yet Sex and the City 2 has touched a nerve on a variety of issues .
It ’s too bad that the film did n’t live up to expectations , but still , the revelations it has unearthed has been fascinating .
But what has been so profound to me has been the release of a pent up torrent of misogyny against women and this film has just been a vehicle for that misogyny to be revealed .
Because films allow — and in fact require — critical responses this has seemed to be an invitation to be as mean as possible .
And it ’s come from everywhere .
From men from women , and from people who are usually progressive about issues and ideals .
I still do n’t understand what this movie has done that is so offensive that it deserved the nastiness of the reviews that it received .
If you do n’t like it , do n’t go .
As for the numbers , the film has made now $ 73 million here in the US ( and the studio thinks it will have legs here because there are very few movies that will appeal to women opening over the next couple of weeks ) , but it seems to be doing a lot better overseas where it has made a total of $ 90 million .
And while it never hit number 1 here in the US , it was number 1 in England , France and Australia .
The good news is that people are firing back and are noticing this nastiness .
Because it ’s just not ok .
And when you say nasty things about women in movies , how far are you from saying nasty things about women in general ?
Women — and men — need to stand up to this misogyny and show that it is not acceptable about movies or in society in general .
Here are some of the people standing up to this crap .
Bidisha in The Guardian :
It ’s jaw - dropping .
Reviewers do not appear to despise a real rapist such as Polanski , but they do seem to despise four fictional women who are portraying mildly silly lives .
SATC2 is currently topping the UK box office , above Streetdance 3D , Prince of Persia , Robin Hood , Tooth Fairy , Iron Man 2 , Space Chimps 2 , The Losers , Bad Lieutenant and Four Lions .
The Streetdance boys and girls are buff paragons of unalloyed dance ambition .
Space Chimps is a searing portrayal of the effects of astral travel on primate development .
The other seven films are all standard ignorant , cliched , macho , brutal , brainless , gung - ho , numb - knuckle , totally male - dominated , exhilarating toss .
They feature large clubs of self - involved obsessive stupid men and their multiple male nemeses and cronies and one or two completely outnumbered women in demeaning , underscripted roles .
All but one or two blockbuster films are about men — many men , sometimes all men — and are often a thousand times more venal , selfish , avaricious , consumerist , ignorant , aspirational , shallow and one - dimensional than Carrie and co .
But there is no critical hate for them and their values — or their faces .
That is saved for four women in one film no stupider than anything else Hollywood produces .
And I want to thank the stars for Manohla Dargis who probably does n’t enjoy having to be the gender police at the movie desk for the NY Times but stands up when she needs to ( and it seems that she ’s needed to a lot lately . )
I am grateful that she does n’t shy away when her voice is needed .
The scene of Samantha in the souk has been branded insulting to Muslims .
Certainly it ’s insulting to comedy lovers and to the character , a shrewd number sold out by her director for an unfunny gag about the unruly female body .
This and other scenes of the women with Muslims are often awkward , though that ’s partly a function of Mr. King ’s direction .
Yet there ’s also something touching about a few of these encounters , as when the women wonder how you eat fries when you ’re wearing a veil , a question that strikes me as an uncharacteristically honest admission of difference in a mainstream American movie .
Too bad the women were n’t guys and went to Las Vegas , where they could have indulged in the kind of critically sanctioned masculine political incorrectness that made “ The Hangover ” such a darling .
There are others who are thinking about the film in interesting contexts :

Massachusetts is poised to become the first state in the nation to force retailers to prominently display graphic warnings about the perils of smoking right where cigarettes are sold — at tobacco sales racks and next to cash registers .
Images of ominously darkened lungs , damaged brains , and diseased teeth could start appearing before the end of the year in more than 9,000 convenience stores , pharmacies , and gas stations , if a proposal by the state Department of Public Health is approved as expected .
Other posters would direct smokers to where they can get help to stamp out their habit .
Retailers who refuse to display the signs within 2 feet of tobacco displays and cash registers could face fines of $ 100 to $ 300 .
A retail industry group reacted yesterday with dismay , arguing that cramped corner stores are already burdened by too many regulatory dictums .
The initiative needs the approval of the state Public Health Council — an appointed panel of doctors , disease trackers , and consumer activists — but board members yesterday expressed unequivocal support .
Since the 1990s , Massachusetts has been at the vanguard of US efforts to reduce tobacco use , the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States .
The signs are modeled on a nothing - left - to - the - imagination campaign in New York City , where signs showing the health effects of smoking began sprouting in 11,500 shops last December .
Massachusetts health authorities provided copies of the New York City posters as an illustration of what their campaign will look like .
“ If somebody is trying to quit smoking and they go back to the store and they ’re tempted — oh , just one pack — we hope this will help them make a different choice , ’’ said Lois Keithly , director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Cessation and Prevention Program .
The campaign is being underwritten by $ 316,000 in federal stimulus money from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which will allow the state to provide the materials to retailers without charge .
Because the posters will be produced by outside vendors , a spokeswoman for the state Department of Public Health said , it conforms to the intent of the stimulus law , providing jobs in a sour economy .
Graphic images portraying the damage wrought by smoking have been a hallmark of antismoking campaigns in Europe for years .
But , in the United States , admonitions on cigarette packs and at stores have tended to rely on words rather than pictures .
“ And they ’re just very ineffective at this point , ’’ said Eileen Sullivan , policy director for the state ’s tobacco control program .
Magpul has just filed a patent application ( #20100126053 ) for a quad stack AR - 15 compatible magazine .
The design is quite straight forward .
A central partition separates two dual staggered round stacks .
Two springs are used , a lower stronger spring and a weaker top spring , which are joined by spring slicer .
The magazine has a constant curve geometry .
Interestingly , the transition area ( 16 ) is asymmetric in order to stagger rounds correctly .
The follower
The follower is very interesting .
Two bails ( 58a and 58b ) are spring loaded .
When the follower is pushed against the central partition they part and reveal a hole which allows the follower to descend below the partition .
The patent does not reveal what the capacity of the magazine would be .
I would expect it would be around 50 rounds .
The patent application comes on the heel of the announcement from Izmash that one of the major features of the AK - 200 will be a 60 round quad stack magazine .
It seems 2010 or 2011 may be the Year of the Quad Stack Mag !
A quad stack magazine would be ideal for the M27 IAR .
I have no doubt that Magpul will eyeing a lucrative contract with the USMC .
You can read the full patent after the jump .
UPDATE : Drake at Magpul said to me “ Unfortunately I am unable to disclose any other info at this time on the product in question . ” ( more … )
Countless videos and over six months in isolation later , Christiaan van Vuuren , the TB - afflicted man who became a YouTube star after posting rap videos from quarantine , has finally been given the all - clear to leave hospital today .
Rising to fame as the " Fully sick rapper " , van Vuuren used YouTube and social media to stay connected with the outside world while being confined to a small Sydney hospital room , after he was struck down with a multi- drug - resistant strain of tuberculosis in December last year .
His spoof clips and comedic raps about his time in hospital - about 13 of them have been posted to YouTube - have been viewed nearly 1.5 million times and van Vuuren 's online celebrity even got him a regular gig on prime time national news in New Zealand , rapping the news of the day .
Asked this morning how he felt about his imminent departure from hospital , van Vuuren said he was " buzzing " .
His clear test results only came back on Friday .
" I 'm just pumped to get home and sleep in my own bed , breathe fresh air and enjoy some of the sunlight ...
I 'm just excited to get back into life in the real world again , " he said in a phone interview .

Not uncommonly in practice I see individuals who have a diagnosis of possible ‘ hypertension ’ ( high blood pressure ) hanging over their heads .
Usually what has happened here is that a doctor has noted a high or borderline high reading , which has been ‘ confirmed ’ again on another visit .
Perhaps not surprisingly , individuals can be quite uptight about the fact that they may have raised blood pressure .
There ’s a risk that this anxiety can push up blood pressure when being tested in a doctor ’s office .
The end result , sometimes referred to as ‘ white coat hypertension ’ , is that readings taken in the clinical setting overestimate blood pressure , and possibly lead to unnecessary treatment and undue concern .
For this reason , when I see someone with a suspicion of raised blood pressure in practice , I tend to give two pieces of advice .
These are that they might consider getting a self - test blood pressure monitor that they can use calmly and quietly at home .
If this reveals consistently elevated readings , then it might be prudent to have further investigations ( e.g. automatic 24 - hour monitoring of blood pressure ) .
However , if self - testing reveals normal blood pressures ( as it very often does ) , then this basically puts the person in the clear for hypertension .
Then they ( and their doctor ) can , generally speaking , stop worrying about it .
I was interested to read about a recent study in which the usefulness of blood pressure home - testing was assessed [ 1 ] .
A group of 2000 men and women aged 45 - 74 were assessed over a 7 - year period .
During this time , the individuals measured their own blood pressure at home ( with a Omron HEM - 722 c ) , and also had regular physical examinations including blood pressure measurement with a doctor .
Over the course of the study , there were a number of fatal and non-fatal ‘ cardiovascular events ’ such as heart attacks and strokes .
It turns out that the home - measured blood pressure readings were a much better predictor of these events than the readings taken in the doctor ’s office .
What level of blood pressure is healthy ?
Well , conventional advice is generally that blood pressure should be lower than 140/90 mmHg .
The British Heart Foundation here suggests that blood pressure should be lower than 140 / 85 , but “ if you ’ve had a heart attack , stroke , have diabetes or diagnosed with coronary heart disease , your blood pressure should be below 130/80 . ”
Some doctors have suggested that with blood pressure , “ lower is better . ”
However , there is at least some evidence that this is not necessarily the case .
See here for more about this .

El presidente Felipe Calder�n firm� un decreto para que quienes compren un auto nuevo no paguen el impuesto de la tenencia .
El Presidente inform � que las personas f�sicas que adquieran nuevos autom�viles con un valor de hasta 250 mil pesos no pagar�n la tenencia , que se eliminar� completamente el 31 de diciembre de 2011 .
La medida aplicar� una vez que se publique el decreto en el diario oficial de la Federaci�n , lo cual se prev� ocurra ma�ana mismo .
El Presidente se�al� que el gobierno federal cubrir� la tendencia de autos nuevos por un monto de hasta 250 mil pesos , pero aquellas personas f�sicas que adquieran una unidad por un monto menor no pagar�n nada .
Acompa�ado por los secretarios de Hacienda , Ernesto Cordero y de Econom�a , Eduardo Ruiz Mateos , afirm � que con la compra de autos nuevos se generan m�s empleos para los mexicanos .
En marzo del 2009 , el Presidente se pronunci� por la desaparici�n del pago de la tenencia vehicular , del cual , dijo , ya el gobierno no recibe dinero , aunque reconoci� que de hacerlo impactar�a en las finanzas de las entidades federativas .
El impuesto fue creado como una medida temporal en 1962 �por el entonces presidente Gustavo D�az Ordaz , para financiar los Juegos Ol�mpicos de 1968 , pero una vez pasada la justa deportiva no fue derogado .

Parents are dicks , girls and boys smell bad and act worse , and your teachers are either trying to sabotage your success or sleep with you .
In Rocks Off 's own 2001 senior - yearbook photo , we had n't quite mastered the art of having two distinct eyebrows or growing a beard , so we have no qualms calling these folks out .
It 's fun to see all these badasses and sexpots when they were just that creepy kid who carved GWAR into the detention hall desks or the girl with the mousy smile that would one day wear a pack of lit cigarettes as eyewear .
We rounded up a gaggle of high school pics of some rock , pop and rap 's biggest stars for you to take a gander at .
Some have n't changed much at all , while some are barely recognizable .
Or in Katy Perry 's case , just seem to have been born hot .
Seriously , we would have walked her to every class and even let her cheat off our English homework .
We would have made out with her during Titanic , or at least told people we did .
This one goes out to the high - school graduating class of 2010 .
This is a class whose students were somehow born the same year that Nevermind hit No. 1 on the charts and the Pauly Shore vehicle Encino Man began warming the world 's hearts .
Remember guys , the world is yours ... for now .
Squeeze the juice out of that sucker for us old - timers .
THE POP CLASS Lady Gaga Looking at her in the hallway between classes , would you ever think she would wear shrouds of tulle and wear a dress made of bubbles ?
Plus , she was actually pretty cute , even though she had a wicked Didi Conn thing going on .
Beyonce Knowles
This picture is either from Alief Elsik High or HSPVA over in Montrose , and even then , Beyonce looked drop - dead awesome .
Check out her man Hova in elementary school .
Avril Lavigne
Avril looks like a good half of the chicks we went to high school with .
She probably played the flute too .
This is a junior high pic from Canada , before she sorta dropped out to be a pop star and make neckties an accessory for girls all over .
Katy Perry
We wonder if Katy Perry was a bitch in school ; she does have that glare about her .
She may have had her own table with her own minions , too .
You can tell by the Bebe shirt .
Adam Lambert
Never in a thousand years would we expect this person to be kissing boys on live television and looking like a drag king .
THE ROCKERS Kurt Cobain
By all accounts , Cobain lived a comfortable life before his parents split when he was just in elementary school .
This would be Cobain in early high school before he dropped out .
Marilyn Manson
Here 's the future God of Fuck Cardinal Gibbons High in Fort Lauderdale , Florida before he magically turned into Wayne from the Wonder Years and got a few ribs removed so he could fellate himself and date or marry every single woman we love .
James Hetfield Enter Freshman .
Sorry , it was too easy .
Tommy Lee Being a teenager was probably way cooler if you were Tommy Lee .
Word travels fast with girls in high school , knowwhatiamsaying ?
( His penis is large .
Wink . )
Henry Rollins
The future Black Flag front man went to prep school in the Washington D.C. area before getting that job at the ice - cream shop and jumping in the van with the band for five years .
THE RAPPERS
Drake
If you watched Degrassi : The New Generation during Drake 's eight - season run on the teen soap opera , you would have seen his character Jimmy Brooks get shot and paralyzed , dashing his hoop dreams .
Eminem Nice mullet , Slim Shady .
Jamie Foxx
This takes the cake from Lil ' Jon 's yearbook picture and throws it into the punch bowl at the high - school dance .
Where to begin ?
Kanye
West I 'm really happy for you , and I 'ma let you finish , but we just got to say , Kanye , that Jamie Foxx had a better yearbook picture than you .
Snoop Dogg
This is most un - stoned picture of Snoop we have ever seen ( or likely ever will ) .
It 's like Bigfoot , the shooter on the Grassy Knoll and Martians all rolled into one .
THE MASTER CLASS Iggy Pop " When I grow up , I wanna rub peanut butter all over my chest and be in threesomes with Mick Jagger and David Bowie in Berlin . "
Bruce Springsteen
The Boss really grew into his ears , it looks like .
And somewhere along the line he got a perm that has lasted for the past 40 years .
Prince Jesus Christ , under all that ' fro is the Purple One .
Do you think he grew his hair out to look taller since he's , like , four feet tall ?
" Sexy MF " indeed !
Janis Joplin Here 's Ms. Joplin from her Port Arthur yearbook .
She was a shy gal , but ended up with a statute in her hometown .
Our hometown has a statue for us too .
They call it a new police station .
Steven Tyler
The Aerosmith lead singer even had the lips in high school in Massachusetts .
Now he looks like your grandma on Halloween .
Joe Perry is a helluva drug .
בישראל טרם החליטו על ועדת חקירה , אולם ברגע שתהיה אחת כזאת - קנת ' או'קיף , שהיה על הספינה " מרמרה " וכלול ברשימת אנשי הטרור שתקפו את לוחמי השייטת שניסו להשתלט עליה , מעוניין לשוב לארץ כדי לספק את גרסתו לאירועים .
בראיון מיוחד ל- ynet אמר , כי " אני שוקל ברצינות לבוא ולעמוד בפני כל ההאשמות .
אני בטוח שכל הראיות יהיו מפוברקות וחשוב שאהיה שם " .
או'קיף , בן 41 , בוגר שירות צבאי מלא בחיל הנחתים האמריקני , שב
לטורקיה חבול בפניו .
בצה " ל הגדירו אותו כ " פעיל קיצוני שונא ישראל , פעיל חמאס " , ואומרים כי " מטרתו הייתה להגיע לרצועה לאימון ולהקמת יחידת הקומנדו של חמאס " .
בתגובה ראשונה לטענות , טען או 'קיף כי " זה אבסורד מוחלט .
מאז שהייתי במארינס חלפו 18 שנה , בהם לא הייתי מעורב אפילו פעם אחת באלימות " .
חייל המארינס לשעבר אף הפנה אצבע מאשימה לצה " ל , ואמר : " אין לי עניין לאמן ואין לי עניין להתאמן .
בטח שאין לי עניין להפיץ אלימות .
זה מעלה את השאלה - איך הם הגיעו לזה ?
ומתי ? יום אחרי שעזבתי ?
יומיים אחרי ?
אולי הם בכלל ידעו את זה לפניי ?
לדעתי מדובר בפועלת הסחה לטעות האיומה של מדינת ישראל , שמנסה לשנות את התמונה " .
בינתיים , בכוונתו לשוב לביתו באירופה , שעל מיקומו הוא מסרב לספר : " תמיד יהיו משוגעים שירדפו אותי " .
" זה היה אני או ה ם "
או 'קיף סיפר על חוויותיו מליל המשט הקטלני .
" הייתי מעורב בפירוק נשק משני חיילים , אקדח אצל אחד ורובה אצל אחר .
האלימות של הישראלים באה ללא אזהרה , במים בינלאומיים .
ברגע שנחת הקומנדו הראשון , כבר ראיתי בינינו גופה והיה ברור שהופעל נגדנו כוח קטלני .
כשירד השני כבר היו לידי שלוש גופות .
זה היה ברור שזה אני או הם .
ישר שהם ירדו מהחבלים , חטפתי את הנשקים ורוקנתי את המחסניות - על מנת שיהיו עדות במשפט " .
לדבריו , " עובד ה שרק הישראלים מאמינים לגרסה של הממשלה , אף אחד אחר לא קונה את זה " .
הוא סיפר על תחושותיו האישיות במהלך הקרב בין התוקפים ללוחמי השייטת .
" לא פחדתי .
זה היה מצב של קרב וזה מוכר לי מהמארינס .
האדרנלין זורם בגוף , ההתרגשות באוויר .
שהיו פלאשים של האהובים בחיי , וחשבתי על האפשרות שלא אוכל לחבק שוב את ילדיי ואשתי " , אמר .
" מסכים עם כל מה שגנדי אמר " , אוקיף במסר לישראל ( צילום : רויטר ס )
חייל המארינס לשעבר ויתר על אזרחותו האמריקנית לפני תשע שנים ונשא לאשה כלה פלסטינית .
לדבריו , הוא שאב עידוד למעשיו על ה " מרמרה " ממשנתו של מהטמה גנדי , שדגל באי - שימוש באלימות .
" אני מסכים עם כל מה שגנדי אמר .
אחת מאמרותיו , ורבים לא מאמינים לי עד שהם בודקים , היא שכאשר צריך לבחור בין פחדנות לאלימות , פחדנות באה קודם , אבל במקרים קיצוניים הוא האמין שזה בסדר להשתמש בנשק ואלימות , כאשר נשקפת סכנה למולדת ואזרחים " .
לדבריו , " כאשר אתה נמצא בפני הפסד של כבוד , אדמה או חיים , יש לך הזכות להשתמש באלימות למטרת הגנה עצמית .
היו שם אנשים עם מוטות וסכינים .
זה בדיוק כמו משנתו של גנדי .
אנשים באים מהשמיים עם נשק , והורגים חברים שלך .
מה אתה היית עושה ?
האנשים על הסיפון היו בפחד מאוד גדול .
כולם - גם החיילים שנתפסו .
ראית את זה בעיניים שלהם - הם לא חשבו שהם ישרדו " .
" מרחם על משפחת שלי ט "
למרות שלא הגיע לעזה , או 'קיף מרוצה מתוצאות המשט .
" הכעס של העולם והלחץ להקל על המצור בעזה הם לדעתי חדשות טובות גם לישראלים , בין אם הם מודעים לכך ובין אם לא .
זה גורם לי לכעס ולעצב שכל - כך הרבה ישראלים לא מבינים שהמדיניות הזו כלפי עזה לא נכונה והרסנית גם לישראל .
יש 800 אלף ילדים בעזה , ולא משנה מה תגיד על חמושים וחמאס , אין שום הצדקה להכפיף אותם לטרור וטראומה " .
גם כלפי החייל החטוף גלעד שליט הוא חש סימפטיה .
" זה סיפור טראגי לו ולמשפחתו .
אני מרחם על ההורים שלו , זה בטח נורא .
יש לי ביקורת גדולה לגבי חמאס וזכויות אדם , אבל חשוב לזכור שהם בנסיבות קשות .
זאת עובדה שיש הרבה יותר משפחות פלסטיניות עם ילדים בבתי כלא ישראליים , עם אותו סוג של כאב .
גם אנשים שלא הלכו להרוג נמצאים בכלא .
ולא , לא את כולם אפשר לבקר " , הוא טוען .
לטענתו , לא ניתן לאפשר ביקור הומניטרי אצל שליט .
" אם יגיע הצלב האדום זה יסגיר את המקום בו הוא נמצא , וייתכן שיהיה שם מבצע ישראלי .
ברור שבחמאס חייבים להגן על המיקום שלו .
אני מקווה שבסוף כולם ישתחררו , גם הוא , ובבריאות טובה .
אחת הבעיות בעולם היא שמעריכים חיי אחדים יותר וחיי רבים פחות " , הוא קובע , ושולח מסר לישראלים : " אני רוצה לראות מוסלמים נוצרים ויהודים זה לצד זה .
" אם הישראלים רוצים שליטה מוחלטת בארץ הקודש הם יכולים לעשות את זה כעת , אבל זה לא יעבוד לנצח - כמו משטר האפרטהייד .
אתם חייבים לשנות את המדיניות .
אני אוהב את כל האנשים בעולם כולל את הישראלים , אבל עד שאתם והממשלה תעצרו את מה שקורה , אנחנו נמשיך להיות משני צדי המתרס " .
Lately , I ’ve been quoting from last year ’s survey results left , right and centre , and seeing how we still do n’t have a nicely linkable version online , I guess it ’s high time to change that .
Around the 0.5.0 release in early August 2009 , an innocuous discussion on IRC turned into an impromptu poll about Stonesoup ’s player base .
The survey was subsequently ported to various forums , hosted on CAO and pointed out in the mailing list .
Between August 17 and some time in early November , we received a total of 274 replies to the following 12 questions :
What is your age ?
What is your country ?
Do you play locally , on a server , or both ?
Do you play Tiles , ASCII , or both ? OS ( es ) at home ?
Roguelikes played before ?
( NetHack , ADOM , etc . ? )
Where did you learn about Crawl ?
And when ?
How many Crawl wins ?
( If none , you may specify your best game . )
If you take part in the tournament , where did you hear about it ?
Ever recommend Crawl ?
Which computer game have you played most in the last month ( July ) ?
The results , as posted once we had 250 replies , can be found here .
In November , I presented the complete results at the International Roguelike Development Conference in Geneva .
In the rest of this post , I will attempt to summarize the most interesting findings , but leave the more detailed numbers and in - depth discussion to the two files linked above .
The average Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup player at the time of the survey ( or at least the average survey participant ) can be described as follows : He ( 94 % likelihood of being male ) is between 25 - 29 years old ( 31 % , average age : 27.3 ; most common age : 25 ) and lives in the USA ( 54 % ) .
Even if he does n’t , he ’s very likely to speak English as a primary language ( 75 % ) .
He uses Windows XP ( 52 % Windows , of these 63 % Win XP ) at home , and only plays Crawl locally ( 54 % ) because he prefers Tiles to ASCII ( 60 % if playing locally , 38 % total ) .
This also means that he did not take part in the tournament ( 39 % participants total , 23 % Tiles players ) .
He ’d probably never even heard of the original Dungeon Crawl and only started playing after Stone Soup came out ( 65 % ) .
Crawl is not his first roguelike ( 91 % ) and he ’s very likely to have at least tried NetHack before ( 73 % ) and maybe also ADOM ( 40 % ) , Angband ( 28 % ) or one of the smaller roguelikes ( e.g. Rogue , DoomRL , Dwarf Fortress , POWDER , various Angband variants , etc. )
At the time of taking the poll , he had n’t won Crawl yet ( 62 % ) and probably had n’t even found his first rune yet ( 79 % of non-winners ) , but he nonetheless claims to have recommended the game at least once ( 83 % ) and also lists Crawl as the game played most “ within the last month ” ( 53 % total , 27 % if discounting tournament participants ) .
Though , to be fair , hardcore players are more likely to take part in such a survey , so we should take all results with a grain of salt .
Still , thank you ! :)
There ’s an interesting rift between ASCII players and Tiles players when it comes to percentage of winners ( 49 % ASCII , 25 % Tiles ) .
However , interpreting this finding to mean that “ ASCII players are better players ” would be overly hasty .
For one , Tiles players tend to be relatively new to the game ( Tiles : 72 % joined since Stonesoup , 34 % in 2009 ; ASCII : 61 % joined since Stonesoup , 20 % in 2009 ) if not the genre , whereas players who knew Crawl from before tiles were introduced were already used to the console “ graphics ” and might have seen little reason to switch .
Second , and more importantly , there ’s a much stronger correlation when comparing local vs. server play ( 25 % local winners , 68 % online ) , possibly because players on the server are more likely to use the # #crawl channel to ask for playing tips and can receive advice from more experienced players watching them .
The survey also showed that many players felt they “ were n’t good enough ” for online play or the tournament , so it might be that the more experienced Tiles players eventually switch to online ( ASCII ) play , even though they would prefer a way to continue playing the Tiles version online .
In general , Crawl ’s popularity has increased significantly once tiles had been added .
Downloads jumped from 2,472 and 4,321 in total ( source and various platforms included ) for 0.1.7 and 0.2.7 , respectively , to 10,374 downloads of the Windows Tiles version alone in 0.3.4 .
( All numbers taken from SourceForge on March 31 , 2010 . )
A few conclusions
The impact of language is much stronger than we expected .
It would be interesting to compare this effect with other games which rely a lot on text ( e.g. MMORPGs which have not been translated or text adventures , i.e. interactive fiction ) .
A good many players have known the game for years , yet have never won .
This is important for design purposes : adding features for the early game ( e.g. new gods , shallow vaults , etc. ) will be appreciated by those players .
The Crawl tournament would benefit immensely from tiles play over the internet .
While some players oppose Tiles on principle , we also got a lot of praise for the quality of Crawl ’s tiles and interface ; for example by players who said that they play other roguelikes in ASCII , yet Crawl with Tiles .
As developers , we plan to keep supporting both modes .
Each of them has advantages of its own and we will continue to improve their interfaces .

Welcome to the ComicShots section of Doctor Who Online - DWO 's very own exclusive series of Doctor Who comics , which feature concise , humourous retellings of the Classic Series Doctor Who episodes .
In a world with an alternate history , a great war finally comes to an end leaving the earth diseased and polluted .
The geneticist Dr. Azuma vies for support from the government for his neo-cell treatment that he claims can rejuvenate the body and regenerate humankind .
The government leaders , guarding their own deeply entrenched powers , turn down the professor .
Driven to complete his work , Dr. Azuma accepts a secret offer from a sinister faction of the powerful military .
After an incident occurs in Dr. Azuma 's lab , a race of mutant humans known as the Shinzo Ningen are unleashed upon the world .
Now only the warrior known as Casshern , reincarnated with an invincible body , stands between the Shinzo Ningen and a world on the brink of annihilation .
Written by Frank Tinsley V
AN increasing number of humans are being killed by wild elephants each year in Bangladesh - with many of the fatalities occurring because people settle in the animals ' migration corridors .
Bangladesh is home to only an estimated 227 wild Asian elephants , but up to 100 more migrate through the country each year , mostly through the north and northeast , according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) .
As more people in Bangladesh , one of the world 's most densely populated nations , settle in the elephant corridor areas , they are more likely to be attacked by confused , angry pachyderms .
There are now hundreds of villages along the densely - forested Indian border and residents of the area say they frequently have to drive away herds of wild elephants that come to raid their paddy fields and fruit trees .
During harvesting season , the villagers form night patrols and use kerosene torches , firecrackers and drums to drive the elephants away , but these efforts are becoming increasingly futile .
Tribal leader Luise Neng Minja said the elephants , which shelter in the forest during the day and come down to villages at night , used to flee but now they are no longer so scared .
" I 've seen an elephant snatch a torch from a man with its trunk while we were driving away a herd , and throw the flame on a house , setting it on fire , " said Luise , 51 .
Professor Anwarul Islam , head of Wildlife Trust of Bangladesh , said it was no surprise the villagers ' tactics were failing .
" You can not imagine how intelligent the elephants are , they are quick to learn human strategies and they find tricks to avoid them , " he said .
" They are hungry , so they defy villagers ' defenses and attack to eat crops and fruits , " he added .
According to a 2004 IUCN study , the most recent data available , 39 people were killed in the study year of 2001 - 2002 , while seven elephants were killed by people in the same period .
Officials say the direct financial losses caused by elephants are estimated at 30 million taka ( US $ 500,000 ) annually , with this figure rising every year .
Wildlife expert and lead author of the 2004 IUCN study , Mohsinuzzaman Chowdhury , said elephants in Bangladesh are reacting naturally to a shortage of suitable habitat .
" Fencing on many parts of the India - Bangladesh border has severely disrupted the elephants ' movement , leading to an acute food crisis for elephants , " he said .
" Finding a solution will be tough , " Mr Chowdhury said , suggesting that preventing ongoing deforestation was also essential .
The government of Bangladesh , however , has done little to reduce the rising problem of human - elephant conflict and settlement of elephant corridors continues unabated .
" An awareness campaign to prevent deaths of villagers has started , " said the government 's top conservation expert Tapan Kumar Dey .
" But otherwise we have a lot more to do . "

Congratulations to all .
Late last week we announced the public beta of the Stack Exchange API — a way to write apps that work with Stack Overflow , Server Fault , Super User , Meta Stack Overflow — and any future Stack Exchange 2.0 sites we launch together as a community .
To ensure that we get lots of feedback on our public API beta , and produce some quality apps that fully exercise the API , we ’ve decided to have a little contest .
With some totally awesome prizes !
First Prize
top of the line 30 ″ LCD monitor ( either Dell 3008 WFP or Apple Cinema HD — whichever we can get to you easiest )
Second Prize
Herman Miller Mirra chair
Third Prize
Intel CULV Netbook , similar to Acer Aspire 1410 .
Special Prize ( for best library / wrapper )
Adjustable height , motorized GeekDesk
The contest will run for the duration of the public API beta , which we expect to be about 8 weeks , roughly .
The winners will be announced when version 1.0 of the API is formally released .
If that sounds appealing to you …
visit stackapps.com and start building awesome stuff with our API !
To make sure we ’re all roughly on the same page for this contest , let ’s set some ground rules :
Contest open to every man , woman , and child on planet Earth , except those men , women , or children living in places where contests like this are somehow illegal .
Only applications and libraries / wrappers listed on the apps tab of stackapps.com are eligible for consideration .
The application or library / wrapper must be written using our API , and work universally against all of our sites — at least those sites we have made public and have an active API at the time the contest ends .
While we do have a special prize to recognize the best library / wrapper , to be eligible for the first 3 prizes you must build an application .
If you live in an area of the world where it is logistically impossible for us to get your prize to you — like , say , because your nearest Herman Miller dealer is 3000 nautical miles away — email us when you win and we ’ll make something work .
Your app must work against the final , 1.0 released version of the API .
We ’ll give you at least week ’s notice here on the blog when that ’s closer to happening .
A few notes on how we ’ll be judging this contest :
The entire Stack Overflow , Inc team will ultimately decide the winners based on order of awesomeness .
And lest you think we do n’t know awesome when we see it , we built Stack Overflow .
I ’m just sayin’ .
( But seriously , please understand that our decisions will be based on a variety of factors , some of which may be entirely subjective . )
We will look at the number of votes your app or library / wrapper gets on the apps tab of stackapps.com .
Does n’t have to be a zillion votes , but we ’d definitely like to see you convince your peers that your app deserves to be in the top ( n ) of stackapps by popular vote .
We will look at the number of requests for your API key .
Was your application used by a lot of people ?
Or at least a reasonable amount ?
We will look at your application itself .
Does it look cool ?
Does it work ?
Is it reasonably documented and understandable ?
Can other people find it ?
We will look at your application ’s code .
Is this app a reasonable example of how to write clean code against our API ?
Is it open source so other programmers can learn from it ?
Does it accept outside contributions ?
Being open source is n’t required , but it does get you some extra brownie points .
If you ’ve read this far , clearly you ’re invested , and you deserve one of those totally awesome prizes .
Now go build yourself some apps !
Update : the contest is officially over , and the results are in !
Congratulations to all .
Two months of paid leave for MTA bus drivers to recover from “ assault ” by spit ?
News that this is routine , thanks to a contract clause , has outraged New Yorkers .
But MTA Chairman Jay Walder ’s drive against such wasteful practices has the unions spitting mad .
One of the nicer things transit workers recently called Walder in an online forum is a “ tightwad micromanager . . . who manages through fear rather than respect . ”
Others wish the union had “ taken action months ago with rule book slowdowns , mass protests at Walder ’s house . ”
In other words , ending even the most blatant abuses will be a major battle .
Overtime kicks in by eight - hour day rather than 40 - hour week .
So employees earn full pay while working less by calling out sick and then making up the lost wages through ( premium ) overtime .
Over the last few weeks , MTA officials have steadily begun to uncover what Walder calls “ the shame of the system ” — wasteful work rules that prevent its various agencies from running bus , subway , rail and maintenance operations more efficiently .
For example , many bus drivers clock a 12 - hour shift for driving four hours in the morning rush and four in the evening rush .
For the four hours in between , they ’re paid for being available — but with no work to do .
Some have become pretty good pool players , Walder has noted , thanks to free time and recreational equipment at the bus depots .
The union ’s response ?
“ The MTA has agreed to these terms for 50 years — and it ’s fair , ” insists John Samuelson , president of Transport Workers ’ Union Local 100 .
Fair to whom ?
Surely not to the tax - and fare - paying public .
Walder has begun to end some of the insanity .
Maintainers of the Brooklyn - Battery Tunnel , Verrazano - Narrows Bridge and other crossings traditionally clocked an 8 am to 4 pm shift — with the first couple of hours wasted as they waited out the morning rush before starting work .
Now , maintenance crews will work an 11 pm to 7 am shift for a 10 percent bonus — rather than traditional overtime wages .
Then there ’s the LIRR , with its legendarily obsolete work rules .
As The Post reported earlier this month , whenever crew members are switched from one train to another , they get another day ’s full pay .
That may have made sense back in the coal - shoveling days of railroading ; in today ’s world it ’s a golden giveaway .
For decades , union intransigence has blocked technological advances .
Real - time bus arrival information is finally being tested on Manhattan ’s 34th Street — more than a decade after technology had made it possible .
Union drivers did n’t want to be tracked , so union bus mechanics refused to service wheels with the rotation - counting device needed to supplement GPS in its early days .
And while the new system on the Canarsie line can run trains with no crew aboard , L trains still operate with crews of two — thanks to union work rules .
Of course practices like these are just the tip of the MTA labor - cost iceberg .
The agency also faces huge pension and benefit liabilities .
And transit workers who labor in dirty , dangerous and even deadly , conditions deserve fair compensation for the work they do and the risks they take .
But that does n’t mean pay for time not worked .
In fact , work - rule waste jacks up costs for everything in New York :
* The union representing crane operators insists on having full - time “ oilers ” at construction sites every day .
But unlike the steam - driven equipment of old , modern cranes do n’t need constant lubrication .
* On building sites across the city , union operators must staff elevators — even when they have normal push - buttons for each floor .
* Told it would cost $ 1,000 to have a union electrician plug a laptop into the wall of a Midtown hotel , one smart customer ran out and bought a spare battery for $ 70 instead — and then noted it would be cheaper to buy a whole new computer than to pay the hotel electrician .
* Another Midtown hotel just lost out on hosting the Sidney Hillman Foundation awards dinner after its unionized workers said they ’d refuse to serve the foundation president — because he also heads up a rival union .
* Tavern on the Green is about to become a Central Park visitor center , snack bar and retail shop because the demands of the Hotel Trades Council derailed the last attempt to renovate and reopen it .
The city ’s soliciting new bids , but it ’s hard to see how the landmark will ever again operate as a restaurant as long as the unions refuse to accept change .
It ’s hard to imagine the city ’s transit system going the way of Tavern — but the fact is that outrageous work rules are slowly strangling the entire city economy .
New Yorkers need to wake up and realize how often unions now fight to protect unfair pay and other privileges — at the expense of the rest of us .

Today , exactly four years have passed since The Pirate Bay was raided by the Swedish police .
While the entertainment industries hoped that this would be the end of their troubles , in hindsight they 've created a a multi- headed hydra that is impossible to kill .
The events that unfolded could easily be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster .
May 31 , 2006 , less than three years after The Pirate Bay was founded , 65 Swedish police officers entered a datacenter in Stockholm .
The officers were tasked with shutting down the largest threat to the entertainment industry at the time – The Pirate Bay ’s servers .
While the policemen were carrying out their jobs , Pirate Bay founders Gottfrid and Fredrik learned that something was seriously wrong .
In the months before the raid they were already being watched by private investigators day and night , but this time something was about to happen to their trackers .
Fredrik recalls the day vividly : “ I got a phone call like 10 am in the morning , it was Anakata [ Gottfrid ] . ”
He told Fredrik that there were police officers at their office , and asked him to get down to the co-location facility and get rid of the ‘ incriminating evidence ’ , although none of it , whatever it was , was related to The Pirate Bay .
As Fredrik was leaving , he suddenly realized that the problems might be linked to their tracker , so he initiated a full backup of the site .
At the co-location facility there were 65 policemen , some in civilian clothing .
Fredrik asked them : “ Who are you ?
What are you doing here ? ”
To which they responded , “ Who are YOU ?
What are you doing here ? ”
After questions back and forth , Fredrik eventually told them his name , and a police officer said , “ Oh , we ’ve been looking for you . ”
Although these events may seem almost comedic , Fredrik ’s decision to start a backup of the site is probably the most pivotal moment in the site ’s history .
Because of this backup Fredrik and the rest of the Pirate Bay team were able to resurrect the site within three days .
If there had n’t have been a recent backup , things may have turned out quite differently .
Technicalities aside , the determination to get the site online as soon as possible set the tone for the years that followed .
Backups were spread over different countries to guarantee that the site would survive any attack .
Although the site has gone down for 24 hours or more after the raid , this was usually caused by technical problems combined with laziness or wild parties .
If they were shut down because of legal troubles , it usually took just a few hours to set up shop elsewhere .
Now back to 2006 where the Swedish police confiscated 180 servers , most of which had nothing to do with The Pirate Bay .
After all equipment was taken Peter , Fredrik and Gottfrid were escorted to the police station .
During the subsequent questioning , the Pirate Bay trio gave up very little information .
Gottfrid quickly confessed to his crime – of killing the Swedish prime minister when he was 2 years old , but that was all they got .
After the raid it became clear that the US had threatened to put Sweden on the WTO ’s black list if they refused to deal with the Pirate Bay problem .
Even the MPAA was involved , with John Malcolm , Executive Vice President of the MPAA writing a letter to Sweden ’s State Secretary in which he stated , “ It is certainly not in Sweden ’s best interests to earn a reputation among other nations and trading partners as a place where utter lawlessness with respect to intellectual property rights is tolerated . ”
The raid eventually resulted in a lengthy investigation where the police presented 4000 pages of evidence against the people involved .
This was used by the prosecution during the Pirate Bay trial of last year , and we all know how that ended .
The case is currently waiting to be appealed .
The site , meanwhile , is still up and running and it is larger than ever before .
Right before the raid the site welcomed its one millionth registered user , today they have well over 4 million .
The Pirate Bay folks themselves continued to play Hollywood with their mockings and have declared May 31st to be the independence day of pirates .
“ Let today be the pirates independence day ! , ” they announced in 2008 .
“ Today we celebrate the victories we ’ve had and the victories that will come .
Today we celebrate that we ’re united in our efforts .
Keep on seeding ! ”

Black has a solution for dealing with the oil company responsible for spilling millions of barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
Black believes the U.S. should put the same effort into plugging the leak and cleaning up the spill that was put into attacking the oil - rich country of Iraq .
“ I have a theory I ’ve been postulating and I think you ’ll like this , ” Black told MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann Wednesday .

“ We went into Iraq because there was supposedly these nuclear weapons there .
Now — and that we might get attacked .
Might .
Now , we have BP , which is a multinational corporation , and they act like countries .
I mean they basically are countries , ” said Black .
“ They , as far as I can tell , are attacking us with oil .
And so I propose we declare war and invade them , ” Black suggested .
“ They ’ve got no standing army .
We take over their buildings .
We put the workers , their folks in internment camps and we just get their checks and do what we can with the money to solve the problem down there , ” Black said .
While outlandish , Black is not the first comedian to wonder why the U.S. could put so much effort into attacking Iraq but appears helpless when it comes to the BP spill .
Comedy Central ’s Jon Stewart had similar thoughts Tuesday .
“ It can not be that the only thing our government is good for anymore is war .
We have to at some point use the same urgency and preparedness that we brought to taking over other countries ’ oil to cleaning up our own , ” said Stewart .

Does any part of you feel like you got trapped too long in a single role ?
I ’m conscious of how it has occupied a long chapter of my working life -- all to the good .
Everybody should have my set of problems .
But being in the middle of the Pacific has kept me from doing all the things a New York actor does .
I ca n’t do readings or workshops , ca n’t do voice - overs or commercials .
This is the thing .
I long to be somewhere where I can step outside and run into people who do what I do .
What was it like for you , when you were doing theater all those years in Florida and Alabama ?
It was all I could do .
It was n’t a choice between two things .
It was all I could do .
Alabama Shakespeare Festival had an M.F.A. professional - actor training program , where you get a degree out of the University of Alabama , but you would never set foot in Tuscaloosa .
We had our classes in the morning , and the rest of the time we were either rehearsing our own stuff or understudying and playing small parts on the main stage .
It was just a way for me to make contact with the world of grown - up professional actors and directors .
It was the closest I could get to New York and still be in the South , where I lived .
Are you from the South ?
No , but it ’s where I started acting .
I ended up in the South by a fluke .
An ill - considered marriage and divorce left me high and dry in St. Augustine , Florida .
I had started out my grown - up life in New York City , but I could n’t figure out how to be an actor there .
And so I had been a magazine illustrator instead .
You talked about that on Conan one night , and he showed some of your drawings .
I do n’t know where he found them .
That was insane !
Those were n’t just from my former career ; they were two of the first illustrations I did as a working illustrator ; 1979 was the date of those drawings .
What magazines did you illustrate for ?
Psychology Today , Business Week , Barron ’s , New York Times .
In those days , you ’d see eager young men with black portfolios running around near Rockefeller Center .
And in those four or five tall buildings were half the magazines on the planet .
So every day I would wake up , put on clothes , go into town from Brooklyn , leave my portfolio at some magazine , and then go kill a couple hours , because they would look at them on their lunch breaks .
Then the deal was trying to figure out if they had actually looked at it .
The illustrators had these Holmesian tricks , like we would wrap a pale thread around two pages , and if those two pages had been separated by opening , the thread would fall away .
But if the thread was still in place we would know no one had looked .
POPULATION growth will lead to Australians living " in a chook house " if we do not stop our " addiction to growth " , a forum in Adelaide has heard .
Independent MP Bob Such aired his concerns , with others , at the Population Reform Forum yesterday , one of a series of debates held nationally and funded by prominent population growth opponent Dick Smith .
" In Australia for a long time , we 've had an addiction to growth and it's time that we questioned that addiction and did something about it , " Dr Such said .
" Problems caused by growth can't be solved by more growth .
" Do we really want to live in a chook house ?
And I can tell you it would n't be free range . "
Dr Such was joined by SA Senator Nick Minchin , who criticised the business sector for seeing population growth as a way to increase the local consumer market .
" I do n't believe Government 's role is to provide more customers for business to sell their widgets to , " he said .
University of Adelaide geneticist Dr Michael Lardelli warned Australia was relying on imports for much of its fresh food and it was " game over " if the country ran out of resources .
Earlier , Business SA chief executive officer Peter Vaughan told The Advertiser he believed concerns about the effect of population growth on the environment were " a convenient hook to hang your hat on when you do n't want to say what you really think " .
The Sustainable Population Growth Study of almost 1400 Australians , conducted by consultancy firm TNS , warns there is a " need for greater government communication around how these challenges will be faced " .

In May 1897 , the great American humorist , novelist and social critic — best known by his pen name , — was in London .
It was one of the stops on a round - the - world speaking tour he ’d embarked on in 1895 .
He hoped to use the fees from speaking engagements to pay off the considerable debts he owed in the United States , due to a series of unsuccessful investments and publishing ventures .
While Twain was in London , someone started a rumor that he was gravely ill .
It was followed by a rumor that he had died .
According to a According to a widely - repeated legend , one major American newspaper actually printed his obituary and , when Twain was told about this by a reporter , he quipped :
“ The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated . ”

Another common variation of the line uses the words
“ Reports of my death are grossly exaggerated . ”
Sometimes the quip is given as
In point of fact , all such commonly - heard versions using “ greatly exaggerated ” and “ grossly exaggerated ” are misquotes .
It is true that in late May of 1897 the English correspondent for the New York Journal , Frank Marshall White , contacted Twain in London to inquire about his health .
The editors of the newspaper
The editors of the newspaper had sent a cable White on May 28 , asking him to get Twain ’s response to reports that he was on his deathbed in England .
White relayed this request to Twain .
On May 31 , 1897 , Twain wrote down his response and sent it to White .
June 2 , 1897 , the article was
The next day , White wrote an article that quoted from Twain ’s letter .
On , the article was published in the New York Journal .
It said , in part :
Mark
Twain was undecided whether to be more amused or annoyed when a Journal representative informed him today of the report in New York that he was dying in poverty in London ...
The great humorist , while not perhaps very robust , is in the best of health .
He said :
“ I can understand perfectly how the report of my illness got about , I have even heard on good authority that I was dead .
James Ross Clemens , a cousin of mine , was seriously ill two or three weeks ago in London , but is well now .
The report of my illness grew out of his illness .
The report of my death was an exaggeration . ”
The origin of the more familiar misquote versions of Twain ’s response seems to be the popular biography of Twain written by Albert Bigelow Paine
Paine ’s book was published in 1912 , two years after Twain ’s death .
It includes what is apparently Paine ’s own embellished variation of the story about Twain ’s death quip .
In In Chapter 197 of the biography , Paine said a young reporter had “ ferreted out ” Twain in London after being assigned to follow up on rumors that the famed humorist was “ lying at the point of death . ”
According to Paine , the newspaper had sent a cable to the reporter ordering him to send back a five hundred 500 - word story if Twain was ill , or a thousand word story if Twain was dead .
Paine claimed that upon being shown the cable , Twain “ smiled grimly ” and told the young reporter :
“ You do n’t need as much as that .
Just say the report of my death has been grossly exaggerated . ”
Most scholarly books of quotations now use or include the quote recorded in the New York Journal article , taken from Twain ’s letter to Frank Marshall White .
However , Paine ’s “ grossly exaggerated ” version and “ The report of my death has been greatly exaggerated , ” which seems to be a colloquial variation of Paine ’s line , are better known and commonly assumed to be actual quotes by Twain .
Of course , Following the Equator , published in November 1897 : Of course , as Twain wrote in his book , published in November 1897 :
If you were developing a plan for responding to an oil spill caused by deepwater offshore drilling , it seems like you should be required to include a model in which you assume that the spill takes place below the surface in deepwater conditions , right ?
Well , according to the Wall Street Journal , despite the seemingly obvious nature of that proposition , Federal regulators in the Bush administration eliminated that requirement .
Instead of modeling deepwater spills in deepwater conditions , the Minerals Management Service -- the agency charged with regulating offshore drilling -- limited its models to surface spills , allowing the oil industry to develop response plans based on faulty data .
BP PLC and other big oil companies based their plans for responding to a big oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico on U.S. government projections that gave very low odds of oil hitting shore , even in the case of a spill much larger than the current one .
The government models , which oil companies are required to use but have not been updated since 2004 , assumed that most of the oil would rapidly evaporate or get broken up by waves or weather .
In the weeks since the Deepwater Horizon caught fire and sank , real life has proven these models , prepared by the Interior Department 's Mineral Management Service , wrong .
During the Clinton administration , the federal government had announced plans to require spill models for deepwater drilling to be based on deepwater conditions , but under Bush , that decision was reversed , and models for deepwater drilling were developed using the same assumptions as surface spills .
Researchers have spent the past decade trying to improve modeling of oil spills .
The biggest challenge : to update the models to reflect the new reality of deep - water oil drilling .
Spills thousands of feet below the surface behave very differently than spills on the surface .
Underwater currents , for example , can grab plumes of oil and transport them far from the scene of the initial spill , scientists say .
Deep - water releases tend to break into smaller oil slicks , further complicating efforts to forecast where they 'll go .
MMS said in early 2000 , in a notice to lessees , that it planned to require oil companies operating in deep - water to use new oil - spill predictions specifically designed for deep water .
That regulation never came into effect .
Oil companies today still base their contingency plans on the government 's models , designed only for surface spills .
In 2001 , the then - head of the MMS environmental division wrote a paper that warned " the oil spill trajectory models currently used by the oil industry for the preparation of oil spill response plans may not be adequate for deep water . "
When that 2001 paper was written supporting the Clinton decision , the head of MMS was a Clinton - era holdover , Dr. Thomas Kitsos .
By early 2002 , the Bush administration had tapped a new head of MMS , a former GOP state legislator from Dick Cheney 's home state of Wyoming named Rejane " Johnnie " Burton .
Burton , you 'll be shocked to learn , was in the energy industry and in her announcement touted the fact that she " began her career in the oil and gas industry . "
It was under her leadership that MMS began to rapidly deteriorate , failing to address even the most basic safety issues for new offshore drilling .
If the Bush administration had n't reversed the Clinton decision requiring accurate models , companies involved in deepwater drilling would have been forced to develop a mitigation plan for undersea deepwater spills .
Instead , thanks to the Bush administration , federal regulators allowed deepwater operators to base their plans on surface spills , which are far less complex than deepwater undersea spills and do n't take into account things like undersea plumes , undersea application of dispersant , and ( last but not least ) what to do about a months - long blowout gushing tens of thousands of barrels per day .
So while it 's fair to be tough on President Obama , let 's not forget this key difference between his administration and the last : when President Obama falls short , at least he 's trying to do the right thing .
The previous administration was n't .
They represented the oil industry , not the public .
And we 're still paying the price .

Defects in insulin function -- which occur in diabetes and obesity -- could directly contribute to psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia .
Vanderbilt University Medical Center investigators have discovered a molecular link between impaired insulin signaling in the brain and schizophrenia - like behaviors in mice .
The findings , reported June 8 in PLoS Biology , offer a new perspective on the psychiatric and cognitive disorders that affect patients with diabetes and suggest new strategies for treating these conditions .
" We know that people with diabetes have an increased incidence of mood and other psychiatric disorders , " said endocrinologist Kevin Niswender , M.D. , Ph.D .
" And we think that those co-morbidities might explain why some patients have trouble taking care of their diabetes . "
" Something goes wrong in the brain because insulin is n't signaling the way that it normally does , " said neurobiologist Aurelio Galli , Ph.D .
Galli's group was among the first to show that insulin -- the hormone that governs glucose metabolism in the body -- also regulates the brain 's supply of dopamine -- a neurotransmitter with roles in motor activity , attention and reward .
Disrupted dopamine signaling has been implicated in brain disorders including depression , Parkinson 's disease , schizophrenia and attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder .
Now , Galli , Niswender , and colleagues have pieced together the molecular pathway between perturbed insulin signaling in the brain and dopamine dysfunction leading to schizophrenia - like behaviors .

The researchers developed mice with an insulin - signaling defect only in neurons ( they impaired the function of the protein Akt , which transmits insulin 's signal inside cells ) .
They found that the mice have behavioral abnormalities similar to those frequently seen in patients with schizophrenia .
They also showed how defects in insulin signaling disrupt neurotransmitter levels in the brain -- the mice have reduced dopamine and elevated norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex , an important area for cognitive processes .
These changes resulted from elevated levels of the transporter protein ( NET ) that removes norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic space between neurons .
" We believe the excess NET is sucking away all of the dopamine and converting it to norepinephrine , creating this situation of hypodopaminergia ( low levels of dopamine ) in the cortex , " Galli explained .
Low dopamine function in the cortex is thought to contribute to the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms -- depression , social withdrawal -- associated with schizophrenia .
By treating the mice with NET inhibitors ( drugs that block NET activity ) , the investigators were able to restore normal cortical dopamine levels and behaviors .
Clinical trials of NET inhibitors in patients with schizophrenia are already under way , Galli said , and these new data provide mechanistic support for this approach .
The findings also provide a molecular basis for interpreting previous reports of Akt deficiencies in patients with schizophrenia , as revealed by post- mortem , imaging and genetic association studies .
advertisement
Galli and Niswender suggest that the insulin to Akt signaling pathway is critical for " fine - tuning " the function of monoamine neurotransmitters -- dopamine , norepinephrine and serotonin -- and that it can be impaired in many different ways .
" Dysregulation of this pathway -- because of type 1 diabetes , because of a high - fat diet , because of drugs of abuse , because of genetic variations -- may put a person on the road to neuropsychiatric disorders , " Galli said .
Understanding the molecular link between insulin action and dopamine balance -- the connection between food and mood -- offers the potential for novel therapeutic approaches , the researchers said .
The mouse model described in the current studies may be useful for testing schizophrenia and cognition - enhancing treatments .
Michael Siuta and Sabrina Robertson are the lead authors of the study .
Niswender is an assistant professor of Medicine and Molecular Physiology & Biophysics ; Galli is a professor of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics .

Image caption Mr Lieberman ' abused the public trust ' the Israeli police say
Israeli police have recommended that Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman face fresh charges in a corruption scandal .
Mr Lieberman and another official are accused of trying to manipulate a police investigation into alleged money laundering .
Police have previously recommended that the foreign minister , a right - wing member of the governing coalition , should be indicted on other charges .
They have added " breaching the public trust " to the list of charges .
Israel 's attorney general must now decide whether to take up the charges .
This is a process that can take months .
The police say that the country 's former ambassador to Belarus , Zeev Ben Aryeh , is alleged to have given Mr Lieberman - a political ally - a document detailing a the police investigation .
Mr Lieberman had reportedly plucked Mr Ben Aryeh from obscurity at the foreign ministry and made him an ambassador , the Haaretz newspaper reported .
The minister worked as a nightclub bouncer in his youth in the USSR , and is known for his abrasive style .
He famously once said that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak could " go to hell " .
Last August police recommended indicting Mr Lieberman on charges of bribery , money laundering and obstruction of justice .

Before the season began , some people ( such as myself ) expected the Milwaukee Brewers to at least give the St. Louis Cardinals a fight for the National League Central title .
It was n’t hard to look at an offense that featured Ryan Braun , Prince Fielder , and Rickie Weeks as one that could put runs on the board , and there were enough arms on the pitching staff that I liked to think that they could outscore the opponents on most nights .
It has n’t happened .
After losing last night , their seventh consecutive defeat , the Brewers stand at 15 - 23 , seven games behind the first place Reds and six and a half games behind the Cardinals .
They are one of only five teams in baseball with a winning percentage below .400 .
They are certainly better than they ’ve played , but , at this point , the hole may be too large for them to climb out of .
With 124 games to play , assuming that they ’ll need to win 92 games to give themselves a good chance of winning the NL Central or the Wild Card , they would have to play .621 baseball the rest of the way to make that happen .
As much as I like some of the players on this roster , I do n’t think anyone can realistically expect the Brewers to win 62 percent of their remaining games .
There ’s also the problem of the Reds .
It ’s one thing to be trying to run down just the Cardinals , but when you add a second team to the mix , you limit the chance that you ’ll win by default , as your competitors fall by the wayside .
With just one team to overcome , there ’s a chance that they could face serious injury issues or have a prolonged slump of their own , but that is far less likely to occur to both St. Louis and Cincinnati simultaneously .
Realistically , the playoff chances for the Brewers appear slim for 2010 , and with that reality staring them in the face , it ’s probably time for them to put Prince Fielder on the trading block .
Ryan Howard ’s crazy extension only served to make it even less appealing for the Brewers to attempt to re-sign their slugging first baseman , and with his 2010 value being diluted by his teammates ’ poor play , it makes the most sense to deal him this summer .
It ’s not the outcome that Milwaukee had in mind when they put this roster together , and they do have enough talent to right the ship and get back to a winning record , but they are far enough back in the NL Central where its getting to be time to change directions .
Six weeks of bad baseball can sink a season , and in the case of the Brewers , it probably has .
Mr. Cheney goes to Riyadh — mysteriously
In a move that is sure to set conspiracy theorists aflutter , former Vice President Dick Cheney popped up yesterday in Saudi Arabia , where he met with King Abdullah .
Accompanying him was former State Department diplomat and its top interpreter , Gamal Helal , who recently left the government to form a consulting firm , Helal Associates .
While the Arabic press has caught on to this story , I have n’t seen it reported in the U.S. media as of yet .
But still , it raises a few eyebrows : Cheney , a private citizen who has reportedly been working on his memoirs , does n’t have any obvious reasons to sit down with the Saudi monarch .
The details behind the meeting could go a long way toward unraveling what the former vice president plans to do with his retirement .
Here ’s hoping that the inevitable theorizing about his plans does n’t generate more heat than light .
NASA wants to put your face in space .
No , really : Just in time for the last two space shuttle flights , NASA is offering to fly pictures of anyone who uploads a head shot on their Face in Space website to the International Space Station .
Face in Space follows a long tradition of spacecraft carrying personal touches out of Earth 's gravity well .
Since 1997 , shuttle missions have carried elementary school students ' signatures as part of an outreach project called Student Signatures in Space .
The Cassini spacecraft brought a disk of signatures into orbit around Saturn .
The Phoenix Mars Lander took DVD to Mars ' north pole .
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter took a microchip to the moon .
And the exoplanet - hunting Kepler telescope took a DVD full of names and messages to ET into orbit .
The Voyager I spacecraft 's cargo was even more intimate :
It carried a phonograph record containing recordings of a kiss , a mother 's first words to her child and Carl Sagan 's wife Ann Druyan 's brainwaves , among other Earthly sounds .
But this is the first time the public has been invited to send their portrait into orbit .
As long as you 're older than 13 , all you have to do is upload a photo ( or , if you 're camera shy , just enter your name ) and choose which of the last two Space Shuttle missions you 'd like to fly on .
STS - 133 will launch the Space Shuttle Discovery on September 16 , and STS - 134 will launch Endeavour in November .
After the Shuttle returns , you can print out a " flight certificate " signed by the mission commander .

A constant of folk etymologies seems to be that the odder a word sounds to us , the sillier the story we invent to explain its origins .
“ Pumpernickel ” — the dark coarse sourdough bread we typically associate with Germany — is just such a funny - sounding name that surely it must have a funny story behind it .
Accordingly , someone obliged and came up with a fanciful tale about Napoleon ( or Napoleon ’s groom , or an anonymous Frenchman ) , who , while on a military campaign in the part of Europe now known as Germany , was given some pumpernickel bread to eat :
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 1998 ]
Napoleon referred to a kind of dark bread as only fit for his horse , Nicol — “ pain pour Nicol ” — pumpernickel .
The disdainful recipient of this loaf ( whoever it was ) , declaring it unfit for human consumption , instead fed it to a horse named Nicol while stating either “ C’est du pain pour Nicol ” ( i.e. , “ It is bread for Nicol ” ) or “ C’est bon pour Nicol ” ( i.e. , “ It is good for Nicol ” ) — a disparagement somewhat similar to Samuel Johnson ’s definition of “ oats ” in his Dictionary of the English Language ( 1755 ) as “ A grain , which in England is generally given to horses , but in Scotland appears to support the people . ”
The German locals , apparently unoffended ( and also inexplicably lacking a word of their own for this type of bread ) decided to adopt the spiteful phrase as a name for the dark loaf , rendering the French “ pain pour Nicol ” as “ pumpernickel . ”
If a story this ridiculous requires disproof , it should come from noting that the word “ pumpernickel ” was part of the German language ( as a pejorative roughly equivalent to the modern English “ jerk ” ) over a century before Napoleon was born , and that it also appeared in English ( as a type of bread ) before the French emperor ’s birth .
An alternative origin of “ pumpernickel ” is nearly as strange , if somewhat less savory .
“ Pumpern ” was a New High German word similar in meaning to the English “ fart ” ( so chosen because , like the word “ achoo , ” it imitated the sound it described ) , and “ Nickel ” was a form of the name Nicholas , an appellation commonly associated with a goblin or devil ( e.g. , “ Old Nick ” is a familiar name for Satan ) .
Hence , pumpernickel is the “ devil ’s fart , ” allegedly a reference to the bread ’s indigestible qualities and hence the effect it produced on those who consumed it .
( Some word fanciers have claimed that “ pumpern ” refers to the sound produced by thumping on a loaf of pumpernickel , but that explanation is extremely unlikely . )
On April 9 , 2010 , Miami University 's Pi Beta Phi fraternity for women held a spring formal at the quaint Lake Lyndsay Lodge in Hamilton , Ohio .
The sloppy , slutty details of what transpired that boozy enchanted evening are tremendous .

The letter you see first was written by Lake Lyndsay operator , Lyndsay Rapier - Phipps , to the Dean 's office at Miami University .
In the last couple days , this letter popped up online .
Phipps references Phi Delta
Phi , but the featured sisters in this instance are actually Pi Beta Phi , better known as " Pi Phis " .
I contacted Phipps yesterday to confirm every completely ridiculous detail she states in the letter actually occurred .
" Yes , " she said .
" You 're like the 14th person who 's called me today . "

Like most bus rides to fraternity formals , the guys and gals pounded Natty Lights and other booze most of the way there and were completely obliterated before they even stepped foot inside Lake Lyndsay , which is about 20 - 30 minutes away from Miami University 's campus .
Phipps said the damages both inside and outside the palatial lake area lodge ( which was hosting a non-alcoholic wedding at 8 a.m. the next morning ) were not the most disturbing part of the evening , but more " the overall behavior of the students . "
As you can tell from the detailed description in her letter , both male and female attendees went completely nuts : puking on themselves , breaking crystal vases , decapitating stone lion statues , urinating in sinks , pooping on the side of the building , screwing in the caterer closet , boinking in the beach house .
" They were out of control , " Phipps said .

Even though Phipps threatens in the letter to go to the local papers with this incident , she never did .
She 's still unaware how her letter popped up online but she does n't seem to worried about putting this story out there , even though both she and her husband are proud Miami University alums .

The end result of all this ?
Well the national Zeta sisters ain't happy : From the formal news release :
" The Ohio Zeta Chapter of Pi Beta Phi was founded in 1945 with more than 1,900 proud Pi Beta Phi alumnae .
" The alumnae join Fraternity leadership in expressing great disappointment in the decisions of a few chapter members who have completely disregarded the values in which Pi Beta Phi was founded , " Grand President Mary Loy Tatum said .
" They have placed their chapter in jeopardy with Miami University and Pi Beta Phi . "

Not surprisingly , as you 'll see in the news release on their site , the Ohio Zeta chapter was suspended for one year due to their behavior at the formal in an attempt to " change the culture " of their historic fraternity for value - focused women .
Good luck with that .

The following is the text of James Galbraith ‘s written statement to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee delivered a few days ago .
Chairman Specter , Ranking Member Graham , Members of the Subcommittee , as a former member of the congressional staff it is a pleasure to submit this statement for your record .
I write to you from a disgraced profession .
Economic theory , as widely taught since the 1980s , failed miserably to understand the forces behind the financial crisis .
Concepts including “ rational expectations , ” “ market discipline , ” and the “ efficient markets hypothesis ” led economists to argue that speculation would stabilize prices , that sellers would act to protect their reputations , that caveat emptor could be relied on , and that widespread fraud therefore could not occur .
Not all economists believed this – but most did .
Thus the study of financial fraud received little attention .
Practically no research institutes exist ; collaboration between economists and criminologists is rare ; in the leading departments there are few specialists and very few students .
Economists have soft - pedaled the role of fraud in every crisis they examined , including the Savings & Loan debacle , the Russian transition , the Asian meltdown and the dot.com bubble .
They continue to do so now .
At a conference sponsored by the Levy Economics Institute in New York on April 17 , the closest a former Under Secretary of the Treasury , Peter Fisher , got to this question was to use the word “ naughtiness . ”
This was on the day that the SEC charged Goldman Sachs with fraud .
There are exceptions .
A famous 1993 article entitled “ Looting : Bankruptcy for Profit , ” by George Akerlof and Paul Romer , drew exceptionally on the experience of regulators who understood fraud .
The criminologist - economist William K. Black of the University of Missouri - Kansas City is our leading systematic analyst of the relationship between financial crime and financial crisis .
Black points out that accounting fraud is a sure thing when you can control the institution engaging in it : “ the best way to rob a bank is to own one . ”
The experience of the Savings and Loan crisis was of businesses taken over for the explicit purpose of stripping them , of bleeding them dry .
This was established in court : there were over one thousand felony convictions in the wake of that debacle .
Other useful chronicles of modern financial fraud include James Stewart ’s Den of Thieves on the Boesky - Milken era and Kurt Eichenwald ’s Conspiracy of Fools , on the Enron scandal .
Yet a large gap between this history and formal analysis remains .
Formal analysis tells us that control frauds follow certain patterns .
They grow rapidly , reporting high profitability , certified by top accounting firms .
They pay exceedingly well .
At the same time , they radically lower standards , building new businesses in markets previously considered too risky for honest business .
In the financial sector , this takes the form of relaxed – no , gutted – underwriting , combined with the capacity to pass the bad penny to the greater fool .
In California in the 1980s , Charles Keating realized that an S&L charter was a “ license to steal . ”
In the 2000s , sub - prime mortgage origination was much the same thing .
Given a license to steal , thieves get busy .
And because their performance seems so good , they quickly come to dominate their markets ; the bad players driving out the good .
The complexity of the mortgage finance sector before the crisis highlights another characteristic marker of fraud .
In the system that developed , the original mortgage documents lay buried – where they remain – in the records of the loan originators , many of them since defunct or taken over .
Those records , if examined , would reveal the extent of missing documentation , of abusive practices , and of fraud .
So far , we have only very limited evidence on this , notably a 2007 Fitch Ratings study of a very small sample of highly - rated RMBS , which found “ fraud , abuse or missing documentation in virtually every file . ”
An efforts a year ago by Representative Doggett to persuade Secretary Geithner to examine and report thoroughly on the extent of fraud in the underlying mortgage records received an epic run-around .
When sub - prime mortgages were bundled and securitized , the ratings agencies failed to examine the underlying loan quality .
Instead they substituted statistical models , in order to generate ratings that would make the resulting RMBS acceptable to investors .
When one assumes that prices will always rise , it follows that a loan secured by the asset can always be refinanced ; therefore the actual condition of the borrower does not matter .
That projection is , of course , only as good as the underlying assumption , but in this perversely - designed marketplace those who paid for ratings had no reason to care about the quality of assumptions .
Meanwhile , mortgage originators now had a formula for extending loans to the worst borrowers they could find , secure that in this reverse Lake Wobegon no child would be deemed below average even though they all were .
Credit quality collapsed because the system was designed for it to collapse .
A third element in the toxic brew was a simulacrum of “ insurance , ” provided by the market in credit default swaps .
These are doomsday instruments in a precise sense : they generate cash - flow for the issuer until the credit event occurs .
If the event is large enough , the issuer then fails , at which point the government faces blackmail : it must either step in or the system will collapse .
CDS spread the consequences of a housing - price downturn through the entire financial sector , across the globe .
They also provided the means to short the market in residential mortgage - backed securities , so that the largest players could turn tail and bet against the instruments they had previously been selling , just before the house of cards crashed .
Latter - day financial economics is blind to all of this .
It necessarily treats stocks , bonds , options , derivatives and so forth as securities whose properties can be accepted largely at face value , and quantified in terms of return and risk .
That quantification permits the calculation of price , using standard formulae .
But everything in the formulae depends on the instruments being as they are represented to be .
For if they are not , then what formula could possibly apply ?
An older strand of institutional economics understood that a security is a contract in law .
It can only be as good as the legal system that stands behind it .
Some fraud is inevitable , but in a functioning system it must be rare .
It must be considered – and rightly – a minor problem .
If fraud – or even the perception of fraud – comes to dominate the system , then there is no foundation for a market in the securities .
They become trash .
And more deeply , so do the institutions responsible for creating , rating and selling them .
Including , so long as it fails to respond with appropriate force , the legal system itself .
Control frauds always fail in the end .
But the failure of the firm does not mean the fraud fails : the perpetrators often walk away rich .
At some point , this requires subverting , suborning or defeating the law .
This is where crime and politics intersect .
At its heart , therefore , the financial crisis was a breakdown in the rule of law in America .
Ask yourselves : is it possible for mortgage originators , ratings agencies , underwriters , insurers and supervising agencies NOT to have known that the system of housing finance had become infested with fraud ?
Every statistical indicator of fraudulent practice – growth and profitability – suggests otherwise .
Every examination of the record so far suggests otherwise .
The very language in use : “ liars ’ loans , ” “ ninja loans , ” “ neutron loans , ” and “ toxic waste , ” tells you that people knew .
I have also heard the expression , “ IBG , YBG ; ” the meaning of that bit of code was : “ I ’ll be gone , you ’ll be gone . ”
If doubt remains , investigation into the internal communications of the firms and agencies in question can clear it up .
Emails are revealing .
The government already possesses critical documentary trails — those of AIG , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
Those documents should be investigated , in full , by competent authority and also released , as appropriate , to the public .
For instance , did AIG knowingly issue CDS against instruments that Goldman had designed on behalf of Mr. John Paulson to fail ?
If so , why ?
Or again : Did Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac appreciate the poor quality of the RMBS they were acquiring ?
Did they do so under pressure from Mr. Henry Paulson ?
If so , did Secretary Paulson know ?
And if he did , why did he act as he did ?
In a recent paper , Thomas Ferguson and Robert Johnson argue that the “ Paulson Put ” was intended to delay an inevitable crisis past the election .
Does the internal record support this view ?
Let us suppose that the investigation that you are about to begin confirms the existence of pervasive fraud , involving millions of mortgages , thousands of appraisers , underwriters , analysts , and the executives of the companies in which they worked , as well as public officials who assisted by turning a Nelson ’s Eye .
What is the appropriate response ?
Some appear to believe that “ confidence in the banks ” can be rebuilt by a new round of good economic news , by rising stock prices , by the reassurances of high officials – and by not looking too closely at the underlying evidence of fraud , abuse , deception and deceit .
As you pursue your investigations , you will undermine , and I believe you may destroy , that illusion .
But you have to act .
The true alternative is a failure extending over time from the economic to the political system .
Just as too few predicted the financial crisis , it may be that too few are today speaking frankly about where a failure to deal with the aftermath may lead .
In this situation , let me suggest , the country faces an existential threat .
Either the legal system must do its work .
Or the market system can not be restored .
There must be a thorough , transparent , effective , radical cleaning of the financial sector and also of those public officials who failed the public trust .
The financiers must be made to feel , in their bones , the power of the law .
And the public , which lives by the law , must see very clearly and unambiguously that this is the case .
Thank you .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
Gold prices went from red to rallying Monday amid lingering concerns about the health of the world economy , briefly topping their May 12 record before settling a couple dollars short of that high mark .
Gold futures for August delivery , the most active contract , added $ 23.10 , or 1.9 % , to settle at $ 1,240.80 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange - $ 2.30 from their May 12 settlement record of $ 1,243.10 .
The contract set an intraday high of $ 1,243.30 an ounce in electronic trading , according to the CME Group , which owns Comex .
" A lot of the momentum players are trying to catch on , " said Charles Nedoss , a senior market strategist with Olympus Futures in Chicago .
Silver tracked gold higher and finished up 5 % on Monday .
Silver for July delivery added 86 cents to $ 18.16 an ounce .
July copper finished 5 cents off , or 1.9 % , to $ 2.76 a pound - an eight - month low for the metal .
" We 're seeing a lot of people readjusting their portfolios trying to figure out the best flight - to - quality asset , " said Adam Klopfenstein , a trader and senior strategist at Lind - Waldock in Chicago .
Gold is the clear winner of the day , winning over U.S. bonds and currencies , as " people are feeling more confident buying gold , " he added .
It is likely to be a volatile week for gold trading , as prices will continue to push higher and test new records , Klopfenstein added .
" Right now people do n't want to wait for the next leg down and they are jumping into gold . "
Recurrent pessimism about the financial shape of the world is likely to keep gold prices well supported around $ 1,198 an ounce , with a ceiling around $ 1,230 an ounce , said Scott Meyers , an analyst with MF Global 's Pioneer Futures division in New York .
With Europe 's debt situation and BP Plc's BP , - 1.18 % oil spill in the gulf as the main focus of concerns , gold is expected to remain " nervously up " as fears about the economic recovery will still dominate , he added .
On Friday , the contract gained $ 7.70 , or 0.6 % , to end at $ 1,217.70 an ounce , giving the precious metal a 0.3 % gain for the holiday - shortened week .
BP 's latest effort to stem the flow of oil in the gulf was partly successful , but as the oil slick has the potential to move about the Eastern seaboard it could affect a much larger swath of the population and economic activities , Meyers said .
" It could slow down the economy in a way we 've never seen before ... believe me , I want to be wrong on this , " he said .
Last week , markets came under heavy selling pressure after a Hungarian government spokesman said that the nation faced the same sort of debt trouble that pushed Greece onto shaky financial ground .
Even as the government distanced itself from those statements , the euro stood just above $ 1.19 on Monday , and the dollar index DXY , - 0.07 % , which compares the U.S. unit against a basket of six currencies , was up at 88.35 .
A rising dollar is usually negative for commodities as it makes them more expensive to holders of other currencies , but gold has often glossed over the usual negative correlation to gain even on days the U.S. currency is stronger .
The dollar lately has been seeing as a lesser evil versus the embattled euro .
Meanwhile , holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust GLD , - 0.60 % , the largest exchange - traded fund backed by gold , on Friday decreased by roughly three metric tons to 1,286 metric tons ( 1,417 short tons ) , down from a record on Thursday .
That represented a change of pace for the ETF , which had increased inventories by 20 metric tons last week .
Analysts at Commerzbank said they do n't expect a slowdown in investor demand for the product , however .
The world 's biggest gold processor , Rand Refinery Ltd. , announced that sales of the South African Krugerrand gold coin had increased by 50 % within one week , Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients Monday .
" Prior to that , Austria 's and Australia 's mints had already reported a clearly increased demand for gold coins .
Thus , it is not surprising that speculative investors also continue to bet on rising prices , " they said .
Meanwhile , platinum and palladium also closed lower on Comex Monday .
Platinum for July delivery was off $ 8 , or 0.5 % , to $ 1,517.30 an ounce .
Palladium for September delivery declined 65 cents , or 0.1 % , to $ 430.35 .
The cerebellum is largely responsible for coordinating the unconscious aspects of proprioception .
Proprioception ( [ 1 ] [ 2 ] PRO - pree - o - SEP - shən ) , from Latin proprius , meaning " one 's own " , " individual " , and capio , capere , to take or grasp , is the sense of the relative position of one 's own parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement . [ 3 ]
In humans , it is provided by proprioceptors ( muscle spindles ) in skeletal striated muscles and tendons ( Golgi tendon organ ) and the fibrous capsules in joints .
It is distinguished from exteroception , by which one perceives the outside world , and interoception , by which one perceives pain , hunger , etc. , and the movement of internal organs .
The brain integrates information from proprioception and from the vestibular system into its overall sense of body position , movement , and acceleration .
The word kinesthesia or kinæsthesia ( kinesthetic sense ) strictly means movement sense , but has been used inconsistently to refer either to proprioception alone or to the brain 's integration of proprioceptive and vestibular inputs .
History of study
The position - movement sensation was originally described in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger as a " sense of locomotion " . [ 4 ]
Much later , in 1826 , Charles Bell expounded the idea of a " muscle sense " , [ 5 ] which is credited as one of the first descriptions of physiologic feedback mechanisms .
[ 6 ]
Bell 's idea was that commands are carried from the brain to the muscles , and that reports on the muscle 's condition would be sent in the reverse direction .
In 1847 the London neurologist Robert Todd highlighted important differences in the anterolateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord , and suggested that the latter were involved in the coordination of movement and balance . [ 7 ]
At around the same time , Moritz Heinrich Romberg , a Berlin neurologist , was describing unsteadiness made worse by eye closure or darkness , now known as the eponymous Romberg 's sign , once synonymous with tabes dorsalis , that became recognised as common to all proprioceptive disorders of the legs .
Later , in 1880 , Henry Charlton Bastian suggested " kinaesthesia " instead of " muscle sense " on the basis that some of the afferent information ( back to the brain ) comes from other structures , including tendons , joints , and skin . [ 8 ]
In 1889 , Alfred Goldscheider suggested a classification of kinaesthesia into three types : muscle , tendon , and articular sensitivity . [ 9 ]
In 1906 , Charles Scott Sherrington published a landmark work that introduced the terms " proprioception " , " interoception " , and " exteroception " .
The " exteroceptors " are the organs that provide information originating outside the body , such as the eyes , ears , mouth , and skin .
The interoceptors provide information about the internal organs , and the " proprioceptors " provide information about movement derived from muscular , tendon , and articular sources .
Using Sherrington 's system , physiologists and anatomists search for specialised nerve endings that transmit mechanical data on joint capsule , tendon and muscle tension ( such as Golgi tendon organs and muscle spindles ) , which play a large role in proprioception .
Primary endings of muscle spindles " respond to the size of a muscle length change and its speed " and " contribute both to the sense of limb position and movement " .
[ 10 ]
Secondary endings of muscle spindles detect changes in muscle length , and thus supply information regarding only the sense of position . [ 10 ]
Essentially , muscle spindles are stretch receptors . [ 11 ]
It has been accepted that cutaneous receptors also contribute directly to proprioception by providing " accurate perceptual information about joint position and movement " , and this knowledge is combined with information from the muscle spindles . [ 12 ]
Components
A major component of proprioception is joint position sense , which is determined by measuring the accuracy of joint–angle replication . [ 13 ]
Clinical aspects of joint position sense are measured in joint position matching tests that measure a subject 's ability to detect an externally imposed passive movement , or the ability to reposition a joint to a predetermined position .
These involve an individual 's ability to perceive the position of a joint without the aid of vision .
Often it is assumed that the ability of one of these aspects will be related to another ; however , experimental evidence suggests there is no strong relation between these two aspects .
This suggests that while these components may well be related in a cognitive manner , they may in fact be physiologically separate . [ 14 ]
More recent work into the mechanism of ankle sprains suggests that the role of reflexes may be more limited due to their long latencies ( even at the spinal cord level ) , as ankle sprain events occur in perhaps 100 ms or less .
In accordance , a model has been proposed to include a ' feedforward ' component of proprioception , whereby the subject will also have central information about the body 's position before attaining it . [ 14 ]
Kinesthesia is a key component in muscle memory and hand - eye coordination , and training can improve this sense ( see blind contour drawing ) .
The ability to swing a golf club or to catch a ball requires a finely tuned sense of the position of the joints .
This sense needs to become automatic through training to enable a person to concentrate on other aspects of performance , such as maintaining motivation or seeing where other people are .
Basis of proprioceptive sense
The initiation of proprioception is the activation of a proprioreceptor in the periphery . [ 15 ]
The proprioceptive sense is believed to be composed of information from sensory neurons located in the inner ear ( motion and orientation ) and in the stretch receptors located in the muscles and the joint - supporting ligaments ( stance ) .
There are specific nerve receptors for this form of perception termed " proprioreceptors " , just as there are specific receptors for pressure , light , temperature , sound , and other sensory experiences .
Proprioreceptors are sometimes known as adequate stimuli receptors .
TRPN , a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels , has been found to be responsible for proprioception in fruit flies , [ 16 ] nematode worms , [ 17 ] African clawed frogs , [ 18 ] and zebrafish . [ 19 ]
Piezo2 , a nonselective cation channel , has been shown to underlie the mechanosensitivity of proprioceptors in mice . [ 20 ]
The channel mediating human proprioceptive mechanosensation has yet to be discovered .
Proprioception of the head stems from the muscles innervated by the trigeminal nerve , where the GSA fibers pass without synapsing in the Gasserian ganglion ( first - order sensory neuron ) , reaching the mesencephalic tract and the mesencephalic nucleus of trigeminal nerve .
Although it was known that finger kinesthesia relies on skin sensation , recent research has found that kinesthesia - based haptic perception relies strongly on the forces experienced during touch . [ 21 ]
This research allows the creation of " virtual " , illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities . [ 22 ]
Conscious and non-conscious proprioception
In humans , a distinction is made between conscious proprioception and non-conscious proprioception :
A non-conscious reaction is seen in the human proprioceptive reflex , or righting reflex — in the event that the body tilts in any direction , the person will cock their head back to level the eyes against the horizon . [ 26 ]
This is seen even in infants as soon as they gain control of their neck muscles .
This control comes from the cerebellum , the part of the brain affecting balance .
Applications
Field sobriety test
Proprioception is tested by American police officers using the field sobriety test to check for alcohol intoxication .
The subject is required to touch his or her nose with eyes closed ; people with normal proprioception may make an error of no more than 20 millimeters , while people suffering from impaired proprioception ( a symptom of moderate to severe alcohol intoxication ) fail this test due to difficulty locating their limbs in space relative to their noses .
Diagnosis
There are several relatively specific tests of the subject 's ability to proprioceive .
These tests are used in the diagnosis of neurological disorders .
They include the visual and tactile placing reflexes . [ 27 ]
Learning new skills
Proprioception is what allows someone to learn to walk in complete darkness without losing balance .
During the learning of any new skill , sport , or art , it is usually necessary to become familiar with some proprioceptive tasks specific to that activity .
Without the appropriate integration of proprioceptive input , an artist would not be able to brush paint onto a canvas without looking at the hand as it moved the brush over the canvas ; it would be impossible to drive an automobile because a motorist would not be able to steer or use the pedals while looking at the road ahead ; a person could not touch type or perform ballet ; and people would not even be able to walk without watching where they put their feet .
Oliver Sacks has reported the case of a young woman who lost her proprioception due to a viral infection of her spinal cord . [ 28 ]
At first she could not move properly at all or even control her tone of voice ( as voice modulation is primarily proprioceptive ) .
Later she relearned by using her sight ( watching her feet ) and inner ear only for movement while using hearing to judge voice modulation .
She eventually acquired a stiff and slow movement and nearly normal speech , which is believed to be the best possible in the absence of this sense .
She could not judge effort involved in picking up objects and would grip them painfully to be sure she did not drop them .
Training
The proprioceptive sense can be sharpened through study of many disciplines .
Examples are the Feldenkrais method [ 29 ] and the Alexander Technique .
Juggling trains reaction time , spatial location , and efficient movement .
Standing on a wobble board or balance board is often used to retrain or increase proprioception abilities , particularly as physical therapy for ankle or knee injuries .
Slacklining is another method to increase proprioception .
Standing on one leg ( stork standing ) and various other body - position challenges are also used in such disciplines as Yoga , Wing Chun and T'ai Chi Ch'uan . [ 30 ]
Several studies have shown that the efficacy of these types of training is increased by closing the eyes , because the eyes give invaluable feedback to establishing the moment - to - moment information of balance .
There are even specific devices designed for proprioception training , such as the exercise ball , which works on balancing the abdominal and back muscles .
Joint position matching
" Joint position matching " is an established protocol for measuring proprioception , and joint position sense specifically , without the aid of visual or vestibular information . [ 31 ]
During such tasks , individuals are blindfolded while a joint is moved to a specific angle for a given period of time , returned to neutral , and the subjects are asked to replicate the specified angle .
Measured by constant and absolute errors , ability to accurately identify joint angles over a series of conditions is the most accurate means of determining proprioceptive acuity in isolation to date .
Recent investigations have shown that hand dominance , participant age , active versus passive matching , and presentation time of the angle can all affect performance on joint position matching tasks . [ 32 ]
Joint position matching has been used in clinical settings in both the upper and lower extremities .
Impairment
Temporary loss or impairment of proprioception may happen periodically during growth , mostly during adolescence .
Growth that might also influence this would be large increases or drops in bodyweight / size due to fluctuations of fat ( liposuction , rapid fat loss or gain ) and / or muscle content ( bodybuilding , anabolic steroids , catabolisis / starvation ) .
It can also occur in those that gain new levels of flexibility , stretching , and contortion .
A limb's being in a new range of motion never experienced ( or at least , not for a long time since youth perhaps ) can disrupt one 's sense of location of that limb .
Possible experiences include suddenly feeling that feet or legs are missing from one 's mental self - image ; needing to look down at one 's limbs to be sure they are still there ; and falling down while walking , especially when attention is focused upon something other than the act of walking .
Proprioception is occasionally impaired spontaneously , especially when one is tired .
Similar effects can be felt during the hypnagogic state of consciousness , during the onset of sleep .
One 's body may feel too large or too small , or parts of the body may feel distorted in size .
Similar effects can sometimes occur during epilepsy or migraine auras .
These effects are presumed to arise from abnormal stimulation of the part of the parietal cortex of the brain involved with integrating information from different parts of the body . [ 33 ]
Proprioceptive illusions can also be induced , such as the Pinocchio illusion .
The proprioceptive sense is often unnoticed because humans will adapt to a continuously present stimulus ; this is called habituation , desensitization , or adaptation .
The effect is that proprioceptive sensory impressions disappear , just as a scent can disappear over time .
One practical advantage of this is that unnoticed actions or sensation continue in the background while an individual 's attention can move to another concern .
The Alexander Technique addresses these unconscious elements by bringing attention to them and practicing a new movement with focus on how it feels to move in the new way .
People who have a limb amputated may still have a confused sense of that limb 's existence on their body , known as phantom limb syndrome .
Phantom sensations can occur as passive proprioceptive sensations of the limb 's presence , or more active sensations such as perceived movement , pressure , pain , itching , or temperature .
There are a variety of theories concerning the etiology of phantom limb sensations and experience .
One is the concept of " proprioceptive memory " , which argues that the brain retains a memory of specific limb positions and that after amputation there is a conflict between the visual system , which literally sees that the limb is missing , and the memory system which remembers the limb as a functioning part of the body . [ 34 ]
Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs , such as after amputation of the breast , extraction of a tooth ( phantom tooth pain ) , or removal of an eye ( phantom eye syndrome ) .
Temporary impairment of proprioception has also been known to occur from an overdose of vitamin B6 ( pyridoxine and pyridoxamine ) .
Most of the impaired function returns to normal shortly after the amount of the vitamin in the body returns to a level that is closer to that of the physiological norm .
Impairment can also be caused by cytotoxic factors such as chemotherapy .
It has been proposed that even common tinnitus and the attendant hearing frequency - gaps masked by the perceived sounds may cause erroneous proprioceptive information to the balance and comprehension centers of the brain , precipitating mild confusion .
Proprioception is permanently impaired in patients that suffer from joint hypermobility or Ehlers - Danlos Syndrome ( a genetic condition that results in weak connective tissue throughout the body ) . [ 35 ]
It can also be permanently impaired from viral infections as reported by Sacks .
The catastrophic effect of major proprioceptive loss is reviewed by Robles - De - La - Torre ( 2006 ) . [ 36 ]
There is also some evidence that proprioception is impaired in autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger Syndrome . [ 37 ]
Proprioception is also permanently impaired in physiological aging ( presbypropria ) . [ 38 ]

In his decision yesterday , Judge Kennelly said there had been no comparable confirmation by the government or AT&T of “ the existence or nonexistence of AT&T ’s claimed record turnover . ”
He refused to rely on news accounts of the program as proof of its existence and noted that “ no executive branch official has officially confirmed or denied the existence of any program to obtain large quantities of customer telephone records . ”
The case was brought by the journalist Studs Terkel , five other individual plaintiffs and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois .
They argued that the program violated a federal law that forbids the disclosure of some customer records to the government , and they sought a court order to stop it .
Among the papers the government submitted to Judge Kennelly to urge the dismissal of the case on state secrets grounds was a declaration from John D. Negroponte , the director of national intelligence .
“ Even confirming that a certain intelligence activity or relationship does not exist , either in general or with respect to specific targets or channels , ” Mr. Negroponte said , “ would cause harm to the national security because alerting our adversaries to channels or individuals that are not under surveillance could likewise help them avoid detection . ”
Judge Kennelly noted his “ great antipathy ” for dismissing the suit .
“ Nothing in this opinion , ” he wrote , “ prevents the plaintiffs from using the legislative process , not to mention their right of free speech , to seek further inquiry by the executive and legislative branches into the allegations in their complaint . ”
More than 30 lawsuits over government surveillance programs are pending in the nation .
Only one , in Detroit , has moved beyond questions of procedure and privilege to consider the legality of the wiretapping program .
A decision in that case is expected soon .
